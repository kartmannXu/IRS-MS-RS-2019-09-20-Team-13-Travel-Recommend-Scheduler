,,A great place to see nature right in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"We visit MacRitchie everytime we come to Singapore. The city can wear you down a little bit with the pace and the crowds, but this park - even on a weekend with nice weather offers trails that are fairly peaceful. The treetop walk is the highlight and worth the 6 km round trip, but that trail can be crowded on the weekends. The long loop around the lake and golf course is never very crowded. Although there are runners that pass by, they usually don't make much noise so you can actually hear the forest. Do watch out for the macaques, they like to steal food if they see an opportunity."
,,Enjoy the beauty,5.0,,It sits above Singapore largest reservoir and experience nature and wildlife . 11 kms of trail. Series of hiking paths and boardwalks
,,Exhausting but great,5.0,,"My ex really likes to push me to the edge, and this qualified. We took the longer hike, beautiful, saw lots of monkeys, walked over great claustrophobic bridge, sweating a ton but the ranger stations with water replenished us. A good workout if thats what you're looking for, otherwise maybe something else for you...."
,,A very nice alternative!,5.0,,"We started and finished at the Venus car park and it took us about 3.5 hours to do the treetop trail. All the trails are well marked out and passable and there is plenty of wildlife to see if you keep your eyes open. We saw monkeys, wild boar, a coral snake, and much more."
,,Nice walk through the rain forest and good views - but mind the heat,5.0,,"We started of at Harbour Front, easy to find the track, which starts right at the MRT station. Note that the Mount Faber cafe's are only opening at 11, so no coffee if you start in time in the morning. However, fortunately the Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion is open and is a very nice place, serving very good coffee! We concludes our walk at the Science Park, and took the MRT from there back to the city. Nice track through very well maintained rain forest, and the Mount Faber offers good views on the city. Towards mid-day the heat is a factor to take into account. Better start early to beat the heat."
,,You have to go on the Treetop Walk!,5.0,,Fabulous nature trail complete with monkeys along the way. It's a bit tricky to get to. Recommend taking a cab to the reservoir park. Download the map onto your phone before you go and make a picture so you will know which entrance to take. The paths are well-marked once you get there. Simply astounding.
,,"If you love nature, you need to go there!",5.0,,"I found this jewel via a local Singaporean blogger and it succeeded by far my expectations! The nature is incredible, I hiked for about 3 hours, met lots of monkeys and other animals and sometimes other hikers. The canopy tree top walk is amazing and if you are lucky and on your own up there, just enjoy the view and peace, it is amazing and although close to the city, one feels like in a completely different world. Take water, small snacks (dont open in front of the monkeys, they will try and grab it from you), mosquito spray, sunlotion, towel and cap as it does get very humid and hot. I reached there at 10am and thats a real good time to go there or even earlier. Try to go during the week as it wont be very full. All in all, 100% a must do for nature lovers while in Singapore."
,,Iconic Instagram place,5.0,,"the MacRitchie Nature Trail is an Iconic Instagram place and it is extremely popular with Singaporeans, especially the youths. A typical day there would consist of trekking and phototaking."
,,Environment,5.0,,Very beautiful nature . Hike up to approximately 9 km . Take time of the City and enjoy the nature ><
,,Nice walk. Good for a nature fix while in the man-made Singapore city.,4.0,,Very beautiful nature. I am surprised not many people coming at all. We only saw around 10 to 20 people during our 5 hours trailing. The canopy tree top was amazing. It was really high and long (250 to 350 meters I think). The information was not so clear. Only one restaurant and the food was not great.
,,Wear tennis shoes and workout clothing!,5.0,,"This was a beautiful but challenging hike of about 9km total. It was very muddy and uphill a lot of the time, but was a great way to see the rainforest and escape the city."
,,Up Lift your Mood,5.0,,This is a fantastic place in the middle of the City. It offers a walk by the reservior : leasurely & easier than the one through tropical forest : Tree top trail. The signage is adequate and explains degree of difficulty so that you cam choose as per your fitness standards. Carry water. Snack optional. As advised stick to the trail. Tree top trail closes by 1700 hence recommend keep about 2 -3 hours to complete the trail.
,,a piece of nature in the heart of singapore,5.0,,"a weekend favorite among families and expact, huge nature reserve and well maintain by Npark. Possibility of using canoes"
,,Beautiful escape from the city,5.0,,So much diverse people on the trail. Well traveled and upkept. Canopy bridge was with the hot sweaty hike. Don’t feed the adorable monkeys—even though they are so cute. Easy to get to via bus or mrt and also near the botanic gardens /orchid garden.
,,Lovely escape,5.0,,"I visited midweek so was fortunate enough to have a quiet walk! Beautiful scenery, well kept tracks. Plenty of stops along the way (benches in the shade). Very well organised!

-Make sure to take plenty of water
-Avoid walking around midday due to the heat!
-Wear proper trainers (can be very boggy in parts, I saw a few people wearing flip flops and it was obvious they had regretted that decision!!)

I would 100% recommend a visit if you are a fan of walking! It’s a nice break from the city life. Enjoy!"
,,Nice to be outdoors!!,4.0,,"A nice place to go to escape the concrete jungle. Essentially the nature trail is a walk around the reservoir - its about 10km (without the treetop walk) and 12km with it. I went with my 3 children and it took about 3 1/2 hours to do the 12km loop. For most of the way, its a ""jungle path"" which is OK when its dry, but not when its raining as it gets very slippery. The walk itself is not ""easy easy"" - there are plenty of hills and long windy paths plus if you want to do the Tree Top Walk, its a fair walk up a steep hill and then down lots of lots of stairs the other side. Because you are walking through forest, the views are not always spectacular however every so often the trail opens up and you get a decent view across the reservoir. Plus if you do the Tree Top Walk, you get a great view (looking north!). There is plenty of wildlife to see - including monkeys and snakes, plus at the end there is a little restaurant that serves drinks, hot & cold food and there are even showers there if you want to freshen up! The trail walk can get very busy with other walkers and runners, however for a few hours in the outdoors, it is well worth it. FYI, it is for walking only - no bikes allowed!!"
,,peaceful and green,5.0,,"worth go there and feel the different way about Singapore. It locates old reservoir area, there are small mountain full of different trees, birds even monkeys."
,,"Not a wild walk, but a relief from the city centre",3.0,,The trails - up to 10 or 12 km - are well prepared and this slightly detracts from the experience. Probably needed to protect the woods. A pleasant way to escape the city.
,,"Not for the feint hearted,",4.0,,"Really good, but quite tough walk...especially on a hot day! Best tackled early in the morning. Well worth the effort."
,,Free Nature Reserve Walk,5.0,,"We recommend Macritchie Reservoir Nature Trail for 1st Timers to try out Nature walk. We did the easiest walk, which was about 1.2km, which was 600 into the forested hiking path (it was spacious and not narrow), and on the return leg, we crossed to the Lakeside Boardward, to walk alongside the Reservoir.
We also met with a family of Monkeys (Maccacs) at the Start of the Trail and took make close up Photos. Luckily these monkeys were young and were not disturbing us.
At the end of the walk, there is a complete Food and Drink Stall and sitting area under the shelter, with reasonable prices for Pastas and other dinner and lunch foods. There are also good shower and lockers and bathroom facilities at this area. We had a Good Car Parking area too, so it was so convenient for city dwellers to make a first attempt at the nature reserve. And oh yes, the views of the large Reservoir was a sight to behold for selfies and photo taking.
Highly successfully run Park in Singapore."
,,MacRitchie Nature Trail,5.0,,If you like walking with some added difference then this is it. Beautiful tree shaded trail. Remember to wear good hiking boots / shoes and carry bottled water to hydrate. Sunny days can get tough. Choose a cloudy / overcast day and hope it does not rain.
,,Avoid the weekends if possible,5.0,,"Superb trail. The majority of people do the whole trail, which is 3 hours from start to finish. It is mostly covered so don’t worry about the sun. I would also ignore the weather. The forecast will just do the opposite of what it says anyway.

I have been to Singapore multiple times, but this was my first visit. If you are visiting for 72 hours I would certainly include it in your itinerary.

And don’t forget to bring WATER!!!!!!!!"
,,"Excellent place to escape the city, while in the city.",5.0,,"MacRitchie is a large park with many trails surrounding a lake-like resevoir. Lots of shade while walking, some ups and downs but no major hills. The trails can connect to Buket Timah at the west via Rifle Range Road. Don't feed the monkeys."
,,Lovely walk around the reservoir,5.0,,"If you're looking to do a few nature walks in Singapore, MacRitchie is a lovely place to go. There's a few trails to go around, with monkeys pretty much guaranteed to be seen.

I would recommend if you have several days in Singapore and nature is your thing, but if you're only reserving one nature walk for your trip - I personally preferred the Southern Ridges instead.
MacRitchie has the benefit of walking alongside water though. So it depends on what you're after. Both are great :)"
,,A easy and good hike to the highest point of Singapore,5.0,,This trail is easy to hike with sounds of the nature (insects) and scents of the tress. A great location for family and friends to spend 2 hours. Along the way you may see family of monkeys playing and scratching each other.
,,Get back to Nature,5.0,,Feel like exploring a real Rainforest? Look no further... as you venture deeper and deeper into the forest.. the air gets cooler and the sound of the road recedes into oblivion. All you hear..small and see is nature. Feels great. Breathe in deep and savour nature. Dont go after a rainy day though.. as the ground gets really muddy.
,,Treetop trail at macritchie,5.0,,The treetop trail at macritchie is a must do. No need to time it for the weather other than rain . It's fully covered so the sun is no bother. It's an absolutely blissfull feeling being surrounded in mother nature.
,,THOSE STAIRS,5.0,,FULL BODY WORKOUT. MY LEGS DIED. MY THIGHS DIED. But that view!!!! Be prepared for many many many many many stairs & steps. Bring a lot of water. Do not feed the monkeys.
,,monkeys lizards and exercise,5.0,,"We did the 14k walk with our Singapore resident son. We included the tree top walk and we went on sSnday morning at about 8 am. Even then it was busy with runners doing a 50 k run. but it was stil possible to enjoy the walk through jungle on a clear path. We did not see many wild life on the way apart from monkeys until we were wallking along the reservoir and saw a lizard swimming and little lizards basking. Probably Sunday morning is a peak time as it is the weekend and early is cooler. It is a great walk for variety and a jungle 'feel'. There are ranger stations to fill up with water and good toilets. The aerial views are fantastic and . although busy, it was a very enjoyable experience we shall repeat every time we visit."
,,Great walk from reservoir up to the tree top walk,5.0,,"Saw the biggest variety of birds on this trip - plus a colugo, squirrels and lizards. Can be busy with exercisers though. Go before it gets hot as it is uphill all the way."
,,Chemperai Boardwalk will open in September,4.0,,The most scenic stretch of path in McRitchie reservoir is the chemperai boardwalk on the south bank. It’s still closed to the public due to a stretch of boardwalk damaged by falling trees. Glad that a sign states that it will be reopened in September. Looking forward to it.
,,Several options and routes to walk,4.0,,"In the picture is the high-level tree-top walk, but beware there is a longish walk too and from this ""bridge"". Consult the map for a length of walk to suit you. Nearer the reservoir, on the south-side there is now a walkway around the reservoir which was comparatively quiet and cooler due to the breeze blowing across the reservoir. The turtles which used to be numerous, seem to have disappeared or been moved elsewhere."
,,Great R&R,4.0,,"This is a great trail, I started in the Windsor Car Park and did loop via the links trail by the golf course. It’s an easy walk although it has a steepish climb towards the top. You can only go one way across the bridge so do go the right way to avoid disappointment. The entire 9ks took me about 2 hours, it’s hot take water but there’s drinking fountains at the ranger station. The boardwalks are well maintained and would help any reasonable fit person get to the top. It’s not the longest walk through the trees. Keep your eyes open for wild life and watch out for the monkeys!"
,,more than 5 stars,5.0,,closely integrated into the tropical forest with its natural trail. Enjoy the cooling breeze when hiking. Another well-maintained park.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Its a fun and enjoyable trail. Super easy. Bring loads of water and avoid the afternoons. Best to start early and finish early.
,,Good workout!,3.0,,"I am sure there are many walking trails all around this area. We wore our trekking boots and brought our walking poles along. The trail we took started off at Venue Drive and took us straight into the Sime Forest. It was hilly in parts, mostly rocky so you need to look where you are placing your feet. We saw about ten baby monitor lizards all along the paths - apart from that not much else. We finished our walk nonstop in 3.5 hours, and we’re really tired and pushing to finish towards the end. Be sure to bring your water bottle and wear drifit clothes - it was very hot and humid and we perspired a great deal."
,,"Great trails, but plan in several hours",5.0,,"This is a great set of trails with no entry fee. Unfortunately we did not realize how extensive they were before going or we would have allocated much more time. We had only an hour or so to spend and we did walk a bit of the trails, but would have liked to do much more. The trails were nice and easy to follow. It is very peaceful here and easy to get transportation. There is even a mall nearby with a food court to get some refreshments. I would certainly recommend going, but would suggest going in the morning and allocating several hours for the trails here."
,,Best nature track in Singapore,5.0,,"We spend more than 4 hours and covered around 25km as we walked from Bukit Timah Nature Reserve trails. MacRitchie Nature Trails are natural trails, so wear comfortable shoes. First stop is tree top walk - maybe not the most impressive, but still excellent views on tropical trees from top.

There is ranger station - do not miss, as this is the only place where you can refill bottles of water and if temperature is plus 35 and humid then water will be needed. Inside trails you will see many monkeys, many baby monkeys and most likely also some angry monkeys (not so nice so be prepared and on watch all the time). We saw also some bigger animal running away- not sure if that was deer on big pig but something heavy and scary.

After tree top walk you can follow trail through trees or near golf course along lake - we enjoyed later as there was air breezes and was not so humid any more as inside forest. And there were different animals like big lizards (we saw around 2 meters long) and one lizard followed as for long distance in water (i guess people are feeding them). After 25km food in mushroom cafe (not sure about name) was tasty and good."
,,"Nice, beware of the monkeys",5.0,,"It's a nice tranquil walk. Catch the passion made possible ad by STB to appreciate the sights on screen before going to see it for yourself. Pack insect repellent and sunscreen, and don't eat food while on the treetop walk because monkeys will snatch and scratch."
,,Weekend Morning Walk,5.0,,Brought my family there for morning walk followed by breakfast. My kids love walking around the trail and Tree Top!
,,A jungle walk in the city.,4.0,,"Once you head onto the Nature Trail around the reservoir you are transported out of the city into the natural habitat of the area. Monkeys, snakes and other wild life abound. Would recommend if you have the time."
,,Do this walk - challenging slope,5.0,,"This is a great place for a challenging uphill walk jog or run...
The steep incline makes you work hard - however there are places to rest stop of it gets to much.
The first incline is a wide road and then there are further trails up higher with many stairs.
A great workout and definitely worth doing to overlook the areas and get some good exercise and fresh air."
,,Excellent place to walk and hike,5.0,,Enough of challenging pathway to make frequent hikers sweat. Enough pathway with gentler slopes for family to have a walk together.
,,Natural Beauty,4.0,,"We did the long 7 k loop which would have been fine but the monkeys were not in a happy mood on the day we went.....or are they always a bit gnarly? The path thinned to a single lane with vegetation brushing your shoulders each side. It was great until the monkeys were spread out across the pathway ahead of us. I stopped to allow them time to move , but in typical monkey nonchalance they decided to stay there. Then they were behind us too, so we decided to slowly walk through them. Bad move. They erupted into shrill screams and pandemonium broke out. It was quite unnerving . My son was charged by one and it punched him on the leg. Not nice . They didn't continue hassling us and simply disappeared into the jungle. Its their territory and there are signs warning you about the monkeys but just be aware that encounters are not always placid and not always provoked. I would not take small children on the walk across the bridge either as they were all around the steps near to it and were attacking people for their bags and personal belongings. As we mad our way back to areas where there were more people we noticed many locals carrying large sticks with them , now we know why! Beautiful area. worth a hike. But go prepared. Dont take a bag or take a dummy bag that you are prepared to lose, and take a big stick to fend off the monkeys if they get too close. Im sure that simply waving the stick would be enough ."
,,Well Worth a Visit,5.0,,"Takes a while to get there by bus/MRT but a lovely area with a nice rural feel with lots of trails, mostly in the woods but also some nice parts along the reservoirs which are fairly open with nice views."
,,Fun outing on a weekend,4.0,,It's well-maintained and very doable if you begin early in the morning. The views from the Treetop Walk are great.
,,My weekly work out trail,5.0,,"Sports is my life. Singapore offers many outdoor sports venue, but nothing like MacRitchie. I go to MacRitchie every Saturday morning when I am in Singapore and when it is not raining. 10 mins drive from the middle of town early morning, you come to the wild and nature of MacRitchie. Tropical rainforests and reservoir, there are people who like me come every week to train. The main trail is around 12.5K, but it also connects to Bukit Timah natural reserve, it could add up to 17-18K. I usually start just before 7:00 am, when it’s still dark in the forest, when reaching the side of island Golf club, you could see beautiful sunrise! At 6.5K, there is drinking water and a toilet, where people rest."
,,Pleasant afternoon walk,4.0,,This is a lovely walk around the reservoir and not too strenuous. The path is easy to follow and pretty smooth although it might be quite muddy in the rain. Keep an eye open for wildlife as you walk around.
,,Great get away from the city,5.0,,"It is great place to be. Most of the time is covered by tree and by the water so it is not too hot. Very easy to walk. You can see monkeys on the trees,( Especially the baby monkeys are very cute) turtles and fish in the water, Iguanas in the woods.It is exciting to see them so close. It is amazing to have a place like this where you can forget about busy life in the city and so near by. Also nice to see sunset and different experience to be in the woods when it is getting dark."
,,A must see if you have time,5.0,,"We walked the 12KM Trail, so be prepared for a good walk, wear proper shoes and clothing. Its very humid with the weather so bring plenty of water although near the tree top walk they have a water station to refill bottles.
This is a great place to visit, Lucky enough to see countless monkeys today and various creepy crawlies.
Its a fabulous place to walk, No cycling is aloud so you don't have to dodge mountain bikers.

Give yourself a good 4-5 hours to walk all the way around and do the tree top walk."
,,Our favorite Hike in Singapore!,5.0,,"If you want to see the monkeys, this is the place to go. Not only is the hike awesome, but you also get to see the monkeys. Just do not feed them and do not give them eye contact and they will not bother you. We had the best experience here."
,,Prepared for people doing their tracking,3.0,,Great tracking of you like nature. Prepare for humid and problems woth breathing because of that. Me and my friend walked the shortest trail and it was 10 km. We met drinking fountains and toilets quite offen and the resting huts even more.
,,It was wow!,5.0,,I have been in Singapore for long as well as went there many times. It was my 1st time to Macritchie Trail. We can reach there by bus allign in upper Thompson then walk to the park. Love the trees & the animals there. But be ready because the toilet was far up in about 3km up from the start. And be careful of the golf ball on your way back because you will pass the golf court. I think it was 12km the total journey.
,,Absolute Nature Near A Concrete Jungle!!!,5.0,,"This surreal place is less than half an hour bus ride to from the City Centre. Don't forget to carry a bottle of water and apply anti mosquito cream in case you have sensitive skin. You go on a hiking trail for approximately 18-20 km back and forth. You start with a path which is sandwiched between a golf course and the reservoir. The view is magnificently misty early in the morning when the sun just peaks from far away. The destination is a long free standing suspension bridge called ""Treetop Walk"" which has a majestic view of the forest."
,,MacRitchie is the real taste of jungle in the middle of civilization!,5.0,,"Take a taste of jungle and start from the car park at Venus Drive. From there it is only a 2.5 km walk to the most spectacular tree top walk. You can see wild monkeys, snakes, lizards and squirrels. This is real nature! I love it and you definately will!"
,,Take fresh O2,5.0,,4 to 5 hrs inside trail... bring water along. beware of monkeys when you bring food along. Never litter.
,,An excellent back to nature walk that unlike most things here is FREE!,5.0,,"The MacRitchie is a fantastic trail around the reservoir in the central catchment area. It is well worth the effort to make the loop starting from either the Venus Carpark or the MacRitchie trail head.

The total trail including the treetops walk (which is equally worth the hike) is around 12kms so allow yourselves 3-4 hours to take it at a leisurely pace stopping along the way. The trails are well marked and it is pretty much impossible to get lost.

On the walk you will likely see wild monkeys, monitor lizards and if lucky some of the local (not venomous and not so venomous) whip snakes and other varietals.

It is hot and humid and up and down but nothing is particularly difficult. Be warned however on the ranger station has a water fountain and that is 3.5kms into the walk. So.....bring a large bottle of water. The other thing is that whilst a lot of the trail is boardwalk, unfortunately there are a lot of steps and rough terrain making (I would imagine) impossible for the physically impaired.

The best bits - it is an escape from the hustle and bustle of the CBD and City life; the wildlife is excellent and interesting.....and it is free."
,,Very nice and refreshing walking trail,5.0,,"Perfect thing to do if you are looking for something different in Singapore than usual sightseeing and parks. We started this trail from venus drive, went to treetop walk, Jelutong tower and finished on lornie road. It was around 7-8 km walk. Treetop walk was just amazing and beautiful. There are maps and directions along the trail so you will be on track always. Overall very good experience and motivated us to go for more walking trails in SG."
,,Good but...,3.0,,"If you're a first timer then you would want to take a picture of the wide map provided in the main gate and the food court area, since the road mark along the trail is not really clear. And there's little people walking around the trail, so it really feels scary to walk here alone even if we're taking about safe singapore here. Since the road trail is not clear, you can just get lost midway, and with few people, you don't even have anyone you can ask for help."
,,Best hiking,5.0,,"One of the most popular hiking trails in Singapore. The tree walk is great. The whole trail is about 4 hours, so take your comfortable tennis shoes and a lot of water. Don't underestimate walking in the tropical and humid weather."
,,Excellent trail,5.0,,"We come here every week. The trail is well taken care of, good paths, a bit crowded during weekends, but the best place for a walk in Singapore."
,,Walk in the Footsteps of Heroes!,5.0,,The trail and reservoir was an area held by the British when the Japanese invaded Singapore in 1942 and was hard fought over ground. Know doubt unknown heroes still lie in their silent space around this area.
,,Our national lungs,5.0,,"An integral part of our central Catchment Area area, this park is filled with beautiful wonders of the tropical rainforest. Went for a nice round the reservoir track (covering about 14km) and was treated to a huge array of tropical rainforest flora and fauna. An added positive experience was the fact that despite the hot afternoon, a walk in the forest was nice and cool due to the canopy."
,,Nice getaway from the City,4.0,,"Take plenty of water and good shoes that you don’t mind getting wet and muddy. This is a lush trail with the promise of seeing monkeys, wild boar and snakes. Do not take food in your packs as the monkeys are very clever. The treetop walk was fun, but not for someone with fear of heights (that’s me!). You do not HAVE to do the treetop walk, but be advised that once you start it , through the gate, you are not allowed to go back. (Also me). Overall, we really enjoyed this activity."
,,MacRitchie 10 km run,5.0,,"This 10 km run is different from the 5 km run that we ran in our school days cross country. You landed up deep in the forest.If you are a nature lover, you should experience the MacRItchie nature trail
The 10 km takes four hours to complete but if you have someone who cannot keep upwith the pace and you have to wait for her/him you may end up five hours before
you can finish the trail.

If you bring food. eat when you are out of the sight of monkeys.
They seem sweet,adorable and certainly know how to pose in front of cameras.
But once you bring out your food they will run down from the tree to the ground and
snatch your food. One hiker walked on the treetop brought out some food. The
monkey walked on the rope and snatched the food.The tree top walk gate closes at five pm . When you pass the gate, it warns you that it is a one way traffic

This is the yellow route. You will pass by the Jelutong Tower . Climb up the spiral
steps , Reach the top and you will get a good view of the forest canopy

There is also the ranger station where people play golf. Beware when you are there,
do not use the lane that that is meant for the rangers .Do not enter or you may get hurt by the golf balls

There is this Shinto Shrine which Japanese built to commemorate soldiers who died
in the Malaya and Sumatra War. Before Japanese surrendered , they destroyed
Shinto Shrine so that it would not be desecrated.

Follow the signs closely, or you may land up heeding to Bukit Timah Nature
Reserve. You have to pass by the landmarks that I mentioned. Use a GPS
Do not walk into the forest with an empty stomach or with minimum water supply
There is no food along the trail, there are only two toilets .

Travel light with enough water, food handphone medicine.and bring umbrella raincoat and hat ."
,,nice part of singapore,4.0,,nice pathways and generally safe except the monkeys and snakes. direction signage were very helpful. great place to explore outside the city!
,,first hike around macritchie,4.0,,the weather helped in our hike and the views upon reaching the bridge is worth it. it was quite chill and even saw monkeys along the way! the route was just right for a casual conversation. bring a camera along to take photos!
,,relaxing hike,4.0,,"hiked with my friends and we had a great talk, the route isnt too tough for conversation, just right for a casual walk!"
,,Lots of animals!,4.0,,"We headed for the treewalk. Walking trough the djungle we saw poisinous snakes, lizards, butterflys and a lot of monkeys! Though it was relly hot we really enjoied the walk. Don't forget water!"
,,Treetop walk..,5.0,,"Get your walking boots on and take your poncho, this walk has many different tracks with different surfaces so sturdy footwear is a must, take plenty of water and be prepared to encounter lots of wildlife, Macaques are a plenty so keep your valuables close to your body, don’t even think about opening up your lunch until your well clear, we saw wild pigs too so keep alert, the suspension bridge above the treetops is magnificent so well worth the walk.."
,,Very nice park,5.0,,"This park and nature preserve is a great hidden gem in town. The trails can be as long or as short as you like. Take the time and do the tree top walk, it is worth the view. There are also wild animals all along that you can get (uncomfortably) close to at times. Really a nice surprise to find in a bustling metro area."
,,Very hot but beautiful walk,5.0,,I went on this walk with my Mum and Sister. It was worth it for the view on the bridge but my god was it hot!!!! Definitely bring a lot of water and try and go earlier in the day or in the afternoon. Would recommend as something fun to do in Singapore that gets you out of the city.
,,Naturally Aesthetic,5.0,,"This is certainly a must visit for all avid lovers of nature! The scenic trail though off the beaten path is well maintained and clean, though be wary of the wildlife as they can be pretty rough! Other than that, it is worth the visit with a loved one or a small group of friends!"
,,Beware of the monkeys!,4.0,,"We did the Treetop walk, which was really lovely and mostly boardwalk or pavement. There are a few steeper climbs with steps, but nothing unmanageable. There are quite a few monkeys around and when you get to the Treetop Walk bridge, there are a lot. As we were going onto the bridge, there was a lady asking the security man there about monkey scratches. While we were walking across the bridge, a monkey jumped onto the side and was eyeing people up, he bared his teeth at a lady in front of us and then tried to get into my Mum's bag before going for me, scratching my shoulder and taking my empty coffee cup out of the side pocket of my bag. The security man tried to make him drop it, but it bounced off the bridge and into the rainforest! It could have been a lot worse (a purse or a phone!), but it made us even more wary of the monkeys on the return part of the walk!"
,,Reconnect to the Nature,5.0,,"Nature lovers will delight in this scenic trail, which is extremely clean and well maintained. It’s a great way to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and reconnect with nature – and you’re even likely to encounter some animals along the way."
,,Nature reserve in the heartland of Singapore!,5.0,,"Awesome piece of nature to enjoy! Many monkeys, particularly on the bridge. Do not look them in the eye and keep your water bottle safe. I went on a Sunday as did many other visitors and joggers. Try a different day."
,,Not disappointing at all.,4.0,,"Ever feel like you need to go out and experience bird chirps and mosquito bites? (Bring bug spray) In that case, MacRitchie Nature Trail is for you! With relative distance to a few residential areas, this place can provide you with weekly exercise, family outings, and a sense of tropical Singapore! Bring water, sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses, and you're all set!"
,,A good chance to see jungle in Singapore,5.0,,"You will see all kinds of plants and trees along the walk with good signs of what you are viewing. You should see some animals along the trails like lizards (monitors), turtles, monkeys."
,,Interesting but needs improvement,3.0,,"The walk is interesting but lacks public convenience(toilets) The walk is quite well maintained but distance on one of the signages after Island club is wrong it is much longer than stated.
Ocversea Visitors should note that it is normally impossible to get a taxi at Lornie Road. I met a group of three man who were hailing for taxis. They wanted to take a bus but none had cash they carried only credit cards. Make sure that you have change to take the bus or pre-paid card to take a bus or the phone numbers of taxi services like Grab.
The hike was interesting and some places beautiful. Not fantastic on a rainy or hot and sunny day. Do bring water and get yourself hydrated, there are no stalls except for one station that water could be purchased. Have a walking stick, could be useful if attacked by monkeys as they can be aggressive especially if you are carrying food.
I did not notice any rangers patrolling when I did my walk."
,,Nice for a chill hike,4.0,,remember to bring plenty of water and hide your food from the monkeys they're quite smart at stealing food!
,,30000 steps,5.0,,"Take a short trail though this nature reserve, up the tree top walk to enjoy fresh air away from the buzzing city life. Beware of monkeys, they are not afraid of us. Not recommended for people who cant walk long. Approx 4hrs hike."
,,One of the best walks in Singapore!,5.0,,"Took the 3hr trail which saw my BFF and I trek up almost to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve! Loved the singing birds and noisy insects. Even the macaques were too friendly sharing my brekkie which they snatched from my bag! I had been warned and serves me right for not heeding! The canopy walk was not breath-taking by offered unique views of Singapore you can't get anywhere else. Worth a second, third and many more trips."
,,新改的栈道让人失望Disappointing Lornie Path,4.0,,许久没有去徒步了。这里最令我回味的是靠湖的栈道，风景优美。可惜最近施工将lornie 小径改到离开湖的树林里了。不知谁出的主意，最美的一段风景完全不见了. 也许只是暂时的修理，希望不会永久改道。Recently the most beautiful part of the initial segment of the MacRichi paths the Lornie path has been redirected to only the muddy path in the forest away from the reservoir. The wooden path along the reservoir which is the most scenic is blocked. I hope it will be open again soon instead of permanent block.
,,Great morning walk,4.0,,"A great place for people who love walking, easily accessible via public transport, a short 5-10 mins walk from Marymount MRT station. Nature is here with you during the entire walk: trees, flower, water..."
,,Too busy in parts!,4.0,,"Did the full 11km,Very tiring as some steps too.
Very busy but was a Sunday.First parts of trail too many joggers and loud people to see any wildlife.Not much room to pass on narrow paths either.
We cheered up when we got to the ranger station on tree top walk as saw a lovely family of long tailed macaques playing in the trees not bothered about all the people!
Path was quieter too after this.Saw squirrels,lots of butterflies and terrapins!
Had to go in a shelter as thunderstorm and ate our sandwiches we brought as nothing to buy here."
,,Macritching my life~,5.0,,A very good place for a nice run with natural vegetation surrounding. There are also many parts of the reservoir that can be explored!
,,HIdden Gem in Singapore,5.0,,A natural wildlife reserve in Singapore. A good break/getaway from the hectic mundane life. I would recommend for people who are more outgoing and looking for activities to do with their families or friends.
,,"Scenic, Challenging, a must do for some exercise",5.0,,MacRichie is a gem... it is worth a trip to go and exercise in a beautiful setting. The walk/run is quite long and steep but that adds the challenge and you feel good and rewarded. And YES you can get there via the MRT.
,,A walk in the wild,5.0,,"A natural wildlife oasis in the northern part of Singapore covering 12 Hectares I believe. There are many waymarked trails around the park included a 'tree top' walk which includes a high suspension bridge. Popular with the keep fit brigade. Be aware you may well encounter wildlife including snakes and monkeys. Take water with you, but there are water stations dotted around. Well worth a visit."
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"A short 20 minute bus ride from Clarke quay to this little piece of tranquility, I went on a Sunday so it was busy with runners and lots of family groups but still peaceful. Did the 10km loop in just over 2 hours, bring plenty of water it is stifling, relatively easy walk, few uphills, some stairs and some loose stone pathways but overall a fairly moderate walk, which is well signposted. The canopy walk is well worth it. Highly recommend if you are keen to stretch your legs and spend some time amongst the trees"
,,Walk in nature,5.0,,"Get down at Caldecott or Marymount station on the circle line and from there it’s about 2 km walk till the entrance .
It’s nurtures you into the beauty of nature the trail has yes ofc there are monitor lizards , monkeys etc but the trek is worth the hike yes it’s little bit difficult at some times . Carry lots of water with you and napkins and a spare cloth set . HSBC tree top walk nice structure gives the whole view of the trail . Jeroung tower is also a must go.
Venus drive is the nearest location till which you can drive and from there 1.5 km to HSBC tree top walk"
,,Great walk,5.0,,"We did the 10.4km walk which takes in the tree top walk. It was all very nice, just like walking through a rainforest. Even saw 2 Waglers Pit Vipers right next to the path (so do be careful).
The suspended bridge is so high and gives a great view.
There are water refuelling points at the ranger stations which is really useful.
I highly recommend this walk. Wear trainers as the path isn't very flat, if you did it in thin soled shoes you will feel the stones."
,,Good escape from the city,5.0,,"Can't really tell you're in Singapore when you head to the more secluded portions. Great walking trail. Mostly shaded. Keep an eye out for the monkeys. Plan your trail carefully.
They've renovated the place by adding in more concrete steps and wooden boardwalks. It used to be more challenging to get to Treetops from Venus walk."
,,Worth going to,5.0,,It was a great day out. Lovely long hike with monkeys along the trail and treetop walk high over the valley below looking out to the reservoir.
,,Hiking,5.0,,"If you are wanting to ""get out of the city"" then MacRitchie is a lovely place to get lost in nature. We go for hikes and love the walking trails at MacRitchie. We come across big water monitors as well as plenty of monkey's."
,,Last piece of Natural Nature in singapore,5.0,,I love this place and visit often. Best to go at 10am or 12pm when you can hike as it will take you 2-4hrs depending on your speed. most of it in the middle walk is untouched except for the foot path which is nice. moment after 6pm it get almost pitch black duck as it is a complete nature walk and there are no lights or electrical stuff in the middle. The Treetop bridge is amazing. I love this place.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,You can actually feel that nature is not over in the world and there is so much still yet to see do visit this place atleast once in a life time
,,Absolute the best of Singapore!,5.0,,"If you fancy a bit of peace or some exiting training, this is THE place. Be early,especially in the weekends as it might become a bit crowded between 9-11am. You can choose between 3,10 and 13km round trips."
,,"hell of a hike, but great spot",5.0,,"of you are not a hiker, get dropped off near the golf course of it is around 5km to the treetop bridge."
,,Green paradise close to the city,4.0,,"Unless you knew where you were going, finding the location was difficult due to the lack of signage. An early morning start would be best. We were there early afternoon and it was too hot for us to tackle the tree top walk and were content to walk the boardwalk of the Prunis trail. It was very relaxing walking on the mostly shaded boardwalk and we saw fish and turtles, but no monkeys. The small cafe was conveniently located just before the trail."
,,Running along the trail,5.0,,"Went morning jog there. The place is scenic, green, with good track. Few kms of the track were through the forest which made the jog less tiring. If you use MRT, Marymount would be the closest station. Bring your water, it’s quite a long track😊"
,,100 miles away,5.0,,This trail was great. It was like you were very far away from the city but you were not! If you like to hike it is worth the time. We saw some interesting creatures on our hike!
,,A hiking enthusiast’s dream.,4.0,,Well marked hiking trails are provided. Start your hike around seven in the morning to avoid the heat. It is a very popular hiking trail where you will encounter other hiking and running enthusiasts.
,,nature walk,5.0,,can get a good exercise going to the treetop walk. after that can go to Adam road market for food. crowded on weekends. start walk not later than 4pm otherwise will get dark before reaching yr destination.
,,Get out of the city - in 15 mins,5.0,,"If you spend lots of time in Singapore chances are you will want to escape downtown for a while, and the Nature Trail is a great escape, 15 min taxi ride away. Before you start out decide how far you want to go, and plan you route. You can spend lots of time here."
,,Jungle escape,5.0,,Great place to get out of the busy city. Lots of walkers and runners. Make sure you stay to the left. Bring water and wear sport clothes. Macaques are cute but be aware. Head up to treetops suspended bridge.
,,"This trail is a must if you like trail running, or bush walking.",5.0,,"This trail is a must if you like trail running, or bush walking. Once you are only a little way in you feel like you are deep in the jungle and certainly not in a metropolitan city. Take your own water though, not really anywhere to get a drink. I did an 11km loop clockwise and I saw giant lizards, monkeys some of the most beautiful tropical jungle I have ever had the privilege of trail running in. Cab ride from the city was only about $8. Caution though: It's a proper bush trail (not a concrete path). I LOVED IT!"
,,"A hot, humid and long hike",4.0,,"TreeTop Walk is 5 km away from the entrance, if you're arriving by MRT to the Caldecott station. Humidity was a startling 90 % and temperature 35 C. No mosquitoes in late September (fortunately)."
,,Zen Trail,5.0,,It was a lovely trail as the air was so fresh that you can even smell it. The natural setting of the trail provides a zen garden feel which I went twice within 10 days.
,,Wild monkeys!!,5.0,,"We spent 6 hours hiking over 11km with our two 7 year old girls. The scenery is beautiful and the highlights were the monkeys and turtles. Set out early in the morning and be prepared to sweat a lot and take hats and plenty of snacks for the kids. The monkeys were most active around the ranger station and showed some aggressive behaviour to people carrying plastic bags and openly eating.
I would highly recommend this as a great activity away from the hustle and bustle."
,,MacRitchie Nature Trail Singapore,4.0,,"A good fresh morning walk on this trail with lots of lovely shady trees...nice broad walk, singing birds and various sound of insects..."
,,Great place to escape the concrete,4.0,,"Highly recommend that you do this one in the morning.

The locals were out in force on the reserve doing canoeing, kayaking and skull rowing when we arrived at 0800 as were plenty of trail runners.

We did the 11km trail starting at the main shower / toilet / eating area (where the local 166 bus stop is) and cut it down to about 8 1/2 km by stopping at the Venus trail and carpark.

The views across the water are well worth the walk, the forest made for a great escape from the concrete jungle that is downtown Singapore. The only negative to the walk was the 2km spent with the lake on one side and a golf course on the other. Real shame that a bigger corridor could not of been kept. The effects of over fertilisation and the massive blooms of water grasses (being dredged when we were there) are a real shame and perfect example of why a corridor is needed between the two uses.

Overall, if you are spending more than a couple of days in Singapore and want to do something different, away from the shops and bright lights then this place and the walk is highly recommended. Very average fitness level is all that is required and plan on starting early and carrying plenty of water and anyone can do it (even the over 60's)"
,,Best for Morning Stroll,5.0,,Highly recommended for those who wanted to spend a fine Sunday morning to relax themselves from a whole week of work stress.
,,Get back to nature,5.0,,A really enjoyable stroll through the local flora and forma. Make sure you take a hat and water with you; it's hot and not full shade.
,,Top choice for trail & forrest walk!and views are beautiful!,5.0,,"One of Singapore's hidden treasures.Not too populated.But a lovely trail to spend a Sunday morning here.
Tree top walk is amazing and a must do.
Place is easily accessible by bus.Better to go early in the morning as it will start getting hotter and humid later."
,,Best place for forest walk,5.0,,"Best place for forest walk or nature trail in Singapore. Tree TOP is a diversion of around 3 km. Decide before you step in ! Amazing ambience, active monkeys ... live the big lake and golf course side greenery while walking"
,,Beautiful views,4.0,,"The MacRitchie Nature Trail is a lovely escape from the big city. You can reach the trailhead by public bus. The trail includes ground portions, raised walkways, and the impressive suspension bridge. For non-locals, the physical strain of walking up the steep raise ahead of the bridge, in the wicked Singapore heat and humidity, can be intense. Be prepared by bringing water and expect to be drenched in sweat by the time you're done."
,,Aweee experience,5.0,,Guests can also relax in the garden.Guests are getting more for their money when compared to other properties in this city.
,,Free activity in Singapore,5.0,,What a treat this place turned out to be. We caught a bus from near our hotel straight to the reservoir. I was hoping to see a monkey in the wild and was not disappointed. Seen heaps 5 minutes after arriving. The tree top walk was good and a great view from top of a tower u can walk up. Was hot and sweaty but the canopy of trees kept u in shade which helped. Apart from near the golf course where u are exposed for a short while. The cafe at the end also does delicious and cheap meals and drinks. Take water which u can refill at rangers station
,,Great for exercise and bonding,4.0,,Had a great time at the MacRitchie Nature Trail because it wasn't too hardcore. The beautiful sight of nature made the sweating and heat very worthwhile. Great way to exercise and spend time with friends and family!
,,Nature's Trail 28km of it in the middle of Singapore!,5.0,,"Put Singapore map in front of you and look into the centre of it and you will see MacRitchie Reservoir - a green oasis! 14 kms on either side is MacRitchie Trail that leads to beautiful views of the Reservoir as also lush tropical forest. One trail leads to Tree Top Walk which is a must.
When you are at MacRitchie, don't forget to eat local delicacies at the Mushroom Cafe!"
,,The perfect Romantic Opportunity,4.0,,"Great day out for walking, beautiful scenery and the chance to woo that special girl and have one on one time. Make sure you take plenty of water and some snacks would be a good idea."
,,Worth the sweat,5.0,,I had to be dragged here (I much prefer the warmth of my comforter especially on weekend mornings) but am glad that I was. The route to the tree top was quite doable and I enjoyed myself a lot more than I expected. It is a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the city - it feels a world away from what I know everyday as Singapore!
,,Lots of monkeys,5.0,,It’s very easy to get the bus to the train from the city centre and cheap too. The whole trail is advertised at 4-5 hours of walking but you can do it in less (though we were very sweaty afterwards). The treetop walk is great and looking over the trees on the suspension bridge is also a unique view.
,,the trail,5.0,,"one of the most common place for runners or nature lovers to start their hike or run. a lot of gripes recently as some of the rock slopes are being ""modernised"", but perhaps it's due to feedback on the surface wanted at the rail corridor (near bukit panjang mall)???

this place hold a lot of memories as my late father used to bring us there when young...then the bandstand used to have regular concert a la botanic garden...but now it seem to have stopped?? a lot of races and school cross country race also started from this reservoir lol

they have detour to rifle range road which will lead to bukit timah reserve and beyond and also the Windsor park. and of course, not forgetting the treetop walk...very nice scenic viewpoint..."
,,"Monkeys, Lizards, Frogs, oh my!",5.0,,"This trail was a welcome diversion from the hustle and bustle of the big city. The hike was very serene and not crowded at all. Long-tailed macaques followed me for a few kilometers along the trail, fighting and playing the whole time. It was fantastic to be so close to these monkeys in their natural habitat. I also saw a monitor lizard and some turtles."
,,Very enjoyable trail,5.0,,I have gone through this trail multiple times and it has always been enjoyable. Go with friends for best experience.
,,Sweaty Stuff,4.0,,"Great walk, mainly under tree cover although the bit around the golf club is exposed to direct sunlight. All the steeper inclines have steps but that doesn't mean it's an easy walk especially in Singapore's humidity. Note the tree top bridge is closed on Mondays and is itself one way meaning you have a reasonable trek to do even if you only want to do that. Doing the full macRichie loop plus the bridge took me almost four hours. I've uploaded a photo of the map for info."
,,Monkeys in the wild,4.0,,"I walked about 11 Kms. For much of the time the noises of the city disappear.

A pleasant walk.

Read the website first. The bridge is one way (I walked anticlockwise around the lake).

I came across a few groups on monkeys. I kept my distance - remember they are wild animals with teeth."
,,Wonderful walk,5.0,,We had a wonderful walk here. There was a bit of a downpour which made some parts slippery and muddy. But it's accessible to anyone with average fitness. Well worth it to get some nature time.
,,Perfect trial to visit nature in Singapore,5.0,,"Combination of hills and flats, rocks and dirt : if you are training for cross-country or long-distance running, this is the place. Or if you are tired of the city, this is the perfect place to visit natures and walk on the trails."
,,nice,5.0,,great day of walking and seeing the sites of the more natural parts of Singapore. Bring water for your walk and wear good shoes
,,Will make you forget you are in a big city,5.0,,"Take a break from the crowds and the combat shopping for lux goods. This walk through the rainforest and will make you forget you are in a big city. It took me 4+ hours because I needed to stop and rest (my knees) but the tree top walk across the bridge was amazing and I am so happy that I accomplished this walk. The water was so clear I saw turtles and fish swimming. I saw a group of monkeys right next to the trail! Be prepared to sweat, wear comfortable clothing, closed toe shoes and insect repellant wipes. There are ranger stations were you can refill your water bottle."
,,Standing high up at the tree top like the king of jungle.,4.0,,It was a good walk for people like me that seldom do exercise. It was all worth our sweat when we reach the treetop bridge. The security only let the groups in by batches due to safety reason. It was ashamed that the bridge is very short and the experience was over before you really enjoy the view.
,,Hike,5.0,,It took me 3 hours to hike all the way round without stopping much so I would recommend longer if you wish to photography the animals and views. Really pretty and the TreeLine bridge is spectacular even if it is very high!
,,Singapores little secret,4.0,,"This nature trail is a little way out of the city but well worth a visit, because its gives you a different perspective on Singapore from high rises and condo's - and shopping malls"
,,Just do it!,4.0,,"Bring a water bottle and poncho. Lots of monkeys, monitor lizards and turtles. It's also a serious runners path, but the heat and humidity can kill you."
,,A Saturday Well Spent,5.0,,"Well-paved trail perfect for both adult and children. Spent about 3hours for the hike from Route 3 (Blue), head towards Tree Top Walk, continued towards Jelutong Tower along Route 4 (Yellow), ending the day at its best at the Vava Bistro for happy hour!

Total: 12.45km

[TreeTop Walk Opening Hour]
Tue to Fri: 9am to 5pm
Sat, Sun & PH: 8.30am to 5pm
Closed on Monday except PH.

Bring snacks & water"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"One of the best things we did in Singapore -took a taxi out, walked for a few hours in a big loop -out to the Tree Top Canopy suspension bridge and then back along the other side of the dam.
We saw monkeys and lizards. Lots of other people walking and it felt very safe
Then grabbed a cab dropping another group off to get back into town.
Perfect."
,,Great Hike with views of Singapore nature,5.0,,"We needed something to do on Sunday and wanted to get outside with some exercise. This was the place. Nice hike, some ups and downs, so be ready for it. But plenty of places to stop and relax. Nice place at the top by the Sky Tram with views and a breeze.
The hike was nice, long and enjoyable with lots to see along the way.
Not too crowded and really cool to see how much the Singapore government invested here as it is very well done."
,,"Awesome weekend adventure, monkeys!",5.0,,"MacRitchie nature trail is great, for both kids and adults... The trail itself is not challenging at all and you can get through it in under 2 hours... The best surprise comes at the end when you get to the boardwalk with hundreds of wild monkeys"
,,싱가포르 내에서 드물게 드넓은 자연과 마주할 수 있는 곳,5.0,,"말 그대로 싱가포르에서는 드물게 인공미가 없는 자연을 즐길 수 있는 곳입니다. 물이나 음료를 꼭 준비하세요. 숲 속에서 간식시간을 갖고 싶다고 한국처럼 편하게 자리잡고 앉아서 음식을 꺼냈다가는 원숭이들의 표적이 될 수도 있으니 주의하세요. 간단히 입속에 쏙 집어넣고 끝나는 간식이 낫겠어요. 초행길이고 이런 곳에 익숙하지 않은 사람이라면 일부 구간은 혼자서 가기엔 조금 무서울 수도 있을 것 같습니다. Rare place where you can enjoy real nature without artificial touch. Such a great hiking course for nature lovers and it's not really difficult walking for children too. The nature is so beautiful but you might feel isolated if you go there alone, especially during weekdays when there's not many people. Recommend you to carry your own bottle of water or drink. Be careful when you want to grab a snack in this forest because the monkeys are also hungry."
,,Excellent educational walk,5.0,,"We had a great time walking the nature trail and saw heaps of monkeys, birds and butterflies. The treetop walk is great and lots of interpretive signage explaining flora and fauna along the trail. Good to take water although there is a top up station at the rangers office and wear sturdy shoes. It's nature at its purest and that in the middle of Singapore."
,,Take water,5.0,,"We did the 10 km option and had a great time. Saw several groups of monkeys, some large lizards and heard birdsong for most of the trip.

The path is well formed, although muddy is some places. Wear rugged or sensible shoes.

The tree top walk is worth the extra kilometres getting there

But....it’s hot and the trees reduce any chance of a breeze, so I strongly recommend taking a bottle of water because you’ll likely lose a lot of fluid doing the walk.

You don’t have to do the whole 10 kilometres. There are shorter options. Enjoy!"
,,Excellent reserve in this urban city,5.0,,"The trails are very rugged! Nothing much is paved, and it’s mostly dirt paths so wear comfortable footwear. I also recommend bringing enough water as water points are rare - in fact I only know of one that’s located halfway through. Mind you, the reserve is quite big!
There are also wild monkeys but don’t touch or feed them. They can get aggressive."
,,A great day out,5.0,,"We started the 11km walk in the blazing sun and ended it completely soaked through after a huge storm hit while we were high above the forest on the tree walk. It is a beautiful place very easily accessible on public transport. We saw lots of monkeys and monitor lizards, plus lots of insects and birds. The walk is easy but long, but there are toilets and water available at a lodge just under half way round. A really nice day and worth the effort."
,,A feel of the jungle close to the city,5.0,,"Lovely easy trails through the jungle, on boardwalk by the reservoir and in the treetops. Yummy curry puffs and fresh orange juice at the Mushroom cafe near the main entrance. Monkeys, water monitor lizards, turtles, butterflies and incredible trees."
,,Fun Trek admist nature,5.0,,"This is a gateway to Singapore’s nature reserves and popular spot for nature lovers and exercise enthusiasts. With hiking trails, kayaks and canoes for rent, it is also a great place for recreational activities, both on land and in water. Its important to check out the weather forecast before you go as it rains occasionally. There are many groups of macaques, colourful birds which make your trek interesting. The highlight of the MacRitchie Nature Trail is TreeTop Walk, a 250m- long freestanding suspensionbridge between the two highest points in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (MacRitchie) and the first of its kind in Singapore. From the suspension bridge, you can delight in having a bird’s eye view of the forest canopy and try to spot different wildlife in their natural habitat. You can also enjoy panoramic views of the verdant greenery of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve and the placid waters of the Upper Peirce Reservoir."
,,Awesome wee activity!,4.0,,"Free and outside!
We did the 10km route. Was very flat, which I don’t think I expected. Glad we went earlier in the day as it was hot hot hot! Also monkeys were a little dangerous throwing branches on the way. Please be aware these are wild animals. So many tourists trying to get close photos. Great casual activity. Take bug spray! Lots of lizards on the path!"
,,Enchanting serene Petai Trail off MacRitchie,5.0,,"It has been a long while ago when Petai Trail was undergoing refurbishment of its natre trail. Finally it is open and we can all take a relaxing pictureque cooling walk on this 2.25km trail beside the reservoir. The weather is fantastic and the trail is so well done even family can bring elderly with wheelchair along. As it is such a fine day there were many individual, partners, group. Many photographers, birds and nature enthusiasts too. I covered about 5km. For the season one, they can take the longest trail 11km or if you decide to take a full ""round"" 22+km. So coincidentally met a long ago colleague who did 22+km with his jogging team. Beautiful flowers and scenery, so enjoy the nature. Remember dont feed or bring food along or you will be inviting monkey. You may take a good rest at the Mushroom Cafe here too."
,,A hidden gem,5.0,,"My husband and I loved this experience. However, pick your day and take plenty of water. It was quite humid. We walked about 11kms around the reservoir and over the treetop walk. Saw squirrels, lots of monkeys, and monitor lizards, as well as plenty of butterflies. A lovely respite from the city. We got there by MRT and bus. The bus drivers were very helpful in letting us know which bus and when to get off."
,,Enjoy every second of it,5.0,,"If you have good stamina and have a friend/partner that shares the same trekking hobby, don't miss this place. Thoroughly enjoy every corner that we ventured. Photo enthusiast may find many money shots."
,,Nature Oasis,5.0,,Took a cab to the entrance of the park from Raffle City and it was only 12 Sing dollars and about 13 minutes. I recommend starting the trail counter-clockwise so you’ll get to the Tree Top Bridge at the beginning and since it's a one-way bridge you won’t have to backtrack like you would if you started the trail clockwise. Bring water and a light rain jacket—got drenched with the typical afternoon torrential rain. Of course it helped cool us down.
,,Best nature reserve in Singapore,5.0,,there is a nice walking trail and you are close to the lush greens. Great for family picknic outing.
,,Definitely worth a visit!,5.0,,"We only had a brief visit to Singapore but I am SO glad we used part of to get to MacRitchie for a walk. You can't believe you're still in Singapore - it's incredibly peaceful, beautiful nature, with hardly a soul around! We saw monkeys, monitor lizards, gorgeous birds and butterflies, and really enjoyed the walking - not suitable for pushchairs, with steps and mixed terrain, and a good workout in the heat! We just took a taxi from our hotel, about a 15mins trip, and then a local bus back again. Highly recommended so make sure you pack your trainers/running shoes when packing for your trip!"
,,Macritchie trail review,4.0,,"We went to the Macritchie Reservoir on June 8, 2018. We took the bus number 74 from the exit B of Tan Kah Keep MRT station. We took the tree top trail. The view is awesome. We took more than 4 hours to complete the walk of 9 kilometres to the tree top and back.We took exit at the Venus drive car park. One can also take this trail from the Venus drive car park. There is a bus stop near the Venus drive car park. One can take the bus to the Orchard or Bencoolen MRT stations."
,,Most visit the tree top,4.0,,"This is the place if you love nature and love hiking. There are a few trails you can go according to your fitness and exercise time.

I and my friends took about 2hours to reach the tree top, walk quite slow (similar normal walk pace).

Do remember to do weather check before your trip and bring umbrella along. Bring a water bottle. You can refill drinkable water at ranger station. Ranger station is the only place with water dispenser and toilet.

Be careful of the monkey. Don't feed them as this will trigger chain reaction to attract more monkey to you.

It is FREE. No entrance fee. Mobile network is always good along the trail.

Difficulty of trail: beginner level."
,,Well worth a visit but come prepared,5.0,,"We took the “yellow” trail from the Mushroom cafe up to the Tree Top Walk and then walked out via the Venus car park. Took us around 3.5 hours to do an estimated 8km. It is muddy in places so wear appropriate footwear with some tread. Bring water but you can top up your bottle easily at the cafe and again at the Rangers station near the Tree Top Walk. You will get very hot and sweaty but most of the walk (except near the golf course) is pretty well shaded. Today we were not bothered by mozzies.
The Tree Top Walk is impressive, longer than I expected, and very high up in the trees. To get to the start from the Rangers Station is a 300m steep road and at the end you go down and up and down quite a lot of stairs so it will require a level of fitness.
We took the 166 bus from Chinatown which dropped us right at the reservoir and then walked out onto Upper Thomson road at the end and took the 166 bus back.
If you have half a day to spare, don’t mind getting hot and sweaty and you want to branch off the line of tourist attractions in Singapore you should give this a try."
,,"Amazing natural retreat in the middle of a busy, modern city-setting.",5.0,,"We really enjoyed the trails and layout. Lots of variety on paved, boardwalk, dirt/gravel trails. It's a nice break from the pavement, shopping, traffic, heat. Bring water and set aside a few hours to wander and enjoy the break!"
,,Escape to nature in the middle of the city,5.0,,Nice trails to feel in the middle of nature while in the big city. The odd spot can get busy in the weekend but most you feel like you’re on your own
,,Great for hiking and running,4.0,,A beautiful place in the middle of a big city. We hiked the loop and it was just lovely. Good footing. Not difficult. Well travelled but not busy. Saw several runners. It would be a great place to run or hike. Lots of shade. We saw monkeys squirrels and lizards. Kayaking and canoeing available at certain times on the day. The tree top walk was closed on Mondays. The trail was well marked.
,,A must do hike!,5.0,,This was probably my favorite place to visit during my vacation in Singapore. I got my exercise in and the TreeTop views were amazing. Was not as hard to find as I read on other sites. Great signage to the TreeTop bridge. Took a bus to the Reservoir during the middle of the week. Very relaxing place but can imagine it gets very busy on the weekends.
,,Awesome trail route for a run,5.0,,"Had an awesome time with my running group friends at McR trails. The route is a bit challenging as a part of it runs along the reservoir and is wooden without any railings, but that adds to the fun. Lots of hills, up & down and the best part is in the middle of the trails they have toilets and water taps available. Beautiful place for a early morning run and to capture some great sunrise pictures."
,,An amazing 'nature' experience,5.0,,"The MacRitchie Nature Trail was such a wonderful experience for us. Its a perfect way to 'tree bath' and once you are here, you won't feel like being in the bustling city of Singapore..... The place is serene, really well maintained, safe and clean."
,,Nice Spot,5.0,,"Great jungle park/walk - easy to get there by bus or taxi. But take water with you, Feels like you are totally away from all the other aspects of modern big building Singapore."
,,Good Place for Nature Hike,4.0,,"Good place to go to get away from the city. You will be close to nature and greenery but it will be hot and humid as well, so do wear comfortable clothes and shoes, and stay hydrated. Worth the effort to go to the Tree Top Walk but be prepared to spend about 3 to 4 hours to hike there and back.... at a reasonable/leisurely pace."
,,A truly memorable hike,5.0,,"The hike to the ""tree top walk"" (pictured) is not easy, and yes, Singapore is hot and humid about 365 days a year. But is it ever worth it. At the one-way bridge (the ""tree top"" part), you will likely be greeted by several monkeys -- we had never seen that before, and it was truly amazing to see monkeys outside of a zoo environment. As for the walk, you need to be in SOME sort of reasonable shape, but it really isn't bad -- the shade provided by the forest canopy helps a lot. Overall, this was the highlight of our Singapore visit. I wouldn't trade this experience for a dozen art museums -- get out and enjoy Singapore's best effort to preserve part of nature."
,,Gorgeous!,5.0,,"We went on a 6 mile tree top hike the first day we arrived. Stunning scenery, lots of wildlife to be seen. Loved seeing all the macaques and Monitor lizards!"
,,Well worth the effort,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore there is no shortage of excellent things to do in the City, but few people venture out of the city into this wonderful nature reserve.

A visitor will find tranquility and a natural environment. Paths are maintained but good footwear should be worn and the climbs and descents are such that you need to be healthy and reasonably fit.
Take plenty of water, the only supply is at the ranger station.

You will see no end of monkeys, birds, butterflies and we even spotted a 1m long monitor lizard.
The tree top walk is splendid, and offers a superb view across the tree canopy. Similar views can be had after climbing the seven storey high viewing tower. All around you can see the top of the forest and in the distance is the city heights of Singapore appearing to be a world away.
We went early in the morning to avoid the midday heat, but it was still extremely hot and humid.
Well worth a visit."
,,Another gem in a small country,5.0,,"What a recomendation this was. Our relatives had mentioned that we should do the tree top walk and it sounded like a good idea. Our taxi driver dropped us off at Venus Drive car park. On looking at the map it suggested a walk of a few kms, and that was in 32 degree heat. So we were a bit concerned coming from Scotland and not being used to high temperatures. However it was well worth the walk. The tree top walk was exhilarating but we didn't see any animals there. When we left it though, there was a troupe of macaques and we got to see more on the Drongo trail near the car park. Beautiful to see in their natural surroundings."
,,"In the jungle, the mighty jungle the monkey sleeps tonight...",4.0,,"If you are a tourist to Singapore and you want to spend some time visiting nature, you have some limited options and this one is one of them.

Don't misunderstand me, this park is beautiful (as I will describe further down), I am just warning you that Singapore isn't precisely the most harmonic place with nature as it has been heavily built to accommodate its residents.

Nevertheless, you can come to this park via bus or train and the entrance has some clear signs telling you when you are getting into monkey territory (asking you not to feed the animals).

If you have never been to a nature reserve I should tell you, bring water, comfortable shoes and, in case you want to do the full walk, something to eat. Is impressive how many residents come here just to exercise and have a chat. Going up is not super demanding, there is footpath almost all the way and you might have a treat or two when monkeys, chipmunks, lizards and various birds pop out the vegetation to give you a little private show before disappearing into the vegetation once more.

The trek is relatively easy, you will see a lot of elderly people going by you having a chat and trying to get their workout on their way... That being said, if you are unfit or you have mobility issues I will highly recommend you to take the trek with a complete attitude of ""I will chill out and I don't need to do everything"". I say this because, Singapore is quite warm, meaning you will be sweating and overheating easily, meaning if you are not careful you can dehydrate yourself and pass out.

As several other people have mentioned here, bring comfortable footwear and lots of water. We didn't need a bug spray but the part we underestimated was how much water we were going to consume and by the end of the trek we had our mouth completely dry and were looking for a convenience store or a shop of sorts to get water.

The full trek can be 10 kilometres (or a bit more). It really depends on how much you want to explore. We started quick energetic and on our way back, the heat made us slow down quite significantly because of our lack of water and dehydration. Good fun though.

If you are coming to see the animals be aware that this is not service-on-demand, on our first 6 kilometres we saw no animal what-so-ever and I was starting to get a little disappointed. After a short stop, a local told us that we were walking behind a really low group and animals tend to hide and pointed out we needed to find a quiet space among the crowd to get a chance to see something. It was not easy, as I mentioned before, there is a lot of people (at least when we went there) but found a gap and did the walk, after 10 minutes two monkeys came out, chasing a chipmunk that was adorable. Both of them froze on the spot when they saw us, stood there, giving us a hard look for a minute or two and continued their merry way. In my opinion, the animals were hard to spot in the beginning because you are not sure what are you looking for. Once you have spotted one or two it becomes easier to find them as you pay more attention to the subtle changes of the vegetation.

By the way, the last tip... if you have food with you, keep it in a place that is sealed. We had half a sandwich which we tucked in our bag's external pocket and as we were walking out, my missus told me ""Honey, what did you do to the sandwich?""
Looking at it, we could notice the wrapping paper was torn out and someone gave it a bite or two. I honestly don't know when it happened but I am going to guess that it wasn't a sleeping monkey.

Enjoy your trip :)"
,,nature and fresh air,5.0,,"was there many times for some hiking exercise.
i always start from Marymount mrt and walk all the way to bukit timah area,and enjoy some authentic SEA or Singapore local good there most of the time.the tree top walk is cool to but it closes at 5pm,if you plan to go watch ur time."
,,A walk in the jungle,4.0,,"Very nice for people who like to walk through the nature. Watch the monkeys ... there are tons of them around, alone and with their children. The bridge is scary but worth to go. Pity we did not manage to see a lot of other animals. It is still so nice to learn about the jungle through special sentences written around the trail. Bring with you some water, you cannot buy anything there! Overall .. well done Singapore city!"
,,10km jungle trek,4.0,,"We spent half a day here and walked around 10km in total. I advise comfortable footwear, plenty of water and BUG SPRAY.
The trails themselves are fairly easy to follow as many have been decked but there are many steps and the humidity in the more dense parts of the jungle makes the walk seem harder.
During our time here we saw monkeys, a terrapin, two types of squirrel and lots of interesting insects. And, although there was a sign advising to beware of the wild boar, we didn’t see one around
If you like the outdoors and fairly demanding exercise, then this is for you!"
,,It was fun.,4.0,,"My nephew said to go to this place its a nice walk. What he didnt tell us was that if you commite to walking the WHOLE TRAIL its 14kms. Yes we did it, Felt like i was in the army in Vietnam waiting for VC to jump out at any moment HAHAHA.
But what a day great way to sweat out all the impurities in your body."
,,A good excercise,4.0,,It is a very good place to jogging. There are some trails inside the forest that you can see monkeys. Good to run in the early morning around 7am or evening ard 5pm.
,,Nice Trail to Hike,5.0,,"I have done this walk twice and the first thing I have to say is come prepared. Bottle water, good walking shoes, sun hat and sunscreen. The part of the trail, I did starts at MacRitchie Park which is just off of Thompson Road. Go around the end of the reservoir and on to the board walk which follows the shore line for a good portion of the trail. You will see signs which explain the vegetation that can be found on the trail. There are a few steps but for most of the trail it is flat. The balance of the trail is a dirt track with some small hills. I would suggest walking it in the morning when it is not so hot. It is one of those peaceful spots in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a major metro area. I walked as far as Island Club Road and then down the trail to Upper Thompson Road. You can turn left and do the Tree Top Walk. Make sure you allow yourself enough time and drink lots of water. The heat and humidity and be oppressive. A great hike and change of pace."
,,Away from the noisy city you can get the other side of Singapore.,5.0,,Phantastic feeling walking hours under the trees and balancing over the hanging bridge. You have the choice to choose different walkways. Very relaxing experience.
,,"Fantastic nature walk, but very long",4.0,,"My husband and I and our two children aged 7 & 8 completes the tree top walk today. The walk is very picturesque, full of wildlife and a stark contrast to Singapore’s busy city centre. My kids did an amazing job and we completed the 11km track today. The track is not for the faint hearted - there are many, many steps, uneven surfaces and steep hills. We thoroughly enjoyed the bridge, and boosted some great views. As many others have stated, please be prepared with water, comfortable and supportive footwear, hat and sunscreen. As for the monkeys, yes, there are quite a few of them, especially round the entrance to the trees top bridge. They were not aggressive towards us, and we followed the recommendations of minimal eye contact, no showing teeth and moving slowly. 4/5"
,,Loved it! Watch out for the monkeys :),5.0,,"Who knew that this could be found in the middle of a city like Singapore! I enjoy nature walks so I had to check this out. Glad that I did. They have lizards and and monkeys for you to see and you can also check out the tree top walk. Be careful if you see lots of monkeys, especially the small ones as they can be quite aggressive if they feel scared."
,,Treasure in the vibrant city,5.0,,"go by bus or MRT but bring your water with you. there are no stalls where you can buy something during the track. i saw a little crocodile and a familie of monkeys. the walk over the jungle trees it's outstanding. i am european and made for walking, you will need a good constitution to go there. Have been already two times and will come again"
,,Amazing Way to Exercise,4.0,,"Getting to the bridge is a feat in itself. If you are dropped off at the resevoir and hike up to the bridge and then hike out, you will cover about 4 to 6 miles depending on route. It's pretty wild that this valley and the isolation can exist in the center of a big city like Singapore."
,,Green oasis in the city!,5.0,,There are lots of trails that connect up which mean that you can hike about 12km or more if you choose to. We started at MacRitchie reservoir (having got the 980 bus from town - very quick and easy) and walked along the boardwalk trails and then on to The treetop walk and then back around to the Venus car park which is in Windsor nature park - in total about 6.5 miles and took about 2.5 hrs. It’s not desperately hard but there are a lot of steps in places (up and down) and parts where the terrain is a bit uneven so just makes it harder going underfoot. The trail was really busy this morning all the way along with both walkers and runners so would suggest that if you have a choice do it during the week when it is bound to be quieter. A lovely walk though through tropical forest and as other people have said - take water!
,,Do walk the trail amidst greenery,5.0,,"This is a great trail that allows you to walk near the tree tops! You will get to see lots of flora and fauna - monkeys, birds and feel rejuvenated amongst nature. Not too difficult, kids can do this too. Don't forget to wear sports shoes or hiking shoes."
,,Spent a month visiting Family,5.0,,"By far not the cheapest place to visit, but well worth it. So much to see and do, just a shame Raffles Hotel is closed for renervation so missed my gin sling. Mrt, buses and taxis are cheap and easy to use so car hire is not needed. If your in transit, spend a few days here you will enjoy it"
,,A Beautiful Nature Haven,5.0,,"If you're looking for a great place to get away from the city, the Nature Trail offers a piece of sanctuary to clear your mind. There are several trails to choose from. From challenging to easy. The course of the trail I take can take anywhere from 3-4 hours. Weekends are crowded, so I'd recommend visiting during the week early in the morning.

Make sure to bring a large bottle of water as there is only one break stop before you reach the challenging part of the walk to the tree top, but watch out for monkeys hiding in the forest. There are monkeys everywhere and they are not afraid of anything or anyone. Watch your cameras, hats and water bottles, as they can be quick and feisty.

Once you get to the tree top, you feel a huge weight of liberation off your shoulders and the view is mesmerizing.

You can finish off the hike with a refreshing beverage or snack at the restaurant located at the top of the hill.

I'd highly recommend this natural reserve to anyone who enjoys photography, hiking, kayaking or a nice peaceful walk in nature."
,,Good Three Hour Trek,4.0,,"Finally trekked through all of MacRitchie. Recommend giving this place a few hours of your time on a day where it has not been raining out. We went after a downpour and became quite dirty with mud everywhere. Bring a bottle of water, sunblock, a hat, and a friend for company."
,,Nice outdoor area,4.0,,"This is a nice park for walking around and enjoying the outdoors in Singapore. It was a bit challenging to find, but worth the walk to get there."
,,Get away from the city and back to nature,5.0,,"There a re lots of trails within and just off the Macritchie reservoir park. The trail all the way round is about 10km and goes through native forest, skirts a golf course and runs along the edge of the reservoir so lots of variety. Various animals lurk in the dense undergrowth to give you a fright with their rustling. It is easy to walk up one side of the reservoir to Windsor Park and then catch a bus back down (or vice versa) which is around 5km, so lots of options."
,,MacRitchie Nature Trail,5.0,,Scenic views and walking among the trees. A good form of exercise by the nature with good shades (tall trees and shrubs). Some path may be a bit steep and rocky but its worth enjoying. Dress comfortably with a good pair of sports shoes and exercise attire. Bring an umbrella along just in case it rains. Water bottle to quench your thrist.
,,"Fantastic Walk and Scenary, But Be Prepared",5.0,,"Decided to try the Treetop Walk based on the reviews on here and was not disappointed.

Great scenery & wildlife and well worth the visit.

Caught the MRT to Caldecott, then walked to the park.

Before you set off, make sure you are carrying water, sunscreen and a hat. Walking in high humidity in 30 degC heat, expect to melt. Also fill up you water bottle at the ranger station.

Allow for 4-5 hours for the Treetop walk - it is much longer than the Venus one in the main description. Roughly x2"
,,Fabulous nature trail,5.0,,"Brilliant walk around the yellow trail - about 12km. Very well marked trail.
Get the MRT to Caldecott, it's about a 5 minute walk to the lake.
Take food and drink. Make sure to top your water up at the ranger station. We spent 5 hours on the walk as we saw so much wildlife. Lots of seats to rest on while looking at the wildlife.
Take the boardwalks at the start and end of the walk as these follow the lake and we saw monkeys across the lake and kingfishers, monitor lizards and terrapins. Climb the Jelutong Tower for another great view over the canopy."
,,Nice to get out of the city,4.0,,"Good way to get out of the hustle and bustle of the city and see a different side to Singapore. The reservoir is quiet and peaceful, but there's enough people around that you feel quite safe. The tracks are well signposted so you shouldn't get lost. Keep your eyes out for the wildlife - I saw a turtle, a snake, and lots of monkeys and butterflies. Take plenty of water and wear comfy shoes. The track is uneven but not too challenging - mostly flat and shaded.

There's a lot of bus routes that can take you here - it took me about 30 minutes on the 166 bus from Chinatown."
,,Hiking in tropical rainforest,3.0,,"I guess that if you are an avid walker or hiker who loves nature, green and trees, then this forest will be great for you. For me it is just a bit too foresty and dense. I'm not a hiker and i like vistas. I find walking here a bit boring actually. In that sense I much prefer the Henderson Waves. Also for the treetop experience I prefer the Henderson Waves."
,,Away from it all,5.0,,"We did the 11km circular nature trail walk but there are lots of walks of different distances and degrees of difficulty to choose from. You mostly walk through trees so it isn't too hot and there are reptiles, monkeys, birds and lovely butterflies to be seen along the way. There are a couple of cafes near the start/end of the walk too. It was good to get out of the city and have the feeling of space. We took the MRT to Caldecott on the circle line and it took about 10 minutes to walk from there to the resevoir."
,,"Beautiful, Free, and Monkeys!!",5.0,,"This trail was awesome! So easy and relatively close to get to by bus. I took the 980 bus near Bencoolan/Middle Rd and it took about 20 mins and it drops you off right in front of where the trail is. The trail goes in a loop, but i decided to follow signs and go counter clockwise which puts more of the dirt uneven trail at the beginning which I prefer.

Treetop Walk is the highlight, but make sure you don't go on a Monday as they are closed. Tons of beautiful nature, sounds, and animals about. I saw some giant lizards, monkeys, squirrels, and a chicken. Most of the walk is covered by trees which makes the heat bearable.

I don't know how much I walked as there is several diverging paths, but I spent about 3 hours here and got to the Treetop Walk which is about halfway on the trail loop.

Bring some water and that's all you need."
,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,"Walk past the lake, via the MacRitchie trail towards the treetop walk. No sounds of the city, monkeys in the trees, very nice escape! You can even go for a canoe trip!"
,,Great running and hiking trails,5.0,,"To get away from the city, one has only to step onto the MacRitchie Nature Trail and the one is enveloped in tranquility and a lovely area for a jog or hike."
,,A good place for a very Long walk,3.0,,A nice place to take a very Long walk. Make sure you have enough drinking water with you. Wear comfortable shoes and cloths.
,,Fun tastic,5.0,,"MacRitchie is located in the central area of Singapore, just off Thomson Road. Well managed park with about 12 km round walk, including a tower to go up and a top tree hanging bridge walk. Walking this trail, you feel like you've left hectic Singapore and are in the middle of a rainforest. Highly recommended."
,,Peaceful Walk amidst nature !,4.0,,A lovely walk along the reservoir - great for the young and old and has a cycling track. Greenery galore.
,,Lovely walks through woodland to the skywalk through the treetops,5.0,,"There is a large area of woodland around the MacRitchie reservoir, with many paths. We only walked from the main car park to the Skywalk (about 45 mins walk for fit adults, not stopping to take many pictures, longer with children or keen photographers!), over the Skywalk and then back round via the Tower. The paths through the woods are great, there are lots of monkeys, best to watch them while keeping walking, if you stand still too long they start to come a bit too close! Great to see them jumping across the walkway. The bridge through the tree tops is great, with terrific views. Note you can only go one direction across it, so have to come back via a circular route. There are lots of other paths that we didn't take, but may some other time.
To get there, we took the bus 410 from Bishan interchange. There is 410G and 410W which basically go opposite ways round a loop. I think it is approx at the far point of the loop, so probably doesn't matter too much which you get. Ask the driver for Upper Thompson Rd (same price to all stops on that road, so you don't need to say more than that). We took the 410G and stayed on till nearly the end of Upper Thomson Rd, we got off by the petrol station. If you stay on longer than that, the bus turns right at the crossroads, where the MacRitchie is to the left. The shop at the petrol station sells drinks, crisps, cakes, so you can get a minimal picnic from it (the lady serving was very friendly). We caught the 410W back from the other side of the road. The buses go pretty regularly (every 15 mins or so, I think?)
We got a few insect bites, so some repellent might be useful, also sun cream even though you under the trees a lot of the time, and definitely some drinking water."
,,"Nice walk, but too much for small children",4.0,,"We went there with our 2 children who are 2 and 3. They enjoyed the first part of the walk but were soon in their pushchairs.
This is a lovely reserve but more for fitness enthusiasts.
The monkeys can be a bit aggressive also.
Ice cafe where we had some cider and meal after though."
,,A good walk,4.0,,It is a peaceful walk. you have a choice of the difficult trail and an easy one for the senior citizens. It is worth a try.
,,Absolutely worth it,5.0,,"I absolutely enjoyed the hike. It is a great activity for rainy weather too. Most of the trail is under trees so you don‘t get wet.
Saw butterflies, birds, monkeys.
The treetop walk is pretty neat too. Great nature adventuere.
I would not recommend it during hot, sunny weather. Bring water and maybe a snack. And better no sandals or flip flops. Sneakers will do."
,,Healthy natural environment,4.0,,Lovely big open environment without too many people or commercial attractions. Good for short visits or the whole day. Great for picnics. Great for calm.
,,Great hiking trails,5.0,,Can easily spend a whole day here. Great hiking tracks. I'd go early in the morning or late in the afternoon as the sun can be too hot in the middle of the day. Perfect on a cloudy day though. Beginner to advance level tracks.
,,A Quick Escape from the Hustle and Bustle of the City,3.0,,"If you want to explore some hidden gems of Singapore, then this place is for you. MacRitchie is one bus ride away from the city (this place is still being developed so it is unreachable by train). The signage is not that obvious but you can ask the locals for directions. Note that this is a day-trip. The trail can take up to 6 hours or so. Once you cross the suspended bridge (which is the highlight of the trail), there’s no going back. Aside from the suspended bridge, there’s not much to see in this place. However, the nature vibe and animal encounters (squirrels and monkeys) were worth the sweat!"
,,PERFECT TO ESCAPE CONCRETE JUNGLE,4.0,,"Should you wish to feel the Old Singapore Spirit and walk in a safe environment this nature trail around lakes (reservoirs) is the perfect getaway. However, beware of the agressive monkeys on the tree top bridge."
,,Nature Walk,5.0,,"Large nature reserve with good walks and a tree-top-bridge. Easy to reach with bus, quite popular and many animals/birds to see."
,,Favorite walk in singapore,5.0,,"Depending on your appetite for walking , mac ritchie offer you several paths
My favorite one is around 12 km.
You can if you want include the famous treewalk on suspended bridge over the jungle.
Macritchie is kind of jungle in Singapore.
You can easily meet monkeys, bat, squirrels or butterfly.
I heard there are still few pangolin there, but never got chance to meet any.
Only negative point , pet are not allowed."
,,Very easy simple walk to experience tropical forest,4.0,,"If you are short of time or just want an easy stroll, I would suggest taking the Petai Boardwalk. It is newly renovated and the boardwalk is about 2 km long with view of the bluish green water of the reservoir and the huge trees in the forest. With more time , one can complete the tree top trail or the trail around the reservoir in about 2 hours. The total distance around the reservoir is about 10 km. The most beautiful stretch is the walk near to the Bukit Island Country Club."
,,Enjoyed walking in the park,4.0,,"I enjoyed the walk round. There are a number of options you can take on walking, more than I mention here. This is what I did on one visit.

Started with the loop to the TreeTop walk, passed through some really lovely forest areas and enjoyed the views from the tree top bridge. Need to be aware that it is a one way walk at the bridge and there are quite a lot of steps to deal with, especially after you have crossed the bridge (more descend than ascend). The paths are good condition, some natural material so would recommend wear trainers.

After that I looped back for a bit and then took the MacRitchie Nature Trail coming back, nice but not as enjoyable as the first part of the trail. I did the short detour via the Petai Trail off this, that was so lovely with views over the reservoir and seeing the snake enjoying its lunch on the path!! (I did go passed it with some caution). Evidently this piece of trail has recently been re-opened and the latter part of the trail is still being refurbished into 2018. You are led out to the MacRitchie Trail. Hardly anyone else was on this part of the walk.

Then at the end, if you wish, it is the dam crossing and a very open area with some lovely gardens. There is also a fitness trail for those who like to run (which clearly some people do).

The park is easy to get to from a variety of buses (Venus drive stop just beyond Esso garage at the start) and for me (Lornie Road at the end, just beyond car park)."
,,Top trail,5.0,,A nice experience in Singapore. Nature and forest so nice with some monkeys crossing the trees. Dont loose it.
,,jungle trail,5.0,,It was an easy walk but really really humid. you really need to dress for heat and humidity. take water and travel lite.
,,Great hiking trail!!!,5.0,,One of the best hiking trails in Singapore. Very easy to walk although the complete round is 13 kilometers. No need to be in fit to do it. The highlight of the trail is the Top Tree walk.
,,Always a great place to hangout with family =),5.0,,Coming to Macritchie for a little curry puff and a walk is always a joy. The best time to come is in the mid afternoon where the crowds have thinned.
,,nature walk,4.0,,"The MacRicthie Park is very well to make a walk in the nature. By the way, you have to take the taxi as it is far from the centre. In the Park you can choose if you want to make a little Trail, average or the big trail. It is well indicated by different colors you can follow during all the trail. You can see if you have chance some animals. You will see for sure the monkeys, don't feed them and don't drink in front of them to avoid any problem."
,,Good walk,5.0,,"If you want a decent place to hike with a lot of nature, this is the best place to go on Singapore. Monkeys, lizards, and turtles!"
,,A contrast between what we perceive about Singapore,5.0,,A contrast between what we perceive about Singapore. Wildlife is absolutely thriving in these quarters. Avoid from November onwards. Rainy season starts. (=
,,Exercise,4.0,,"A nice place to exercise or have a morning walk. Once at the treetop bridge, the view is pretty and great for taking instagrammable photos."
,,Great nature trail,4.0,,A great escape from the city and easy to reach by Bus - take plenty of water to drink (there are water stations around the trail to top up)r! Saw lots of lovely birds and monkeys.
,,Lovely,5.0,,Away from built up singapore a stunning nature trail Really enjoyed the hike and the tree walk ... blah
,,Lovely introduction to Singapore,5.0,,"On our first morning in Singapore we decided to have a walk here and to go across the treetop bridge. As expected it was incredibly hot but was worth every minute. It was amazing to be on the bridge and look out over the trees whilst also being able to read about them, thanks to signs along the way explaining what they were and their uses in Singapore.
If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle this is a good place to start. Make sure to take plenty of water and a good pair of walking shoes."
,,Great Nature Walk,5.0,,"This is a great place for nature lovers. It has a lot of trees, bushes, grass. It is very green. I went in the morning. You have different paths like a 5 km walk, 7 km walk etc. We went to tree top which is kind of a hanging bridge. The complete walk was around 11 km. It took 2.5 hours. Higly recomended for nature lovers"
,,Interesting Hiking Trail,4.0,,"Indeed an interesting hiking trail which goes straight through the rainforest. The trail is well maintained, which makes walking quite easy. You may encounter monkeys, lizards, birds and beautiful butterflies on the way. The views from the tree top bridge are amazing. Good place to unwind and learn the other Singapore. Don’t follow the sign to Bukit Timah natural reserve though. The trail is not very pleasant as it is rather broken and goes near the shooting range of ST Kinetics, a local military corporation, suddenly then turning into the car road."
,,Fun and easy hiking,5.0,,"Relatively easy hike with some good views. Decent amount of wildlife, plants, trees. Be careful of the monkeys! They will steal from you... they are vey quick and quiet!"
,,Explore nature,4.0,,MacRitchie Nature Trail is a great way to be away from the city life of Singapore and to feel some fresh air
,,Most go,5.0,,"I love this trail! It is like a jungle in the middle of the city. The hike to TreeTop Walk is very descent, it is not too hot this time of the year."
,,Simply Beautiful,5.0,,"After visiting the overtly impressive and much lauded Gardens by the Bay, I wasn't sure any of Singapore's other parks would have the ability to compete, but the rugged MacRitchie Nature Trail, nestled somewhat incongruously in the middle of a bustling urban area, showed me just how wrong I was! This idyllic haven is simply teeming with wildlife for those with keen enough eyes to penetrate the lush flora, and we saw innumerable lizards, squirrels, birds, insects, and a couple of long-tailed macaque monkeys, on our approximately 4 hour trek. Where your eyes fail, your ears are only too happy to step up to the challenge and are indeed almost over-burdened with the ceasless hum from countless insects, which form a pleasant symphony alongside the tiny rustlings made by invisible creatures buried deep within the brush. Although the tree top walk is the definite highlight, enabling you to spot monkeys dancing above the canopy even as it offers stunning views of the forest and neighbouring reservoir, the trails themselves are an absolute delight. Just be aware that they are somewhat lengthy and demanding, especially with Singapore's oppressive heat, so be sure to pack sun protection and plenty of water."
,,A pleasant surprise,4.0,,"This walk surprised me with it's length, scenery and contrasts. Completing the loop is a great way to exercise, enjoy the outdoor and to see a different side to Singapore. The ""jungle"" like terrain and the surprising wildlife was wonderful. The first time I completed the hike I did it alone however, I would recommend doing with with another person. I saw 2 snakes, monkeys and a very large monitor and would've preferred to have been walking in at least pairs. I've completed the walk numerous times with girlfriends since and always love it."
,,Day vist,5.0,,"The tree top walk is some 300 metres long and in the middle of Mac Ritchie/Windsor national park. It is at the peak of the park - so a hike to the entrance.
It is about a 3.5 kms walk to/from the tree top walk itself. The trail is well signposted but a bit rough places. Certainly not a hard walk - but the heat and humidity are a challenge!
In all we walked some 8km round trip. But the scenery is wonderful, the tree top walk was excellent and safe and the whole trip (about 2.5 hours round trip) a great adventure.
We took a cab to the location (S$13) and found a bus outside the entrance (a short walk to main street) that took us all the way the hotel (S$4 - 2 people). In hindsight, not knowing the exact location, this combination was was a good compromise. The bus trip was a sight seeing adventure in its own right. Again, as usual, the locals were extremely helpful and polite as!
This is a great, unusual and not well known adventure highly recommended for the hardy traveller."
,,Long and well-maintained nature park,5.0,,"Longer than expected and many nice views. So better to take care of the time!
It was not just a walk but like a hike. And no place to buy water.
Like a mountain, can get mindfulness through a trip.
In some places like a long high bridge or tall tower, can change mind and have good memories."
,,Place to go running in a natural setting,4.0,,This is the place to go trail running there is a board walk and also trail paths which go all around the reservoir. Change and shower facilities available near the car park along with a cafe. Lockers cost $1 must use a $1 coin only (both old or new ones). Do not recommend it after a rain storm (very muddy or fallen branches) suggest first thing in the morning.
,,A nice place for a Long walk,3.0,,I have been here once and it was a god experience. Make sure you have enough of energy to walk the Long trail and keep enough water and snacks with you.
,,Once is never enough !,5.0,,"An amazing trail - with different walking routes : some easy, some challenging (at least for me). Best to go in the early morning on weekdays to avoid crowds. Good to go alone or with friends. Up to the scary suspension bridge or close to the waters. Simply awesome!
Just beware of the monkeys and do not bring food or expose your bags as they can be faster than you can open your mouth to shout."
,,Would go here again!,5.0,,"I loved this! The view from the bridge is really wonderful.
Luckily when we went there was no one else on the bridge so we could take our time on the bridge and while walking through the trail ✨
It's a one way road, you can't turn back and walk so remember to take photos or videos when you need to!

Ps. There are monkeys! I didn't see them in the trail part but whilst walking up to the top where the trail started they'll sometimes jump across the trees above you I didn't see any signs about food or beware of the monkeys but maybe be careful?"
,,Love trail,4.0,,Good walking trail that will take you to the 'top' of the forest. Easy walk that can be done by young and old.
,,One of my favorite walks in the city,5.0,,"MacRitchie nature trail is such a treat to escape the busy city life! I would recommend going during the week or early on week ends to avoid the crowds though, as it's a favorite amongst nature lovers and joggers."
,,Nice trail run cum brisk walking,5.0,,You can run btw 5-10 km depending on the route or even longer. Just be careful of monkeys. Leave them alone and you will be fine. Good to run in the early morning around 7am or evening ard 5pm.
,,Jungle experience!,5.0,,"It is a very good place to jogging or hikking. There are some trails inside the forest that you can see monkeys, lizzards and many other animals. You can also run/walk in a deck around the lake (reservoire). There is a great food court also to have a lunch after workout."
,,A Good days excercise for those cooped up in A/C offices.,5.0,,"It's about 11 km from start around dam, halfway point is fire tower, then to the HSBC TREETOP sky bridge and back around the lake to the dam entrance again. Next to Koreas Jeju, or up around the Peak in Hong Kong,possibly one of the most 'people friendly' hikes in Asia. But when sunny it will wear you out, hot, and tropical rains will drench you. Bring a water bottle and poncho. Lots of monkeys, monitor lizards and turtles. It's also a serious runners path, but the heat and humidity can kill you. About 20 minutes by bus or MRT (then bus)from CBD, in Bishan area. Do it."
,,Lebih dari 5 bintang,5.0,,The view is majestic especially from Jelutong tower and the suspension bridge. More than recommended!
,,For those who find Singpore too city like/ artificial,5.0,,MacRitchie is one of the several close to nature places in SIngapore- a side of the city state which tourists often ignore. Recommended for long morning walks/jogs and being one with nature
,,Good run,5.0,,This place is well maintained. A good place to run or walk amidst the lush forest. You can run along the reservoir on wooden planks or run inside the forest. monkeys are everywhere.
,,Great place for a walk!,5.0,,"Love the fresh air and greenery. A great place to get away from the traffic and high rise building. You can spend the whole morning walking and enjoy the fresh, crisp air."
,,great place to explore,4.0,,"You can spend hours exploring this beautiful place. There is so much green that you will be surprised. Don't miss out the tree top trail. It closes at 17:45, and carpark closes at 19:00."
,,Djungle close to the megacity,4.0,,"This is a great place to explore the last remaining bits of (mostly) untouched djungle in Singapore. Great paths, some quite steep, amongst the trees. We saw monkeys and bushbabies and listened to the amazingly loud sounds of cicadas. Don't take food or water with you - the monkeys will go for it! Rather leave it in the car ath the parking lot and drink before and after. One feels so much lighter and enchanted before returning to the megacity!"
,,Nice place to walk around,4.0,,"I went there with reasonable expectations. The walk is though short, worth taking through the bushes and trees. One can hear the weird sounds which is a mix of birds, insects like crickets, etc, but the walk is worth taking once."
,,Good variety of trails for various ages,4.0,,"Came here with my family a couple of weeks ago for a walk and the path along the reservoir is very beautiful. It helps that in most of the trails, you are sheltered from the sunshine by the tall trees so despite the hot weather, it didn't feel too warm. We were a bit unfortunate not to spot any monkeys or other animals, but still had a good time. Will consider coming back again."
,,The forest in heart of singapore,4.0,,"You will feel the forest smell and witness some beauty here. You need to take the trail starting from the MacRitchie Reservior for full hiking trip. Plan your time ahead because @ 5:00PM Tree Top Walk gate is close. You will hike uphill be prepared for the exercise.
You can skip the time and head to Tree Top Walk starting from Venus Car Park, Take bus 162M in Blk 454 bus station, from Orchard Street.
Bring sufficient water if you don't have you can drink cold water at Radio station on the way to Tree Top Walk Gate."
,,escape from the hustle and bustle of the city,5.0,,"Escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Large lake surrounded by expansive lawns, and thick bush with walkways and boardwalks - but literally in the middle of the city.
Note it can be busy on weekends and in the early mornings with families, rowers and joggers.
Allow several hours to wander the nature trails, or just sit on a bench.
Bird watching is fairly good.
RMT station a few hundred metres away."
,,Really nice walk,4.0,,"We went through this walk with my husband. It's nice walk and it was fun seeing monkeys on the way. The best part was the Tree top walk. Recommend to take lot of water with you, as there is no water to buy around. It took us about 2,5hours to walk the 11k route."
,,Best walking trail in singapore,5.0,,"Walk across the reservoir is very beautiful with fair share of ups and downs. The complete circuit is approx 10kms. Make sure you visit treetop walking trail, the views are simply amazing."
,,GREAT FOR NATURE LOVERS,4.0,,"great place to visit for the day, you feel like you are in a middle of a jungle but you are in the city. we took bust 167 on stamford road, behind Swissotel hotel. only a short walk from the bust stop. wear comfortable shoes as it is a long walk. along the way there a numerous plants and shrubs , an occasional lizard and lots of chirping birds. also lots of wild monkeys, so watch your bag as they will still anything you carry. we did see a pink bag hanging on the tree with a selfie stick hanging out of it. so keep you things out of sight. they are adorable but do not show your teeth to them as it is a sign of aggression to monkeys. we walked 5 km to rangers station then another to Bukit Timah nature reserve from where we took a public bus 171 back to the hotel. on the way we encountered more monkeys on the road side and the street but they are harmless will not attack you unless you have food. all in all a long hot walk but it was worth it. highly recommended."
,,Nice,5.0,,Very peaceful. Away from the city sounds. The only nature area available for public in singaporean. Recommended
,,Tree Walk and Trails,5.0,,"Nice hike in Singapore not far from the city. It is nice to get out and see nature away from the crowds of Orchard Road. See monkeys in the wild, especially at the suspended tree walk."
,,Loved the Hike!!,5.0,,we forgot we were in a concrete jungle of Singapore.... this is like a true rainforest experience.... can be dehydrating... would recommend carrying adequate fluids.
,,"Singapore's last ""wilderness""",5.0,,"Easy to access by public transport, direct stop of many bus lines.

Well managed park with about 10-15 km round walk, including a tower to go up and a top tree hanging bridge walk.

Beware of the monkeys hahaha, they may snatch a loose bag if you give them the chance to do so.

Great place for jogging or other sport activities. Showers, lockers etc are available....."
,,Worth the taxi trip!,5.0,,"Not far but if you're staying in the Orchard Rd area or CBD it's a bit more of a drive but normally against the traffic.
A great place to work out and burn off all the food! If you're lucky you'll see some monkeys hanging out or some awesome big monitor lizards.
A lovely place to walk around but avoid the cafe and food."
,,Nature in the midst of a bustling city,5.0,,"I am glad that there is such a nature trail in the midst of a bustling city.

Went for a trail walk and i must say it was quite a challenge. Saw families with young children and wondered how that could take the difficult routes when there are endless slopes and uneven grounds. I must say it will be quite a feat for children below 12 years to complete at least 5km.

I must say that this nature trail is the best training ground for runners. It will not only help to build the stamina but also the resilience to the harsh ground conditions (worst when it is raining).

Overall experience is good because of the cool air and I was quite surprised I did not get any mosquito bites when I am usually a victim of it. Perhaps it was due to my sweaty legs.

Will not recommend babies or toddlers below 3 to visit the place."
,,Monkeys in the middle of the city!,5.0,,"What a beautiful setting for a walk, just minutes from the city. We entered through the Upper Thompson entrance and were immediately greeted by wild monkeys. It was a nice walk, and the bridge across the canopy was really a pleasant surprise. Go early in the day, it gets hot!"
,,Nature in Singapore,5.0,,The MacRitchie trail allows you to forget the busy life in Singapore city. After 15min you are in the tropical forest and the city noise is gone. The trail is easy to follow yet not artificially. It does has some climbs and you will probably get hot. The tour takes about 2 hours.
,,Allow enough time,4.0,,"MacRitchie nature reserve is a nice day out. But it requires a day, or close to it.

A google search for the entrance to the treetop walk took us to the lower carpark. Until we arrived I didn't realise this was just the entry to the park. The tree top walk was a further 4km up the hill.

There is plenty of signage, but it is terribly inaccurate. For example, we passed a sign that said ""treetop walk 1200m"" then a few minutes later a sign that said ""treetop walk 1500m"". From the carpark it is supposedly a 6km round trip. My GPS recorded 9.8km total and we never left the marked trails.

Hold onto backpacks and don't consume food near the treetop walk or ranger station as this is where most of the monkeys hang out ready to grab food and other items. There's no water or toilets along the track except at the ranger station so take a day pack, water and mosquito repellant.

The squirrel trail is good for children and squirrel are easy to find. There's also fish in the stream and children will enjoy feeding them bread. The view from the treetop walk was nice and the overall park is very pleasant.

It's very pretty but be sure to allow enough time."
,,Amazing but be prepared!,5.0,,"This is a definite must do! Absolutely enjoyed the tree top walk. The macaques frightened a few ladies but as long as you keep your food and drinks in your properly secured bag and don't look them in the eye, you should be able to proceed without any unsolicited adventures. In addition, wear proper hiking shoes and exercise clothes as the terrain is mainly gravel and unpaved.... (did I neglect to mention that you are hiking in hot and humid weather???In case you forgot, you are in equatorial Singapore) Do bring lots of water and snacks. My group hiked from the front entrance, making it a long hike. If you have little kids or older folks, park at Venus drive before commencing. Very enjoyable experience."
,,"Nice tree top walk, but not much to see around that part of the park",3.0,,"We only had a couple of hours to spend in the park, so we started the walk at Venus drive so we could get to the tree top walk as part of our walk. The tree covered trails gave us a nice break from the heat, but even in late PM it's still pretty hot - bring water and wear good sneakers or light hiking shoes.

The monkeys in the park were fun to see, and the tree top walk gave us a good view of the surrounding areas but not much in terms of birds or other natural sites.

Not a bad place to go to walk off or run off some calories."
,,Fun trail,4.0,,"2-3 hour hike. It’s supposedly a chill and easy walk (probably if you’re fit). It’s pretty flat, but the 10km walk can be exhausting. Honestly the view from the treetop is just ok. The bridge itself is the actual highlight. DON'T bring food or else monkeys will chase you."
,,Great way to get,5.0,,"It has lots of walking trails to follow. We followed one of the shorter ones (4.8km) that took us onto a boardwalk along the edge of the reservoir. Saw lots of wildlife; monitor lizards, terrapins and monkeys. Lovely afternoon!"
,,Great hiking trail.,5.0,,"Mac Richie Reservoir - Singapore

Mac Richie Reservoir is one of the oldest reservoirs in Singapore built by the British. Construction was eventually completed in 1868 but the pumps and distributing network were not finished until 1877.

The forest surrounding the reservoir has been protected as a water catchments reserve. It is the nearest open reservoir to the City which is why it is the most popular venue of visit for both locals and tourists. It is also area that receive the most rainfall.

Deep in the nature reserve there is the ruins of a shrine that was built by the Japanese Imperial Army during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore during World War 2. Visitors are told not to try to reach it, moreover it is suited away from the normal tracks that visitors frequent.

There are boardwalks skirting the edge of the scenic MacRitchie Reservoir and walking trails through the forest. The trails range in distances from 3 km to a 11 km round trip. Both the boardwalks and trails are signposted allowing visitors to venture safely on a self-guided tour.

The boardwalk and trails which hug the reservoir also allow for easy exploration of freshwater wildlife, plants and bird life. Apart from a occasional glimpse of some monkeys and squirrels other animals such as monitor lizards, snakes, samba deer, and wild boars will remain hidden from human eyes.

Most of the visitors coming in from the main entrance will head straight across the dam towards the kayak storage area. School children can be seen in the afternoons kayaking and canoeing in the calm waters. The popular Tree Top walk is in that direction. It is a 250 m aerial suspension bridge spanning the two highest points in the reservoir. At 25 m it offers a panoramic view of the surrounding rainforest. A short distance from the exit of the Tree Top Walk is the Jelutong Tower which also offers a panoramic view of the surroundings. A visitor taking a round trip will come across a golf course that come close to the edge of the trial. As the flights all head away from the trails there is no possibility of any stray balls that go out of bounds.

It should be noted that the terrain of the trials are normally of gradual gradient and the ground in most cases level. A person of normal fitness would be able to hike the 11 km round trip. However there is a 22 km (round trip) circuit that connect MacRichie with the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve starting and ending at Dairy Farm Nature Reserve car park. For that tough route you have to start at Dairy Farm and take the rough terrain behind the Bukit Timah Reserve till you come to Rifle Range Road and follow the road till you come to the entrance of the forest leading to MacRichie. For that trip I will need to bring my lunch and sufficient water and a poncho, in case it rain, and I have to start my hike before noon for a 6 hour trip. I am 74 and I have to take it slow. There is also a (more than) 30 km hike that continues from MacRicher onwards. I will write about it someday when I have the time to go through the route once more. It will take me the whole day."
,,Long and tiring walk,3.0,,"Brought my overseas friend to see the treetop. It was drizzling when we started the walk, however it was cooling yet we still perspired, how much more if it was sunny. We walked more than 5km to reach there and it was just a short treetop walk. We have to walk more than 5km to exit the other way as it was a shorter route. However, when we finally reached the car park, it was still a long way to the main road to take the bus. Thank God a delivery truck came by and the driver offered us a ride to the bus stop. It was really a long and tiring walk."
,,A great way to escape the city,4.0,,"Walking this trail, you feel like you've left hectic Singapore and are in the middle of a rainforest. You can't hear any cars, just nature.
The trail is not overly exciting in terms of sights but I enjoyed it very much. It gives you time and place to switch off your mind in the midst of nature. Although my friend and I went there on a Saturday, we didn't encounter any crowds."
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"Very hot and steamy. Beware of the thieving monkeys, they will attack and steal what ever is in the bag. We did see a pink bag hanging off a tree with a selfie stick hanging out of it. great to see a jungle forest in middle of the city. You can take a bus 167 for $2 there and back from Stamford road and it brings you back to ANY stop in the city. Or you can walk another 5.5km to Bukit TIMAH and catch a bus 171 to the city. Singapore has a great public transport , USE IT. The walking trail is well marked but there are few steps along the way so be prepared for a little huff and puff.
Great way to spend an active day out with interesting fauna and flora .lot of locals on the weekend so go on a week day.
Highly recommended."
,,A Must for Nature Lovers,5.0,,"This walking trail is incredible and right in the middle of Singapore. Situated around a beautiful reservoir, the walk is moderately easy and not strenuous. The whole loop does take a few hours, so pack some water! Keep your food well protected inside cloth bags or don't bring food at all if you can avoid it, because of the monkeys. They will just take it from you!"
,,Back for another round,4.0,,"Despite this trail being very popular and quite busy, it remains one of Singapore's better places for hiking. It's also a good place to take visitors to show them that Singapore isn't just full of malls, car parks and office buildings. The tree top walk is a particular highlight and I'd really like to take my kids there, except that it's quite a hike to get to."
,,Beautiful and free,5.0,,"We got the bus out to the reservoir, and followed the signs to find the treetop walk. It feels like a huge walk in the humidity, and since it is uphill a lot of the way so be prepared for a hike and bring plenty of water with you. The views from the tree walkway are amazing, and coming from a different climate there is so much to see here- monkeys, exotic jungle and birds. There seems to be about a million steps down at the end of tree walk to get back down to ground level. If you are really lucky the heavens will really open while you are back in the forest and you will see why the vegetation is so lush and green! If you can manage to coincide this with being in a shelter all the better!"
,,"Beautiful oasis , pace yourself",4.0,,"If like me you live in cooler , less humid climate, then realise you will be more tired than if at home. Sunday late morning we walked from main lower car park up to the treetops walk and then out venus drive. Good decision as easier exit path than returning to main car park. Even if car at bottom just taxi back. Very busy but nice atmosphere as well as beautiful."
,,"Great for walkers, joggers and bird watchers",4.0,,One of the few 'wild' places left in Singapore where much of the threatened wildlife of Singapore is still hanging on. Get there early in the morning for the best chance to see birds.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A nice Sunday morning walk in the Forrest with the tree top walk as the highlight. Stunning views and quietness.
,,A beautiful walk in Singapore,4.0,,This is a perfect outdoor activity a beautiful walk in the forests of Singapore. The walk is good and shows you the beauty of Singapore. Make sure you wear good shoes. Enjoy
,,The greenest green of Singapore,4.0,,"If you think Singapore is all hotels and skyscraper and feel the need to run into the wild, here you go. MacRitchie is quite an extensive reservoir to spend an afternoon with nature without leaving the country. Many people go there running, cycling, kayaking too.

To try: skybridge
To keep in mind: klopto-monkeys on the rise :)"
,,Long but enjoyable trek!,5.0,,Wanted to do the tree top trail. Didn't realize it was 11 km in total - tired at end but a really nice way to get some fresh air and see some interesting things. Worth the trek but be prepared. If you take the MRT it's a short walk - ask the ticket office and they will give you little map
,,"Monkeys, Monkeys and more Monkeys",5.0,,"This was my second visit to the MacRitchie Nature Preserve. The first visit was in April but second visit was in June. During our June visit we were able to see the beautiful monkeys. We were hoping to hike the treetop trail but that trail is not open on Mondays. Although we did not hike the treetop trail we were able to continue on the trail and just skip that part! It is a long hike but just take your time and bring water. The trails are mostly paved but I still wore hiking boots (gym shoes will be fine).

It was great breathing in the fresh air. As you walk you will enter a gulf course, which seemed extremely odd, but not too distracting.

Note: Treetop trail is closed on Mondays. Wear mosquito repellant."
,,"Not For the Faint of Heart, But Definitely Worth It",5.0,,"Singapore does a great job of striking a balance between the demands of a developed urban metropolis and preserving green spaces around the island for people to splash around in. Macritchie is part of a much larger reservoir and catchment basin located in the middle of Singapore. They have carved out a 15 km round-trip trail that loops around the reservoir, and while it takes you through some really interesting jungle (I almost got run over by what I think was some kind of pig once), it also butts up against a pristine country club golf course.

The trail is great exercise, but you should be warned: if you are not used to physical exertion in this climate then you should take it slow. The trail is not a tough trail, but the thick jungle foliage traps the heat and humidity and it will suck the moisture out of you quickly so bring at least a 1.5 litre water bottle. The Tree Top Walk is of course gorgeous, but the walkway is also really narrow so you can easily get trapped behind a group of photo-snapping looky-loos for long stretches of time.

Also, a word to the wise - keep on eye on the sky. There are shelters spaced about every 1-2 km, but in Singapore the rain can come quick and hard at the drop of a hat. I've been caught in torrential downpours that flooded the trail. It's actually quite fun to get splashed by the rain while walking around a rain forest, but it also short circuited by iPhone so I'm not sure if it was worth it or not."
,,A lush stretch of Green in the heart of a bustling metropolis,5.0,,"Very few visitors coming into this modern city are aware of this lush stretch of rain forest surrounding a water body. However, for those interested in hiking, this is a must visit. One can easily access the place by bus or MRT. The hiking trails are well marked. You maybe surprised by an occassional monkey, so you need to take care of your belongings. Carry enough water, it can get hot at times. The tree top bridge is one of the major attractions here, but one must keep in mind that it closes at 5:30 p.m. All in all you may forget that you are in Singapore while you tread through this trail."
,,A Hidden Wonder.,5.0,,"If you enjoy bird watching, walking and beautiful scenery this is the place to go. It is easily accessible either using the MRT or the bus system. We were surprised that this attraction is not well advertised and we discovered it by chance.
The jungle vegetation is lush with a huge variety of trees and plants , there are many species of butterflies and bird life to watch. We climbed the tower for a view over the area and many steps to reach the Rangers Station where the facilities are clean. You need to be alert to the many monkeys as they will snatch any food from you, they will even attempt to get into your backpack. The walk over the one-way bridge is a delight as you can look down on the trees and plants. it makes you realise how tall the trees are. We continues our walk and came out at the Windsor Park where there are huge spreading trees that attract a number of bird varieties. This spot was obviously popular for bird watchers as a number of people were photographing and using binoculars to watch the birds. This is a really good area to explore."
,,A big surprise!!! Why is this not in the top five???,5.0,,"I am a nature lover and hiker by nature and was recommended this by a friend who is a trail runner. I was totally un-prepared for the wonders of this magical trail. The trail is accessible from a few points mainly the country club and a short walk from the Marymount Central MRT stop. There are also many buses which service the area to all parts of Singapore. Once you enter this lovely trail which surrounds the reservoir you feel like you are in the deepest jungles. The paths are varied but easy for most walkers and where things may get more difficult there are board-walks. There is a great mix between wild and natural elements with ranger stations and lookouts and picnic areas, but also stretches where you feel like you are in ancient Singapore. The hilight is the HSBC Tree Walk (following the signs from all the entrances...there is a 'one way' entry). From here you are greeting by monkeys and beautiful views. There are also monitor lizards and beautiful butterfly species (I spotted 13 different species on the two hour walk). There are also birds and reptiles to keep everyone interested. Make sure you bring plenty of water for the first legs (you can re-fill at the ranger stations) and a camera to enjoy the view. This is not accessible to those using wheelchairs or very limited mobility however there were many older people and children enjoying the trail."
,,Beautiful nature trail,5.0,,"If you love nature, you will like this place. It is a 2-3 hour walk. Don't miss the Treetop Bridge around 1 hour walk from the entrance near Venus Drive. Surprising that there are places like this in Singapore which is known to be very urbanized. Go around the reservoir for great scenic views. However, be prepared for its hot and very humid climate. Bring lots of water."
,,Grossly underrated,5.0,,"MacRitchie is well-worth a visit if you're into hiking or tropical flor and fauna. The main circular track is approximately 10.5 km. The terrain is not too technical; if you're of good fitness, it's possible to jog the 10.5 km trail in 60 to 90 min."
,,"Flora and fauna, all around.",5.0,,"The forethought of Singapore's citizens have led to this amazing park, but in typical Singaporean fashion this area is not just a pretty place it is also an intregral part of it's water managament plan. Long lesiurely walks along the boardwalk takes one past lizards, frogs, monkey, butterflies and more. The trees and the forest floor are full of native plant species. Most of which are identified by the numerous storyboards along the path. It's a long walk but not a difficult one. Bring your water bottle and sensable foot wear."
,,Get lost in Nature,5.0,,"It's one of the most beautiful place in Singapore with a great view and completely at peace, especially when you go in less crowded times. Don't forget to carry enough water and snacks if required - especially if you're going with kids."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,Well mapped out and easy to navigate. Make sure to bring water bottles with you so you can refill. The treetop walk is awesome.
,,Decent Walk,4.0,,"Trail is real easy and marked well. It is not hard walking, but quite a few stairs if that is not an issue.

The views were nice and lots of wildlife. Monkeys were not bad and as others state, don't smile at them. Look, but keep moving. Don't make them feel threatened. Saw some squirrels, snake, large lizards, monkeys and fish."
,,Don't Smile at the Monkeys!,4.0,,"I walk the trails here every few months. Monkeys think teeth are threatening. Do not smile or interact with them. They can attack!
Do not feed any animal. This walk of ""tree tops"" is special. Be prepared in advance for thunderstorms and know where you can find a taxi midway by a golf course if you need medical attention for any member of your group, as we did. Visitors from colder climates get overcome with heat. Be prepared with 100 Plus or equivalent electrolyte drinks. Water is insufficient. Keep all food and drinks hidden from monkeys. They will jump on backpacks to steal the bottle! Pay attention to your footsteps! ENJOY NATURE!"
,,Home care group outing,4.0,,Wonderful morning walk through the macRitchie Reservior main entrance . Very beautiful waters views and greenery. Further into the trails will come into forested areas reminiscent of a virgin primary jungle. Be prepared with walking on muddy tracks especially after rainfalls. A walking stick will be useful.
,,My favourite Trail,5.0,,"I come to MacRitchie Nature Trail few time every year. It's a peaceful, nature rainforest. I come for a run which the whole loop takes around 12km. Treetop walk/bridge which is hanging above all the trees emergent layer is a must go but note that it closes at 5pm."
,,Far but rather worth it,4.0,,"Had a bad start to the treetop walk as it is easy to get lost without a guide. Thankfully I met some nice locals who were walking up the trail as well. This is definitely not for the weak-hearts as it's spanning about 10-11 km. Do remember to go in the early morning as well as Singapore's weather is soooo humid. Nevertheless, the view was great and I had an enjoyable time!"
,,Love this park - out of town but inside,4.0,,"Always a nice park for a Sunday run or to bring visitors. Tree top walk is pretty cool, walk by the golf course with the monkeys too (I like to do it counter clockwise starting from the dam) Recommended"
,,Walking in the woods,5.0,,"After my 11 year old decided that the family should go on a Mac Ritchie reservoir outing , the family got geared up in comfortable shoes and a few niknacks in the bag and got dropped off at Venus Drive. We wanted to go straight to the treetops as we entered the place pretty close to closing time that is 4.15. That last entry at the treetop walk being 5pm on the weekends. So we started walking through the woods up and down the trail.
It was great to see that Singapore has another place for the fitness enthusiasts for training in the natural environment. Loads of oxygen.
We could finish the entire trail in about 1 hour 45 minutes. We stopped over at viewing sites and on the treetop walk for photographs etc.
Be sure to carry water and some fruit like apples if you have very young children along. Wear very light clothing and good shoes. Caps and goggles if one is visiting during the day. On the way are a treat to watch. Especially they are absolutely in their natural environment. There is a mutual respect between the humans and the monkeys which is good to see.
Overall it was a super Saturday evening trek."
,,Awesome on a weekend morning!,5.0,,"Unbelievable that such a lovely trail is there in the middle of Singapore. Great for a nice hike - connected to several other parks. If you're doing the Tree Top Walk, just be prepared for an almost endless set of stairs :-)"
,,Adventure,5.0,,I've been to the mac Ritchie recently and I find it very adventure compare to Henderson wave when I been there .. although I felt very tired even on the half of the trail but it's a good walk for youngsters and I would recommend it to the elderly couples as I'm in a hospitality industry and I always have people visiting Singapore and asking for nice place to go for a walk .. anyway end of the day I think I have lost 3 kg from that walk !
,,Nature walk in the city,5.0,,"If you are up to a 10+km walk, MacRitchie is one of the many excellent offers in Singapor. Good height differences. Not too crowdes. Variating nature."
,,5km walk! well worth it,5.0,,Wear comfortable (preferably waterproof) shoes to his long hike. the tree walk at the end is more than worth the walk!
,,An adventure,4.0,,"This was certainly an adventure and an opportunity to experience a different side of Singapore. 

We asked our taxi driver to drop us off at the Venus Drive car park. It was our intention to walk to the tree top walkway. We started walking and heavens opened, not too bad initially but it then turned into the most intense rain I have ever experienced. 

I had activity shoes on but my wife had sandals. We were clearly unprepared. About half the trails we took were stoned or boardwalks. The rest are dirt trails and they turned to huge mud puddles because of the rain.

There is very little in terms of information (maps, signage etc). The distance signs that do exist, don't seem to give correct information as it seems you walk forever but per the signs you've gone not that far (and vice versa). Weird. 

We were lucky that the rain eased off for a bit while we were at the tree top walkway. Views were impressive but perhaps not worth the effort. There were lots of stairs up and down. 

Our adventure took 3.5 hours. You can't exit the reserve once you've crossed the walkway, instead you have to walk back (taking a different route). My advice is to prepare for bad weather, a long walk and wear appropriate footwear. There is a water fountain at the Ranger station, located about half way between the Venus drive car park and the walkway. Note there is a road that runs adjacent to the footpath to Venus drive but it is private and cannot be walked on. We had to walk to the main road to hail a taxi. 

This is certainly an experience we'll never forget. The views were great but we weren't prepared for the conditions. "
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Wonderful walk into the jungle. Monkeys walking free all over the park. Pretty butterflies and mimoza pudica. Be careful not to get lost in the woods like us and walk accidentally 16km in three hours.
,,Above the Forest Canopy,5.0,,"Amazing views above the forest canopy, complete with macaque monkeys! Wonderful trails around the reservoir. Be prepared for inclines to get reach the Bridge above the trees. Great Workout with forest views."
,,MacRitchie Nature Trail,5.0,,"Try the tree top! Spent almost 3-4 hours inside. You will feel don't want to come out. You may see the monkeys, small animals, small insects. Go there for a fresh breathing. Let's go!"
,,One of Singapore's best nature trails!,5.0,,"This is one of my favorite nature trails in Singapore. It's long and accessible via a few points but I prefer to go from the Macritchie car park, walking the trail all the way to the tree top walk. Dress comfortably - the terrain is rocky at some points and goes up and down a fair bit though very gradual."
,,Good trail in January but bad visitor advising.,4.0,,very nice place but I did not appreciate at all that the counterclockwise loop was closed withaout any advice or warning before hat made us go back t the incoming trail. It is a bit rude to close trails without informing the visitors!
,,Great trail with some wonderful fauna to view,5.0,,"This trail took about 6 hours at a leisurely pace. Butterflies literally flew at your feet, dragonflies flew about and monkeys would at times walk towards you. Beware those that want to steal your food! The walk wasn't too challenging but the tree top walk was a little disappointing. Too short but seeing 2 monkeys clean each other's bottom was amusing to watch. If you want to avoid doubling back start the trail at the MacRitchie Reservoir entrance otherwise you'll have to walk past the Tree top exit and walk another 500m to get to the entrance as it is only one way."
,,"humid at the best of times, but well worth it",5.0,,"my wife and I decided to walk the MacRitchie Nature Trail towards Bukit Timah, a distance of almost 10km. we started from Venus Drive Carpark, and made our way towards the Tree Top walk. from then on, it was a relatively easy walk towards Bukit Timah. one thing that we thought was strange were the distance markers, as we swore the distances actually increased the further we walked TOWARDS Bukit Timah. nonetheless, a good walk and work out! make sure you bring your own water, and some food along for fuel purposes. also, do not hand carry plastic bags there as the monkeys that are native to the area have associated plastic bags with food. it also goes without saying that you don't feed any of the wildlife you encounter!"
,,Watch out for the monkeys!!!,5.0,,"A nice bushwalk highlighted by the 'tree top' section where you are literally on a bridge at canopy height. Great views. Watch out for the monkeys though, they take your food like a pickpocket!"
,,Fun walk in nature,4.0,,This is a great hike in Singapore's forests. It takes about 2..3 hours and can be quite hot though there is plenty of shade. Also reckon you'll not walking on flat terrain the whole time. The suspension bridge is cool.
,,Focus,5.0,,"It was my first time in the place, and I didn't exactly know where to start. Good thing there are lot of maps in the place. Be sure to have the proper shoes because there are rocky places and surely slippery and muddy after the rain. It was a very nice place to concentrate, jog or just walk, make sure to bring water and if ever you bring foods beware of the monkeys, they might grab some along the way, and most of all bring or apply a mosquito repellent, there are some bite on my legs even If I am wearing some, so I recommend to buy the lotion one. And lastly the trail is almost 4 to 4.5 brisk walk , if your fast at least 2 hours + + jog and if plainly walking or sight seeing at least morning is the best because it's not yet hot in some areas.

That's it enjoy!!"
,,"Very humid but wonderful green escape, and there are monkeys!",5.0,,"The water areas in this park increase the humidity beyond what you will already be experiencing in Singapore. However, if you have your walking shoes and a bottle of water, this is a great walking area. We were lucky enough to see a monkey with her baby and the most extraordinarily large millipede."
,,Good in parts,5.0,,Realaxing experience walking the trail. When we visited it was quite humid so I recommend you take lots of water with you.
,,Amazing trekking ever!,4.0,,"Me and my bf start trekking from MacRitchie Reservoir Park and then headed along to MacRitchie Nature Trail then passing along the Tree Top Walk. After that, we went to Venus Car Park and back. The trekking was awesome for both of us although it was tiresome we enjoyed so much.
We would like to suggest to bring hat, sunscreen, water and some snacks as it is a walking trail. Wearing cotton dress and short pants would be advantage as it is sweating a lot when walking. Walking with group will be also good.
Please take care of the moneys. According to my experience, please don't make eye contact with monkeys. If not, they will go after you. My bf just make eye contact with one of the monkeys, he started to follow my bf and he also tried to open my bf's backpack and pulled out the things in his backpack. So, just be careful.
Whatever, we enjoyed the tree top walk!!!!!!"
,,Hot but pleasant walk,4.0,,Not used to walking in 30+ degrees but MacRitchie is a beautiful park with an enormous lake and a sky walkway with canopy views. Take water!
,,Good for a long stroll or run,4.0,,Based on the reviews thought I'd be seeing monkey's but although it's free to enter the mrt is a distance away so you need to get a taxi. Lots of routes to go walking so wear proper attire. This place is used by lots of locals for exercise and the lake in the middle is used by lots of youngsters doing sailing. The smallest trail is 3km per way so it should take no longer than 2hours to complete back and fourth. The bridge is around 4km from the start but its closed on mondays. You could spend a lot longer here and I would return here for running when I return to Singapore.
,,Experience Singapore in its natural state,5.0,,"The 12km trail around MacRitchie Reservoir (or 14km if including Tree Top Walk) is a good way to experience the sights and sounds of a tropical rainforest. A good starting point is the Mushroom Cafe at the southeastern corner of MacRitchie Reservoir, which is easily accessible by bus or car and has toilets, showers and lockers (for small items only). Remember to fill up water bottles and bring enough food to last for the whole trail, but make sure to hide them from wild monkeys. Also apply insect repellent before starting the trail. (Spraying of repellent along the trail can affect native animals and is therefore not encouraged.)

The trail itself is relatively easy to walk, with very gentle gradients and well-marked signposts. However, the trail can be flooded and very muddy especially after a rain. Wear waterproof shoes, or be prepared for wet socks. Also be careful of passing runners who may run onto puddles and splash mud onto everyone around them. (The trail is popular with runners on weekends. Hence, to keep your feet dry, the best time to visit is on a weekday with no rain for the past 2 days.) The trail is well shaded most of the time, except for a portion where the trail skirts along the perimeter of Island Country Club, where there is no shade. There are narrow paths, staircases, and uneven grounds, so don't bring anything with wheels (e.g. prams, bicycles, wheelchairs). If you need a break, the toilet at the start of Tree Top Walk (no running water when I visited), and the Jelutong Tower are good resting points."
,,Really are in a jungle,5.0,,"After reading reviews about trips here with people seeing no nature we were a bit hesitant, but after the 14km trek we saw a whole abundance of animals including:

3 monitor lizards (one at least 2m long)
A whole host of monkeys in the trees and also on the canopy bridge
Hummingbirds
Birds of paradise
Lots of butterfly's
Small gecko's/lizards everywhere
Chickens (of course)
Green tree snake
Turtle
Fish
Pair of white-bellied sea eagles
And probably most impressive of all a 2 metre long snake which turned out to be a Malaysian blue coral, which the woman in front of us almost stepped on as it was going across the path.

All in all a great few hours out but bring lots of water and watch where you walk!"
,,Unbelievable Awesomeness!!!!,5.0,,Anyone who has hopped across different malls in Singapore will be pleasantly surprised to visit MacRitchie Nature Trail. Remember to carry bottles of water and a towel to avoid dehydration due to walking through the trail. Great place for a family outing!!!
,,Huge nature park,4.0,,Good place to visit if you're looking for a long hike! You can see monkeys here roaming free and swimming in the lake too. Keep your belongings close as they will try to steal anything left on the floor!!!
,,Wonderful Adventure,5.0,,Everything about this nature trail is exquisite. The bridge is breathtaking and the monkeys are adorable. Just be careful with your stuff because they will take it!
,,10km walk with the occasional monkey,5.0,,"I started at the visitor centre (where the teriyaki chicken is delicious by the way) and took the yellow track to the tree tops bridge. Got to see some monkeys along the way including some baby ones playing in the water. After the bridge I followed the red path past the golf course to complete a loop of the reservoir. Being an outdoorsy person, this walk was the highlight of my trip to Singapore. It took about 2 hours 45 mins to complete the loop and I was walking at a brisk pace."
,,Venus Road to Tree Top loop,5.0,,"Excellent activity out of the busy city. Wild monkeys, and crazy suspension bridge. Great for exercise. Recommend taking drink bottle and towel. There are toilets and water for drinking. You will finish the track drenched in sweat. About 7km. Ran the first section and walked the rest, approx 1.5hr."
,,Gorgeously Beautiful,5.0,,"Gorgeously beautiful. Enchanting forest walks. Would be even more wonderful when it's quieter with fewer people...and only the sounds and sights of nature and her wonders. Definitely my best day in Singapore. Hiking is one of the activities i truly enjoy doing solo, as it allows me to just absorb.. and BE."
,,Nature trails and tree top walk,5.0,,"It's a great place for family walk and bonding. The route to the tree top walk is long but worth it. Even though the route leading up to it is quite a challenging slope, the view on top of the tree top walk is fantastic and one will not regrets even after the long and tiring walk. Must go and experience it. The whole route is cooling and shady."
,,Get back to Nature,5.0,,Have a great time with friends and family as one walks the entire trail that could take between 2 to 5 hours!
,,Nature Everywhere,4.0,,"Wonderful place to see different plants and animals, including monkeys. Just be careful where you're walking because snakes have been spotted here. The treetop walk has a stunning view of the forest."
,,Great way to see the forest,5.0,,"Go get some exercise by enjoying a nice 7 km or longer walk in the woods. You will sweat of you push the pace and expect some stairs and some mud due to construction.

DON'T stare at the monkeys. They will take a swipe at you!"
,,Nice walk. Was looking for exotic animals. Saw a squirrel.,4.0,,"It was nice but short. I was hoping to find some sort of exotic animal or see an interesting bird. We only saw squirrels.
Good for kids. Lots of warning signs. Not sure it they are just to give you the feel that you are in a jungle."
,,Great Hike,5.0,,"A nice change of pace from the business of Singapore. Great views, great hike love the place. I will definitely go back to jog or hike here on a regular basis."
,,Delightful and easy nature walk,5.0,,"The park offers an easy hike - the trail is clearly marked out so getting lost is unlikely, and the tree-top walk is really nice. There are info plaques all along the bridge and the breeze from above the trees is lovely!"
,,HIKE and ENJOY!,5.0,,Really lovely! We enjoyed the suspension bridge very much. And the welcomed site of monkeys everywhere!
,,jungle in singapore,5.0,,"great area to experience a walk or run outside of building forest. Monkeys, bats, squirrels, butterflies and other animals can easily been spotted. Very relax and quiet area. you can reach tree top walk which is quite nice place too. favorite place of Singapore"
,,"Easy hike. Easy to spot monkeys, birds and fishes.",5.0,,"Someone here ends up bloated as one of us simply cannot refrain from laughing while hiking!
Good job, juniors. We completed 25,000 steps this morning. Trekking trails up and down the slopes and weaving our way through the vegetation, and we managed to get up-close to the crowns of the trees."
,,Awesome for Singapore,4.0,,"Great walk & a relieve in this concrete jungle. but dont bother if you're a serious hiker as its nothing mesmerizing, unless 1. you need to score with your date, 2. you're curious, 3. you just want to complete a bucket list.."
,,Fantastic Hiking In Nature,5.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir is an excellent place to get away from it all and hike around nature. The scenery is beautiful and you get to see Singapore's wonderful wildlife, such as monkeys, lizards and snakes (the latter very rare to see!). Ensure to wear proper footwear e.g. hiking boots or trainers, since it's a long trail. Also remember to bring your water bottle with you as it's hot and humid in the jungle. Best to go early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the mid-day sun - try to make it to the HSBC Tree Top Bridge walk. Safe to go alone as lots of signage so you don't get lost."
,,"If you love nature and wildlife, you will be thrilled",5.0,,"we love nature and wild life. we love bird watching. so we came to this trail. you will see so many different topical plants, walk above the tropical canopy, you will see monkeys, different birds, we also saw a huge water monitor (6 feet long as least) swimming and walking up to the beach. really cool. unforgetable."
,,Jungle a million miles from the city,5.0,,"If you want a break from the city, make your way to McRitchie (via regular buses or taxi easy from city centre) You can have a short stroll or opt for a long 9k hike so pack sensibly either way - bring plenty of water and some refreshments (engergy bars good idea) but pack them safely or the monkeys will get them! THere is a ranger station half way around to top up water bottles and take a rest break. Most of the trails are covered with high trees so they provide lovely shade from the hot sun. although for those sensative to plus 30 degrees heat, I would recommend either getting there early morning or later on after 4pm to avoid the hottest part of the day. But once in the jungle you are transported to a beautiful world that is a thankful and welcome respite from the hussle bussle of the city. Access to the green areas / jungle areas of Singapore are one of the principal joys of living in / or visiting this fabulour city state....long may they be preserved....."
,,Nature so close to town,5.0,,We walked an abbreviated section of the walk one morning and were amazed at how many animals we saw even though there were lots of people on the trail. Beautiful foliage and all of this with in minutes of downtown Singapore.
,,Great walk in the nature,5.0,,"Great reservoir, great views, sounds and sensations. The trail is correctly preserved, clean, clearly signed and confortable to walk, flat trail, maybe hard part with the stairs before the bridge, but recommended to do."
,,"Nature Lover, Must Visit!",5.0,,"Great place to walk, jog, chit-chat, etc. Set in the nature reserve area, it is fiercely protected by those who loves nature in Singapore, where any suggestion of re-development is opposed strongly, thus kept its true beauty. Don't miss the ""Tree Top Walk"", walking through a short bridge over the canopy of tropical rain forest, sure to amaze!"
,,Had a very good walk on the MacRitchie,5.0,,"Loved this trail, we saw monkeys, enjoyed the suspension bridge very much. It was a great place to walk through and enjoy the rainforest."
,,Also part of the MacRitchie Reservoir,5.0,,"There are many trails around the MacRitchie Reservoir - one will bring you to the Tree Top Bridge. It is a very lush and green experience, best done on weekdays since there are no crowds. Remember to bring water since it will be a very hot hike through the rainforest and around the lake."
,,Exhuasting but Exciting and Excellent Experience in Nature Reserve,5.0,,"It is one of the exhausting but exciting nature trail in the MacRitchie Reservoir and the Tree-Top Walk was very awesome experience and one can practically see the whole MacRitchie Reservoir at one view.
The greenery experience is one that can never forget.
You can choose to go a shorter nature trail (around 2.5km) or longer trail (around 6.8km).
The smell of the MacRitchie Nature Trail is one that you will never find this experience if you are only lives in Singapore. Its raw but greenery tea leaves- like smell is absolutely remarkable."
,,Get close with Nature,5.0,,"I will come back here whenever I am in Singapore. The walk here or your journey within the nature trail can both de-stress you physically and mentally. The trail will take you closer to nature. The walk itself going to the HSBC bridge will take more than an hour but I can guarantee you that every step inside is worth it. Not because it has a lot of breath taking views or rafari-like experience but once you're inside, you will forget the heat when you are in the city. Just a little reminder that there are lots of monkeys inside so better put your food inside your bag, dont feed them and they might take loose things like your sunglass so dont put it anywhere unattended. Oh, and dont show your teeth to monkeys also as its a sign of aggression."
,,Amazing walk,5.0,,"Really enjoyable walk. You could go as a group, family or even solo. So much to take in with the sights and scene. One of my highlights when visiting Singapore."
,,Mother nature and a trek,4.0,,"If you're looking for a nature trail and trek that ends in a treetop bridge with some great views, this is the place for you! It's something outside of what you would usually expect in Singapore. Of course, it is a bit of a trek. But still, no admission fee, and it's just a nice stroll in nature."
,,Get your serenity here.,5.0,,"This is the place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore hectic and stressful lifestyle. Very well signposted, you will not get lost, if you do there are many people around to ask for directions. There are also many side trails you can explore, one of them take you all the way to Bukit Timah Hill. Bring lots of water."
,,Well maintained,4.0,,"The trails were well taken care of. There were a couple steep sections and a couple that had some water damage.
It was all very well signed! There are a couple different loops and lengths of trails.
If you're capable of doing this hike, it's worth it!
If you hear something in the trees it's probably monkeys or monitor lizards."
,,Surprising oasis of nature,4.0,,"A fairly strenuous hike to get here, especially on a typically hot day. Worth it for the contrast with the rest of Singapore - you really feel like you're in a vast nature preserve. Careful of the monkeys - not so charming and they smell bad."
,,A little piece of paradise,5.0,,"I hit the trail every time I'm back in Singapore and it never fails to astound me with its sheer beauty! The reserve is my little piece of paradise as I pound away on the trail to beat jetlag, burn off all the delicious home cooking here in Singapore and/or reclaim me time in hectic Singapore. Love it."
,,Amazing views and authentic nature,5.0,,"Walked the 7km loop from Venus drive to the tree top walkway. It was graded moderate/hard and not without good reason. Worth it for the views, total immersion in the jungle and for glimpses of wildlife like monkeys, lizards and squirrels, all of which I saw on a busy Saturday afternoon.

The walk is definitely worth it, some advice:
- take plenty of water and maybe some nuts to replace salts, you're gonna sweat
- take a small towel to mop your sweat
- don't take a plastic carrier bag, but instead a backpack or bag with strap, as monkeys can grab your carrier bag
- plan on a shower after at your hotel or the airport

If you want to recover after the walk there is a good mall 5 minutes walk away from Venus Drive. The country club is close but I've read they're not very welcoming to hikers. Not checked myself though.

Happy hiking."
,,Great place to hike,4.0,,"Small piece of nature in the city. Good for walking and/or hiking, there is also possibility to rent kayak.
I thought it will take whole day, but we made all track with four hours. You can fine some monkeys, lizzards and snakes, monkeys were not agressive. Great view from the treee top bridge."
,,"Variety of terrain, great views and...monkeys!",4.0,,"MacRitchie is my fav hike in Singapore because of its proximity to water, the slight incline and the monkeys. Please do not feed them, nor should you stop and linger too long while taking pics, lest they decide you have something on your person that would look really great back on their little trophy stand at home. Can get muddy, but very quiet and few people during/after a rain. Weekends are a traffic jam."
,,Enjoying nature...a non-typical Singaporean experience.,4.0,,"Singapore is well-known for its urban development. Fortunately, the MacRitchie Reservoir has been preserved for Singaporeans to be able to enjoy a ""back-to-nature"" recreation for both athletes and non-athletes.

Before planning visit to the trail on a weekend, you may want to make sure there are no special events being held there (ie such as a marathon) on on the day of your intended visit."
,,Escape the built environment,5.0,,"MacRitchie Nature Trail is one of my favourite Singapore haunts. We used to live in a condo backing onto the trail, so had our own entrance. Best to avoid Saturday or Sunday mornings unless you love being trampled by joggers; at any other time you have a good chance of seeing large monitor lizards, lots of skinks, squirrels and turtles. Be aware that the macaque monkeys are a nuisance and likely to grab bags that look like they might contain food. Walk past quickly and carry an umbrella is best. But mostly MacRtichie is peace, quiet and trees going about their business. The walk right around the reservoir is great, but make sure you carry plenty of water, especially if you live outside tropics normally. HSBC walkway is good, but only if you can avoid parties of noisy people."
,,"Awesome trail, just prepare for a long trek!",5.0,,"This trail is beautiful. Just be prepared that you have to walk far. I would plan it as a day trip as you're gonna be tired after. Also if you're in Singapore for just a few days I would visit some other locations first, but if you have a longer stay then this is definitely worth a visit! The treetop walk was fun and I saw a bunch of monkeys"
,,Nature - Serenity & Calm,4.0,,"In the midst of a busy Singapore concrete jungle, the serenity and calm of the nature reserve is indeed very refreshing. The serenity of the green canopy and the sound of dripping water is a balm to the soul."
,,Awesome nature hike!,5.0,,"Awesome hike! Took about two hours to do one of the trails, including the Tree Top Walk. Bring your camera, we saw lots of great wildlife...loads of monkeys, monitor lizard, gecko, squirrels, and a garden snake hiding in the bushes. Recommend to bring water as it gets a bit hot (but no food if possible, as the monkey's may steal it!). There are public restrooms available at one point in the hike, which are well kept for a public and outdoor place!"
,,A piece of wilderness in the City Centre,4.0,,A large walking trail close to the city. Go early and take plenty of water with you. It can be quite hot and humid in Singapore. Some boardwalk and the rest is just trails. Make sure you wear good walking shoes. A great way to spend the morning in the serenity of the wilderness so close to the city.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,If you are looking to go out and watch nature this is the place. Long route and very quiet. Watch out for monkeys though
,,Dawn runs the best!,5.0,,"Love this place. Very, very special at early dawn as the day is breaking. The moment you come round and out of the thick jungle and are hit by the sight of the mist rising across the vast perfectly still, mirror-like reservoir surrounded by the thick jungle backdrop of epic proportions Wow."
,,Beautiful hike!,5.0,,"Did this with a few friends on a hot day which is challenging, but it's such a beautiful and lush area and the suspended bridge is cool to cross"
,,i enjoy nature,4.0,,"i went there to see the monkey in their natural inhabitant , didn't see the lizards though as the bridge walk was closed as it was after 5pm
i seen squirell , roaster , dont smile to the monkeys as showing teeth is agressive gesture to them"
,,Wow bridge,4.0,,THis is definitely a must for any adventure and nature lover coming into Singapore. Unbelievable this is within a bustling city like Singapore
,,Singapore Nature Reserve and Macritchie Trail,5.0,,"Unique experience in a Trail almost on the equator. Trails varying distances. Flora and fauna in serene ""forest""."
,,Exercise in the Jungle,5.0,,"Great place for exercise and animal viewing...Don't go on Mondays as the tree top bridge is closed and don't arrive at the bridge before it opens (at 9). I make weekly jaunts through Macritchie and i have never been disappointed. I always come out exhausted, sweaty and thrilled with having seen some crazy jungle animal whether it was a strange bug, lounging monitor lizard, sleeping flying squirrel, beautiful butterfly or horrid monkey. Insect repellent, water, and comfortable shoes are a must."
,,Attractions of Singapore - MacRitchie Nature Trail,4.0,,"The Long walk trails in MacRitchie Nature trail will help to shed those extra pounds from all the binge drinking and eating in singapore. There is a good spot for drink and food at the end or beginning or trail (depending on where you start the trail) if you crave for a little treat after the long walk.

Careful with any luggage you carry as there are little monkeys out there in the park for a mischevious steal. And if you are lucky you can spot the mini me dragons or giant lizards (depending on how you see them). Forget the dslr cameras, pack light and dress smart for a long walk.

- No Entry fees, Also no baggage lockers so pack light."
,,"Choose your path wisely, for treetop walk go to Southern ridges instead",3.0,,"We were recommended to go there for the treetop walk, but it was disappointing. It is crowded, noisy, very short, and the path leading there is uninspiring. For treetop walks, we recommend going to the Southern ridges instead.
On the other hand, the paths around the MacRitchie reservoir are much nicer, and less crowded. There are many monkeys and squirrels around. The infrastructure at the South side of the reservoir is surprisingly good: there are showers, lockers, and the ""mushroom café"" offers decent food."
,,Great for active travelers!,4.0,,"I enjoyed this hike, but it was longer than expected. The wild monkeys and tree top bridges were well worth it, but it is not for someone who is unfit! There is a bathroom and water fountain at the ranger station, but otherwise it is just nature. Trails are reasonably easy to walk along but terrain is varied and the heat definitely adds to the challenge if you are not accustomed to it. Saw lots of wild monkeys, monitors, and even a skink!"
,,Great workout,4.0,,"Had to climb up and down, great workout for those who want to lose weight. Nice view when you reach the bridge. bring your cameras along! retreat from the busy city life."
,,Another side of Singapore,4.0,,"A view from another side of Singapore. Singapore is vastly known for its developed cities however this actually gives another side of Singapore - that of nature, quite nice however in Singapore's weather also not so great."
,,Long trail,4.0,,The trail was longer than I had expected and my legs were getting a bit tired as I had walked around the botanical garden (awesome) earlier that day. Seeing the wild monkeys come really close made it all worth it though! It is necessary to bring good footwear and plenty of water.
,,Amazing Hike,5.0,,"The hill hike was refreshing, even in 97% humidity. We warmed up on the gym equipment at the start of the hike. We were rewarded with stunning scenery and wildlife, then the beautiful lakes. Obtaining refreshments at the cafe, while enjoying the monkeys."
,,A great place to relax and be one with the nature!,5.0,,"Great place to exercise or to just have a break from the bustling city life! Wild animals such as monkeys, snakes and pangolins can be spotted along the trail."
,,Beautiful walk in nature,5.0,,"The MacRitchie Reservoir Park is Singapore's rain catchment nature reserve and offers many walking trails.
What we like about the trails is that they are natural ground trails, and that being in the nature reserve, the tree canopy provides a good shade so you can even walk for a long time without getting exposed too much to the sun. So you can walk late morning or late evening without feeling exhausted."
,,Love the canopy walk,4.0,,"Did the canopy tree walk in MacRitchie reservoir though I always think of the 2.4km runs we had to do there as kids. One has to walk quite a long distance in order to access the canopy walk, but much of the way was through the forest and therefore shaded. You get to see monkeys everywhere especially near the lake (where you can also rent a canoe) and the bridge in the reservoir brings back memories of Singapore from long ago."
,,Weekend Gateway to Singapore's Oldest Reservoir,4.0,,Great gateway to enjoy reservoir with nature reserves. Trillions drops of water are crystal clear but lake appears green because green planktons (info from description board). Will definitely meet some naughty monkeys at Fitness Corner. Heard this is the first and oldest reservoir in the country.
,,One of the relaxing place you can go with whole family,4.0,,"It is FREE,

It is covered with full of trees and the walk can be done even the hot day.
It is very relaxing and the trail is maintained as easy walk path even for the little ones.

There are many paths and can choose long one or short one.
It can end up some golf course sometimes but it is usually straightforward path.

You can see monkeys and some local lives here.
Many runners and walkers are around with good manners.

Good to go early in the morning."
,,One of our favourite hoilday spots,5.0,,"We took a bus here from the city centre on a whim and are so glad we did, it was a highlight of our trip. We saw many animals and insects including a colugo which was very cute!

Make sure you wear insect repellent otherwise the ants will bite you all over!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"I highly recommend visiting the nature trail. We spent half a day there hiking the trails and admiring nature. We saw lots of animals- monkeys, monitor lizards, skinks, birds, and a snake!

The suspension bridge was amazing! Make sure you don't miss it (unless you're afraid of heights!).

We took the bus here, since the MRT doesn't come out this way. It wasn't too difficult, and one of the main entrances is right next to the bus stop.

The hike is a mix of dirt trail and boardwalk, so definitely wear closed toe walking shoes.

Beware- they are not kidding when they say to avoid eating near the monkeys. We hadn't seen any monkeys for about half an hour, so my husband pulled out an apple. Within 10 seconds, a whole troop of monkeys came running through the forest and blocked us on both sides on the pathway. They wouldn't give up until they had stolen the apple!"
,,Nature... nature... and nature,5.0,,"It was a tiring walk but worth it! I had a very quiet hike with the cicadas sound in the background, naughty monkeys everywhere and butterflies! I enjoyed the MacRitchie Nature trail more than the Tree Top walk. They also have kayaking activities (which I haven't tried). Its a huge place and took me 4 hours (including few stops to snap pictures) - starting from the MacRitchie Nature trail to the Tree Top then to Jelutong Tower. After Jelutong tower, instead of taking another 4 to 5 km walk via the MacRitchie Nature Trail to reach Bus stop ""A"" Ive decided to exit in the ""Venus"" parking lot for it would only take me half the distance and time to reach bus stop ""B"". Its an exhilirating experience and would recommend to people who love to walk with nature!"
,,Forrest walk,5.0,,We planned a day away from the shops with a little exercise thrown in. The walk was alone a gravel pathway and wooden walkway for a small section near the tree top bridge. Very clean and pristine. We saw heaps of monkeys around the bridge. Take some insect repellent.
,,Green and glowing cool,4.0,,Great place for walk and little trek. Nice to see this kind of place in singapore...as most of the places are in the centre of the city and not free from noise. If you are a nature lover...you will like it.
,,Don't go unprepared.,5.0,,"Didn't do much research, went in thinking i would go for a relaxing 5km walk.... ended up walking the whole round trip (approximately 10km). The air under the tree canopy is quite cooling and refreshing however just make sure you go prepared if you want to do the whole thing!"
,,One of kind,5.0,,"Reservoir, trails and treetop walk was a good get away from the city adventure. Love how the park is well kept and preserved with great trails to walk or jog on. Scenery is awesome also."
,,Nice walk though the city forest,3.0,,"Weather was on our side so enjoyed every step. Didn't realise its so accessible until we hopped on to the bus. Don't know why we took three year to reach here.

Do not expect wildlife, just trees, bushes and lots of soothing breeze, if you are lucky. Did not go for kayaking but I will go there again just for kayak experience."
,,relaxing walk in the jungle in the city,4.0,,this was a welcome walk in the park. Lots of interesting trees and features including walking in the walkway on the treetops.
,,Soothing,5.0,,"Very soothing weather, excellent for jogging & having natural touch in your trip. Location is also very near to city center."
,,Mid morning walk,4.0,,"Excellent mid morning walk up to the bridge. Would advise everyone to wear comfortable walking shoes with decent grips, 1 or 2 bottles of water, there is a small F&B outlet but limited offerings. The bridge is about 7km from the car park we used, there are several car parks, would also advise to take a small umbrella just in case you get caught in a rain shower, if this happens the talk can become rather muddy and slippy. The bridge usually has last entrance at 4.45 and closes at 5pm timings may vary so please check. The bridge also stops admissions during thunderstorms. You will also come across the moneys that are living in the trees."
,,Drink water and be prepared - monkeys are a bonus,5.0,,Great signposting and maps along route Multiple route options Water / drinks dispensers around Good logistics - bus / taxi MRT etc Monkeys can get aggressive so be cautious Easy walk through forest and around water
,,A good exercise stroll,4.0,,"Went on a stroll at the TreeTop walk trail with the dad. Appreciate that the paths were well marked and literally requires minimal guidance.

Do note though, at first I thought entering by the Venus Drive carpark would allow us access to the shorter green and purple trail. But no, that's the other entrance. My 60-year old dad and I took the 7km orange trail instead. :)

Perhaps the National Parks board could consider changing the colour of the green trail, can't really expect visitors to spot it since majority of the background is green in colour isn't it?

Nonetheless, it's a worthwhile stroll in the park (literally)."
,,Lots to see,4.0,,"The famous monkeys were all around us as we arrived. Fun to watch, especially the mums carrying their babies but hold tight to your bags. We followed the path to the treetop walk. Quite a trek through jungle like forest. Interesting to see how the terrain must have looked before the development of Singapore. The rope walk closes quite early so we had to rush up the last 100m but fortunately we just made it. It was well worth it, great views and glimpses of local wildlife. You need a good head for heights! The route down involved a lot of steps....quite hard work!
A great place to spend a whole day, enjoying the canoeing, a picnic maybe and great walks. Good cafe facilities too."
,,Amazing in the Morning - Beware of Re-Routing,4.0,,"I have enjoyed morning jogs around MacRitchie for a couple of years now. The trails, reservoir, tree-top walk and tower are all enjoyable. The scenery is gorgeous and sometimes there are even MONKIES (and other animals) to be seen!

The best time of the day to visit is early in the morning before it becomes too hot and humid outside. The trails do have shade and help to block out the sun.

On my most recent trip, a major detour resulted in my husband and I getting very lost. If possible, find the new route before heading out for the tree top walk.

The golf course has blocked off the path and signs now direct people to take the Lornie exit, which is very confusing.

Other then that, the other times have been successful and enjoyable.

Don't forget to bring water :)"
,,Aborted run,4.0,,"Tried to get round the reservoir for a run, but part of the track was under repair. Would have been good to know this before I ran a few kms. Otherwise makes a nice change from shopping centres!"
,,Good place for exercise,4.0,,It is very big. You may choose the route. There is shorter and longer roué. There is a tree top bridge which is very interesting. Manage your time as there is one time I started late and end up stuck on the forest in dark.
,,An interesting 11k walk,5.0,,"My son,who is in the Singapore Army and pretty fitness conscious,noticing my ever increasing girth,persuaded me to accompany him on this walk. We accessed the trail from Macritchie reservoir park,which is about 10 mins drive from Orchard Rd in a taxi and well known by all drivers. It is a very diverse walk, stretches of open area alongside a golf course and also areas of semi forest. The flora a fauna is also interesting and you can see monkeys in the trees,terrapins in the water of the reservoir as well as loads of fish and the large odd lizard crossing your path. There are a few rest stops to fill up your water bottle case need(highly advised to take water with you) and the trail is certainly up hill and down dale. I would say you would have to be only moderately fit to partake. I am over 60(with paunch) and managed it with no problems. A very interesting walk overall but do be careful as the terrain can prove quite uneven. Weekends can prove pretty popular,so if you looking for a quiet stroll,try a weekday."
,,MacRitchie Nature Trail,4.0,,Wonderful place to go to for a walk. Very scenic and relaxing. Can be very cooling in the evening. Suitable for families.
,,A must do,5.0,,"First of all, it's FREE, second, it's very convenient as there are buses that will take you there. An amazing place to visit if you love nature. Make sure you bring a bottle of water (which you can refill for free in some places) and bring some snacks too (I didn't find any shop). The tree top bridge is just amazing, even more amazing when you get welcomed by a monkey. I was told not to smile in front of them, as they see this as a threat, and not to have any food outside the rucksack (they will steal it from you)"
,,Peaceful forest hike,5.0,,"A wonderful trek through the forest encountering lots of animals. Great for couples, family or for a serene solo walk. Highly recommend!"
,,Stairway to Serenity in a Busy City,5.0,,"I was in Singapore on a layover from a recent trip to India and rather than sit at the airport I thought I would go for an adventure in Singapore.
So glad I did , I did a little research and MacRichie nature trail reviewed well so I set out. I caught a train to the nearest station and walked around 4 km to get to the car park nearby.
I didn't cover the whole trail but I did get to see the treetops walk it was spectacular, it's well above the treetops, so not for people afraid of heights and it's also a decent accent to the top of the hill so not for the lazy adventurer but I'm neither so I loved it. I saw monkeys, squirrels and plenty of birds. Its nice to be just wandering on a forrest trail when 4 km down the road your back in the hustle and bustle of the city. There is definitely a lot of effort been put into maintaining such a cool park ,it's a real credit to the local government for having this free attraction. Definitely worth the effort to see this one."
,,Very peaceful hike or walk,5.0,,Enjoyed nature and tranquil setting if you have an hour or more to explore.we encountered monkeys and monitor and birds and turtle in a short walk
,,Great trail for the weekend walk,4.0,,"We walk the tree walk trail often and have had lots of wilderness encounters as a result of walking quietly. We have seen Ribbon Snakes that leap from tree to tree, Green Tree Snakes, Pigs, Lizards, beautiful pigeons, the habitual monkeys, fish in the creeks, etc...
We recently discovered that we are not allowed to park up the Country Club road anymore near the water tank reservoir which used to cut a fair bit off the walk for our young kids. You now can only park at the Venus Drive entrance which is currently getting a make over so can be difficult to get a park t the peak times.
In the near future a boardwalk will be completed linking the two regions of the carpark and the access to the info centre.
I suggest that you be careful of the monkeys. Don't confront them in this area as they are very bold and sometime attack visitors on the bridge to get food from the backpacks. This happened recently to people we were walking with. Secure your glasses and food wrappers as they will go for anything including water bottles sticking out of backpacks as you walk by.
Go in the morning early to avoid crowds and see more wildlife. Water bottles can be filled at the info centre."
,,Forest walk,5.0,,"If you're sick of tourist ares such as Orchard or City Hall, you may probably write this forest walk into your travel agenda.

This is a nature view of tropic forest. Travelers will see monkey somewhere. This place may request sports wear and comfortable shoes. Local people come here to do morning or evening exercise normally.

Travelers MÄY combine Bukit Timah hill, tree top walk and macritchie nature walk into 1 day visit, provided you must have enough energy.

The 24-hour coffee shop in opposite of Bukit Timah shopping center is great. You will enjoy native Prata there. A great exercise route for locals as well."
,,Nice outdoor Singapore s nature!,4.0,,"Only through local friends I was able to know this amazing piece of nature in Singapore ,,very nice for walking, hiking or mountain biking,known by the locals but not at all by tourist! Perfect getaway to enjoy locals nature, monkeys, birds etc,,"
,,Easy or strenuous,5.0,,My Son and his Wife are both very enthusiastic walkers and I cannot keep up with them so walked the boardwalk skirting the reservoir it is about 2.5k each way or you can walk on way and then find a path to take you back it was raining when I went (but still 28 degrees) I saw plenty of birds butterflies and a monkey on the board walk but as I had been advised to not have any food with me we just ignored each other. It was so peaceful just to wander and look.There are lots of different trails from easy to Long and difficult so something for everyone and well worth a visit. It is easy to get to by bus.
,,Forest within a city,4.0,,Doesn't feel like you're in the middle of a metropolitan city. Wonderfully preserved with lots of monkeys!
,,Excellent walk,5.0,,Excellent walk ! The paths are well maintained and easy to navigate. It was not to warm as the paths are well shaded. Do wear good walking shoes and bring enough drinking water.
,,Birdwatcher's Paradise,5.0,,Went birdwatching with my friend who is Singapore-based. The trail was a bit busy with early morning joggers. Enjoyed the hike and got me some photos of birds.
,,Safe and Enjoyable walk Trail,4.0,,"Me and friend decided to try walking MacRitchie Nature Trail and the main goal is the Bridge as we saw the picture shared online which is so pretty! I initially thought that it will be very hot but surprisingly, It was not that hot as the nature shades almost the whole trail! The road is a llittle bumpy but not dangerous. You can even see a lot of people jogging. Safe for young kids too! The view from the bridge is amazing. One of the scene you cant find in other parts of Singapore:)"
,,"Loved the nature walk, right in the middle of the city!",5.0,,"We were in Singapore with our 5 yr old so wanted to do a small trek. Started the trail from Venus car park, went all the way to treetop walk. After the treetop, we went to the Jelutong tower and then walked back to the Venus car park area. The total trek was around 8km and we finished it leisurely in around 3 hours. The view from suspended bridge and jelulong tower was worth all the effort. And fresh air was added advantage! Carry enough water and keep the bottle inside your bag. There is a water dispenser/ toilet at the ranger station; which is still a good walk from the venus car park. There are monkeys looking to snatch bottles/ plastic.

Check out the trails before you plan to do the trek. There are various entry points and some can be long for non-trekkers.

Venus car park can be reached by bus from Little India. The bus stop is around a km walk from the car park though. We went by taxi to keep ourselves fresh for trek,but came back by bus. Early mornings are better; treetop walk closes by 4:30pm and it can get extremely hot in the afternoon."
,,away from hustle bustle,4.0,,To my surprise can not expect such a place existed in Singapore . Follow the tree top for a good long walk ..Many different species encountered too
,,excellent walk - good 3 hours though,5.0,,very nice walk and loads of nature to view. try early morning as it can be quite hot. the whole route is not open until April but still worth the trek
,,Unique patch of green & water with an unhurried ambience!,5.0,,Amazing patches of green next to a water reservoir with a jogging track to boot! It's amazing how Singapore has managed to create many such 'spaces' serving as 'virtual lungs' to an otherwise upward bound office & residential concrete jungle!! Great place to go either with family and kids for long cycling rides & frisbee/boomerang play or for a decent jogging workout to refresh you a lot.
,,Loved it !,5.0,,"This is the other side of Singapore, that some tourists don't get to see - but it is just as amazing and beautiful as the modern Singapore.
We took the taxi to the nature trail from the Singapore Botanical Gardens - it is a good plan to do both the same day of you can.
We were unsure we were going to see any monkeys that day, but there they were, tens and tens of them, hanging out on the trail, next to people jogging, in the trees above you and in the bushes next to you. It was amazing to see these beautiful little creatures in their natural habitat, not behind a cage.
We could have spend hours just looking at them interacting.
Be aware not to stare at them directly in their eyes, and NEVER feed then, or have food with you. If you leave them alone and follow these rules, they will just ignore you and go about their monkeying around.
The day we went on the trail was excruciatingly hot, so we did not get to the bridge, but one day we will go back."
,,Love the Canopy Walk,5.0,,It's a pretty good walk from the car park to the canopy walk but it's enjoyable on a nice day. The views are lovely and there's a monkey or two to keep you going.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Great breath of fresh air from hustle and bustle. Tree top views are worth walk. If you are pushed for time you could start at the Venus Drive carpark. This would halve the walking time I'd say. Drink bottle is a must.
,,Great place for nature walks,4.0,,"I have been here twice in the last year, absolutely loved it! Nice place to lose yourself in the trails. Beware of the monkeys though! If you are a nature lover, and good at spotting various species and plants, this is one of the best nature trails in Singapore."
,,Great Escape from the City,5.0,,"MacRitchie Park is a great way to get an experience of the Singaporean rainforest and escape the city for a few hours. It's very hot and humid (as anywhere in Singapore) so bring along plenty of water as there isn't a lot of places to refill. We started at the Venus Carpark and ended up doing a 7km loop track to the treetop walk and back. We had a fantastic time! The rainforest is beautiful and we saw so much flora and fauna (monkeys, squirrels, monitors and even a green tree snake). The path has interesting little signs with information about different plants and animals you may see around. Be careful of the monkeys - they've very cute but looking at them in the eye and crowding them can cause them to get scared and we had one bare it's teeth at us along the boardwalk."
,,Singapore has nature offerings,4.0,,Many tourists and foreigners staying in singapore don't seem to know that the country actually has quite a number of nature offerings. Macritchie nature trail is one of these offerings.
,,Great workout while on vacation,5.0,,"MacRitchie is a peaceful and a relatively easy trail yet still challenging enough to give you a fairly decent workout while on vacation. Going up isn't all that bad - you meet lots of people along the way, it's still relatively cool at about 9:30-10am and you're still very energized to reach the top. Reaching the top was amazing - there we saw monkeys, crossed the steel bridge and it was just breathtaking to be walking above the trees. Going down proved to be more challenging for me as i had run out of water by that time and was getting really hungry. It took us almost two hours to finish the trail for a relaxed walk/ trek both going up and back down."
,,amazing hike and run route,5.0,,For outdoor lovers a must if you visit Singapore. well maintained tracks in the jungle and lake. especially early morning when it's not too hot yet the best time.Unfortunately you can't do the lake loop in the moment because of rework on the golf course which has to be crossed.
,,probably the safest place on the planet to see wild monkeys !,5.0,,"The trail is not that challenging and is absolutely littered with macaques, water monitor, squirrel and if your vigilant enough you can spot some of the more unloved animals ( snakes and spiders ). Love the signage around telling people not to feed the monkeys but it didn't seem to stop some idiots doing so."
,,Surprising Gem,5.0,,We had a lovely time in a very natural environment walking around the reserve. Surprisingly we saw wild crocodiles (very large) andlovely little salamanders (mud skippers) and lots of things inbetween.
,,Tree Top Walk ! Suspension Bridge !,5.0,,"Monkeys everywhere! Once again...this is a hot hike. Bring lots of water. I put in over 4.5 miles (I'm from USA so I think in miles) I Ubered in, so I could hike out ""anywhere"" to get a ride back to hotel. I was dropped off at the end of the road at the water treatment plant up past the the Luna Park Lot, past the golf course, where the road ends at the water treatment facility. A guard gate with posted signs for do not enter and signage to get you headed to TreeWalk. This saved proably 2 miles of walking if you start from Luna. I did walk from the plant to Luna on the way back because I didn't think an Uber would come in to get me...probably would though if you tried and called to discuss your pick up point, but I wanted the walk. Part of the loop is closed, so after the one way suspension bridge loop is done, you'll have to go back to your start point. Also, a hike to the 6 story tower is worth it. I had a delicious lunch of Bee Cheng Hiang sliced pork jerky atop this tower (look it up...one location for the jerky is at Raffles City Mall) made this a 5+ day. The stairs were difficult on the way down, so you do need to be fairly fit. I did see two 60 plus ladies do it without a problem though. I'm sure they did a lot of walking, as they were equipped for it. My knee is still hurting from this walk (and all the walking I did on this 10 day trip) 1 week later. One tip...other than lots of water, is a pair of gloves. It's not completely necessary, but it would have been nice to slide a hand down the wood rails to help you down all the stairs. One pair can share."
,,Other side of singapore...,5.0,,"When you think singapore only for shopping and modern city then you never come to this place. This place totally worth it to visit. You never imagine the modern city like singapore have a place like macritchie reservoir. There are a lot of peoples jogging every morning, athletes practice kano in a lake... its so green and natural. The must visit is top tree bridge... but you must walk around 7km from the enterance... and you need to go back again so total you need to walk around 14km... but trust me you wont get tired... because you will see monkey and other animals during your journey. Enjoy the other side of singapore..."
,,Definitely worth it!,5.0,,I did the trail while in Singapore this week. It's really worth it to do the trail. The earlier the better! The canopy provides shade throughout however so you don't get too hot and the trail is popular with the locals who use it for their daily runs or walks. There are monkey families that you'll encounter as well so keep food out of sight and proceed normally so as not to bother them - you are after all in their habitat! The Treetop walk is also very cool!
,,Excellent Nature Walk,5.0,,This is free for all to enjoy. This place is away from the city and has nice walking trail as well as a tree TOP walk too. Suitable for kids as well and there's eateries on site. Esp. Nearer to the entrance.
,,Nice hike trail,5.0,,Nice hike trail with friends on a weekend. A stop over point with resting areas and toilets in the centre. Also good direction signages
,,Great walk with some great scenary,3.0,,This is not an easy walk for those not used to the climate or exercise. It is a good walk however and not to difficult to get to from the city centre. Pack plenty of water and plan to start as early as possible to avoid the heat and humidity.
,,Nature,5.0,,It is one of the rare places to enjoy nature walks in Singapore. You truly feel isolated from the big city and enjoy the nature.
,,A great way to spend a Sunday,5.0,,I love the tree top walk through MacRitchie Reservoir - I did the walk again yesterday and though tiresome its a great way to spend a Sunday. A leisurely pace will take 3 plus hours and once you have finished treat yourself to a curry puff and chicken stew at Mushrooms cafe. Seriously this cafe serves food way above expectations.
,,Be prepared,4.0,,It's hot and the trail is longer than you think. Set aside 3-4 hours for a slow go around and get really close to nature. 2 hours or less are for the brisk walkers and runners. Try not to be too annoyed at the loud people and those who can't walk without blasting music. Bring water and a charged GPS phone.
,,A green paradise in the city,5.0,,"If you have at least 2 hours to explore such lush green area just a few miles from the city, then you should really visit McRitchie. You will see monitor lizards sunning on the grass, take a lovely walk in vast greenery with the lake on one side. I usually take my bike so I get to cover wider space. It's so wonderful to 'get lost' in the foresty bit. Try the Tree Top Walk."
,,Not for tourists attraction - But great day activity for locals,4.0,,We took the hiking route...a bit tiring...but we wanted to hike to enjoy the nature trail. It's unbelievable to find such a place in a city like Singapore full of high rises!
,,Nature wslk,5.0,,This walk is noted for having the highest suspension bridge in Singapore The walk is moderate with lots of animals along the way. Especially the monkeys
,,Nature trail,4.0,,"If you wanna have a good sweat and a leisure nature trail with friends or family try this macritchie nature trail. There are various Long and short trail going around the Golf course and lake .
We did ours for about almost 2 hrs heading towards the Tree Tops , bare it in mind you can't turn back when u head there , it's only one way so coming back to your point of start is going to be a big round .

The tree tops is about 250m Long , a hanging bridge extended between two highest point , it can get swaying when it's windy coz it's about 7storey high :)

Things to bring : a must ; water bottle , small towel and maybe pack a nice sandwich to sit and relax ."
,,There's nothing like a jungle run!,5.0,,My husband and I visited Macritchie three times in four days during a trip to Singapore. What a splendid trail. Loved the smell of the jungle especially after a downpour. It's remarkable that such a place exists in a shiny city like Singapore. Must be treasured and preserved!
,,Nature Lover,4.0,,"i went here in a sunday morning and started trekking around 10am. it was just a bus away from my place took #167 bus and arrived after 20 mins. the boardwalk around the entire jungle trail is simply amazing gives you comfy while walking. some people do yoga and some are doing all their exercises. inside the forest was very peaceful and all you can hear are the sound of cicada, birds and monkeys. luckily i didnt encounter any snakes but it i had so much fun walking and sightseeing all over the place. i met my new friends from new york john, theo and thad who made my day and gave me more fun while walking. i enjoyed the treetop walk and the entire trail is 10km. it took me almost 4 hrs to finish the trail but thats because i am with two kids thad and theo trying to motivate them too to finish the whole trail (which they did! tough guys). there were ranger stations where you can have a break and get your water bottles refilled. There's even a place to do water boating. and lastly you may want to have a bit of refreshment at the mushroom cafe. Overall the place is awesome especially for athletic guys and those who love nature. Try it and you'll have fun."
,,"Wonderful, amazing and beautiful place!",5.0,,"While living in Singapore, we visited MacRitchie multiple times. Each visit was wonderful and different. There are several trails to take, from short to long, easy to hard. Bring lots of water though as there is no place to fill up unless you take the long walk all the way up to the tree top walk. There are places to take a break under a pavilion, so snacks are good too, just don't leave your trash behind. There are monkeys but they are generally very shy as long as you don't provoke them. A Must to do in Singapore if you need a break from all the noise, crowds and malls."
,,Great walking and running courses,4.0,,"There are great and beautiful place.
There are many trails for walking and running.
It takes about 2 hours by running for 10km and 2 hours by walking for 4km.
You could see monkeys and wild plants like a jungle.

호수가 정말 크고 예쁘네요~
가는 곳마다 물 색깔이 다르기도 하고, 커다란 물고기도 관찰할 수 있어요.
입구에 짐 보관하는 곳이 있어서 가볍게 마실물과 핸드폰 만 들고 가시면 좋아요~
손에 먹을게 있으면 원숭이가 다가와서 위협할 수도 있으니 가급적 안가져가는게 좋다구 허네요~

모두 길이 그늘로 되어있어서 햇빛에 노출될 걱정이 없어서 좋아요~
다만, 숲속이다 보니 모기나 곤충 습격을 피하기 위해서 모기 퇴치제 레펠런트 같은 스티커나 스프레이 뿌리고 가시면 좋을것 같아요~
제가 오전에 비온뒤 갔을 때는 모기같은건 보이지 않았어서 생각보다 좋았어요~

즐거운 여행으로 추억 가득 담아가셔요~ ^.~"
,,splendid view and a good workout,4.0,,to get to the tree top it was quite a climb. a lot of steps up and down. but this is a really unique experience to have in urbanized Singapore. view was great. be careful of monkeys though.
,,Nice trekking place in Singapore,4.0,,"We had a great day trekking here. Aside from hectic city area Singapore, MacRitchie is place for us to immerse to the nature. The trail is not so long so it is suitable for people with little exercise."
,,Great alternative activity in Singapore,5.0,,"Spent an afternoon doing the full circuit of the reservoir and trail.

After Orchard Road and Marina Bay this is a great time out to do something different.

We had a leisurely stroll of about 11 km in 3.5 hours. Most of the track is level but there are some sections near the tree top walk which involve a climb.

We counted 51 monkeys, various lizards, birds etc.

It was very quiet for the middle of Singapore, little traffic noise.

Only comment is make sure you bring plenty of water as there is none on the walk (which I found a bit surprising)."
,,A stunning rainforest walk,5.0,,"Take a taxi to 'Venus drive car park' and walk the 9km to the main park entrance, from there you can get a bus or taxi home. The walk is stunning, with cable suspension bridge, lookout tower and huge lake. Look out for whip snakes and monitor lizards.
It's best to take this walk on early as it's a good walk, most people will be up to it but you need a basic level of fitness. You should not try this without water bottles, a snack and a hat. You won't get bitten by insects if you keep walking. Bring a camera and enjoy, it's stunning."
,,great for a jog,5.0,,"The trails are nicely shaded so one can go at any time of the day , its very peaceful and the scenery is really beautiful"
,,Not really exciting,2.0,,"The nature trail is not bad for Singapore standards as it is the only one and thankfully some of the jungle was maintained. But if you compare this to any other nature trail in the surrounding countries this is poor. You walk on a perfecly maintained pathway, you can hear the planes and cars at times and a big part is next to a golf course. It is a nice getaway from town, but that is all"
,,"Run, trek, walk",5.0,,"Best place in Singapore to run, especially for one who loves running in trails. The treetop walk is also a highly popular place for families and couples especially."
,,Great place to enjoy nature,4.0,,"This is a good place to enjoy fresh air and nature. Do watch out for macaques, which can be quite aggressive. Do not leave food exposed, avoid eye contact and do have an umbrella or walking stick handy, in case you have to deal with an unpleasant situation."
,,A good green workout,5.0,,"The trail is well maintained and there are good facilities (toilets, water station, footpaths) and signages along the trail.

To note that the trail is very busy especially on Saturday mornings when the school kids do their training so the paths get a bit crowded.

There is also a connector trail to the Bukit Timah nature reserve."
,,Quick nature fix,5.0,,"This place is great for a quick nature fix! It's a short ride and walk with MRT from the city to an oases of green, quietness and beautiful trails. Went for a run around the reservoir; it's about 10-12km of dirt tracks, boardwalks and some pavement with little up&down. Pretty well covered from the sun by all the trees. The monkey can be pretty aggressive (to each other). A must for a trail-runner!"
,,A Must-Do in Singapore,5.0,,"MacRitchie Nature Trail is an amazing thing you really should do while in Singapore. You escape the busy city and head into jungle , walking under rainforest trees and beside a blue shining water reservoir. The tree top walk will give you the possibility to see the rainforest from above, which is a great experience! Bring enough water !(refill is possible at ranger stations)"
,,Pokemons,5.0,,"yes there classed as wildlife there somehow, there are about 40 of the poky stops, we did a massive walk 30,000 footsteps, My fiancee and I were looking at the wildlife and found it a wonderful day, my 15 year old son was looking at his phone and found the day even better!"
,,Large area to walk in natural surroundings,4.0,,We had a good long walk along the jungle trail and-more enjoyably-on the boardwalk along the waterside. There are 2 2 km boardwalks there and its a really nice walk. The jungle trail is on a rough terrain-just have to be a but careful when you walk early morning-it can be dark.
,,Great for a long jog!,5.0,,"Visited here with a girlfriend for a run / jog and to see some monkeys (apparently they can often be spotted here!)
The great thing about this place is that there are several routes to run / jog or walk ranging from under 5k to around 11-12k and all are well signposted.
The trails / footpaths are all well maintained although can be quite steep and certainly not suitable for disabled / wheelchair users.
It was great to see so many people enjoying this place, just keeping fit & enjoying being outside.
We jogged & walked our way around & also took in the walkway over the valley which is where we spotted the monkey! (Another great photo opportunity)
By the time we returned to the car having covered just over 11k we were dripping wet due to the humidity & exercise.
Loved this attraction me will return!"
,,Hiking Paradise,5.0,,"Forest in the City. This reservoir is the oldest in Singapore (Source: Wikipedia). A huge forest has flourished surrounding the reservoir.

The longest trail is 14KM long, and worth the walk. The tree-top hanging bridge is once in a life-time experience.

Take this walk and enjoy a day of divinity with nature."
,,Great for jogging and enjoying nature,4.0,,Went with family members and jogged around the whole trail. Very eco-friendly and quite easy to walk around.
,,Great place to spend the day,5.0,,"I had a free afternoon in a quick visit to Singapore and this reserve was fantastic. A great place to wander and enjoy the nature in Singapore. Clean, well taken care of trails and stunning views along the way. I never made it to the suspension bridge, but I will next time. The little monkeys are cute too!"
,,Oasis in the city,5.0,,"Not far from the city, but it really does feel quite isolated and almost wild. You do, of course, encounter plenty of other walkers but it is not so crowded that you feel surrounded or anything. What you might feel surrounded by are monkey as there are plenty of them, particularly on the tree top walk bridge, but also near the restaurant way over on the other side of the reservoir. I haven't seen any snakes yet, but I bet they are in there somewhere too!"
,,Great way to mix in some outdoors into your trip,5.0,,"We weren't quite sure where the starting point was and simply told the taxi driver we wanted to get to the treetop walk which led to some confusion. Turns out we needed to direct him to the MacRitchie Reservoir Carpark. Very easy to get to from where we were staying in Novena. We realised afterwards we could have caught a bus to get to the carpark.

From there it was a nice walk that was clearly signposted. No drinking stations along the way so make sure to pack a bottle of water. We saw people running the track so if you're up for that, you wouldn't be alone. Mostly quite a wide nature track. We took our time walking and enjoying the scenery. We started early before it got too hot (not sure it would've gotten much hotter), but either way we had some light showers to keep us cool. Definitely recommend it to get away from all the high rises."
,,Trekking. Monkeys. Monitor Lizards.,5.0,,"Trail winds around the lake and then through the hilly jungle before going through boardwalk and swamp.

Somewhere along the way you might find the OCBC Treetop Walk which is worth the climb to get to. It closes early, check the time.

The full hike with Treetop Walk is maybe 13-14km, so nothing that you would accidentally do, you need to plan it a little.

There is water at the ranger station.

Don't feed the monkeys and don't set down your bags or packs: they'll steal everything looking for food."
,,Beautiful and Untouched,5.0,,"I used to run through here regulary when I lived in Singapore, it is magical, try to visit early morning before 10am or late evening after 4pm to avoid the heat. Make sure you take your walking shoes and watch out for the monkeys in the trees, they swing past, but DO NOT FEED them!"
,,Monkeys everywhere,5.0,,What a great walk. The Treetop experience is worth the walk and the whole trail is ever changing. We saw so many monkeys and there were a lot of babies. So cute. It is a well looked after walk as far as maintenance. Lovely scenery and great exercise too.
,,Excellent getaway from the city,5.0,,"This is one of the few nature trails in Singapore, and if you're up for hiking and nature, or if you just want to get away from the city, you should definitely visit MacRitchie. It's a short walk from Caldecott MRT station and it is about 11.1km walk. I think it's extremely relaxing just to walk the trail as you get to enjoy nature. There's also a treetop walk that is open from Tues to Sunday. I'm not sure what time it opens but it closes at 5pm, so try to go before then. It is family friendly, and there are activities like kayaking that you can do apart from hiking. Definitely worth a visit with your friends or families or solo."
,,a pleasant break from the city bustle,4.0,,"A party of 4 of us visited the MacRitchie reservoir. It's easy to get to by bus. Do take lots of water. After studying the map on the wall at the café, we decided to do the 11 km walk around the reservoir in a clockwise direction with a walk up to the high point as a side trip. This was a mistake as, when we reached the turn off for the high point, we found there's a 'one way' portion meaning you have to cover some of the main track twice... Had we gone in an anti-clockwise direction, we would have saved a few km's. While the walk was pleasant, we didn't see much wildlife. That was not until we got back to the café where a family of monkeys were giving the staff a hard time pinching food from tables."
,,Id give it 6 stars if I could,5.0,,"What an asset to Singapore, lovely clean park with a treetop walk and no rubbish at all. Amazing park compared to rest of south east asian parks. Great place for a walk or run, very safe and many users. Can go 10k or more if you want"
,,Great for family / friends with a few hours in the evening or morning,5.0,,There are numerous websites in Singapore showing maps of the trails (such as National Parks website). The trails are well marked and singapore is really too small to get very lost. About 15 minutes walk and you will almost forget you are in suburban Singapore. Trails range from 5 to 15 km .. circuits or one way.
,,"Nice walk, very crowded, hard to get there by public transport",4.0,,"Caught the MRT from Clarke Quay to Caldecott and expected to get a cab from there, but there were none around, so I called Uber who turned up very quickly.

Started the walk and it was very pleasant being out of the city. Saw some monkeys as I made my way to the Treetop Walk. There was a massive queue - it was a Saturday, about mid-morning. I stuck with it and after about an hour, got onto the Treetop Walk. It was fun walking across and the views were pleasant. Other than the Treetop Walk, the rest of the reserve was unremarkable, but good exercise.

I then walked back to the entrance to get a taxi. After waiting a while, one turned up, but was not prepared to take me back to Caldecott station. I guess it was too short a trip for him. So I walked down the main road, spoke to a friendly local, and caught a bus.

It's worth doing if you want a break from the city and feel you have seen everything else you wanted to see. I wouldn't go if I was short of time in Singapore."
,,Singapore's Hanging Garden!,5.0,,"Mention MacRitchie to any Singaporean and the talk will certainly turn to cross-country runs, nature trails and the TreeTop Walk.

Anchored by Singapore’s largest reservoir - part of a water catchment system that captures rain water - the park and nature reserve at the very heart of Singapore is a popular destination for runners, water sports enthusiasts, and of course nature lovers.

If you’ve ever wanted to enjoy the tranquility of walking with your head above the trees, you’ll get your chance at the Treetop Walks, a 250-metre aerial free standing suspension bridge spanning the two highest points within MacRitchie.

Take an exhilarating walk around the 11km nature trail loop known as MacRitchie Trails, located within the tropical rainforest of Central Catchment Nature Reserve. You’ll likely bump into long-tailed macaque monkeys, squirrels and monitor lizards. If you’re lucky, you may even encounter colugos (flying lemurs) or owls!
Avid water sports enthusiasts can try their hand at kayaking and canoeing at the reservoir, as these amenities are available.

MacRitchie Reservoir was constructed in 1867, through a donation of S$13,000 by philanthropist Tan Kim Seng, and is one of the four reservoirs located within the nature reserve. The others include Lower Peirce Reservoir, Upper Peirce Reservoir and Upper Seletar Reservoir.

With so many attractions and scenic spots of nature on offer, MacRitchie is an excellent destination for anyone who loves fun and the outdoors."
,,Perfect for a Morning Walk,4.0,,"Start early and bring mosquito repellant, wear comfortable clothes with runners and bring water! its a nice stroll around the park but beware of which paths you take as you could end up walking a lot further than you intended."
,,Gem in the city,5.0,,Thinking of where to go on a bright sunny offday on a weekend? Make your way down to macritchie resevoir and immense yourself with lush greenery with trails that entails nothing but the clean waters that follows you. From wild monkeys to komodo dragons that will surprise your trek.
,,Gets quite busy on a Sunday morning,3.0,,"Took the opportunity to go hiking along the nature trail this morning as part of a longer hike to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. It's about as good as you get in Singapore, but unfortunately that means it also gets quite busy. Once you get off the main loop though it's not too bad with far fewer people around. Not doubt I'll be back again, but there really aren't so many alternatives."
,,Tree Top Walk,5.0,,"Start early for the Tree Top walk and choose the park entrance closest to the suspended walkway. Wear trainers, and mosquito repellent, take water to keep hydrated. We saw monkeys, birds and had a great time."
,,A great walk.,5.0,,"Many interesting options here; ranging from gentle strolling in the park or along the Nature Trail or along the eastern side by the golf course, canoeing on the reservoir etc.
If you fancy a good long walk follow the Treetop Walk signs which take you past the boat houses. It is all plainly signed.
Be warned this about 13 or 14 kilometres in total if you want to go all the way round. It also includes the fantastic Treetop Suspension Bridge which is awesome and not for those with vertigo. It took me just short of 4 hours and was worth every minute and every drop of perspiration. Loads to see, monkeys, monitor lizards, fish etc.
Take plenty of fluids with you, a camera and binoculars for the views from the bridge, from the top of the Jelutong Tower and coming back along the boardwalks.
Access by car or Bus 157 from Toa Payoh interchange close to MRT or only by car from the Country Club.
Absolutely loved it."
,,Green goodness,5.0,,"Needed my fix of trail running and headed to MacRitchie reservoir for an outing and was really surprised at the serenity, greenery and track condition. Great for a walk, a run and there's even kayaking available. It's mostly flat with a few inclines to keep it interesting, not too technical underfoot either although not smooth. Plenty of toilets and showers and a cafe at the start/end. One water font half way around so bring your own. I didn't get to see any monkeys but they are there. Was pretty busy on Sat morning with plenty of running groups and school groups using the trail which is mostly about 1-2 metres wide. We went for 6am and it was surprisingly cool. I'll def be back to run it again."
,,Good for a walk,4.0,,"You can go around in a circle, hill up, hill down. Good for a workout. Do bring some good shoes as not everywhere it is paved."
,,Did not manage all of it,4.0,,"A lovely area at the reservoir. The gardens and trail are, in Singapore fashion, well kept and attractive. Not many folk there when we visited on a Sunday morning. Nature at its best. Be careful of the monkeys. I felt a tap on my arm and looked down to see one on the bridge trying to get my attention. Look out for small children. We saw a little girl chase a monkey only for it to turn round and chase her."
,,Beautiful Walk,4.0,,"My wife and I walk every weekend and one of our favorites is MacRitchie Nature Trail. It is an easy walk and takes about 1.5 to 2 hours depending on how fast you want to go. There are views over the reservoir, forest views etc. Easy to follow and a rewarding couple hours."
,,Do not bring food,4.0,,"Great walk and interaction with nature. However, PLEASE do not bring food. Monkeys WILL attack and you'll cause inconvenience to others walking behind you."
,,Nice hiking,4.0,,Very nivce trail with some 200m treetop walk. Watch out for all the monkeys along the path and Refrain from feeding them or carrying any plastic bags. A bit difficult to reach and not recommend if you are not staying for at least a week in Singapore
,,Scottish Heritage in the Tropics,5.0,,"James MacRitchie was the Scottish engineer after whom the park and reservoir are named. Around the reservoir are ornamental iron railings, canopies and sluice housings all made in Glasgow. Worth a visit for that alone. The park itself is a haven of tranquillity. Vast tropical trees and creepers house a myriad birds and insects as well as a few troupes of monkeys. It is quite large and people have been known to get lost in here so its best to stick to the several well marked and worn trails. For those who think that Singapore is an urban desert with little nature - please head out to MacRitchie and surprise yourself - its well worth the trip."
,,Like a mini zoo,5.0,,"The place is perfect for a hike, nice greenery and ideal for nature lovers. The first time, it took me about 3 hours to hike from the entrance to the treetop walk and back. The second time, halfway through my journey, it rained and we lost our way and ended up taking the longer route to the exit, but we explored a more interesting route even though it was tiring, took about 4.5hours to get to the exit."
,,Best nature trail in Singapore,5.0,,"My favourite jogging track, for training and for leisure
Undulating 10.5 km full circle trail is very good for marathon training, while the shorter ones and boardwalks are good for walkers
Never gets boring
Have told my family to scatter a bit of my ashes there after i'M DEAD AND GONE!"
,,Great walk if uv got the legs,5.0,,"We've been round MacRitchie around 50 times since moving to SGP and enjoy it every time. Lots of wildlife to see if you're looking and it's a nice break from the busy city life. Make sure you take plenty of water, good walking shoes, mozi spray and a few snacks (just don't eat them anywhere near the monkeys). The skybridge is well worth the short uphill walk for greats views over the two reservoirs."
,,Excellent place for trail running,5.0,,"Best for brisk walking, hiking and trail running. Cool and shady, close to nature, lovely water body peeping through the leaves. God's creation."
,,amazing trail,4.0,,"5 hours walking trail, we could see monkeys and reptils. Missing way outs. You need to walk 5 hours to exit, no way."
,,jungle adventure trail of SG flora/fauna,4.0,,"A friend took me here on an early morning 20km run but it turned into a jog/walk due to the difficulty of the terrain. This trail is not for the faint of heart. Some trail are for MTBers only so give the right of way to them at all times or stay off. I consider myself to be in moderately good physical condition but this really beat me down. If you're going for the first time, it's better to have someone experienced with the trail with you for obvious reasons. Especially visitors unacclimated to the SG climate may overheat or tire easily resulting in getting lost. Bring lots of water, but don't even THINK about feeding the monkeys. Incredible Singapore."
,,Great hike when the weather isn't TOO hot.,5.0,,A nice example of what Singapore looked like before development. Don't bring plastic bags or the monkeys will assault you.
,,Great spot to explore nature of SG,5.0,,"Very nice nature trails in SG. A little busy at times with joggers and other walkers, but the trails are well maintained, there is good variety and the monkeys are friendly."
,,Nice trek in the middle of the city,4.0,,"My brother and I went on this trail but we started at the wrong end, from the McRitchie Reservoir to the Tree Top Walk. Be prepared with lots of water, wear something ultra cool and dri-fit, and a hat. The place needs more signs especially the Tree Top Walk. There needs to be better directions about where to start because apparently it's a one-way trail, so if you start from the wrong end, you have to go around and practically do the trail twice. There should also be distance marks for those who want to decide if they will continue or not. Pleasant walk but may be too much for first timers. Tip for tourists: go super early in the morning, and take a taxi."
,,Nice walk in the tropical forrest,4.0,,"The difficulty is average, no steep incline, but the humidity may wear you down. The tree top walk was ok but I don't think it worths the long walk there. I think the views of the lake along the walk here and there were much better. And beware of the monkeys, they are quite aggressive and they loiter around right at the ranger office and the tree top walk. One monkey tried to take a plastic bag inside my backpack when I opened it to take out my water bottle."
,,A wonderful place to retreat to in the concrete jungle,5.0,,"A place like this is rare in built-up Singapore and precisely why so many flock there. Take a leisurely stroll or long run through the jungle in peace and quiet... If you have time, check out the tree top walk and from there, you can walk all the way to the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. This place is accessible by bus or car."
,,"Experience beautiful nature, not far from the city........",5.0,,"The best time to come here is early morning, when the hot sun is still not up & the air is cool & fresh.

We usually come before 7am. The much appreciated tranquility & beauty of nature can be truly experienced here at your own pace. An experience very worthwhile & very different from the usual attractions.

It's nice to see & enjoy the presence of wildlife so near to you. Spotting an occasional squirrel scampering up the trees or curious animals coming close to you ( monkeys).

But be careful of monkeys. Do not stare, feed nor threaten them in any way- they can get very aggressive if you do.

Best way to come here is by MRT via Circle Line (Yellow). Alight at Caldecott Station. It's about 5-10 mins walk away to MacRitchie."
,,Singapore's best kept secret,5.0,,"We found this attraction by accident on google, so followed the instructions and took the local bus. It took approx 3 hours hard walking but was wonderful to walk through the natural forest with all the wildlife, including monkeys. Beware as they wee on you from the trees when passing under them. They are very inquisitive and will come down to have a look at you. Well worth the effort and is free."
,,An oasis of calm in a busy place,5.0,,"The nature trails around the MacRitchie Reservoir ar e a great place to have a walk in the countryside in Singapore. It's also a good place to see wildlife - I saw lots of Macaques on the MacRitchie trail and more macaques, birds, fish, monitors, skinks and a water monitor around the reservoir.
Googling ""chemperai trail macritchie pdf"" will get you the leaflet for the reservoir showing the trails. I started at Marymount MRT at the Eastern end, and walked the MacRitchie trail to the treetop walk and then back down the West side of the lake and back to Marymount. It was a great morning, but you do need to remember to take lots of water - I didn't have enough, and I was really glad of the water fountains at the Peirce Track."
,,Say Hi to the Keeper of the bridge,5.0,,"Arrive early to enjoy the hike of the tree top tour before it becomes too hot.
Bring a hat, a backpack full of water bottles and sunscreen.
The keeper of the bridge is hilarious. One woman was complaining about monkeys being on the railing of the bridge. His reply ""If you don't like monkeys, stay out of the jungle.""
The monkey will not bother you if you do not bother them. The park is very strict on a no food policy and please do not feed the monkeys."
,,"If you like to meander, this place is for you",5.0,,I've been walking these trails for a couple of years and have never once been bored despite walking the same paths. Get away early from the expansive lawns which are breath-taking but can get busy with people and walk towards the Tree TOP Walk to immerse yourself in unmanicured nature- meaning it's filled with wildlife waiting to peer back at you if you take the time to listen and let your eyes adjust to natural surroundings. So many interesting insects and animals to see. Love this place!
,,Good nature reserve in Singapore,4.0,,This is a good escape from the mad rush of Singapore. Go there early morning over a weekend and enjoy the trees and shrubs and the fresh air. You can do a number of trails.
,,Nice visit on sunny morning,4.0,,Not a bad place to catch pokemon I guess. Still able to breathe fresh air from here. Clean place and convenient to reach by public transport.
,,It's a good place to escape from city life.,5.0,,"The title has explained most of my review for Macritchie but I'll add sth a bit. When I went there, the Google Maps did not tell me the direct ways to get there unless you drive your own car. I went to Flame Tree Road after finding a good blog from Google. After I reached there, I found out there are 2 entrances to the nature trail: through the reservoir and through the Venus Carpark (perhaps there are even more). Venus Carpark is located near the Flame Tree Road (which I searched). I went to Macritchie using public transport; from Commonwealth station then take 855 (actually you may reach there from Bishan or Yishun but I chose Commonwealth cause it's closer to my place). The trail can be a bit bumpy with rocks, slope, tree branches and trunks all over the ground. It is a popular place for running and hiking while surrounded by nature.

It is best if you can get insect repellant, enough water and running shoes. Be aware for monkeys as it may steal your food and items."
,,Easy and convenient trail,3.0,,"If you live in Singapore and you have nothing else to do, why not. I would not call that place a ""Must See"" but the trail is pleasant."
,,A rainforest in the centre of the city!,5.0,,"This is the most remarkable place - it's a huge expanse of rainforest with a treetop walk right in the middle of Singapore. I loved the fact that it's been left in a fairly natural state, not at all manicured. I walked the circuit which took about 3.5 hours with plenty of stops along the way. The path starts out relatively sedately around the reservoir and then you cut up through the rainforest along a track which can be uneven in places. Climbing up stairs, you come to the treetop walk which is a swing bridge high above the trees. The noise of the cicadas and birds is deafening. Monkeys hang out along the wires. There's quite a long set of steps at the far end and then you're back onto the main path which consists of board walks when the trail crosses rivers or follows the contours of the reservoir. Although I'm used to walking long distances, I found this a harder walk than I'd anticipated because of the humidity so I was glad I'd taken plenty of water and was wearing my trainers. I passed plenty of people along the way who were kitted out with rucksacks and hiking gear."
,,Best trail in Singapore,4.0,,"Or so they say. I haven't tried them all but this is pretty decent. For an avid mountaineer and nature lover, I salute the well maintained MacRitchie Nature Trail.

It was a holiday when we went there. The line for the Tree Top walk was pretty long. I'd like to assume it's not that bad on regular days cause the exercise is well worth it.

Just be careful of food grabbing monkeys though."
,,Surprising uncrowded on a Saturday,5.0,,"It's a quick hike. I advise not to go through the gold course, definitely more interesting to stay in the woods."
,,calm and cool,4.0,,"calm and cool and in stark contrast to the hot and bustling city of Singapore, good to stretch your legs"
,,Sport activity? Nature Lover? Try this Nature Trail!!!!,5.0,,"Are you with friend, it will be really fun. Are you with family, slow walking and must enjoy the nature. Clean and nice place for the jogging too. Be aware of the monkey if you have food especially."
,,"Connect with yourself in peace , donot carry food",5.0,,"This was one on the most peaceful activity i did during my trip to singapore . it has a boardwalk of 16km around the reservoir , i walked for an hour and turned back around . very calm and enriching experience , expect to be surrounded by monkeys - they don’t say anything until you provoke them , also please do not carry eatables inside as they will tend to snatch it from you. after the walk you can hire a kayak for 25 SGD / hour and relax in the reservoir . much recommended"
,,Exhausting but great exercise- a must to try,5.0,,A great place to run and walk through with some interesting nature trails and an outstanding TreeTop Walk way. Lots of monkeys and other animals to see and well used by the locals. A very secluded walk and well worth a visit but it can be exhausting so make sure you take plenty to drink and don't get lost like I did.
,,Do not bring food with you.,5.0,,"In the reservoir there are monkeys which will snatch food from you or try to even though everything is safely stored in a backpack. I had an apple with me and it was stored in the bag and I did not take it out. But apparently, the smell was enough for the monkeys to target me. I got attacked by them three times. After that, I sprayed mosquito repellent on the bag. After that they left me alone, but I don't know whether it was just luck or whether the repellent overshadowed the smell.
Apart from that very beautiful walk.
About footwear: I would recommend closed shoes like sneaker or trekking shoes. Hiking boots are not necessary, even for the difficult trails."
,,Nature so close to the concrete jungle,4.0,,"Amazing to have such a massive nature park and walking trail so close to the city. Well worth the walk to the tree top trail. Watch out for the monkeys, they are very clever and know what you have and they want it!! Enjoy"
,,Nature,5.0,,"You will find yourself immersed in nature. The trail are surround by trees, plants and wildlife. If you are lucky you may even spot monkeys."
,,Nature!,4.0,,Just a trail into one of the remaining forests in sg. Good to go for a nice day out to feel mother nature.
,,Quiet time away from the city,4.0,,"Every Sunday that I go here for a walk, you never quite see the same thing. Monkeys, turtles, etc. I love the walk way along the water. Beautiful. It's quieter than the other path where there are many people walking and running and can get congested. Depending on how much you can walk, you have many choices of which path to take. I absolutely love the tree top walk. It's good fun for group of friends or with family."
,,Full Nature,5.0,,"If you are a person that LOVES nature then I would suggest going to Mac Ritchie
Full greenery around
Great views

It was a great journey when I went with my family...
It is a great opportunity for you to take pictures with greenery all around you"
,,Definitely going back,5.0,,"We did the tree top trail at MacRitchie. This is a great time if you like the outdoors, don't mind sweating profusely, and can manage a ton of stairs. You get to see monkeys close up--so be prepared by keeping all of your belongings zipped up in your bag--they will steal anything they can get their hands on and they are actively looking. We were also on the lookout for other animals and saw lizards, frogs, and birds plus super cute baby monkeys. Paths are clearly marked, there are covered resting areas, and the views are great. Only downside was navigating around people because it did get a little busy and there were people who really shouldn't have been there--baby strollers, toddlers, and girls in heels have no business on the tree top trail."
,,Good for photo opportunitities,4.0,,I've been here twice only during afternoon as i'd like to avoid the heat of the sun. There's a food centre inside and there are vending machines that sells drinks scattered through the park. There's also a shower area and drinking fountains and lockers. So this is quite good if you want to jog without the burden of heavy bags and such. It's wonderful watching the water during sunset.
,,Treetop walk,4.0,,Started from MacRitchie and exited from Venus carpark. Total distance was 12km. Was drizzling but still enjoyable. Just take extra care from slipping. Too bad the suspension bridge was a tad too short. Bridge infested with monkeys and they will tuck at your bags ferociously. Just try to keep a safety distance from them. Overall was a good outing and workout
,,natural enough,5.0,,"came alone with little food along with me and only one bottle drinks, without fully studying in advance,even that only one bottle of drink was rubbed by a monkey before I started my activity. so I did not drink one drop of water during the whole day travel.
its a good activity if not considering the water problem(there is none shops to buy anything inside the park, so do please prepare your food and drinks enough, and put them well in your bags not stolen by the moneys.:)"
,,Get close to nature,4.0,,"The trail has points that allow hikers to U-Turn back on another parallel route. Mostly Clay, Gravel & Timber Slat Pavements. Textures for surfaces vary greatly and a watchful eye will prevent a nasty sprain. Uneven ground and Wet slippery surfaces are the most problematic, but that is what makes it more 'authentic'. The humidity can weaken the resolve of the uninitiated as breathing can become rather labored. A good pair of shoes, a walking staff, towel, water and a good sense of one's limits will ensure that the experience is a positive one. Do not stray off the path as one can get lost for hours or worse. Keep quiet and enjoy the sounds, smells and sights of the natural fauna and flora as you pass them slowly. It is not the destination but the journey that makes this a worthwhile visit."
,,Stuck in time,4.0,,"If you spend 6-8 hours waking through the forests, you can walk as far as the bukit timah nature reserve! Worth a walk if you have time. In the middle of the reservoir there are the remnants of a Shinto japanese temple built during WWII and destroyed at its end."
,,Wonderful walk away from the hustle of the city,5.0,,It was great to get away from the city for a while and walk the trails. The bridge is great and the trails aren't too crowded. Be sure to take plenty of water and wear sunscreen!
,,Great for a early morning run or a longer hike,5.0,,MacRitchie Nature Trail feels like being hundreds of miles away from the bay city center. The trails takes you through secondary growth rainforest and to the tree top bridge. A longer loop of about 12 kilometres take you around the reservoir. it is a wonderful place for a run or a hike. There are parking facilities and a coffee shop that serves cheap food and refreshing drinks.
,,Beautiful Nature!,4.0,,"I was just having my evening walk in a new neighborhood, without knowing anything about this beautiful place. Not only my stressful thought has gone, but I had a lot of fun enjoying the beautiful view and taking pictures of the macaques too! If you love animals and want to take picture as close as you can, always be alert that these wild animals can always snatch your camera/phone. Most of the time they will ignore you if you just walk pass through them without making too much noises and didn’t bring any food or anything that looked like food. If you walk around the park with food or colorful water bottle, just DON’T! They will try to snatch it from you. If you try to defend your food, more macaques will come. Macaques hunt in a group."
,,Irresistible trail,5.0,,"Have done it three times.Last I did it on July 6th.Have some trouble in the hip joint and was dissuaded not to go for it.But once at Macritchie I forgot the advice and went for it,simply irresistible!"
,,The best hike in Singapore!,5.0,,"I've been to most of the nature parks, hikes and trails in Singapore but this one I believe is the best.

This is the route that I prefer. Hike from the entrance to the treetop walk. Walk up the Jelutong tower to enjoy a bird's eye view of the area and take some good pictures. Next, take the trail to the the Golf Course from Jelutong tower. There's an open area along the way, next to the reservoir, that you can stop at and take more pictures. Then follow the route along the golf course to the boardwalk which will lead you back to the entrance.

The view of the reservoir from the boardwalk is stunning in the evenings."
,,Great trail,5.0,,"Well, got my friends and I lost for an hour or so, but it was really worth when we walked the treetop walk. Recommend for those who wants to kill time quick, it would be a much enjoyable trail for a small group of friends"
,,A walk on the high side,3.0,,"We were recommended to check out the nature trail with tree top walk on our recent visit to singapore. We took a cab to the reservoir and stocked up on drinks and something to eat before setting off on the 11km trail. Half way round would be the tree top walk which we were told was a must. Unfortunately, as it turned out, can honestly say it wasn´t. Massively over rated. Queues were rather long to go across the bridge as they only allow 30 on at a time, so if there is a relatively long line dont bother. Its up high but doesn´t really add much. The monkeys that are around are far more entertaining as they search for food, some being rather bold and actually taking things from peoples back packs.
Overal everythng was pleasant enough walking through the forest/jungle with the wildlife all around and the reseervoir being well looked after with plenty of fish and wildlife.
Be careful when walking or those who are mad enough to run in the humidity the ground under foot is very uneven with lots of bricks and rocks that can turn an ankle so take it easy. If planning to go with small children and are going to use a buggy there are plenty of steps to walk up and down after the tree top walk.
Was a good work out and we did enjoy the walk but it isn´t as good as we were told. So if you have a spare afternoon and want the exercise then its worth it but wouldnt make a huge effort about it."
,,Great way to spend a few days,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the Forrest walk here. It took a few hours and was tough enough but very enjoyable.

We rented kayaks another day, you can't go too far on them but it's a good way to cool off in the afternoon.

Be careful of the monkeys, do not have a plastic bottle out as they will go after you for it."
,,Great board walk around dam,5.0,,"There is a lovely board walk around the dam, thick tropical vegetation on one side. Monkeys ready to pounce on food if carrying any. Large roof covered area with cafe and toilets to seat and eat own lunch or buy near car park. Beautiful green grassed areas. Kayaking on the dam"
,,Tree top walk,3.0,,"Not sure if this is a good time to spend your precious vacation time, unless you come from a country without rain forest and not planning to go for a real rain forest trek in another nearby country (eg - Thailand). You can hardly see any wild life here, except for monkeys.

Also beware of the trekking distance to the ""Tree Top"" walk - a suspension bridge over the forest. Web sites may tell you it's only 2.5km from the Venus Drive parking lot, but it's more like 3.5km. And the bridge is one-way, meaning that to walk back to your car or taxi, it's an additional 1km. So be prepared to trek for 8km or about 2.5 hours."
,,"Beautiful walk, take water not snacks unless you want them stolen my monkeys",4.0,,"Very pretty walk, lots of wildlife. As others suggested, go early in the morning to avoid the heat. Even though it is very protected by trees the humidity is still a killer. I recommend taking water only as you regret carrying too much by the 2km point. Wear a hat. Don't take plastic bags or snacks as the monkeys see/smell them from a mile away. They will jump on your back to get them off you. The longest trail is 14km but there are shorter ones available."
,,Great way to experience tropical forest in the heart of the city,4.0,,"Easily accessible by public transport (MRT about 5 mins walk) this walk through the forest around McRitchie Reservoir gives a flavour of how Singapore was before the modern state was formed. There is an abundance of wildlife....monkeys, monitor lizards, exotic birds, turtles....and the tracks are well laid and easy to follow. A particular highlight is the treetop bridge. There is a cafe but make sure to take drinks with you and use lots of insect repellant."
,,Beware of Monkeys,4.0,,"We went on a walk on the MacRitchie Nature Trail, which took about 2.5 hours up and down. Do be wary of monkeys around you, especially if you have food. They have a tendency to snatch stuff and things from you, or will try their luck by tugging onto your bag. There is a water point and toilet when you are nearing the treetop walk."
,,Nice and beautiful place to visit for natural lover,4.0,,"It a nice place for natural lover to visit this place. Full of green and fresh air, recommend to go in the early morning to avoid hot sun."
,,Good place for exploring nature,5.0,,"Went with a friend as part of the training for my full marathon this year. The trail to the Tree Top Walk is good as it is all covered under the shade so you won't have to worry about the Sun. Some part is quite slippery, so maybe is our shoes is not entirely suitable though. Overall it is an easy path just long distance (11km) to jog. Nice!"
,,Nice and pleasant walk in the nature,5.0,,"Went there with my father, the walk is not too complicate but do not forget to bring some water! Minimum walk is 4 or 5kg from what I remember. Enjoy!"
,,Good training ground for hikers,4.0,,"I tend to go there almost weekly when I was training for my climb in Mt kinabalu, Borneo.
It is indeed one challenging trail, which requires you to endure a lot!
However, despite the humid weather and insects, the view around there is scenic! What's more, it is a place where you feel as if you are lost in a rainforest somewhere other than singapore!"
,,Good place.,5.0,,"MacRitchie is amazing place. Past two years i am visiting almost every saturday. Its a calm and good place away from city. Car parking is available. If you walk aLong thevreservoir, it takes few hrs to complete. Many people doing jogging in weekends."
,,For a good walk,4.0,,"A pretty long trail but a interesteing family activity. However, pathways are overly crowded with visitors."
,,High among the trees !,5.0,,As a disabled visitor not everything is accessible. The treetop paths are utterly fabulous and the views superb. So lovely to be above everything and still able to see
,,Beautiful Park,4.0,,"MacRitchie is lovely. I have been there a number of times and, especially in Urban Singapore, it is a nice place to get away from the hustle and bustle. There is a Japanese shrine in the jungle for those looking for a slightly more adventurous escapade and it is rumored that a Japanese general hid a fortune in gold somewhere within the jungle."
,,Family Walk during a weekend,5.0,,"I didn't realised Singapore did have such a splendid place to visit. The natural is remained untouch, many people jog at this place. The kids get to feel the beauty of forest and yet not much of dangerous animal around.

A good place for bird watching too."
,,A pleasant find i,5.0,,My husband and I didn't know too much about the nature trail before we took on the walk to the Tree Top and we should have taken more snacks and water. That said it is a beautiful walk and we really enjoyed the experience of having such a natural park so close to the busy city. There were different elements to the place with a boardwalk and the tree top bridge. It took us about 5 hrs to complete the walk at a good pace while stopping to take in the sights.
,,Good place for morning walk,5.0,,Beautiful walk to nature .Its a good place to vivist early morning to enjoy the nature and beautiful view of singapore
,,Must do in Singapore. Best green space!,5.0,,"I enjoyed the Gardens by the Bay, the Botanic Garden and the Southern Ridges and couldn't believe it could get much better than that. But then I went and visited MacRitchie Nature Trail. It was so impressive and picturesque I was a bit overwhelmed. The tree top bridge was a highlight but I also really enjoyed the boardwalk near the water. Saw two water monitors and at least 5 monkeys including a baby one. Would definitely do this again but would recommend going early in the afternoon. The treetop walk closes at 4.45pm I made it only a few minutes before it closed."
,,Really Great place to Hike,5.0,,"Singapore is a beautiful place, although its a massive city. MacRitchie was a great place to get out and see some nature on a nice long hike. Being also so close to the city its an easy choice to take a hike there."
,,Rewarding,5.0,,"I convinced my husband to do this walk with me. Yes, it was really hot, sticky and at times uncomfortable but it was so worth it. You are in Singapore, it's hot and sticky. Love the fact that it is free and so well utilised by locals. We ended up doing the full 12 km loop which took a little over 2 hours. This is not a Sunday stroll, make sure you wear exercise shoes and gear as the terrain goes from timber walkways to rocks to mud to tar - bit of everything. Be on the look out for monkeys, squirrels and big lizards! Take plenty of water with you as there are no drink stations or toilets around the trail. We are no gym junkies, but have an average level of fitness and I regularly walk 10km. You will need an average fitness level to do this. We saw 1 lady who did not appear to undertake any regular exercise and was not appropriately dressed (jeans, basic shoes) in distress and requiring assistance. The trail is suitable for active kids - we saw and heard a lot of whining from old and young.
The tree top walk is worth the hill to get up to it. Absolutely beautiful.
Get there early and be prepared to share the track with others, especially on a Sunday."
,,Great Walk,4.0,,"Did the loop walk including the treetops walk around the reservoir late morning just prior to a storm rolling in.
For those of medium fitness this is a great walk ( 11k's) with stairs, hills etc.
I would promote take plenty of water and if it was undertaken on a sunny day I would
probably double expected water consumption. There is no water filling stations on the walk.
I would not recommend for elderly and or those that are not keen on stairs and or rough ground.
PS take a taxi and know how to call a taxi as the service from the reservoir was poor ( my have been due to rain and busy but I would recommend to plan trip back)."
,,nice place to relax and running,5.0,,I've been there one time to run 12 km and also cross the magnificent tree top bridge.I do appreciate this tiny country that they're still keeping nature and environment.If you are first time visit Singapore only a few days I won't recommend you to this place except you are outdoor activities lover or you love to run in a natural trail which this place will be superb for you !!!
,,Nature and greenery a step away from the city hustle and bustle,5.0,,"Always a joy to walk MacRitchie`s... you can go at your own pace and enjoy the green scenery or go fast. There`s plenty of aspects to walk around and see including Treetop Walk, the Tower for bird viewing or see bird`s eye view of the Nature Reserve, the kayaks on the water and monkeys along different paths. Never get bored going there to walk and it is a good exercise."
,,Worth It!,5.0,,"I recommend taking a bus to Opp Flame Park and entering through the Venus Drive for the shortest hike to the Treetop Walk, but you can't go wrong either way!"
,,"Long, tiring, totally worth it! Beautiful.",5.0,,"Great walk, took us around 3 and a half hours to do the whole circular walk - bring lots of water!! You're 'guranteed' to see monkeys! We also saw a huge turtle, heron and many lizards. The treetop walk is really cool. Tip - start the walk going anti-clockwise as this will bring you to the treetop walk entrance. If you walk clockwise, you have to walk past the exit to the entrance of the bridge to then walk this section of the walk again."
,,Feeling the silence in the nature,5.0,,A great adventure in the middle of the nature to enjoy the silence and tranquility of the environment and a good weather.
,,First-Timer Guide to Macritchie Nature Trail,4.0,,"It's a must place to visit if you're into trekking in Singapore.The signs are reliable to follow.It depends on your fitness level.Fit individual are able to complete it within 3hrs while an average may take up from 4hrs to 5hrs inclusive enjoying the sight seeing and taking pictures.My advice is to do your trekking early in the morning to enjoy the view.Things to bring- Water bottle,Insect repellant and a good trekking shoe and you're good to go.It is not necessary to bring walking stick.DO NOT START at 5pm or later. else you end up having a night trail.Hope this help.Enjoy!"
,,One of the few pieces of nature in Singapore,5.0,,"Despite being in the center of a huge city, this trial gives you the illusion of being in a sort of nature reserve especially for the first part. It's fun to walk up the tree bridge and overlook the canopy. Well worth your time."
,,Nature walk in the midst of concrete jungle,3.0,,"Nice to find a good nature walk in the midst of Singapore city. Quite a hike up, can take 2 hours or more to finish half the trail."
,,A great way to connect with nature,4.0,,"Very easy to navigate, but dont go if there is a thunder storm! We did! the bridge became quite slippery and we were worried about lightning strikes, so had to leave earlier than we planned. It was still a fantastic view and great to connect with nature."
,,Beware of monkeys,4.0,,"My husband and I went for a lovely walk through Macritchie on one of the boardwalk routes. Do not carry bags, juice or food or the foods will go for you."
,,If you miss tracking in Singapore,5.0,,"Better to start it at approx 6 am. Please is really nice and you feel like in the mountains/jungle! Beware of monkeys - any food drinks and they're ready to attack you, So take it with you but look around before opening :))))
Overall, slow walking will take about 4 hours to do the full cycle - walk to the top tree walk and go back!"
,,Group Outing,4.0,,This is a truly great place to check out for a group outing despite some coordination. The nature trails are something that we don't get to see much of anywhere else within the Garden City. Allow yourself time to also enjoy the different fauna along the trails. Have to make time to stop and enjoy and admire and not just walking the trail. Be sure to arm with water bottles to quench your thirst along the trail but look out for monkeys who may be looking for targets.
,,Awesome trek!!!,4.0,,One of the best trail in SG. Almost 6 -10 km . Make sure u take enough water and food . Not good for rainy day. Free of cost. Very good for group trekking.
,,Just a walk......................,3.0,,We decided to get away from the rat race of Singapore city centre and therefore went to MacRitchie Reservoir Trail and Treetop walk. We walk quite a lot and the 10k route wasn't arduous but it wasn't an inspiring or interesting walk other than it was through jungle type fauna as opposed to hill walking / woodland walking in the UK. We didn't see any animals at all and the treetop walk was a short walk over a well constructed suspension bridge. Nice view of the canopy but that was about it. The best bit was getting caught in a torrential downpour for our return from the treetop walk as the trail turned into a fast moving jungle stream ! Worth a look if you like walking and like to sweat a lot while doing it or fancy a different type of 10k run (plenty of people were doing that) but there is not a lot to see.
,,Jungle in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,Great trail walk or run (about 10km) around the loop. Other trails within also. Amazing place and you'll see lots of monkeys and other wildlife. Take plenty of water and good shoes. Excellent for trail runners too as the tracks are wide allowing safe passing of walkers.
,,nature lover,5.0,,"love Macritchie. its best to go very early to avoid the tropical heat. make sure you carry plenty of fluids. choose your trail well. its gets hot, but fun."
,,Great way to get some exercise and see some nature,4.0,,its a hot experience but well worth an afternoon of your time. Pack plenty of water and a small towel as it will get sweaty.
,,It's Free!,5.0,,"Some of the best places in Singapore costs nothing and MacRitchie Nature Trail is one of them. Excellently managed by NParks, this place is a must-go for Singapore tourists!"
,,didnt feel like singapore,5.0,,"went here after a lot of persuasion. my local friends said you'd feel like youre not in singapore and were they right! very peaceful, no buildings, only walkers and nature lovers. highly recommended if you want to get away from the hustle bustle"
,,Hard to find but worth it,5.0,,Boy did I struggle to find this place but to see so much green in a city like Singapore is always fascinating. Well worth it!
,,A TEST OF FAITH,5.0,,"I thought at first I cannot do it. But hey, after the heat inducing canoeing, I finally decided to take the trek. The trek was few kilometers long but I was fortunate to meet fellow Filipinos walking along with me. My spirit and mind came alive and kicking... With the Ranger's Station in site, I felt relieved that finally the TreeTop was just nearby. In the Ranger's Station, you could find toilet and water station; enough to boast your stamina for a little more (push)... Treetop was such a relief that a monkey even greeted me at the entrance. I took a selfie with him knowing that it was uncommon to see one. MacRitchie tested my patience and faith...With final stroke and determination, I finally hurdled myself to a bus; feeling fulfilled that finally I accomplished something... BIG in FAITH in a self-made determination... I'll be back if time allows... MacRitchie is not for light-hearted but for those who have FAITH to make it through!!! MacRitchie Trail... one of the best place to visit in Singapore..."
,,Great walk between the nature,5.0,,"Did the 11km trail from Venus drive to Tree top to the reservoir. Make sure to pack enough water, cap, comfortable shoes, food, etc. It is a beautiful walk and takes close to 3hours to complete. Worth the try. The walk is in between beautiful nature. There are places to sit and rest if you are tired. This walk is not recommended if you have a pram or very young kid. Enjoy walking or jogging. The whole trail has signs around so it's not easy to get lost."
,,Who would have known?!,5.0,,"I wasn't expecting much from the MacRitchie reservoir so I was pleasantly surprised.

First off I couldn't believe such a large green area existed in Singapore and that the surround forest area is in fact rainforest.

The paths are well laid and well signposted so it is super easy to follow the route the whole way around the reservoir - the whole way around was approx. 11km.

There is wildlife to see if you keep an eye out first we saw the Macaque monkeys followed by a few monitor lizards.

Other than the first section most of the route is within the rainforest so there is a lot of shade. There is a ranger station half way around near the tree top walk where there are toilets and a water station.

The treetop walk is a definite must as it gives a completely different perspective. The bridge is pretty wobbly (very safe though) and very high so if you're scared of heights it probably isn't for you! There is a lot of steps on the other end that seem to go on forever - they aren't difficult though and it was cool to have something different.

The final part of our route took us passed the edge of a golfcourse and onto a small boardwalk around the very edge of the reservoir.

It is a great place to check out - just remember to take water and some snacks - enjoy!"
,,Good trail in the city with tree-top-walk,5.0,,"Starting from mushroom cafe and entering to the trail. The park itself is well preserved regardless sitting in Singapore. You will even see monkey running / climbing around. Tree-top-walk reveals amazing from the top.
The trail can be finished in 2.5-4 hours depended on how fast you can do. I always start from early morning, around 6:30AM or 7:00AM and finish around 9:30-10:00AM. Then it will be a good excuse for me to have big brunch :) after big exercise."
,,A Really nice place within city limits,4.0,,"We took a trip out there to see the tree top walk, and within meters of the path we met the first monkeys. (in Denmark this does not happen) there were a lot of animals, the forest was amazing. We would have liked to use more than the 2 hours we did there. Remember water (and to keep if safe from monkeys) and good shoes. You will also find that the paths is used for running.. Go there!"
,,If You Love The Outdoors,4.0,,"It's a good way to get back to nature without leaving the island, and the trail is long enough to spend most of it in relative solitude, should one choose to. The natural cover means there is a lot of shade, and there are water coolers mid-way, at the rangers station, which makes the humidity manageable."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,Fantastic being one with nature. The trail is very well maintained having a few rest stops along the way as it can get hot during the day. The views were amazing as were the monkeys who come right up to you when walking. Seeing them in the wild made it that much better
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I walk around here at least twice a week each time you see something new. One circuit is 11km and takes between 90 and 120 minutes.A good pair of trainers is good enough if its dry and there is plenty of natural cover but don't forget a bit of sun block. The weather is fickle however so you can also get caught in down poor if you attempting a full circuit so pack a light mac or a brolly.
One tip, its allot easier going around anti clockwise as you will miss out a couple of steep hills"
,,jungle in the middle of town,5.0,,"calm and green area, you forget you are in town. you need 3 hours to do the big trail, walking leisurely."
,,Perfect place to take a deep breath^^,5.0,,"MacRitchie Nature Trail is the place that check you health that still strong. You will fall in love at the first time. All area at the front of the park were decorated by many type of plant. It's like refresh your lung at the first step. After you walk along the way you will met a clear water in the fishing area. Water have many shading, wonderful!!!. The recommended place that you should to go is Tree Top Walk. It's not easily to go there and not difficult to you too, if you do your best!!!! Finally you will met a wonderful bridge along a big tree. Enjoy and keep in to be your best memories that you have ever taken the most purity air in Singapore!!!!"
,,A Great Walk,4.0,,This is quite a long walk so make sure you have proper footwear and plenty of water. There are places to re fill and rest on the way round.
,,Unexpected walk in this buzzing city,4.0,,The MacRitchie Reservoir Park is a nature reserve where you can walk or run on trails up to 10-12 km circuits. A small section is a tree top walk. Sundays are quite crowded. Go early! Saturday mornings are less crowded. I am told that weekdays are very quiet! Someone drove me there but finding a car park is hard on Sundays. I assume there are buses.
,,Fantastic nature trail.,4.0,,"Having been to Singapore quite a few times, wanted to do something we had not done and this trail fit the bill. We love a good hike/walk. We ended up doing the round trip about (13 klm I think) including the tree top walk, enjoyed every moment of this trail and being out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Amazing, the size of Singapore and yet they have kept this nature reserve, truly a magical place.
Very popular with the locals and tourists, many runners and be on the look out for monkeys. You can commute by MRT or bus and may have to walk a little bit. Also, bring bottled water, there is only 1 place that you can drink/fill up from. In my opinion, that was the only let down of this place...need more water fountains on this trail."
,,Excellent nature walk,4.0,,"I really enjoyed this walk, with monkeys along the way and other wildlife. The walk its self is approx. 15kms for the full circuit, so can be too much in the hot weather."
,,A long hike worth the effort,5.0,,Surround yourself with rainforest and enjoy the sounds and sights of the tropics. The Treetop bridge in the middle of the trail provides stunning views. Takes three hours minimum.
,,Watch out for the monkey's,3.0,,Nice stroll around the nature trail. Do not drop anything on the ground and the wild monkeys will pick it up and run off with it within seconds!!
,,dzungla w miescie,5.0,,"MacRitchie you can reach easily by public transport, you can do few kilometers walk in nature with lizards and sweet monkeys, including walk in the trees. Must go for it."
,,Nice hike!,5.0,,"This is a really nice hike for those who like hiking. We started from the MacRitchie Reservoir Park and walked to the Tree Top Walk (5.5km each way). The vegetation is so thick that you do not see any signs of being in the city. There are plenty of monkeys along the way and you really have to be careful as they will try to steal bags and food. Keep an eye on the ground as you can spot Monitor Lizards.

This is a moderate hike considering the heat and elevation change to get to the Tree Top Walk. On the way back the kids were pretty tired so we took a short cut and called for a taxi at the golf club which shortened the hike by about 1.5km.

Recommendations:
- Plenty of water
- Sunscreen and repellent
- Hat and sunglasses
- Camera
- Backpack. Do not bring things in a plastic bag. Monkeys are so aggressive they will follow you and keep trying to snatch the bag from your hand."
,,Best Nature trail of Singapore,5.0,,This is a really fun trail and will take you 3-4 hours to finish by walking (too slow) while chitchatting with a friend and 1 1/2 hour by running alone. Beware of the naughty monkeys they like stealing away someones food and they are everywhere. The perfect spot for me is the wooden bench overlooking the lake on the side of the wooden boardwalk. A place worth going to leave all your worries behind.
,,At Peace With Nature,4.0,,"There aren't many natural green pockets of lush growth to behold and enjoy in Singapore. But MacRitchie has been popular since my school days. Lose yourself in the chatter of monkeys, the call of exotic birds and the delightful little sounds of insects. You'll also spot nature lovers exercising at all times of the day. Stroll by the reservoir or explore one of the many trails. Head for TreeTop Walk to rest rest, freshen up or enjoy a bite while nature looks on enviously."
,,Check the weather forecast before you go!,5.0,,"Came here as an alternative to the usual touristy things to do in Singapore. However the Singaporean rain decided to pay a visit two minutes in to our trek - disaster! Before you get to the nature trail, you have a 1 to 2 hour walk through the forest which is a lot harder in the rain. The trail will also be closed temporarily until the rain and thunder stops, so make sure you do check the weather before you go!

The trail is definitely worth the walk, and along the walk back to the start (another hour or so) you might get to see a few roaming monkeys! Set aside half a day to complete this - it is definitely worth it though!"
,,Long walk through true SE Asian rainforst,4.0,,"If you fancy a proper walk outside in Singapore, this is route to follow. The path weaves around the reservoir half through rainforest and half on a plank-trank bordering the water edge. The total loop is 11-12km including the canopy bridge section. We've enjoyed many walks here since moving to Singapore. Make sure to take ample water as the only water fountain is at the ranger station half way round. With that taken care of however just relax and enjoy this unique opportunity to explore a true forest & it's wildlife in the middle of this very developed country, you're bound to spot some monitor lizards and monkeys as you walk around."
,,Relaxing trail,5.0,,"It's worth to spend a morning in such a trail, it took me with 3+ hours in completing the whole 10km trail, luckily I brought enough water or you will find it difficult under such a strong sunshine. Though the name of it is ""nature trail"", the whole trail was built surrounding the resouvier, you will find the trail quite easy. I went on Friday morning so there was few people walking.
Beware the monkey along the tree top walk, I was robbed with my water hanged on my bag."
,,Take your time to walk slowly,4.0,,"The tree top walk entrance was a branch off from the Venus Drive. From the trail start point to the ranger's hut as the suspension bridge was about 3.8km or so in walking distance. The bridge was about 200m in length then down hill boardwalk may be about 30-40m and the ascending boardwalk step began. It was about 700m in distance and may be a challenge for some. After this stretch come the gradual descend towards a split junction whereby it would lead to the tentareng trail (Venus Road Carpark)

The entire walking distance factor the terrain gradient was about 10"
,,nature,5.0,,"it's free of charge, a good escape from the city / shopping malls. there is tree top walk inside the MacRitchie nature trail."
,,Unique experience as we were not fit!,4.0,,"Oh man, where do I start! My friend and I decided to do the tree top walk. Both of us are not fit at all and we did not consider how long it took for us to reach there. We arrived here at 11am on a Monday morning and parked at the parking structure at the Lornie Road entrance.

The start of the trail was scenic and beautiful. But after 3 hours of walking (or should I say crawling?), we were lost and had to find a map. The weather took a turn for the worst and it started drizzling miserably while we passed the golf course. Pressing on, we finally reached the entrance for the tree top walk after a really really intense uphill climb.... only to find out that they CLOSE on MONDAYS. The both of us were so upset but had no one to blame as it is stated clearly on the map that the tree top walk is close every Monday. We couldn't help but started laughing manically and start heading back....only to realize that we could have parked at Venus Drive so that we do not have to walk as much. Heading back to Venus Drive carpark, we took a bus back to the Lornie Road entrance again. Tree top walk mission failed. But we will be back again!"
,,Nice walk through Tropical Rain Forest,5.0,,"We went for the Tree Top walk with two children aged 10 and 6. We took a train to caldecott and a bus from there to the reservoir. But the nearest point to the TreeTop walk would be near the car park of Island club. Unfortunately that is more than 3 kms walk from the bus stop. It would have been really helpful to have a bus stop till Island club car park as it is very difficult to complete the walk and then to take a bus and train and more walk to reach destination. The walk had been a mini trek through the rain forest. After Tree top, it had been a paved walk. The view from the top of canopy is awesome. Must for people who enjoy nature and walk through forest."
,,Only stage three rainforests inside a capital,5.0,,"After you've shopped in Orchard, and spent time wandering through Chinatown and the Skyscrapers of the Central Business District, coming to MacRitchie feels like stepping into another world. Despite it's small size, Singapore has reserved a belt of original rain forest around the central lakes that act as water reservoirs. Out in the reservoir you can still see wild long tailed macaque, all too aware that they're a protected species, playing among old raintrees, if you're lucky you can also spot other residents, like the almost 2 meter long Malayan Water Monitor, the White Bellied Sea Eagle or even wild boars. Only 10 mins taxi from downtown, you still feel you've stepped into another country, or another world."
,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,"I have done this walk a couple of times and have always enjoyed it. Its not too difficult but is about 8-9 miles and can get hot and humid. Look out for monkeys and also the bridge, which if you're scared of heights, can be challenging but well worth doing."
,,Unforgettable Moment,5.0,,"Amazing place very cool and I enjoyed very much with my new friends here in Singapore. I like adventure places, MacRitchie Nature Trail one of the most."
,,Awesome walk,5.0,,"Nice walk trail with cool breeze once you enter the tree sides and even magnificent view when you reach the tree top walk. Bring some water, you can fill it up along the way - definitely a must-visit place in Singapore if you are a walking lover."
,,Fascinating!!!,4.0,,"I went there with my friend on rainny day. It was not that hard to complete the trail (14km? I think) during the light rain but you need to be careful about slippery and snakes. Things you need to be careful are snakes, monkeys(beware of you bag and monkeys biting), dehydration and heat stroke.

Some parts of trail are no singnal nor internet connection so keep some map or a photo of map with you unless walking on the wrong trail.

Prepare yourself and enjoy the nature around you :)"
,,A great and fun way to spend a morning,5.0,,"My wife and daughter spend a fun morning. They hked thru it and came face to face with many monkeys, families of monkeys and beautiful natural scenes. Alot of fun. be careful you are not ambushed by the curious monkeys."
,,Wonderful escape,4.0,,This is a great place to get away from urban Singapore and remind yourself that this is the tropics. The Nature Trail winds it way through the jungle. There are monkeys and lizards along with tons of beautiful plants.
,,Great place to be one with nature,4.0,,"Be careful with the monkeys, they could easily grab anything from you so make sure to hold on to your belongings. Best time to come here is early morning or late afternoon so the weather is not too hot."
,,Astonishing ropical paradise in a world class city,5.0,,"One of the best things about Macritchie is the number of people who enjoy it. I went on a Sunday morning. I must admit that I started late - 9:30 - and the heat was punishing.The beauty of the place and the atmosphere of all the people walking more than made up for my discomfort. People of every type, runners, families, business men, young couples, old people all taking time to appreciate nature. Many of the paths are rough and rustic while others are smooth and easy. Lots of snippets of information about things you can see and things you can't - like the nocturnal animals that live there. There is nothing manicured about the virgin jungle that you walk through however. Trees are only cut if they look like they will fall across paths.I did the canopy walk and went up the Jelutong tower to get a birds eye view. A real highlight of my time in Singapore.One tip - TAKE WATER - there is water provided at ranger stations but you may have to walk kilometres to get it."
,,Unexpectedly good,5.0,,"The trail was much better than expected and apart from the distant noise of traffic you really felt as though you were somewhere very different to Singapore downtown. Very well marked, mostly shaded and a great way to spend a couple of hours.

We took a taxi there and had a little difficulty getting one on the way back from the park, but managed to do so eventually."
,,Check the weather before you go,5.0,,A lovely way to get out of the city and be at one with nature - a couple of mrt journeys from Chinatown - a short walk from the station and you are there - well signposted - its a great way to enjoy a good walk. However if the heavens open - there is no protection - the only plus is that you do dry quickly in the heat - however you can also catch a chill on the wonderful mrt trains where for once you could do without the beautiful - at times air conditioning.
,,Good escape from the city,4.0,,"Beautiful walk along the reservoir and between then trees. Need to expect quite a long hike of at least 10KM for the round trip - was a bit hard for a 6 years old, but fun for older kids.
Better start as early as possible to beat the heat
Many monkeys on the trail, some just grabbed other people's food from them"
,,One of Singapore's best hiking places,4.0,,"It does get very crowded on weekends, but it's still a great place to go hiking. Most of the route is in shade so on a hot day it's still quite manageable (although still very humid of course). Combine with the Tree Tops Walk for added interest."
,,Lots of great walking trails,4.0,,"There are many km's of walking trails in the McRitchie Reserve, including the sky bridge. Make sure you take plenty of water and sun protection."
,,MacRictchie IS AWESOME!,5.0,,"When I came here for the first time, I thought that it wouldn't be really good .
But as I started, I came to realize I was wrong!The scenery is beautiful, complete with calm, turquoise water. There are some monkeys and facts .My family enjoyed spotting animals as well. Hope this review was useful!"
,,A wonderful walk in the nature,5.0,,"Heard about the place from a local friend. I took the whole trial and it was long but worth every minute. The trees, animals (snakes monkeys, lizards), the treetop bridge and the tower were exactly what a nature guy like me would love in Singapore.
It is important to take a lot of water, hat and start early in morning cause during noon time it might be too hot."
,,Hiking Hit!!,5.0,,Great hiking trails. I would rate them moderate to difficult for novices (like us). Bring water and an umbrella of you have one. It would be a good idea to plan time very early in the day for a start as it certainly does heat up quickly. Plenty of beauty in sound and sight. Stop and take a moment to really take it all in. Do NOT forget water you'll definitely need it.
,,Excellent Place to relax,5.0,,"If you like being in nature you will love this place.
I would take my son along for walking along the trails to show him trees, plants, small animals (rodents) and some aquatic life. Living always in a busy city, stressed with work and small living space, this feels like a get-away from all that, and to remind you what needs to be really saved for the next generation."
,,Great Long Hike,4.0,,"The hike on this trail is beautiful. It was great to take a day to get out of the city. There is a tree top hike smack dab in the middle of an 11 k trail.
I had gone into it thinking it would be a quick trip to the treetops, but when I got there the distance said 5.4 to the treetops. Then the treetop trail is about 1.5k. Bring a lot of water because there is nowhere in the middle to refill.
If you plan to get there by MRT the closest is the Caldecott station about 1 k from the station to the trail head.

The trail is an easy path, but I would not suggest it for anything with wheels. Pets supposedly are not allowed on the path, although I did see two."
,,Good escape in the city,4.0,,"A good 14 km walk in city !! We enjoyed the walk by the reservoir. Had a good walk right upto the hsbc walk and then up the obesrvstion tower. Spotted a snake on way back.
One of the bad things observed is people feeding monkeys which tend to make them more aggressive."
,,Enjoy the greenery and fresh air,5.0,,"If you're like me who would rather stroll through the trail and enjoy the greens, be prepared to spend at least 4 hours in total (MacRitchie Reservoir Park > TreeTop Walk > MacRitchie Reservoir Park). Do take into consideration that time is enough for you before the sky turns dark if you are not a morning person.

Bring your waterbottle as you may get to refill it at the resting area near Peirce Track. Toilets available too."
,,Great escape to nature in concrete Singapore,5.0,,"The MacRitchie Nature Trail offers a great escape to nature in concrete Singapore. Inside, it's easy to cast aside one's stress and pressures, and soak in what nature has to offer. Bring water, and go early to ensure there is ample sunlight."
,,"Monkeys, monkeys everywhere!",5.0,,"Loved this trail. It is well kept has amazing signs giving plenty of rich back ground information and most of all it is very pretty. The Treetop trail in particular was stunning.
But, for me as a western European, the monkeys are the main attraction. They are so funny, so pretty and so naughty. I loved every minute of being around the 50 or so monkeys we saw on the trail."
,,Love the Nature and Love MacRitchie Nature Trail,5.0,,"Get bottles of water and enjoy the nature, Don't get lost. Make sure you have ability to enjoy the long walk with the nature. Excellent"
,,Quick Escape from the Concrete Jungle.,5.0,,"You'll feel like your not in Singapore. You'll see a lot of animals here, from snakes, monitor lizards and monkeys. You can do some kayaking as well and running. Very nice weekend nature trip."
,,In the wild heart of Singapore,4.0,,"This is quite a good walk with well maintained tracks and board-walks and a suspension bridge to boot. The only fault I saw was there is only one chance to refill water bottles at the halfway mark, more taps would make this a five star park."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is a great place to go for a longish walk and forget that you are in the middle of a big city.the paths are easy to navigate and full of monkeys! There are lots of smaller paths to explore and fantastic views of the reservoir.
,,Great escape from the city life,4.0,,"Well marked trails, paved path and great escape from the city. It can get very busy so go early if you can. treetop walk generally opens at 8:30am."
,,Great to get away from the bustle - well almost,4.0,,"This is a great place to go for a walk and/or run in my case. It is close to nature for Sg and if lucky you will get to see the monkeys (don't feed). The tracks are fine for almost any footwear, there is water half way around but it is 11km around so do prepare (shorter asks also exist). This is more a place for those living in Sg to visit. it is rural for Sg, but if travelling SE Asia there are far far better places (unless looking for a local off road run)."
,,A Must Visit for Nature Lovers,5.0,,"It is the best place in Singapore. Go early in the morning and trek along a walking trail that suits you. There is a hanging rope bridge, which is also nice. It is unbelievable that such a dense rain forest can exist in the middle of a city. It is very well maintained."
,,A fun outdoor even,4.0,,Mac Ritchie located in the national park on Singapore. It is in the center of SG. It a place to explore the tropical wildlife in the metropolitan city. I was amazed to explore this place. Tips- See the water booth point .Get a mosquito repellent
,,"Nature, Singapore style",4.0,,"This review starts off at the Lornie road carpark at 645 am. Even at this early hour, the carpark was filled with traffic, and it was totally full at the time of departure (930 am). From the carpark, a short eastwards turn brings you up the ramparts of the dam, past the kayaking sheds and into the MacRitchie Trail. To the left, the boardwalk trails (Prunus and Petai) which we didn't try. The MR trail leads (generally uphill) to join the Terentang trail which leads to the TreeTop walk; this section took us about 30 minutes along a generally shaded stony trail. A westward loop along the Sime Track brought us to the Jelutong tower, which we didn't climb this time (saving our energy). The next part of the trail loops southwards part the Singapore Island Country Club, and this environ was much more open (read: hot!), with scrubby forest /reservoir to the left and the manicured greens of the SICC to the right. The southernmost border led into the Jering/Chemperai (boardwalk) and Lornie trails. The boardwalk trails were generally quieter with views across the gently rippling waters of the reservoir, while the Lornie trail was much more undulating, requiring several climbs up and down. The boardwalk walks met with the Lornie trails only once, with the Chemperai boardwalk being the longest stretch. Finally, back to the MacRitchie park with much more manicured gardens to enjoy. The circular trip is around 8-8.5 km, and supposed to take around 4 hours. We managed it in just under 2 hours, but that was a fast-paced endeavour.
Pros: greenery, much variety, nature, exercise and well-marked trails (this is as safe as it gets in the tropics!). Cons: the trails were crowded, even at 7 am in the morning, and spandex-covered joggers were much in abundance. I guess peace and tranquility is in short supply in densely-populated Singapore. The usual caveats apply: bring water, wear appropriate clothing, and be prepared for heat and humidity."
,,Nature in the city!,3.0,,"Feeling like you need a prescription filled by mother nature? Tired of the concrete jungle?

Head over here to see monkeys, birds, butterflies, dragonflies, fish, and more. It's great to see so many locals being active outdoors!

It's not comparable to some of the wildlife that can be had elsewhere in SE Asia, but if you just can't get enough of it and you're stuck in Singapore, check this place out."
,,One of the best hangout for nature lover,5.0,,"I really like MacRitchie a lot. The trail are long but enjoyable. be ready to spend a few hours there. There is no other way out so once you start, the one way is to walk back to where you started, or go all the way to the end. I suggest the latter:)"
,,Amazing Oasis,5.0,,"great place for a relaxing Sunday out. nice trails, mostly shaded thru nature. not to crowded even on a Sunday."
,,Amazing walk through the forest,5.0,,"First of all, its impossible to think such place exists in Singapore. Once you are in you cant even see a single building.

We started from the McRitchie Reservoir. There are information boards all along. A lot of people run here. Its a must visit for any nature lover.

Do take adequate water bottles for there is nothing available once you start walking and get in"
,,Best forest walk,5.0,,"Been there many time, walking just besides the pond, lots of fish, trees, fresh air, joggers, rocky roads, wonderful nature walk for not so intensive exercise."
,,Great 10 km hike incl tree-top walk,5.0,,"Great escape from the city to see a different side of Singapore. Nice tree-top walk in the jungle!

Here are a few tips to make it easier to find your way for a 3.5-4 h and 10 km walk:

* Take any of the busses 132, 163, 165, 166, 167, 855 or 980 (check google map which is easiest for you). Get off at ""Opposite Flame Tree Park"" stop and go down Venus Drive.

* Entry is from the car park in the middle of Venus Drive. At the end of the car park there is a map of the trails on the right hand side (see picture). Follow the signs to Tree Top Walk that are also throughout the hike. Go counterclockwise as recommended as the tree top bridge is one-way.

* It is 3 km to the ranger hut with toilets and water fountains (in case you didn't bring any water). Then another km to the Tree Top Walk with a magnificent view.

* After the tree-top walk is the Pierce trail which is about 2 km of nicely built stairs and wooden pathways. Quite long flight of stairs right after the tree-top bridge meaning it's the most strenuous part.

* After this part just follow the signs to Venus Drive via the ranger hut (for more water:) which is about total 4 km back to the start point.

* Busses go back to city at the opposite side of the road where you got off i.e. at Flame Tree Park.

* Opens latest 9 AM.
NOTE: Mondays are closed, except if it is a public holiday.

* Probably you will see some monkeys and they are quite used to humans, which is a mixed blessing. Don't feed them. Don't carry anything in plastic bags as these smart animals have learnt that there may be food in plastic bags. Respect them and just pass by and you will both be happy of the encounter.

Hope you enjoy it!"
,,"A real rainforest within a city, only in Singapore!",5.0,,"Nice trail along the water and within rainy forest , great wild fauna and flora , special mention for the Top Tree bridge 250 m lenght within the canopy, and a lot more to see,"
,,Amazing and Tiring - - - WITH MONKEYS!!!!!,5.0,,"This was one of the highlights of my trip in Singapore. Seeing monkeys up close and personal for the first time, and making this huge trek was worth it, if only for the monkeys. Beware of falling branches."
,,A must to do,5.0,,Well worth escaping the city life and take in the wildlife that you shall see on this walk. One of the best to do should you have the time and energy to do so.
,,Escape the city in the middle of it,4.0,,Nice place to go for a walk. Was of particular interest to me as it contains lakes which are the main water source for the city. The bridge was quite cool and you can get very close to the monkeys. Got a bit long after a while and there isn't a train station nearby so we had to use taxis to get from the train station to it.
,,a different type of Singapore,5.0,,"Certain parts of MacRitchie give you an impression how the majority of Singapore looked like a even a hundred years ago, its a jungle. Its great to do a nice hike or run preferably in the morning or evening. You can see various types of snakes occasionally there, almost always monkeys and lizards of different sizes. The Tree Top Walk is really great and in particular kids will enjoy it a lot. It in particular nice for trail running and hyper busy with hikers and runners on Saturday and Sundays mornings from 7am onwards."
,,Walking enthusiasts,3.0,,"Anyone who enjoys a good walk - here's your place. I did the full walk around the park, took a few hours at a decent pace. For those just going for a stroll ot will take around 4hrs I'm guessing.
Nice place, not much to see of do other than butterflies and a few monkeys.
Travelling to the park I'd recommend bus or taxi if you're close by. The park is about 1km from the nearest MRT station and isn't signposted at all (admittedly I got a little lost)."
,,Great Walk in Nature,4.0,,"Make sure you get of bus / taxi at Venus Drive otherwise you will end up walking an extra few hours. Monkeys in quite a few places, one took my apple!!!. Great walk about 3 hours in total. A few steep set of wooding steps but otherwise easy going. Take plenty of water, fill up at Rangers Station. Stuffed when finished but glad we did it."
,,Morning trek,5.0,,Went on this trek and found it amazing. Very beautiful rain Forrest walk. Easy to medium difficulty. Many options from 3-10km in length.
,,Rainforest in the City,5.0,,"Great nature trail. The loop we did was about 8 km. You will see and hear lots of wildlife, come up close and personal with macaque monkeys, and walk across a tree top bridge, probably at least 30m off the ground. Bring water!"
,,Hot but fun,5.0,,This is a fun walk but Singapore is very hot so make sure to you are bringing enough water and dress appropriately.
,,top of the wolrd,5.0,,"there are many places you don't want to miss on this little heaven, but make time for looking down and feeling grateful"
,,Monkeys!,5.0,,"Great hike - surprisingly long. Lots of wildlife - monkeys, monitor lizards, birds, and even a snake.

If you do the full, 11.5 kms hike around the reservoir, be sure to walk COUNTER clockwise. Gets the sun out of your eyes on the last bit.

Also, if you choose to do the tree-top walk about half way along, this is ONE DIRECTION only, counter clockwise.

I went clockwise, and ended up walking 16kms all up."
,,Rain forest within the city,5.0,,Peaceful and relaxing hike along forest treks and on boardwalks. Be prepared to climb up and down stairs after the Tree Top Walk (it's a one-way circuit and reversing is not allowed). Even tropical downpours could not dampen the spirits!
,,A MUST do while in Singapore!,5.0,,We love taking visitors to MacRitchie to hike the trail and tree top bridge. The monkeys are always fun to see as well!
,,Back to nature,4.0,,"Respite from Urban life. Back to Nature, enjoy the greens and fresh air.
The short hike (3 hours) towards TreeTop walk and back was challenging (but not insurmountable) for the kids, and they are proud of their own ""hiking"" achievement after the trail.

We love the signboards along the way which educates us about the resident fauna and flora. Do leave the monkeys alone, they will snatch any exposed plastic bags (which they link to food).

Some of the boardwalk meanders along the waterbody, making the walking experience so relaxing. We want to go back to Macritchie again and try another trail.

Visitors can park at main Macritchie carpark or Venus."
,,Up in the trees,5.0,,"So nice to find facilities ,for disabled people in wheelchairs, so accessible. Lovely clean walkways that were really well planned and you could see the beautiful trees from the top down. Great being up in the treetops."
,,It's a huge city park,5.0,,"Singapore is not exactly known for it's exotic locales, and while this place might be touted as a good place to trek, it's not because of it's rough terrain or hidden charm.

Still, it's a beautiful place, and a good place to take a walk in Singapore that's at least not cemented all the way through."
,,The macritchie monkeys,4.0,,This is a good place to go if you are into jogging it will take a couple of hours at least to jog round or walk and you will also encounter the wild monkeys but do feed or entice them as they are wild and don't make eye contact
,,Lots of different hiking/walking trails,5.0,,"I've only ever done the biggest track - a full 12km around the reservoir. It's a killer, but well worth it. Allow about 2hrs at a steady pace."
,,Never expected to find a jungle walk at the heart of Singapore.,4.0,,Took MRT to Caldicott. At the counter they gave us a little map of how to get to the park. Had a bite to eat at the entrance and then did it counter clockwise (which is best). 4 hours later we stopped for a well deserved beer at the exit and caught a bus back to downtown. We had been to real jungle before. This feels just like it (minus the leaches which are probably not allowed in Singapore:).
,,My favorite place to run!!,5.0,,"I love to get ""lost"" in nature while I run here several times a week. Beautiful lush vegetation, monkeys, monitor lizards and plenty of beauty. If you're not a runner its just as wonderful for a family walk or hike. This may not be on a tourist agenda but its worth making the effort."
,,The Treetop Walk is worth the whole hike!,4.0,,It took us about 90 mins from base to the treetop walk. All in all very good exercise. We even brought our own sandwiches in a picnic basket and one of our friends had his year-old toddler strapped to his chest - admittedly not very easy to carry around but very doable if you're up for a physical challenge.
,,"This is a great walk, we saw monkeys on the path, approached them quietly and there was a mother with her tiny baby.",5.0,,"It's interesting to be able to escape the busy city and walk in a quiet and leafy path, lots of places to stop off and have a coffee and rest."
,,Amazing Spot in the center of the city,5.0,,My favourite spots in Singapore for a jog and to be surrounded by nature. The full walk around the reservior can get a quite strenous hence please chose the right hike trail prior to the start as getting back may be challenging !
,,It may be a city state. But Singapore has great green areas like this place,5.0,,Great place to forget your in a big city. Stunning walks through beautiful scenery. You will be able to see lots of wildlife here as well. Highly recommended as a great place to unwind.
,,One of my favorites,5.0,,"The MacRitchie Reservoir is definitely one of my favorite destinations in Singapore for outdoor activities. I love the 14 km trail which leads you through rainforest, to tree top walks and along the lake. Keep you eyes open and spot lizards, snakes, spiders, trurtles and, of course, monkeys."
,,A hike in 'flat' Singapore,5.0,,This is a great but very approachable hike coming to about 11km in total with random bits of surprising gradient and some lovely changes of scene and highlights including the forest bridge and a cruisey path around the edge of SICC golf course. Should be a top 10 outdoor activity for Singapore
,,Surprise in highrise Singapore,5.0,,A lovely walk in the forest around MacRitchie Reservoir along a well made path that is such a contrast to the rest of built up Singapore. A lovely way to unwind and stretch your legs.
,,Nice,5.0,,Very natural place to go for running or hiking with friends/families...very peaceful and fresh air. Will definitely go again for weekend sports.
,,A few hours away from the bustle,5.0,,"This area is a great contrast to the Singapore cityscape, and at times in the forest you do seem to be a long way from the hustle and bustle. We walked the circular, well signposted, path which took in the Treetop Walk - it took us a bit over 4 hours at a fairly leisurely pace. We saw some amazing butterflies, monkeys and monitor lizards. Some of the path has wooden boards, but some is quite rough and a bit muddy after rain, so good footwear is needed. We got there on a relatively new part of the MRT to Tan Kah Kee station, then the 74 bus to a stop called Aft SICC, but there are other routes and starting points."
,,Walkers paradise,5.0,,If you love walking this is awesome. I went 12k and maybe saw 5 people. And I also caught a great sunset
,,Great Walk to Enjoy Nature and Quiet,5.0,,"This park and reservoir seem like a different city. You can walk for hours and feel relaxed and peaceful, enjoying nature far from the crowds and congestion of the rest of Singapore."
,,Brilliant for some time out of the city!,4.0,,"My brothers, cousin and I, took a trip here for a day out of the city and we were highly impressed! There are various tracks which are clearly signposted and the TreeTop walk gives great views. Be aware for the TreeTop walk that you want to get there pretty early as you do have to queue a little to get on. However, with lots of monkeys jumping around, there is alot that makes the time pass quickly. There is also a big lake that you can rent kayaks from!"
,,Fun & challenging trek for non-climbers,5.0,,"Having been to Singapore for the 3rd time, my husband and I decided to explore the jungle side of the country as we've often went to the concrete and air-conditioned one. Neither of us are trekkers, but we appreciate nature at it's most beautiful form. The MacRitchie Nature Trail was highly recommended so we decided to do it for the challenge. It might have taken us 3 hours total (up and down the trail), and it was good that we really started early in the morning (we started around 6am) as it started getting humid when we went down around 8am.

Make sure you follow the signs, there will be a lot of people walking up the trail but the more accustomed climbers might be too fast for you so make sure you check out the signs. There's a cabin almost to the top where you can stop for a toilet break, or maybe to catch your breath. Bring water as you would need it, but do not bring any food, not even some nuts! I made a mistake of bringing a bread with a thought my husband and I can share it but since we were so focused on climbing up, I forgot it was there. Only when we were crossing the Tree Top Walk bridge and some monkeys were making its way to me that I realized they can smell the bread! I stopped for a while near the guy manning the bridge and he has this long stick to drive the monkeys away. I took out the bread, left it at the bridge and the monkeys walked past me to feast on it. How I wish I didn't have that bread on me, I could have taken some gorgeous photos of the bridge and the monkeys as well : ( But since they scared me, I made sure I crossed safe quick and put some great distance between us.

Overall it was a great experience. Who knew Singapore would have that beautiful side of nature?! Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a change of pace from the hustle and bustle of the malls and other concrete tourist spots."
,,Singapore Wilderness,4.0,,"An interesting walk of about 11km which we did clockwise with as its feature a 250m swing bridge over the tree canopy at the highest point of the walk. We caught the subway to Caldicott and walked to McRitchie Park (about 500m) and started the walk at the lake edge. Soon after we were walking through the rainforest in the shade on a wide track winding its way up the hill. There was plenty of signage and maps along the route so no concerns about getting lost. It was quite a surprise that after crossing the suspension bridge that the downhill was a lot of steps and boardwalk until we got back to the main track which was a relatively short distance to Jelutong Tower (5 or 6 levels of steps) which had 360 degree canopy views and was the only time we encountered a group of monkeys about 6 or 8 of them swinging through the trees and chattering loudly but they did not bother us.
Walking along the lake edge was interesting also and we saw several lace monitors (giant lizards), squirrel-like creatures and some butterflies.
We enjoyed our day but take plenty of water as there is none to be had once you head off and it was a hot humid day. Certainly enjoyed the cold soft drinks at the café at the completion of the walk."
,,Away from maddening crowd,4.0,,Well worth visit walks to suit everyone bring lots of water as no huts with drinks on way. Nice cafe for food and drinks at beginning of walk
,,Half Day Hike,5.0,,"Just a few minutes walk from Marymount MTR Station and you find yourself in a jungle setting that is hard to believe is in the heart of Singapore.
An easy 3-4 hours is needed for the full circuit.
Definitely worth the effort, especially for the tree top walk. Make sure you follow the signs as the walk is one way and a gate plus a constant stream of visitors prevents any access from the wrong side.
Make sure to take plenty of water as the humidity and heat will really take it out of you and whatever you do do not take food or plastic bags as the monkeys whilst cute will definitely lose any aspect of timidity to get to what they think could be food. A couple a little way ahead of us unfortunately found this out as a larger monkey jumped onto them to get the bag with some food that they must have let him see and along with the car keys that bag was the monkey's. Save for a park worker, they would have had a long walk home.

Definitely make the effort if you have the time. This place is well worth the time."
,,MACRITCHIE NATURE TRAIL,5.0,,One of the best nature walks in singapore... It offers a good break from the hustle and bustle of the city. A very close encounter with various trees including some animals and birds species....
,,Nice Jog trekking,5.0,,"I'm here for a jog and this place is pretty popular for people who like to trek or jog. Reason being it is rare to find such place in Singapore to jog and enjoy nature.

Being awhile since I came, I did not expect the place to be clean, and peaceful. I'm here for 2hours and im glad i manage to try the treetop. This close early so it is good to reach there before 4.

This is the place to come if you look for nature and enjoy trekking. There is a choice of road of 5km or 10km. At times you get to see monkey but do not try to disturb or feed them. I guess the same for all countries.

Manage to take some nice shots of the reservoir while jogging. Not easy to jog as there is uphill and downhill. This really can train up stamina.

Hope you enjoy the nature trail

Cheers"
,,tranquillity at the very heart of Singapore,5.0,,"The park and nature reserve at the very heart of Singapore is a popular destination for runners, water sports enthusiasts, and of course nature lovers. If you’ve ever wanted to enjoy the tranquillity of walking with your head above the trees, you’ll get your chance at the Treetop Walks, a 250-metre aerial free standing suspension bridge spanning the two highest points within MacRitchie. Take an exhilarating walk around the 11km nature trail loop known as MacRitchie Trails, located within the tropical rainforest of Central Catchment Nature Reserve. You’ll likely bump into long-tailed macaque monkeys, squirrels and monitor lizards. If you’re lucky, you may even encounter colugos or owls! Avid water sports enthusiasts can try their hand at kayaking and canoeing at the reservoir, as these amenities are available. With so many attractions and scenic spots of nature on offer, MacRitchie is an excellent destination for anyone who loves fun and the outdoors."
,,Go to jungle!!,5.0,,"Excellent walk in the jungle (and for the kids, nice to see monkeys in real nature). And aat the end, you arrive in the Botanic Garden to continue your day."
,,A cool place amidst all humidity,5.0,,"MacRitchie to my surprise turned out to be a beautiful experience. Mainly coz there was so much of lung space and coolness in the air besides so much humidity. I think that's what nature is all about.
Suggestion is to go early in the morning around 6am and enjoy the walk. The place is very well maintained and you will people of every age group visiting. If you are tired, worry not, they have a cafe where you can have your breakfast too."
,,For Nature Lovers !!,4.0,,"went there for a weekend trail and loved the experience , very different from usual bar hopping in singapore .."
,,Very beautiful and well maintained,5.0,,"I originally went to go for a nice nature trail run and it turned into an amazing nature path walk with tons of wildlife and rainforests. Between seeing wild monkeys, huge lizards, wild snakes and squirrels, plus witnessing an enormous branch break off and fall from about 200 feet up, it was definitely a great adventure. Highly recommend and make sure you do the free TREE WALK!! Incredible and slightly scary!"
,,Great place to get out into the Green,5.0,,There are various trails you can use for walking or running. They are all in good order and no pets or bicycles are allowed. A perfect place to relax and to enjoy the nature.
,,Beware the Monkeys,4.0,,"I went with a group of friends (30 - 70 years of age) and took bus #166 from Chinatown for $1.80 (SG) which took about 40 minutes. Compared to taking the MRT with several transfers, it is about the same time but I recommend taking the bus! It is so great to see sights from above ground, like the National Museum of Singapore, Fort Canning Park and cool buildings like the old Police Building or old Fire Station.

But for the trail!! We got of the bus and immediately saw the first monkey. It was so cool! Then part of our group (the 70 year old) separated to run the circuit trail, which took him about an hour. The rest of us walked the trail which was so lovely because you can pick between the rough trail or the plank board trail. Careful though, both trails were really wet and slippery and one of us bailed down a set of stairs : |

On the way back, a group of monkeys followed us for about ten minutes and we all thought it was cute and innocuous until a larger monkey started circling around my legs and jumping at me. A women started telling us to ""Just walk away!"" so we did. A moment later another monkey came running down the path towards me so I used my water bottle as a block. It grabbed the water bottle like it was a prize and ran off with it. It went about 10 feet from us, plopped down, unscrewed the lid, poured the liquid on the ground and drank it all! I wanted to avoid the $1000 for littering so we wanted until it was finished and threw the bottle out. We speculated that the monkey knew the bottle I had was a ""Sports Water"" bought from the venting machine at MacRitchie and the others my friends had were from the hotel and that the monkey probably knew the sports water was more sweet then the the plain water in the other bottles.

So just a recommendation, the walk was beautiful and amazing but please watch out for the wild life because they are in fact wild! Not cute little pets!"
,,Unexpected.,4.0,,Was a bit surprised to find this place in the middle of Singapore. A lovely walk but be careful of the monkeys as they are notorious for pinching any loose items along with food or drinks out of your hands.
,,Loved the tree top walk,5.0,,After starting out at the reservoir you can tag on the tree top walk. I'm scared of heights but this was not a problem for me. Great feeling of being in the jungle!
,,Ideal for exercise,4.0,,"Many people go to this place to exercise, like walking or jogging. On the top, there is a bridge called HSBC TreeTop Walk where you can see around the scenery. The bridge is one-way, so once you go, you can't go back. There are a few entrances, if you don't like walking too far to reach the bridge, you can enter from Venus Drive carpark."
,,Love the greenery here!,5.0,,There aren't many places in Singapore with greeneries. Macritchie is one of the best places to visit if you will like to be closer to nature. Its safe and free for an awesome workout. Do try out the tree top walk if you haven't. Breathtaking view of the greenery and reservoir. Best to arrive at the Venus drive starting point before 7.30am otherwise it may get too hot for the walk.
,,"Interesting, not for everyone (treetop trail)",4.0,,"Beautiful tranquil place for a walk/hike/run. Nature sounds and smells surround you. Treetop trail, while interesting and good views, was not for me (terrified of heights). Still, it was an experience."
,,fresh air,3.0,,singapore is the best place how to get fresh air. and please do not miss the tree top walk! you can walk between the canopies and the trails.
,,I never get tired in this place,5.0,,"I usually make it a habit to visit there one's a month, but recently i've been very busy, thus I'm missing MacRitchie. The place is filled with trees, you can either walk on the wooden path or inside the trail going to the tree top walk. Even if it's noon, you won't get burned. You will see lots of wild animals such as monkey, snakes and monitor lizard, but don't get scared, they usually don't attack. The place is relaxing and serene. Make sure to bring extra shirt if you are planning to take the trail. It will usually take 3-4 hours (depends on your speed) if you go inside. But nevertheless you won't feel much tired because of the beautiful trees and surroundings. Important tips: Go there in the morning around 7-8AM to start the trail, spray some insect repellent, and dub some spf if you want. Extra shirt and bottled of water. Also, don't touch the monkeys and keep your valuables as they may snatch it. Bring hat and extra shirt"
,,Go Green,4.0,,Singapore is full of concrete and you won't get to see much green in the country. This nature reserve is one of the few places untouched and worth a visit if you looking for a relaxing day closer to the nature just 20mins drive from heart of the city. The trail is well maintained and you would bump into many Trekkers.
,,tree top walk,5.0,,best place to get fresh air. and do not miss the tree top walk! walk amongst the canopies and the trails can lead you to the top of bukit timah
,,Good workout,4.0,,"What a great day out. Wear comfortable shoes and take water with you as it is clammy. humid and hot but luckily the forest provides some much needed shade.

We did the 11km walk and also went on the tree top walk. It was really beautiful. There are snakes and squirrels. We saw three snakes whilst on the walk, one on the foot path and the other two were curled up in small trees approximately 0.5m from the path. Make sure you watch your children so that they don't go and touch something they probably should not.

For a less forest walk you can just walk along the boardwalk next to the reservoir. Also a great walk.

I would definitely do this walk again and definitely recommend it as a must do in Singapore."
,,Nice place,5.0,,Its a nice place to go hiking or a stroll. Away from the town area and vehicles on the roads. Great opportunity to spot wildlife
,,New yet exciting,5.0,,"Beautiful park with breathtaking picturesque scenery.

I'm definitely not an adventure buff and I would never dream of doing anything outdoors. I'm much more of an indoors person who likes to spend her weekends curled up in a blanket reading or binge watching shows. However deciding to come to this place for an outdoorsy experience was a very good idea!

The trail is well maintained and clean but if you are as clumsy as me you will surely end up falling so please be careful. The park offers a myriad of amenities like canoeing, fishing etc. promise you a day full of fun and adventure.

Will definitely visit again."
,,Rainforest hike in the middle of the city,4.0,,Tried this hike several times. Hot and humid so bring lots of water. Great mix of scenery and landscape.
,,Ran here,5.0,,This is an amazing place. The reservoir area has many many different trails for running and walking. Gontonthe Trr Top View and walk the large circuit. Go early morning and you'll see many animals. Take water and sunscreen as the services are only at the car park. Do not feed or stare at the macaques!
,,'Zen in the City',5.0,,"I think it is admirable that there is a rainforest in the middle of a city so buzzing and high tech as Singapore. If you do not hail from South East Asia rainforests are particularly hard to come by so it was a real treat. It was busy today ( Sunday) with slightly varied terrain. We took the 'Tree Top' Walk which was amazing to walk across the suspension bridge to see the full panorama and feel you were amongst the tree tops.
It took three hours and we are reasonably fit and walked at a medium pace. My advice is start early ( even though under the canopy of the rainforest it is noticeably cooler) as it was really hot at midday when we finished. Also if you are afraid of heights probably don't take the ""Tree Top"" walk option. There are others to choose from. And it's free."
,,The jungle in the city,5.0,,"Close to the centre of the City of Singapore, but right out in the jungle. Great walk to see monkeys and other animals as well as beatiful local trees and plants. It will take about 3 hours and a lot of sweating, so bring enough water."
,,"if you have time, definitely worth it",5.0,,"I can only recommend this walk. It is a very very long walk. I think we walked around 15 km. There are many local people who jog along the path or go for a walk. I wasn't impressed much by the nature or monkeys, since we spend a lot of our time in the rain forests of South East Asia but there was something about this trail that I enjoyed very much. It was so peaceful. It was nice to escape from the crowded city... If you have time, I can strongly recommend it. If you don't have much time in Singapore, obviously, this is not one of the top sights."
,,My favorite activity in Singapore,5.0,,"The park is amazing! so beautiful, with huge range of biodiversity, where if you walk quietly you will notice many animals. Beautiful, well maintained, easily accessible. Going there early morning is a good idea, before it gets too hot."
,,Up in the clouds,5.0,,"We travelled on the MRT to visit the MacRitchie Reservoir Park. The rainy season in Singapore includes the month of December - and we experienced a torrential downpour during our walk around the reservoir, which included a crossing of the HSBC suspension bridge. The park was very busy with local people, taking part in jogging and other strenuous activities. The Park includes a cafeteria and it was fascinating to see the staff using water pistols, to deter hordes of macaque monkeys from stealing food from the tables."
,,Tranquility within a City,4.0,,"I have such fond memories.
There was a huge totoise that was just there grinding the surrounding vegetation.
An arowana fish swimming unfazed by our presence on the shallow pool just below the walk ways.
Red eared sliders everywhere.
Macaques roaming about like kings.
It's truly an oasis in a landscape that is Singapore."
,,A walk through the nature.,5.0,,"I stayed near he Upper Thompson road very close to this property. It was opened during 1909 as a water reservoir for the city. It was improved and name changed to MacRitche upon the Municipal Engineer of Singapore during 1921. It can be expressed as the lungs of Singapore, located in the centre of the city. There are number of trails, some with wooden pathways through the primary forest. The walk through these trails is just divine and it costs nothing. At the higher reaches is the walk through the Tree Top walk and lower area is the huge lake. I saw rare snakes, dragon, huge and baby tortoises, big fishes etc. Fishing is permitted with licence. You can also do canoeing and other water sports. A beautiful place in the centre of Singapore"
,,Great trail around the lakes,5.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir Park has a variety of activities, the best of which is the Nature Trail that loops around the central lake. The trail is mainly flat and provides around a 10-12 km loop depending on the time you have available. There is a cool observation post plus a skybridge that provide treetop views of the area."
,,slice of nature in a busy city,5.0,,"its a lovely escape within the heart of the city. great views all over, lovely old growth trees and a nice trail system for waliing, running or just sitting a few benches and looking at the water/ sunsets"
,,Do the Treetop Walk but Know it Takes a While to Get There,5.0,,"This trail is a lot of fun and you get to see a lot of nature, especially if you're quiet and observant. Runners use the trail for their workouts so they may pass you. Some tourists were playing music and talking loudly and that was a bit annoying. Animals come around more to humans if they are quiet. But the monkeys were fun, and we loved the semi-muddy hike."
,,Been Here Many Times and Yet still Amazed Everytime,5.0,,I love the refreshing view. There are also a lot of monkeys in the area. You should try the TReetop Walk - it is worth the long walks :)
,,Nice place to go on a trail,5.0,,"Me n hubby love to go there for trail walking. There are several routes, you can choose to do a shorter distance round, like a 1.5 km round or the entire round is 11 km. There are many monkeys in that area and some of them can get quite aggressive if you start feeding them. There is also a tree top bridge which is also quite fun to go. There are kayaks for rent near the board walk."
,,Pocket of nature in the heart of the city.,5.0,,"The oldest reservoir in Singapore is circumscribed by an 11km nature trail, where, frequently, monkeys share their space with families out on a ramble. Never feed the monkeys.

The route, beginning at a clearly-marked area by the water's edge, will take you through forest, then towards the canopy walk (one-way only), then a stretch of boardwalk around the reservoir.

By the way, there's a WW2-era Shinto shrine (""Syonan Jinja"") compound deep in the forest. No trails in, but seek and ye shall find."
,,Great walk,5.0,,"Excellent scenery and views all round - definitely worth it , just make sure you wear your workout gear. The routes are all quite long, so set aside a couple of hours."
,,Beautiful scenery with an abundance of macaques!,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed a 8 kilometre like through the jungle. Despite the large amount of people on the trail and the narrow trail width you still felt like you were the only people on the trail! Just gotta watch out for all the people jogging past! The high canopy keeps the climate nice and cool which is awesome. Plenty of macaques on the trail especially on the boardwalks. Bumped into a large family of monkeys including a mother and baby which meant she was quite aggressive. Not going to lie but after a few close snaps and several threatening monkeys I was afraid to approach them especially the big males! Don't get too close or disturb them as they pack a nasty bite.
,,Urban Retreat!,4.0,,"After spending some time in hot Singapore we visited the MacRitchie Reservoir and enjoyed the tranquility of the huge lake, a stroll at the shore and the breathing of fresh air."
,,Exhausting...,3.0,,"In general, the entire place is very beautiful. But, unless you are very athletic or a hiking lover, then dont do my mistake by going up to the tree tops. It's very exhausting and it's one way road, so you'll have to walk a long way before you can reach the exit. Up on the tree tops walk is a nice view but very short, so you feel kinda disappointed. You can see the monkeys way down at the beggining of your journey. My advice is go there for a picnic, sit by the water, enjoy the serenity of the place, watch the monkeys play, and spare your feet the pain."
,,Fantastic Place to go for Early Morning Walk/Trek,5.0,,"Love to go this place for a Sunday morning walk/trek. The whole circuit that we do is aronud 8Km which includes the walk through the entrance to the canopy, the tree top and back.

Walking on the Canopy and checking the places with a 360 Degree view is thrilling and fascinating experience. Like this part the best in the walk.

Take a short break for water at the Tree Top and enjoy the aerial view of Singapore

Overall a brilliant experience...try to reach around 7:00 am and finish by around 8:30 am and set yourself for a nice refreshing breakfast on a sunday morning!!"
,,Can't believe there is such a place in SG,5.0,,It's a good place for jogging and trekking. Nice scenery but beware monkeys. They tried to attack me!
,,Good for cardio,5.0,,Must put on proper attire for this walk as the dirt and mud is unpredictable. When it rains please avoid the bridge. Safety come first. Bring lots of water. There's also water cooler located near the toilets.
,,Great to see the monkeys!,4.0,,"The Nature Trail was 11km in total although since I walked the trail in the opposite direction I probably covered 15km since I had to go back on myself in order to complete the tree top bridge walk. The walk was a moderate one although the sun was out in force the day I decided to take on the trek and so made it a little more difficult. Be sure to bring plenty of water with you if you plan on completing the entire trail. I stupidly only brought 1 small bottle and was lucky to finish the trail without becoming dreadfully dehydrated. I had the delight of spotting monkeys, butterflies, lizards and an array of beautiful flora on my walk around. The views from the observatory tower and the trees top bridge were incredible and just put into perspective how tall the trees there actually grow. It was great to feel so close to nature knowing a bustling city awaited you upon finishing. I'd definitely recommend if you want to try something different. You genuinely forget where you are when walking the trail, I really enjoyed it."
,,Out of the city,5.0,,"I spend most weekend jogging at this part, it is a nice & quiet place to escape from the city. Trail is well maintained with 1 water stop"
,,Perfect for nature lovers,4.0,,"Bugs, mozzies, scorching sun, aching feet and lack of connection aside, the Treetop Walk and the trail leading up to it is really a must-go for nature lovers.

For the more adventurous fitness buffs, the longer trail from Lornie Road would be your best bet.

After you alight at 'After Lornie Road' bus stop, cross the overhead bridge, and reach the 'After SICC' bus stop, you have to walk against the flow of traffic before you see a tiny little trail to your right.

There was an area where a huge group of macaques just stared at us curiously as we walked by. I managed to see a few tiny baby macaques.

The 250m bridge felt really short, and it wasn't as high up above the treetops as expected.

Lucky for us, we went on a weekday afternoon so we had all the time in the world to take our perfect shots on the bridge. It's a one-way route so there's no backtracking your steps. Once you exit the gate, that's it. You don't get to go onto the bridge again.

On the way, you'll get to spot quite a lot of wildlife. We managed to see a particularly noisy monitor lizard stomping its way through the bushes.

TIPS:

Bring along sunscreen and insect repellant.
Wear sports shoes that you feel comfortable in (Rocky trails are no joke)
Keep your food and plastic bags out of sight. Don't tempt the macaques."
,,Great walk.,4.0,,Great place for a Long walk in Singapore. Always take water. You can walk Long or short. Whole walk round takes a few hours. Lovely scenery and some wild life!
,,One of my favourite places in SG for a nature hike,5.0,,"Have done the 10K trail around this park several times. Often bring friends that are visiting me in Singapore here as I absolutely love the nature and views.

Some facts/tips:
- Bring mosquito repellent
- The monkeys are cute and generally ignore you if you ignore them but if you get to close or feed them they can get very cheeky (common sense)
- Make sure you leave the park before it gets dark (around 7pm) as it gets very dark in the forest quickly and it gets harder to orientate then
- There are clear signs and maps throughout the park
- The treetop walk is a must to do, it gives you some amazing treetop views"
,,Hiking,4.0,,"If you like to hee, this is a place to go. With monkeys here and there and beautiful scenery from the hanging bridge, you should do it once."
,,NIce morning walk,4.0,,This Tree Top walk is one of MacRitchie Nature trail and is reach by a few trails. It is a long and tiring trail so take your time to reach there and make sure you bring enough water along. Check out for more details at the National Parks website for more details.
,,Excellent Workout,5.0,,"It was a good trekking route. We started from MacRitchie carpark, made our way to Tree top walk enjoying the spectacular view! Afterwards we continue the trail towards the jelutong tower. It was a pain to climb up the tower after the trek but the view on top was amazing and worth the effort.

Brought along a back pack with water and light snacks like banana and energy bar. Saved our life..."
,,Not for the unfit/faint hearted,4.0,,A good walk and a good way to break a sweat around the reservoir - great view from the canopy walk and the lookout tower.
,,Best Hiking trails in the midst of this gorgeous city,4.0,,"Getting there was not easy. Suggest you take a cab to get there. The Park is HUGE. our heart rate monitor showed that we walked for approx 21kms.

Do not miss the HSBC Treetop walk there. It's a narrow bridge and the views below of greenery are breath taking.

We also got lost in the park. Suggest you keep checking with the regular locals to find you the closet exit."
,,Something different,5.0,,A beautiful walk & something completely different in Singapore. We thoroughly enjoyed this walk which is a comfortable 13km if you take in the tree top walk ( a must )
,,Nature Park,5.0,,Lovely place for nature walks and jogging. Best to go in the mornings. Careful of any food in plastic bags. Monkeys will likely target you. Best to put food in proper bags and containers.
,,Forest walk just half an hour from the city,5.0,,"Singapore may be a tiny country but she still have a fair share of nature areas. The Mcritchie Nature Trail is one of them. Who would have imagine that you could be in forested area just half an hour from the city centre.

The whole trail around the reservoir is about 11 km taking about 3 hours of easy walk. Along the way you can seeplenty tropical plants and flowers, giant trees and if you are lucky nocturnal animal such as the colugo.
Their is also a tree TOP canopy walk. Note that it is closed on Monday.
This is another excellent free attractions for visitor to Singapore.

You can access the park by taking the circle line subway exiting at Caldicot station. It is about 15 minutes walk to the park"
,,Great place to walk on an early weekend morning,5.0,,"This is a very nice walk that takes you out of the city and gives you the fresh air an greenery that can be lacking in a large city like Singapore. As well as the leafy rain forest you can see monkeys, monitor lizards and a large array of birdlife.

It can get a bit hot in the middle of the day and a bit crowded at the park entrance end around 9-11 am so early morning is probably the best time to go."
,,Best hiking place in town,5.0,,Located inside MacRitchie Nature Reserve. It is a good place to hike and immerse in the nature. It is also suitable for young children. It may take half day to full day depends on the trail you take. Tree top walk is a must visit if you go there.
,,De-Stress yourself with a long walk,4.0,,"We often visit this Walking stretch and good thing is its free. step out early morning and spend 4-5 hours walking along the entire trail.Its Lovely blend of Nature's various aspects.If you are trekker or a runner or a brisk walker you would enjoy. little tricky with kids though I have seen many families with kids (kudos to them!). You would enjoy the nature walk/tree top walks . Its beautiful and do bring your Cameras , you can have a group outing and a picnic sort as well…excellent to hang out with bunch of friends ."
,,Great place to go.,5.0,,"Another one of those great places to go in Singapore, if you want to run the 10km trial you can or you can take everything in with a walk which will take you a good couple of hours, there's food, kayaking, yoga to name just a few of the things you can do, once again there's no entrance fee to this beautiful piece of land, you wouldn't believe you were in the middle of a city, no traffic noise whatsoever, just you and nature, bliss."
,,Great place to exercise!,5.0,,Love this place even though it really challenges me doing the 10k trail. Have done twice since being in Singapore and will go again whenever I'm back.
,,Getaway from the crowds,4.0,,The MacRitchie Nature Reserve is a fine opportunity to escape the urban bustle of Singapore. Easiest access is by 157 bus from Toa Payoh. I took the yellow trail and added on the Tree Top Walkway which made for a 14km route taking about three hours. Paths mixture of rough stone (muddy after rain) and boardwalk. Mostly in forest. Take plenty of water. Few people on a weekday. Food and drink available from cafe at beginning/end but not on route.
,,TreeTop Walk: Very stuffy and humid.,3.0,,"The Tree Top Walk is a good trail, and can be quite steep and challenging in parts for people who are not used to it. Did not find it easy to complete.

However, more importantly, the trail is surrounded by tall trees and no air or breeze blows through. It can get really stuffy in there, especially with the humidity, which really took away from my enjoyment of the walk.

The reservoir itself though, is large, quiet and beautiful and has many spots one can enjoy."
,,MacRitchie Trail,5.0,,"This trail, if you take it around the entire reservoir, takes a good 3 hours to do and it can be hot and humid. But it's a unique way to get out of the tall buildings and see some nature. We saw quite a few monkeys along the way, but be warned, they can be aggressive and go after your belongings."
,,MacRitchie Nature Trail,5.0,,"It is best to visit the trail in the morning as the midday sun can be hot. You will see squirrels, monkeys and snakes. The trees provide much shade and it is cool in the forest. Beware of snakes which lurk on the forest floor."
,,Just the place in the lap of nature for the weekend hikers,5.0,,"Take a breadth of fresh air and reconnect with nature. Enjoy kayaking and a serene lake view all around the park . Hike through the well marked and directed trails and go for the long hike to the tree walk ! ..
Carry a book , music and just relax and rejuvenate ."
,,"My favorist trail in Singapore, nature, beautiful, peaceful",5.0,,"My favorist trail in Singapore and I have been there for so many times. This trail is quite nature and many people are jogging there. I only walked, and it took me about 4 hours complete the cycle.. walking, and at times stop and sit by a great view."
,,Good Forest walk,4.0,,"We did this walk a number of years ago when we first visited relatives in Singapore.
We decided to try it again on this visit and were not disappointed.
The paths are clearly marked and well maintained and you get to see a range of wildlife( monkeys,large lizards and turtles on this trip).
We walked for 3-4 hours before the weather threatened to downpour and we made cover just as the heavens opened!
Have recommended this walk to many people when visiting or stopping over in Singapore as it gives a different,more relaxed feel, to the city from the high rise buildings and the busy atmosphere."
,,Best park in Singapore,5.0,,"This is the best park in Singapore due to its dense forest. You feel more comfortable than in the other ""less natural"" places."
,,Good day out walking,4.0,,This is a cracking day out walking - take lots of water if you are not good in the humidity but if you are fit and enjoy a good walk get down here - keep your eyes peeled for the many and various creatures.
,,Wonderful Walk,5.0,,"MacRitchie reservoir is fantastic and one of our favourite places in Singapore. Singapore is basically one big city, and there isn't much in the way of open spaces, or wildlife. However get on the bus and travel out to MacRitchie and you can enjoy fantastic walks, wonderful plants, and fantastic wildlife. We went primarily to see the monkeys, and we weren't disappointed - there a many. As long as you stick to the guidelines and don't try to touch them, or make eye contact then they leave you alone and go about their business (its amazing how many people try to get too close and get annoyed when they react!). Also be wary of carrying food. We had a lovely long walk and saw so many animals - it was lovely. Get out of the city and relax!"
,,Definitely for Hiking Lovers - Mind the Monkeys!,5.0,,There a few trails you can do depending on your tolerance for heat/humidity. I love the longer trail (2-3 hours) that spits you on near Bukit Timah road - take a cab to Pasarbella after and try Providore cafe. Bring water (seriously!) and a change of t-shirt if you don't want to walk around smelling of sweat after! Mind the monkeys!
,,Best way to spend a few extra hours communing with nature while in Singapore.,4.0,,"The trail is located inside the MacRitchie Reservoir, so do grab a map at the entrance. Alternatively, you can just explore the large park until you find the Lornie Trail. Be prepared for a long walk, so wear comfortable shoes.

There will be few people on a weekday (I went on a Friday) so it's even better for a long and peaceful stroll. Keep all of your belongings in waterproof containers and bring a raincoat or a hard shell, as showers can happen at anytime. Keep food hidden well away as well from the wildlife.

There are few trash cans inside, so bring an extra plastic bag for disposing trash, and always remember to practice LNT!"
,,Great trail. Bring Mosquito Repellants. Watch out for Monkeys,4.0,,"A beautiful nature trail. Be sure to wear good shoes as the trail is uneven in most places. Also, be sure to bring mosquito repellents and kungfu skills to wade off monkeys. Try not to wear too bright colored outfits and avoid eating in the trail - unless you want to fight monkeys over the food."
,,Something for everyone (almost),5.0,,"A nice track to jog (tick). Quiet place to think, pray or meditate (tick). Indulge in nature (tick). Have an outing with the family (tick). Go on a date (tick). Have a meal (tick). Do photography (tick). Kayak (tick). Yes, there's almost something for everyone... Except those who love air-conditioned malls of course."
,,Trip around the reservoir before flying back to the UK,5.0,,"A great place for running and walking. We saw a very large water monitor in the reservoir and also on a path, along with kingfishers, turtles, eagle, and also many monkeys. The restaurant we stopped in was very good and helpful, as we had a vey bad thunderstorm and lightening, and I think the reservoir will need any water for some time as it hammered it down. Well worth a trip, to get rid of a few cobwebs before a 13 hour flight. A very understated venue and it's free!"
,,"Long Trail - MacRitchie Tree Top Walk, Jelutog Tower, Jering Trail/Lornie Trail, Reservoir Park",4.0,,"After contributing most time to work, finally days of peace arrived. And so arrived my idea of celebrating peace i.e. with nature among green. MacRitchie Reservoir Park seems to me very convincing as the venue to choose.

I chose a Saturday noon to start my trail walk. With already done all the groundwork for a first time lone visitor, i thought there will be no much problem to reach and start until i reached Faber Garden on Upper Thomson road there are various ways going in direction of trail but really tough to decide because there you see no directions marked mentioning Tree Top Walk or MacRitchie Reservoir Park Trails.

My suggestion to anyone who is planning to go has to reach venus drive car park on the road which connect to Island club road. From here you can see Tree Top walk directions.

In my opinion, up to tree top walk is an easy trek. And can be taken up by anyone who is able to walk for 4 km at ease.

Along the way to reach tree top walk nature welcomes you with wild water draining out from dense forest cover and wildlife sounds all orchestrating into a symphony. I already liked the feel of digital detox healing a weary me from long monotonous, stressing & strenuous work schedule.

From the start of trail until tree top walk it is 2.2 Kms. Some part of initial trail path goes along Island club road which then enters into dense forest after Bukit Kalang Service Reservoir.

When along the trail you reach to Ranger station, which has facilities like drinking water, toilets, benches to refresh and move ahead on trail which i remember is just 400 m more from Ranger station to Tree Top Walk suspended bridge.The bridge is meant for only one way movement.

After you exit the bridge the pathway takes you to a junction where you can choose to go back re-tracing the track back to car park towards Ranger station or, you could choose to move ahead on MacRitchie trail. Since i was prepared for longer trail i chose later.

This is a longer trail distance is more than 5.5 Kms until MacRitchie reservoir park. On this trail there is Jelutong Tower which gives you a bird eye view of the forest. on the later trail you move along the lake and watch golfers along Singapore Island country club. Anglers are also seen practicing in this area. Ahead you either choose Lornie trail which goes inside the forest or Jering trail which goes along the lake periphery. Both of them reach the start of MacRitche Reservoir Park.

After reaching Park you can choose among various options from Buses, MRT or Taxi to reach you destination. There are refreshment kiosks vending food & beverages too. A section of reservoir is used for canoeing and is frequented by sport's enthusiasts."
,,Singapore's green lung,5.0,,"I am going there for a run usually on Sundays. The perfect place to get out of the crazy busy city life. Very central located this nature reservoir is highly recommended. If you are planning to go for a run on weekends start as early as 7 am to avoid the crowd.

Enjoy!"
,,Thrilled By The Wild Jungle Experience,4.0,,"Interestingly, Singapore gives you glimpses that are really distinct and exotic. Take for instance, this recreation of the SE Asian jungles. The feel is authentic and there even are trials with directions that lead deep into the jungle. You can even spot snakes if lucky enough. The ambiance is calm and cool. The jungle can be reached via taxi from the Orchard."
,,My favorite place to run in Singapore,5.0,,"Sometimes it's hard to just lose yourself on a run in Singapore because the sidewalks are uneven, the streets are crowded, and the drivers are dangerous. Not so in Macritchie Nature Reserve.

Here you can lose yourself for hours on a combination of lakefront, nature trails, and even the Treetop Walk (bring extra water if you go for this one!). Whether walking or running, it's a perfect day out in nature that will leave you refreshed and rejuvenated within a bustling city."
,,Trip into the jungle a stones throw from the city!,5.0,,"Great trip out whilst in Singapore.

Get the feeling of being deep in the jungle only a 15 minute ride from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Take some water as it gets hot!! Also be wary if you don't like little critters or monkeys!"
,,Pleasant walk you can do with the kids,3.0,,Easy walk around MacRitchie. You can double back after the tree top walk to make it easier or circle the reservoir. If you circle the reservoir it is up and down so younger children probably won't sing your praise for awhile. Like anywhere in Singapore you want to take water.
,,Fantastic seeing wild monkeys,5.0,,The walk can be self paced. A popular place for the locals to exercise. Wear cool clothign and comfortable shoes. Take a bottle of water. It is about a 20 minute taxi ride from Orchard Parade.
,,"excellent family outing to really immerse into local jungle, till being so close to the city centre!",5.0,,"A preview of South Asia jungle, in a rather safe way. There are trails and indications. it is really worth walking the 11 k loop. It is mostly in the shade and the nature is wonderful.
There are sometimes tiny snakes… But saw 2 in 2 years.
The canopy trail is really worth going.
It is easy to get there. It cost less than 10 sing dollars for one taxi ride from Orchard, and 6 minutes.
unmissible"
,,"Might be crowded, beware of opening hours for the bridge, but nature is always awesome",4.0,,"MacRitchie is easily accessible by car, with a good car park and toilets near the car park.

Gets crowded on weekends, so you don't get to see much wildlife,

Beware of the opening hours for the tree top bridge, and beware of monkeys, don't carry food in plastic bags in your hand... Monkeys get aggressive sometimes and will snatch it.

Maintained by Nparks, so it's clean and mostly safe :)"
,,"If you like walking, get your self here",5.0,,"Good
-Beautiful place in a country full of buildings
-Decent sized walk
-Wild monkeys
-Not difficult (except for the heat)
-Different lengths of walks
-Bridge is free to walk over and is worth it while you're here

Bad
- Can take a little while to get here compared to other placed in Singapore
-Singapore is still hot so it can be a sweaty walk."
,,Closer to Nature,4.0,,"A family activity together with friends. It was hot but because of the trees you dont feel the heat. It was a holiday so there were quite a number of people in the park but not crowded. We decided to follow the shortest trail because of some aunties with us. We saw some turtles, fish in the reservoire, didn't find snakes this time but we met a family of monkeys. There are interesting plants and trees too. It's really good to be with nature from time to time away from the busy city life but within the city."
,,"A serene, beautiful natural escapade in bustling Singapore!",4.0,,"The Macritchie reservoir is quite big and very beautiful reservoir in Singapore. It has got couple of walking trails as well. The park is accessible via public transport - MRT & buses. Marrymount (yellow line) is the stop to alight to get to the park.

Do:
1 Carry enough water or fluids as you will drain out.
2 Carry some energy booster food (like banana, etc) which you may like to have to top up some quick energy!
3 Wear a nice and comfortable pair of walking/running shoes as the trail isn't paved or smooth.
4 Start early. The treetop point closes at 1655 hours (last entry). Also the trail is densely covered with trees. So it may get dark a bit soon in evening.

Don't:
1 Carry too much weight as walking trail will drain you quickly.
2 Might not like to venture out on a rainy or wet day as the trail would be slippery.
3 On the way to trail no food stalls are available. So one must keep in mind.
4 If you have young child or children accompanying you, then be prepared as they can be tired.

The treetop point offers scenic views. The last entry ends at 1655 hours so need to plan accordingly. It will roughly take about 75-90 minutes to reach treetop point from the starting point (depends upon the walking/running speed). If you plan to explore the place with a group of friends, then surely will have more fun."
,,A nice getaway from the city,4.0,,Singapore actually has a surprising number of places to just get away from the city and enjoy a bit of nature. This one is convenient to get to with a few amenities to make it comfortable. Watch out for the monkeys. They can sometimes be aggressive so please don't feed them.
,,Best thing to do,5.0,,"Very peaceful and relaxing, was nice to chill and sweat out the hustle and bustle surrounded by monkeys and nature. A must for me for any visit to Singapore."
,,MacRitchie Resevoir & Tree Top,4.0,,MachMacRitchie Resevoir is one of the oldest reservoir in Singapore. Its main purpose is to provide drinking water for Singapore consumption and recreation activities for the common park users.
,,Most Under-rated Experience,5.0,,"This is truly a unique experience. My Singapore friends are all shocked we went here and most of them have never been. From a beautiful walk on the lake to the canopy walk through the jungle leading to the bridge, relaxing adventure. I could have watched the wild monkeys all day!!! There is plenty of other wildlife and Cobras are in the park although I didn't see any (thank God!!)!!!

Be prepared for the Singapore heat. Brings good walking shoes and plenty of water. Transportation is sketchy. Suggest you use the taxi app to order a car when you're done. It is not a frequented stop. I did see a lot of busses but subway isn't too close. Highly recommend."
,,Get into some jungle,4.0,,"Great for a trek or a run, full of sounds and dense jungle. Apart from monkeys and squirrels surprisingly free from animals."
,,Nature Walk!,3.0,,Great for nature lovers. Nice and refreshing walk - for all. Take your time and enjoy. Good for families even with little children.
,,Nice walk. Take water! Definitely worth the trip if you have time to spare or have never experienced tropical forests.,4.0,,"Got taxi to drop us off at Venus Drive off Upper Thompson Road which is the closest you can get to the start. Still a 3.6km walk from here. Nice walk, next to the golf course road at first but becomes more 'foresty'. Canopy walkway itself was impressive, one way only but follow the signs via the ranger station to be at the right end. We left a different way, past the tower then exited via Simie Road onto Lorrie Road so we could flag a taxi as there would be no passing traffic at Venus Drive drop off."
,,Jungle and monkeys,5.0,,"We spent an afternoon walking around MacRitchie Reservoir, including the Tree Top Walk. The walk is through forest and along the reservoir, sometimes on a board walk and otherwise a regular track. We saw monkeys and lizards, and many beautiful plants. It's at all not hard, but it was very hot - so bring lots of water!"
,,Walk along the jungle in Singapore.,5.0,,"You might think that the island won't have any trail but here in Singapore, they have it. Along the 10 kms trail from around reservoir to tree top walk, you will see jungle and lots of monkeys (do not feed them). You can take MRT and walk or take the bus to get here."
,,Great place for the nature lovers,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore for over a week and do have at least half a day to spend, then don't miss this Nature Park.. The place has a very big water body and few man made trails through which you can walk along... You can also go to the Tree Top walk which is located at a distant corner of the park.. If you want to visit the MacRitchie reservoir and the Park, get down at St Theresa Home bus stop... If you want to go for the Tree Top walk (which is open till 5pm only), then get down at Windsor Park bus stop and explore the jungle path which will take you to the Tree Top walk..."
,,A good day out and an easy walk,5.0,,"I visited last Saturday and walked the nature trial route from the Reservoir Park to the Tree Top Walk - 5km, reasonably flat and took around an hour to reach the ranger hut where there are toilets and water fountains.

The reservoir/south entrance is only around a 10 minute walk from Caldecott MRT Station. Just turn left and walk down the hill towards the dual carriageway/Thomson Road. Cross to the other side of Thomson Road, turn right and walk straight ahead following the flyover.

Right at the start of the walk there were 4 or 5 monkeys loitering, eyeing me up for food to steal! Saw another group half way along the trail, but no more until the ranger station. In hindsight, I should have walked the Petai Trail/by the reservoir then joined the forest track. This would have meant around a 3km walk through the forest instead of the full 5km. Not that there's anything wrong with the forest but the sights are more or less the same until you reach the Tree Top Walk.

It's then only a 5 minute walk from the ranger station to the tree tops. The iconic bridge of the Tree Top Walk is only around 100 yards long but is well worth it for the experience and the views. After the bridge there is a board walk trail which takes you back near the ranger station - all in all around 30 minutes.

I left the park by the Venus Link which brings you out by Upper Thomson Road (around 2.8km). From here you can get a bus back towards town or to the likes of Marymount MRT station.

All in all, a good day out. Plan for being there for at least 3-4 hours though. Definitely bring water and an umbrella with you. A change of t-shirt wouldn't go amiss either as the heat and humidity can be something else. I didn't see or have any problems with mosquitos, etc, but it wouldn't do any harm to bring repellent I suppose.

It's free so enjoy!"
,,Great way to spend a day,5.0,,In Singapore for the day and was totally sick of the malls and high speed city life. So this was a good alternative. Amazing nature in the metropolitan.
,,A green oasis in the heart of a metropolis,5.0,,MacRitchie National Park is my favorite spot in Singapore and is on my must visit list during every visit to Singapore. It's hard to believe that within minutes one can leave the hustle & bustle of a metropolis and can be in the lap of mother nature with the vast expanse of tropical rain forest offering the visitor several options of trekking. I have been to this park 4 times and every time I have discovered a new trekking trail ranging from 3 kms to 8 kms. The huge reservoir supplies water to the city and also offers boating facilities to the members of the boat club. The tree top walk at an height of about 90 feet offers a wonderful view of the forest & the tree canopies and should not be missed. The tree top walk remains closed on Mondays. During the trek one can come across monkeys & several variety of birds.
,,A good hike on a mild day,4.0,,"This is a good trail with very nice views, and it's not too hard. Obviously with the activity being outdoors, it is better when it is not too hot and humid!"
,,"Rich Greenery, Great way to exercise too!",5.0,,A very enjoyable walk through the Nature Trail. Being one with Nature! Excellent way to relax! Try the canopy walk
,,One of best spots in Singapore,5.0,,"We hoped to see a monkey or two on our visit to MacRitchie Reservoir Park nature trails. Happily, we saw around 20! Visiting early on a Sun morning, we saw a large group of long tailed macaques making their way through the trees to find breakfast, shaking down fruits and enjoying them on the ground. This was before we even reached the nature trails! We opted for the boardwalk Prunus/Petai Trail and enjoyed a leisurely hike through the jungle, crossing paths with butterflies, monitor lizards and singing birds. The flowers and foliage were beautiful and we walked around the reservoir where many were rowing across the water. Bring water and wear mosquito repellent to stay comfortable on the walk. The quieter you are, the more wildlife you're likely to see."
,,Amazing place for a long walk,5.0,,I love walking the trails here. The view is fabulous. Don't carry food around dusk as the monkeys are out in force.
,,Worth It!,5.0,,"This place proves Singapore is not all about shopping! Its hot yes, but beautiful walks by the lake. You will see monkeys, even up close if you like...and other wild life. Go around the whole lake n venture into the treetops walk! Nice peaceful day out of the busy city!"
,,"Fun, but be prepared...",4.0,,"Bring mosquito repellent, and lots of it.
Bring water if you're planning to do a long walk.
The park gets crowded on the weekends, it's a popular running path / rowing area.
You are almost guaranteed to see monkeys here. They are very used to people.

It's a 10-15 minute walk from Caldecott Stn (mrt).
There are many buses that drop you off right in front."
,,Jungle fever ;),5.0,,5km long walk each way through the jungle. Last visit to the HSBC top tree walk is about 4.45pm. Would not recommend to rush this walk as in the heat it is not too pleasant. Various sounds of nature and occasionally a monkey appears.
,,Pretty amazing trail in the heart of the city,5.0,,We had limited time but I would recommend committing 4-5 hours at least to explore this oasis in the heart of the city. Easily accessible by the MRT.
,,Refreshing walk through Nature,5.0,,"The Long walk is worth it, must be prepared for undulating footpath, leisure walk throughout the 3k walk is recommended, very refreshing nature walk , been there a few time each visit is a different experience."
,,Not touristic. best place for nature - By serendip Traveller,5.0,,"It was totally about 14km trail around the ""MacRitchie Reservoir"" is a free and nice hike all around the forest and wet lands. I saw many wild Macaques, birds, k Makes me totally forget we are in a part of a busy city .The treetop walk along a bridge above the forest was amazing. highly recommending to visit this for Nature lovers."
,,tree top walk,4.0,,"The tree top walk at MacRitchie is well worth the time to take the walk. There are lots of monkeys along the way and when we visited there were a lot of babies with them.
The swing bridge is just that It is high and you are definitely at the tree tops! Have a great view of the surrounding area from the bridge."
,,Nice nature walk,4.0,,"Suitable for walking, hiking or running, it is a breather away from the city life in singapore. The tree top walk is pretty amazing and worth a visit."
,,MacRitchie,4.0,,"This is worth the effort. It is a bit of a hike and you should bring along some water, but the terrain is pretty flat."
,,Great scenery - bring water,4.0,,"Git a bit lost with the signposting and ended walking much further than intended and didn't like that there was no turning back once you reached a certain point. This would be very stressful for those with a phobia of heights. Not fond of heights myself but wanted to do this.
Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes, take water and a camera.
Beautiful scenery and a lot of wildlife. Be careful of carrying plastic bags as you might get mugged by the macaques."
,,Easy trail in the middle of the city,4.0,,"One of the best things in Singapore for those who are on a budget and enjoy the outdoors. We usually meet up at the Bukit Timah Rifle Range and work our way to the Mac Ritchie Reservoir.

I suggest to bring water but avoid bringing food (even in plastic bags) because the monkeys like to attack and will go after your food."
,,Beautiful park in the center of the Island,4.0,,"We thought it would be easy to find the Nature Trail, but it's quite a distance from the parking area to the start of the trail, and then it's another 5 KM after that. What they don't tell you is the last entry is at 4:45 PM (at least in the early fall) so we didn't get there in time to do the whole thing. Still, it was a peaceful oasis far from the tourist areas. I'd suggest hiking the Southern Ridges trail from Henderson Waves Bridge if you only have time for one hike."
,,must visit place for trail runner in Singapore,4.0,,"This is one of my favorite place when I get to Singapore. The 10 + km nature trail with large tree canopies will make you easily forget that you're in so called modern metropolitan. Try to come to this place early morning or early evening (as they do close at night). This place has a canteen, toilet and changing room"
,,Back to nature,4.0,,"Want to getaway from the crowd when in Singapore? Go to MacRitchie Reservoir Park. The park is suitable for people who love jogging as well as people who want to have some fresh air that is far away from city transportations. Exploring the fantastic scenery of the park while going hiking to Tree Top Walk or rowing kayak, you may see some creatures such as monkeys and birds during your journey. Visit the park by taking the bus from Caldecott MRT station. Enjoy yourself at the peaceful park of Singapore!"
,,Tree top walk,4.0,,Easy 2.5hr walk in the cool forest shade away from the haze! Easy pace and easy terrain. Definitely check out the view on the tree top bridge and watch out for the monkeys! Avoid bringing your bags so they have nothing to grab! Some monkeys are really aggressive :(
,,Get some fresh air away from the city !,4.0,,"Great place to chill and walk among nature, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Bring mosquito repellant and an umbrella/poncho ! You'll most likely need it."
,,Great hike in Singapore,5.0,,"If you have some extra time in Singapore and are undaunted by the heat and humidity, the MacRitchie Nature Trail is a must. It's one of the last bits of secondary rainforest left in Singapore. The Tree Top Walk is amazing - you walk on a suspension bridge right over the canopy of the forest. Lots of other interesting stops along the way, as well as several different trails. It's best to head out early in the day, as it can get quite hot and your chances of getting rained on increase throughout the day (depending on the time of the year)."
,,"Free attraction, superb atmosphere but no water fountains or taps",4.0,,"The place was easy to get to by metro to Commonwealth station, then walk 6 minutes to a bus stop opposite Queensway High School. Both bus routes 855 and 93 take you to the door of MacRitchie reservoir. There is no admission fee and the walk around the entire MacRitchie trail is 11 Kms; as we stopped for pictures of the trees and monkeys and for breaks it took us about 4 hours. So start early and carry lots of water to avoid heat stroke because there are no water taps, no water fountains and no drink dispensing machines for the entire circuit. The suspension bridge is about 5 Kms from the start and once you pass the end of the bridge you have to continue the full circuit. From the bridge there were fantastic views of the greenery and the board walk was very pretty by the water reservoir. The section of the walk by the golf course wasn't bad either, and the journey ended at a rest area with pretty flowers, benches and water views. We saw only a few monkeys but plenty of large lizards, squirrels, colourful birds and butterflies, and of course lots of very tall trees. There's a coffee shop 'Mushroom Cafe' at the end too, with rather affordable drinks including freshly squeezed juice, and a variety of cheap lunches. Overall a great relaxing experience very close to the city and well worth it."
,,Good trail with close contact to monkeys,5.0,,"We did the 3h trail from the Venus Drive. You will meet a lot of monkeys on the way. On the suspension bridge, a couple of monkeys stand just a few centimeters next to you when you go through. they might try to stealth your items, be aware."
,,Amazing trail,5.0,,It was a real surprise to find such a beautiful and wild trail in the middle of the busy city. It is an easy trail which makes you switch off from everything.
,,A green hike or run,4.0,,"There are many trails within the MacRitchie Reservoir Park that are great for exercising, exploring nature or just to get away from the city's bustle. Like most jungles, it is not spectacular, but rather pleasant. Some places have explanatory signs with information about species present. The absolute highlight is the Treetop Walk, where you arrive at a one-way suspension bridge with a great view of the jungle. There are normally a lot of monkeys in this area. They are not to be feared, but avoid contact if you can. Do not bring plastic bags or items in plastic wrappers, as the monkeys will associate it with food and aggressively snatch it. Feeding the monkeys is an offense and should be avoided at all times."
,,Serene Morning Walk,4.0,,There are multiple trails in this park and the best part of the attraction is the Tree top walk on the free-standing suspension bridge. The Tree top walk is approx 2- 2.5 km from Venus Drive car park.
,,Beautiful trails,5.0,,"MacRitchie reservoir boasts of multiple picturesque trails which are interconnected. One could try a short 4km walk or cover the entire area which would mean over 15 kms of ground to be covered. The reserve is well maintained and the forest itself is quite dense. One can be almost certain to come across a few animal, bird and insect species. Comfortable clothing for jogging/trekking and a bottle of drinking water are essential. There are many bits with steep gradients or steps and covering the entire park could become a bit physically demanding. The reserve also has some small unmarked pathways that can be explored, provided time and energy levels support. It is always better to plan this as a full day activity; but is a must see place in Singapore."
,,Get out of the concrete jungle and into the real jungle,5.0,,"There are several walks in the MacRitchie Reservoir area that can take you into the real jungle rather than the human jungle that is Singapore. On a hot humid day, which is most days, the best walk to see the rainforest for least energy spent is the Petai walk. As well as the ubiquitous monkeys we saw a 1metre monitor lizard, geckos, squirrels, numerous birds and tropical plants. The walk is well signed with interesting information on a range of subjects. We took the MRT to Marymount station and an easy walk to the reservoir, although use of a map is required for the walk as the reservoir is not well signposted. Highly recommended and only half an hour by train from Singapore central."
,,"Petai Trail, MacRitchie Reservoir",4.0,,"Built in the late 19th century, MacRitchie Reservoir is Singapore's first reservoir. The forest around the reservoir was protected as a water catchment reserve but can be enjoyed by the numerous trails, one of which is the Petai Trail.

The Petai Trail, a relatively long and quiet boardwalk trail, skirts the water edges of the reservoir allowing one to be able to see more of the local flora and fauna. Be prepared to see butterflies like the pretty common posy, turtles, monitor lizards basking in the sun or swimming in the placid waters, birds like the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo and squirrels amid the gnarly bark of the Tembusu, Petai, Chestnut and Oak (yes, you read it right).

One of the best time to explore this trail is early morning where cool breezes waft through the shady trees. Benches are positioned at strategic viewing locations and a sheltered hut is located some midway along the trail.

The Prunus-Petai Trail stretches out 3 km from the eastern end of the reservoir where the kayak shed is. At the end of the Petai Trail would be the MacRitchie Nature Trail again, where one can walk along back to MacRitchie Reservoir Park or retrace one's path back to the start."
,,calm and serene,5.0,,"a great tranquil area after the busy Orchard Road or China Town and Little India, good variety of flora"
,,"Great trail run (or hike), do not miss the Tree Top Walk, and beware of monkeys! :)",4.0,,"This is a great nature trail with a variety of sights and a good amount of tree coverage for shade. I chose to run the loop around the reservoir, clockwise. It ended up being a little over 8 mi or over 12.5 km.

* About the first 2.5 miles are along a boardwalk right on the reservoir
* Around mile 3: There is a lookout tower, 5 or 6 stories to the top
* Around mile 5: Tree Top Walk, very cool pedestrian bridge, one-way only

The wooden stairs after the tree top bridge is where I saw a monkey. It followed us for a bit and watched the pedestrian traffic. Then, in one of the resting huts, it snuck up on this guy and stole his lunch bag! The monkey climbed up on the roof of the hut with his tail hanging 2 feet down. You could hear him opening the plastic bag...enjoying his newly found lunch. Be careful...they're tricky...those monkeys. :)

TIP: Since I ran clockwise and the tree top walk is one-way, I ended up doubling back maybe 1/2 mile. If you don't want to re-trace your steps, hike counter-clockwise from the parking lot. Definitely bring water. It's *hot* in Singapore. I ran & hiked it in about 2 hours. If you want to walk the whole loop, I would estimate about 3.5 hours."
,,Tree To Walk review,4.0,,"We caught the bus to the park and proceeded along the walking trail which commences at the main car park. We saw a dozen monkeys as we entered but saw no more on the rest of the walk. It is a moderate to difficult walk with many unmade and uneven walking trails as well as many steps, particularly on leaving the tree to walkway itself. It is a long walk which became a little messy as it poured with rain on our return walk to the car park. Although there were some rest stops near the tree top walk, some needed to be added along the whole length of the trails. It is a pity that there is no vehicle supplied to enable easier access to the actual tree top walk itself."
,,Hiking like the local,5.0,,"We decided to do hiking like the local and arrived the park at 6:30 in the morning. It was still dark but many local peoples have started doing exercises already. We arrived the tree top at 8am but it will only open at 9am. So, we get a reason to come back next time. We completed the yellow route in 3.5hours by walking slowly. The lake was nice in the moring."
,,Interesting walk with lots to see,4.0,,"It was quite surprising to see a nature trail so close to the city. But lots to see, and really quite a fun and challenging hike through 14Km of rocks, trees, suspension bridges (optional) and small springs. The monkeys added some entertainment too."
,,Tree top walk is a refreshing break from the concrete jungle that is Singapore,4.0,,"Try the Tree Top Walk, there's a suspended bridge along part of the trail. Beware of some monkeys that you may spot on your way though, do not try to feed them or get close to them."
,,A lovely nature reserve for a walk on a cool afternoon.,4.0,,"This reservoir has been very popular with walkers and joggers since WW2, and possibly earlier. The paths and boardwalks have been regularly upgraded and maintained for the safety and convenience of visitors of all ages, from babies in prams to octogenarians with walking sticks. It is especially pleasant if the weather is cool and breezy. Allow at least one hour, and enjoy."
,,Tree Top Walk,4.0,,"There are several trails at MacRitchie, but the highlight would have to be the Tree Top Walk, where you get to cross a suspension bridge high above ground and the trees!

We followed the recommended guide from the Singapore National Parks website, and begin our trail from the entrance at Venus Drive. Normally I would take the MRT when getting around in Singapore, but there isn't a station nearby, so we took bus 166 at alighted at Upper Thomson Road near the Esso petrol station.

Once you're there, just follow the signs that say Tree Top Walk and you'll find your way to the bridge. You should know that the bridge is designed for one way traffic, so once you cross the bridge, you would have to take the Petaling trail which consists of many staircase steps to loop back to the Ranger's station. There are several huts along the trail to rest up, and a toilet at the Ranger's station.

The whole walk back to the Venus drive entrance will take about 2 to 3 hours. We didn't see any monkeys, but was lucky enough to spot a monitor lizard crossing the path!"
,,Nature paradise,5.0,,"Love this tree top walk. I am a massive nature fan and I am delighted every time I visit, I once even spotted a rare colugo!"
,,Calm and good,4.0,,"nature at its best, came here for a calm and relax walk and quiet and gfreenary and comfortable. Good hike"
,,best natural park for trekking in Singapore,5.0,,"Easy to access, many different trails for all kind of people, clean, many facilities, wildlife, paths almost always between trees to avoid the hot sun, and all 100% free."
,,Nice walk/hike and amazing views!,4.0,,"My husband and I chose to walk the MacRitchie trail, near the reservoir, including the suspension bridge, on our last day in Singapore. It did not disappoint. Accessible via SMRT buses, but we chose to take a taxi there and hailed another close to bus pick-up to get back to our hotel. Best in early morning, from both a crowd and heat stand point. Everyone along the trail was courteous and helpful. Some rugged terrain and close to suspension bridge, stairs up and down. Would recommend for a great half day excursion."
,,Nice walk in MacRitche.,5.0,,"great place for children biking, skating and elderly to engage themselves Ina brisk walk without much traffic.This is accessible by SMRT buses."
,,best to come very early in the mornings,4.0,,"trails come with different levels of difficulties, but generally not that difficult to get there. can be crowded (and noisy) at times during weekends."
,,amazing views and jungle sounds,5.0,,Great jungle walk and free entry. We saw monkeys and different birds and butterflies. Best to use insect repellant if bugs like biting you. Great views from the tree top walk. Allow plenty of time to enjoy. The signs in km are often to the next sign. We ended up walking 7k (kids were complaint by the end) but well worth the walk.
,,Peaceful serenity in MacRitchie,5.0,,"We visited some friends who live opposite here. Didn't know a place like this in Singapore. While walking on the trail you would not know you are in a large city. Passed many people walking & running. Didn't do the whole trail but the section we did was very
serene."
,,Amazing and so close to city,5.0,,"combine with the Tree top walk. Animals, birds, trees flowers, insects. Great directions. Download the online guides"
,,Best morning forrest walk,5.0,,"We were discussing for long time to visit, and we made it, best morning Forrest walk and we did perform 2 routes. bridge opens at 8:30 AM. Minimum to walk is 10 KMs"
,,Into the woods!,5.0,,"Be prepared to encounter the monkeys! It's not often to see a bunch of monkeys lying around chilling in the trees in such a modernized country like Singapore. MacRitchie provides a great place for everyone to stick with the green and enjoy the fresh air as well as to escape the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle. Anyhow, the nature trail is quite a tiring journey as it goes uphill. If i'm not wrong, the route I took on that day was the ""Tree Top Walk"". BRING WATER before going uphill. This will keep yourself hydrated because the weather in Singapore can be very warm sometimes.
On the other hand, the markers are badly marked. It's written 500m but it feels like 1km from a walker's perspective.
Anyhow, this place is well-maintained so read the trails properly! Saw a couple of people ignoring the rules (going against a one-way trail) causing chaos because the pathway was quite narrow. But all in all, I had fun here!"
,,Great escape in the city!,5.0,,"Great hike (15km all around) but you have escape pods if you feel tired. Saw monkeys, birds, tree walk, turtles, .... Makes you totally forget you are in the middle of a busy city."
,,Nature and exercise collide,5.0,,"Walk it every time I am in Singapore, 12 km of trail and forest. Bring a spare shirt. There is water approximately half way round. I find the clockwise way around to be an easier start"
,,"Beautiful, but not well marked",4.0,,"This nature park is beautiful and has well maintained trails. However, the signage is lacking and you can quickly find yourself on a path much longer than you initially intended to walk. The monkeys are quite aggressive so watch out. The treetop walk is average so that's something to consider when deciding to make the trek."
,,nice half day in the woods,4.0,,This was about a 3.5 hour hike.taxi dropped us off.we picked up water but they only had a few bottles.bring yours with you as there is nowhere along the trail to get water or snacks.you can start by walking along the water but you won't see much wildlife if you choose that route.in the forest you'll see macaques and monitor lizards.when you get to the rangers station after doing the canopy walk you can go out via the parking lot route as its a bit shorter at that point.you can just flag a taxi down at the end of the street.it's free and there is not much in Singapore that you can say that about!
,,Prepare for a minimum 3 hours hike.,4.0,,"Entire trail is about 11km, with sandy and rocky path mainly. Couple of rest stop with shelter and toilet along the way, but is few km apart.
Be prepare for a minimum of 3 hrs hike. Extra 1.5 km if you intend to branch out to the tree top walk. We completed in more than 3.5 hrs total, much longer than we expected.
Do bring drinking water, wear proper foot wear, umbrella if require. Also, we make a mistake of not taking breakfast, thinking it is a shorter walk. We end up too hungry at the end of walk. So, maybe a light meals before is advisable.
There is a food outlet at the entrance."
,,Great hike!,4.0,,"I've been to the MacRitchie area three times now. I highly recommend the trail that takes you over the suspension bridge. It is very safe, and gives you a great view of the forest roof and surrounding area. Bring lots of water, and try to go early on in the day to avoid the heat. There are toilets at the ranger station close to the bridge. Don't forget it is one way only, so no turning back. It is slippery when raining, but still doable. Avoid the monkeys! And don't feed them!"
,,Nice green getaway from the concrete.,5.0,,"Worthwhile to get away from the ever developing cityscape. Lots of exercise happens with joggers and serious walkers but the boardwalk is well worth a gentle stroll. Saw monitor lizard swimming, monkeys playing and grooming, lots of fish and birds. Just a really pleasant walk."
,,Nice 10 k+ walk or jog,5.0,,"Lovely secondary rainforest, some monkeys and monitor lizards, lovely views of the reservoir. Add the tree-top walk for an authentic jungle experience Singapore style. A station to add sit ups or pull ups for those who do not only want to do cardio. Great!"
,,Wow. 12km of Serious Trekking.,5.0,,"The title is only true if you're not in physical shape. Which admittedly held true for my BF and I. We're in our early 30's, but our fairly sedentary lifestyle and easy pace of traveling while abroad was put to the test on this not-so-gentle trail that featured rocky terrain, slopes, steps, and for our last 4km, walking in torrential downpour with only the protection of our $1.90 rain jacket (lifesaver -- pick one up from uh... not Guardian/Watson/7-11 or a half dozen other shops we tried. We finally located them at a shop in Toa Payoh, but I think you'll have better luck with a mom/pop shop that sells random stuff, like electronics next to cheap cosmetics.)

We opted for the TreeTop trail which is roughly over 11km, and the minute we stepped onto the trail we were greeted by those famous monkeys. The path featured beautiful and lush flora and soaring green canopies. It was strange to be reminded that we weren't so far from civilization from the occasion sounds of construction, or to see the putting green and ""Do Not Trespass"" signs of the Golf Club it was surrounded by...

We were outpaced twice over by walkers/runners between ages of 15-70, but until a group of Chinese tourists showed up, we hardly saw anyone during the first 6km. We were the only ones who were at the bridge when we arrived, and after passing by one monkey, I turned to watch my BF, only to see the monkey checking him out and as soon as he walked past it, the monkey reached down and grabbed a plastic bag out of his back pocket. It dropped to the ground, my BF reached and picked it up and the monkey did not look pleased. That was the only agitated monkey we saw... the rest would scurry away as soon as we got near.

It took us close to 3 hours to close the loop. Yes, bring plenty of water. Bring a rain poncho, wear breathable, close-toed shoes, I put on mosquito repellent but I don't know whether there were any mosquitoes.

Great walk, beautiful reservoir and park, the cafe to the right of the entrance had everything from curry/sardine puffs (yum!), coconuts, huge serving of ice kacang for $3, to I think, pasta dishes. It seemed like a popular stop for students.

Great way to spend a day!"
,,Singapore Sanctuary,5.0,,We were lucky to have friends take us for a lap around the reserve while staying on a 3 night stay in Singapore. What a great little haven of serenity away from the hustle & bustle. We spotted a large monitor lizard on our walk & there is a lovely boardwalk that runs along the edge of the water & various options from 12 km to 5 km walks.To access we caught the MRT out to Botanic Gardens then walked down to the bus stop by Adams rd then caught the bus a few stops to Lornie St & the reserve was accessible from there.
,,Nice walk around the trails...,4.0,,"Beautiful walk and highly recommended. Don't feed the Monkeys and be careful to bring food, etc. on the trail. t is a bit long though if you walk all the way around..."
,,Loved this!,5.0,,"Get out of the cities ""perfect state"" and into nature's trails and high top tracks. This walk takes roughly anywhere from an hour if you're a gun and running to 2.5hrs. Definitely bring a water bottle and joggers to do the walk as it is sometimes a little rocky and hilly. Many boardwalks are along the way too though. The walkway across the tree tops is really beautiful and has a sway about it that is pretty fun."
,,A long walk in the forest,5.0,,"A good and refreshing walk of about 9kms through the forest. The route is not kid friendly and so if you have small kids, it might be difficult. My 4 year old did walk but it was very tiring for all of us. Carry water bottles as there is only one water refill station near the ranger station before the start of the hill climb to reach the suspended bridge."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Although there is nothing particularly special about this nature walk, it is still very cool to immerse yourself in a rainforest in the middle of a city. Definitely worth a 30 min - 1 hour hike along the path."
,,"Clean , well maintained boardwalk at the waterfront",5.0,,"This is a place for everyone - joggers, walkers, nature lovers. The main entrance is accessible by many buses and nearest MRT station is Caldecott with a very short taxi ride. Those who drive get to enjoy free parking for the 1st hour.

I always take the Lornie trail and the loop takes less than 1 hour if you exit the trail to join Lornie Rd. It is a quiet spot with more joggers in the early morning and evening. Do not enter after 7pm because there are no lights along the trail.

Off Lim Bo Seng memorial, get up the dirt track before walking the boardwalk, which is well maintained. You can go as far as the golf course ( SCC ) and even towards the tree top walk some 10 km down. Set aside 4 hours to do this. Be prepared to pass by grass snakes, monkeys and the odd pangolin.

My favorite spot ? The edge of the reservoir where the waters meet the golf course."
,,Nice experience but too much crowded when I visited,3.0,,"A sense of ""wild"" nature, but during week ends it is rather crowded and we had to queue to take the suspended bridge!. With small kids, the queue was too long and we had to turn back, disappointing after a 1 hour walk. Otherwise during week days, this must be a good park to walk around because you may have a rather ""wild"" feeling."
,,Do not underestimate this walk,3.0,,"11km may not seem like much but with the heat and humidity it proved quite difficult. The wildlife and trees were great although for 11kms I had hoped for better. Easily assessable from the city by bus. If you have a spare day then do it, but don't worry if you miss it"
,,Beautiful Nature Walk,5.0,,This is a great place to get away from the city! It's a great hike so plan lots of time for it and take plenty of water. We chose to spend about 4 1/2 hours hiking around the waters edge and following different paths. The monkeys with babies were fun to see from a distance! Do NOT feed them!! It was about a 15 minute walk from the Caldecott mrt. The views and wildlife are beautiful!
,,A walk in the rainforest,5.0,,"Quite easy to access by bus. The walk isn't difficult and is fairly flat. It's best to take water as I didn't see a refreshment kiosk. The canopy walk is well organised, being one way and is very scenic. We saw lots of monkeys on the trail."
,,Excellent Trail of natural beauty!,4.0,,"This is one of the awesome places for trekking in Singapore, I've already been here a few times but still want to go there more. The 11 km trek is excellent place to re-charge away from all the hustle bustle of Singapore. Its a place where you'll find some monkeys, monitor lizard, squirrels, decent lake, chirping birds, smell of the woods. Carry couple of bottles of water with you when you go for the trek as there are very few places in there where you can find drinking water. You can even carry some food along and eat it at the tree top tower. Enjoy the trek"
,,Take plenty of water and do the 11km trek,5.0,,"This is an amazing place where you can see wild monkeys, squirrels and the odd monitor lizard. There 11km walk is not easy in the heat but well worth it. Take plenty of water and a good hat. You can refill your water bottles (and take a well-deserved toilet break) at the ranger's hut more or less at the halfway point. The cafe at the start is quite good and perfect for a (generous) sandwich and cold drink after your walk. You can take the MRT - get off at Caldecott and it's a short walk to the main entrance. Did we say take plenty of water?"
,,The Best Nature Walk in Singapore,5.0,,"This trail is amazing, very closed to the city, easy access by public transportation, so natural, fresh air, beautiful bird chirping, nice smell of the woods, stunning treetop walk, very well organized and maintained, and all for free, no fee needs to be paid. We took bus no 167 from in front of our hotel on Scotts Road. It took 15 min, costs $1.20 per person. We stopped at Upper Thomson Road near Venus Loop. Then we just followed the path and other people who jogged. The path is not so crowded, and yet not so quiet, so we feel safe. There are 5 routes that we can choose. The best ones are routes passing through the Treetop walk. From the Venus Loop there are 2 routes which pass through the Treetop. One route is about 4km, returning back to the Venus Loop. Another route which we took is about 11 km, finishing at the MacRitchie Park for 2 hours 45 minutes with medium speed. We passed through the Reservoir, golf course too. It was beautiful and highly recommended."
,,"Lovely views, but long walk",4.0,,"The treetop walk through the canopy is quite stunning! However, even walking slowly, you'll probably get to the other side in about 5 minutes. Be prepared as it's a long walk to and from the treetop walk. The nature trail and boardwalk is pleasant enough, but it's hot and steamy, so bring enough water."
,,whole loop not for the faint hearted,4.0,,We have done quite a bit of walking here as it's the only decent trail in Singapore. However be warned it's a loop of 11.5km and once you're started you're in the middle of nowhere and have to keep going. Also make sure you've got adequate water because there are NO water fountains or any other water supply along the whole of the route.
,,Our fav hangout,4.0,,We used to go here every weekend to walk for over an hour in the morning. Check out the boardwalk at the end of the reservoir
,,Fantastic place to walk off Clarke and Robertsons Quay drink and food explosion :),5.0,,"Fantastic place to walk off Clarke and Robertsons Quay drink and food explosion :) In some places it's like walking in the jungle. Superb, and interesting wild life. Saw monkeys and a 4 foot lizard thing (it was impressive!) an eagle and many other bits and pieces. Wear light clothing, it's hot but enjoyable."
,,Connect with Nature,5.0,,"It's a great place in the city where you can unwind and stretch. Numerous trails are designed to suit one's preference. we undertook the 'Tree Top' trail and enjoyed the walk thoroughly. Was great being able to walk and be close to Nature. The highlight of this trail is crossing the one-way bridge ontop of trees.

It's an easy walk with very gradual uphill/downhill. We did see 02 monitor lizards and was exciting but I would not have wanted to spot a snake at all (though there are signs mentioning beware of snakes), I would not have enjoyed this walking trail as much then.

Keep in mind to carry a few bottles of water and some nuts or energy bars, we were very tired and hungry by the end of the walk and there are no cafe etc inside to purchase anything...so be prepared and enjoy the walk."
,,Endulge in true jungle experience withing the metropolitan city of Singapore,5.0,,"Great tree top walk. Possible for running around the Macritchie reservoir (5.4 or 12km trail). Go early morning to see real snakes, monkeys, birds, squirels, etc."
,,Nature experience,5.0,,This was a delightful walk but you must be fit to do the whole way We did a short walk and came back along the boardwalk. We saw the monkeys and a large monitor lizard swam along beside us. A friendly turtle came to see what we are doing and posed for a photo. It was peaceful away from the hustle of the city. As previous people have advised do not take plastic bags with food as the monkeys will descend on you and take the bag. It can be very scary.
,,A peaceful break from the city,5.0,,"The 11km trail around the reservoir is lovely. You can take your time and stop off at the little huts dotted along the way. You don't have to go all the way round but if you can make it to the 5km mark, the treetop walk along a suspension bridge above the jungle canopy is fantastic and gives lovely views across the reserve to the reservoir.

I saw lots of wild Macaque monkeys and large monitor lizards. Very cool.

Bring lots of water!!"
,,A highlight of monkeys in the wild!,5.0,,"I really wanted to see monkeys in their natural habitat. I read a review about this place on trip advisor. It was hard to reach. We went to another reserve which was closed for upgrading. We asked a jogger about this one and he said we need a taxi to get there as we had come on the train. Then he drove us there in his BMW. It took about 15 mins. Yes we ignored stranger danger ! Anyway he dropped us at the entrance and we asked at the cafe where to see monkeys. We then walked a very short distance to the reservoir entrance where the walking trails start and there were the monkeys! All playing happily on the edge of the jungle. I was very sad after our walk, as on our return to the start of the trail, all the monkeys were gone! My husband sat down on the grass and starting eating an apple, then suddenly they came out of trees and tracks running over to him! It was a wonderful encounter. The monkeys were little and very cute and we watched them playing. It was the highlight. No tourists. It's a locals area. Worth the trek from the city for animal lovers."
,,One of the best nature trail I've been in 20 years!,5.0,,"Getting tired of the urban jungle? Then try this trail, for a nature lover like me, this place is heaven! It will take you 3 to 4 hours to try the trails, we started at Venus drive, followed the trail going to Treetop walk to Jelutong Tower, Golf Link, Chemperai trail, Lonie trail and ended up at MacRitchie Reservoir Park. Be sure to bring a drinking water coz you will be in the middle of the jungle for 3 to 4 hours! Make sure to wear comfy clothes and shoes. bring some mosquito repellent. Always remember that it is prohibited to feed the monkeys so be extra careful! If you're a shutterbug like me, bring fresh batteries for sure you will enjoy the scenic trail specially Chemperai. Have fun!"
,,Nature Beauty within a City,5.0,,The MacRitchie Trails have so much to offer! Have visited it many times during morning and late afternoon. Certainly a nature beauty within a city!
,,A nice relaxing spot.,4.0,,"Just be weary of the cheeky monkeys. We spent about half an hour there just to see the monkeys and the scenery. Just watch those monkeys. Anyone who was carrying a plastic bag with anything in it got harassed by the monkeys who eventually would steal the bag or drink and take off with it. Apart from that, quite a nice spot."
,,great trek and amazing views,4.0,,"great trek even for the ones not very adventuorous and leads to amazing views from the top. a must do if in singapore for over 3 days and want to try something different from sentosa, malls and universal studios"
,,Excellent trekking experience,4.0,,Excellent trekking experience overlooking half of Singapore. Must remember to bring a towel and a full bottle of water. Long 2-3 hour Hike in the urban-inistic tree tops ! If you end at
,,A delightful excursion,5.0,,"A jungle walk on a well-maintained path. The MacRitchie trail proved a favourite with adults and kids alike. The prospect of seeing monkeys, snakes, large lizards and the like kept us on our toes. Singapore is remarkable in that such an environment exists only a few kliks from the urban sprawl."
,,A long hot hike,5.0,,Walked the tree top trail to the bridge. 10k in total. Quite hard going in some spots due to stoney ground. Take lots of water. Refill available at ranger station just before bridge. Only one way round soonceover bridge cannot turn back. An excellent adventure
,,It's an average park as far as I'm concerned,3.0,,Basically it's an average park with lush green trails and some water. It's not anything that I would say is special unless you are a nature lover and really need your fix of nature. You may see monkeys and you'll see some nature. I've done a few trails now and don't plan on going back.
,,Secondary jungle trail close to residential area,4.0,,"Secondary jungle trail close to housing area ,next to golf course and water reservoir. There are few trails and the longest is about 4.8km. You can find monkeys and some interesting trees and plants"
,,I do this with my best friend regularly,5.0,,"My bestie loves hiking so do I. unfortunately, Singapore lacks options when it comes to hiking /treks, but it does wet our appetite by places like macRitchie or mount Faber, where you can do long walks if nothing else. we also usually go to this place if we are in a mood for kayaking. so give it a go if outdoors is your thing and you are craving some piece of mother nature..."
,,The Treetop Walk Is Great!,5.0,,"Being our first trip to MacRitchie Nature Trail, my family found it extremely accessible by public transport. We caught a bus to nearby stop and walked only few hundred metres to the Venus Drive Entry and start of the walk we wanted to cover to see the Treetop Walk.

The loop we did was fun, paths are on good to fair condition. Signage is poor to average!
The treetop walk is a one-way only walk, but as we progressed we encountered a number of people going in the wrong direction. Puzzled initially how they could get it so wrong, upon completion of our return loop to Venus Drive, we now know it because of poor signage or lack of to be precise advising walkers of this.

It can be hot and humid, so be sure to take lots of water and food, and NOT in a plastic bag as the monkeys may chase you!"
,,Be prepared to walk,4.0,,"So for the tree top walk it is one way. This means if you drive there and then take the tree top walk, you cannot go back to the car except through a long hike. Its much better to take a taxi there so one is not tied down to a car.
Besides that it is great. It is like secondary forest so there is lot to walk through quite dense forest but then one feels safe you can always find your way out. There are a few routes to take so you are not tied down to one area. One can go for the tree top walk or you can climb up the observation tower etc
of course one must be prepared for the humidity."
,,loved every perspiration dripped from it,5.0,,only didnt like the Q at the treetop walk.... phew... the crowd was crazy!! the trail itself was fantastic. lack of a bicycle allowance to use the track - even at certain times is a major major bummer :(
,,Tropical forest close to public transport,5.0,,"It looks like real trekking in forest inspite you can reach it easily by bus. Nice to see monkeys playing in the trees.
Sorry that at the time of my visit there were quite a lot of soldiers with guns in the forest and I was frightened by that."
,,Amazing Scenery and great morning out!,4.0,,"A friend and I went on an early Sunday morning hike and walked the entire trail..in one word 'amazing'!! The Landscape is spectacular and you are truly in nature.
Top tips - go early as it gets hot and crowded later on and take LOTS of water as although you are next to a reservoir, It was hard to find water.
A friend of mine who went said there are taps along the way but i couldn't find them.."
,,Walk in the Clouds!,5.0,,"I needed a wee bit of tranquility after so much sensory overload, so we headed here for a bit of a walk. There are several hiking trails, but don't miss the Treetop Walk, which is a really long aerial suspension bridge spanning the two highest points within MacRitchie. The view is breathtaking!"
,,A great hike!,4.0,,"Aside from dealing with the rain and getting lost, this hike was definitely a different experience compared to most of Singapore tourist area. If you are looking for something to get away from the shopping and city feel of it all, I would definitely say taking a hike here is worth it. My only recommendation is to definitely make sure you check the weather/rain prior to the hike and to be weary of the monkeys as they do come and snatch your food or bags that look like food at Tree top. My boyfriend was a victim as a monkey attempted to steal our sunblock that was in a plastic bag and only dump it after he found out it wasn't food. Despite all of that, Tree Top is a great place/view once you get to the top."
,,unexpectedly good,5.0,,"i had fun enjoying the scenes during the walk. we spent about 3 hours there, it was pretty nice. we saw lots of birds, and monkeys. i happened to notice a monitor lizard digging the ground, i guess it was looking for food or maybe laying eggs. there was a bathroom stop which also providing water. the tree top was also great. other tourists who were there were also nice and polite."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"My father and I always go their for walks, runs. The trail is so great and the place is so refreshing and it's just such a great place to walk even just to hang out."
,,My favourite spot to walk in Singapore,5.0,,This is the best place to train for any walks or runs you have coming up. It's hot it's challenging it keeps you on your toes. I have a love hate relationship with it. All I know is if you have trained here most other things will be easy. :-)
,,Trakl running in the jungle,5.0,,"For many years i thought that in singapore there is no place for trail running. Then my wife told me to go once to the mc ritchie reservoir. I couldnt believe it. In the middle of the hustle and bustle of singapore there i a place which looks like in a remote island in malaysia. I always run around the lake (11 km). At the trailhead there are facilities like shower, restroom and a small cafe. The trail as such i well maintained and there are many exit points. Dont forget to bring along some water. Then enjoy the run."
,,A dream of a walk,5.0,,This nature trail offers the chance to all the people who love walking and enjoy the nature in a busy city like singapore . The scenic lake and the trail will leave you with sense of wonder - the easy access of it being not too far from the city is added advantage ..
,,What a serene and cool trail,5.0,,The trail wind along by the water edge and through the tall trees and bushes. So quiet except for crickets and other insect life. Another world from our bustling noisy city walks. Love the fresh air and safe feeling strolling there.
,,AMAZING hike!,5.0,,This place is amazing! the hikes are about 11km and the trail is fairly easy to do! it is beautiful and quiet. We visited the hanging bridge and the view is amazing! I will definitely be going back on a monthly basis for a nice long hike!
,,I go running here a lot,3.0,,"Not much to see really, except of the reservoir and maybe some monkeys if you are lucky. The treetop walk is ok. It's still not a bad walk by Singapore standards."
,,Good place to escape from city,3.0,,It's well-organised and maintained. Very clear marks and there are rest stops and signs. It's also suitable for different levels of fitness. U can just walk by lake if you are with toddler or your semiors. There is nothing interesting for tourists though
,,Nice quick escape,4.0,,"Great to leave the city behind and just have a couple of hours of nature. Do keep in mind, you're not the only one with that plan"
,,Beautiful jungle walk,5.0,,This is a great trail to walk through the jungle that used to cover most of Singapore. The walks to the Treetops Walk and tower are worth it!
,,Best nature walk around,4.0,,Enjoy the peaceful tranquility in MacRitchie Nature Trail during the day or in the evening. It is linked to a Tree Top Walk (HSBC Tree top walk) where you can have an bird eye view over the whole park!!
,,Cool walk!!,5.0,,Reach as early as possible in the morning as if you are doing the full train you may wana avoid the sun as much as possible. Its good to be one of the first to reach the tree top entrance before it opens so you can see the monkeys who stay there for a while before dispersing (seeing too many humans). Fun with fitness.
,,Have fun walking trail.,5.0,,it was great to walking trail there. nice place close by the town. it's easy to get there by the bus. just take 2-3 hours to walk route 6 in the MacRitchie Nature Trail. Highly Recommended.
,,MacRitchie Nature Trail,5.0,,I was back there in June 2013. Trip advisor doesn't have a proper calender for me to mark my visit to Singapore. Had a long trail walk with my family back in 2006 before I migrated. There are board walks along the reservoir so bring a camera with you.
,,Great place for hiking,4.0,,"I've visited MacRitchie Reservoir on numerous occasions over the years, but today was the first time I tried some of the longer walking trails, and certainly the first time to actually see the Treetops Walk. My main criticism of the Treetops Walk is that it only opens at 8.30am (on weekends, or 9am during the week apparently) and so if you arrive shortly before 8.30am you end up getting stuck in a queue. My advice would be to time your arrival for about 30 mins after opening time so as to avoid the crowds. Other than this thr trails around MacRitchie are great fun and well worth it."
,,"Enjoyable walk, watch out for the cheeky monkeys",4.0,,"Walked up to the tree top walk with extended family. We took it easy with heat and 2 young children. There is nothing around except what you bring, which is fine, it's what we expected. The walk across the tree tops is pretty good.
We stopped on the other side for a snack for the kids and ended up grabbing everything from a monkey who spotted our food and came a foraging.
Kids and adults still loved the day."
,,a world away,5.0,,the track is a humble 13km and its got a breathtaking view of the reservoir on a suspended bridge. while the monkeys can be abit pesky this park is easily accessible as are many places in singapore. a definite must go for the nature lover looking for an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.
,,Try the tree top trail,5.0,,Super duper trail! I love to see the greens from the height. This is a very nice trail suitable for everyone who love nature. It's hot ( its Singapore after all) but if you are well hydrated you'll be just fine!
,,Back to the jungle,5.0,,Urbanisation of Singapore is increasing daily. MacRitchie offers the chance to escape back to the tropical jungle and get well off the beaten track.
,,Tranquillity and peace minutes away from the hustle and bustle of life.,5.0,,"A convenient tranquil spot just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest MRT station and a short drive from the surrounding heartlands.

Was greeted by a group of monkeys as we entered the trail. Then spotted a monitor lizard basking lazily in the sun on a piece of log. Along the way through the trail you may encounter more wildlife. Do not disturb them, respectfully carry on as this is their home.

As you walk along the boardwalk, you will be greeted by sights that you may make you think if you are still in Singapore. That's the beauty of this place."
,,"Turtles, monkeys",4.0,,"Turtles in the lake. cheeky monkeys running around in groups (watch out if you are wearing only open sandals), take a bottle of water as it is a long walk around the perimeter of the lake. Fish swimming and ca n sit and watch them on one of the wooden platforms.
I got here by one of the limited buses going this way but took a taxi back."
,,"Great walk, take enough water!",4.0,,"Very good walk around MacRitchie reservoir. Its about 10km with monkeys and lots of birdlife. Temperature was 32 and humid, so ended up pretty dry despite having 1 litre of water."
,,Wow,5.0,,"This is a large park built around a lake, right in the middle of the city. Paths are well laid out, range from easy to fairly difficult. If you like nature, you'll love it. I certainly did - walked the 10km trail.

If you go..
- Start early in the morning. The nearest MRT station is less than a half a mile away, MRT opens at 5:30. I skipped the breakfast at the hotel - had something to eat at the park cafe before my walk.
- Bring a water bottle. There are fill-up stations along the way, so a 500ml bottle per person should be enough
- Do go for the sky walk, it is worth it. It quite far from the main entrance - if you'd rather not walk the whole 6 miles, consider taking a taxi to the ranger station. Then you can walk the remaining 3 miles or so to the entrance - it is mostly paved, and all downhill/flat."
,,Great place for a walk or run,5.0,,If you are looking for fresh air and a little challenge then come on down to macritchie to give your health a bit of a boost. Do it in the morning and you can breathe the difference in the quality of the air once your on the trails.
,,Beautiful sweaty walk,5.0,,"My friend and I did the 11km walk yesterday and wow it was sweaty but great. We saw monkeys and this massive lizards, it was surreal. We were so impressed with ourselves after we had completed it. I can't believe this place in a few minutes away from the city. It's lovely, just make sure you take lots of water as you'll need it!"
,,a greenspot in the heart of the city,5.0,,"nature at its best at this place. kids can simply run, play , hop. the reserviour is so tranquil. the trails are nicely planned, and challenging. must visit ...for all nature lovers and fitness freaks."
,,Nature Trail,4.0,,We took about 2 hours to finish the tree top trail. Love the view from the Tree Top it is simply amazing.
,,Wonderful few hours,4.0,,"During a recent business trip I had a few hours to spare and felt like getting out, exercising and seeing something different in Singapore. A short trip by taxi from my hotel and I was in another world in MacRitchie Nature Trail.

I had a wonderful walk through the forest. The noise was deafening. The trees and plants were lovely to see, with a relatively easy path through. Having recently read a number of World War 2 books about this region, I could only marvel at those who had survived without resources and in constant danger.

It was beautifully peaceful, only meeting a handful of other people during my few hours there - in fact I saw more monkeys than humans.

I did not have enough time to make it all the way to the tree-top walk, but next time I am in Singapore I will allocate a full half day to this beautiful place."
,,Never felt so soaking wet :-),5.0,,"The nature trail is a well carved and kept path around the reservoir, including side trails like a tree-top bridge. And it has it all, tropical flowers, animals (even monkeys), rest areas ... not too crowded even during weekends. However, make sure you bring plenty of water - making the entire walk (some 11 km?) at 30+°C and 90-100% humidity is strenuous, no doubt."
,,Great city escape!,5.0,,"If you wanna do a 10KM walk, than this nature trail is good for you, also if you wanna stop before that 10KM limit, every kilometer is marked with a marker. So you can return after 2KM if you only can make 4KM :)

Great place and if you open your eyes you might see some special animals like lizards or big fish, crabs even turtles I've seen. Birds I didn't recognize this time."
,,a domesticated jungle in the center of Singapore,4.0,,"This trail in the middle of the city is not completely wild but it provides a welcome 11 km walk in a domesticated jungle. you can walk or run on wooden platforms or on dirt tracks on the ground or climb and enjoy a tree top walk 25 m up in the tree canopy on a 250 m-long suspension bridge; you can watch monkey, varans, snakes, lizards or macaques; you can rent kayaks; you can stop and eat by the reservoir.

It is very well organized and the sign posts are very clear. After all, this is Singapore!

You can go there with the bus 157."
,,Away from Singapore,5.0,,"Starting from the reservoir, walk towards the wooden walkway along the reservoir. Takes about two hours leisurely and it was a fantastic walk in the shade of mature trees. See various trees and ferns and also many monkeys. Amusing walk. Does not feel like you are in Singapore at all."
,,will take you away from singapore,4.0,,its 11kms walk in Singapore in complete greenery and in reservoir. you can also do kayaking at this place.
,,nice trail but nothing unique,4.0,,It's a nice trail in the concrete jungle. take care during raining season as trails become flooded at some point and is extremely slippery. It's far from MRT so has to go by bus from nearest MRT which is novena. It's a popular running and strolling place for local but not the best attraction for a tourist as I find nothing special about the trail.
,,A nice getaway from an urban atmosphere,5.0,,"It is a very pleasant walk, where one can choose to walk inside the forest or along the water. It is a hide from the city and from the heat, usually it is cooler inside the jungle. If time allows one can visit the tree top walk. It helps to visualize the height of these tropical trees. It might not be the most thrilling tree top walk that you have done, but it is a safe and a pleasant one."
,,its safe and provide by ranger station,4.0,,"don't worry to get into the nature trails, its safe, several ranger stations to rest and the restroom to go to the toilet and filling your drink."
,,Awesome hike even for beginners,5.0,,"I don't go much hiking this trail, while still challenging, it was easy enough for a beginner like myself. The tree walk seems to have the spotlight her but, I think the view from Jelutong Tower was much better so make sure you don't skip that one."
,,"nice forest, narrow paths",3.0,,"11 km hike on Sat morning. narrow paths, many walkers amd joggers - which detracted from the experience. nice tree walk from great heights - tree top level, so it was nice. but there are better places to hike and run and escape , so I don't think I'll return"
,,Tree Top Walk,4.0,,"Long walk until you get there but great scenery, many monkeys - don´t forget to take water with you!"
,,Beautiful Nature Hike,4.0,,"This is a great place to do some trail running or hiking. The main trail is about a 10k loop. Although the trail is widely used by people walking and running, at times it seems very remote because of the beautiful canopy surrounding you. Bring your camera, there are great opportunities to take some beautiful pictures. I specifically enjoyed watching the monkeys on the trail. Just a word to the wise, this is not an easy trail and not for the faint of heart. There are parts of the trail that are level and easy to run but much of the trail is hilly, rocky and difficult. I saw people having to fold up and carry strollers because the stroller could not be used on parts of the trail. It's also easy to make a wrong turn and end up going further than the 10k route unexpectedly. Although there are markers, the signs are not always clear. My initial planned 10k run turned into at least a 15k hike. Be prepared with plenty of water, comfortable clothes and shoes and just enjoy the nature all around you."
,,If you like to hike and tired of the city this is the place for you.,5.0,,Singapore is a fascinating city but it also has some incredible nature spots and this is one of them. Nice long hike by lake and through jungle within a few minutes of one of the most unique cities in the world. Welcome break from city seeing.
,,excellent 11km walk.,5.0,,"Its a long walk in the heat, but so many habitats and animals to see, including monkeys, terrapins, lizards, many different butterflies.Dont miss the treetop walk- suspension bridge through the rainforest canopy. Paths are well maintained, there is aranger station half way round, for emergencies, and theres a good cafe at the end."
,,Native animals wild here,5.0,,this is a little gem of a place a park surrounding one of Singapores water catchments . Its a good walk with a lot of trails and the best part is you are very likely to see native animals here such as monkeys squirrels flying lemurs and some quite rare and exotic birds - you may even see a turtle in the water . there is very few tourists here so it is quite peaceful and gives an idea of what the jungle was like in sigapore before urbanisation
,,Best Natura Attraction in SIngapore,5.0,,Yes This is Nature. This is Something Special. This is something you will not forget when you are in Singapore! Make your way up to McRichie Nature Trail!
,,"Smoke-free, family-friendly",4.0,,"The nature walk is of moderate difficulty. Walked from MacRichie to Bukit Timah. Beginners or people who had not exercised for a long time may find it difficult to complete but determination is the key! Get in touch with nature on this walk. I love it that it's a smoke-free park. The air is clean and fresh, especially after the rain yesterday. However, the rain did make certain parts of the trail slippery, be careful while walking. There were many joggers too. And I find it easier to jog through certain parts. Bicycles are not allowed. No feeding of monkeys too. Recommended for everyone, I even saw quite a number of elderly walking with their families. Kids-friendly too. Please bring a water bottle, you definitely need to stay hydrated. There are water coolers if you need to refill your water."
,,Neat trek in the middle of Singapore,3.0,,Went for a 4 hour / 11.5 km trek with my kids and wife and enjoyed it although it gets hot and sticky very quickly. The tree top walk is excellent and offers panoramic views of the park.
,,Explore Singapore in its original state.,5.0,,"If you're not a complete urbanite, shopaholic or foodie, then you're on the right ""off the beaten"" track. You would not be disappointed if you to choose to go. Many great trails to explore and wildlife to discover. I've forgotten how happy one becomes, away from noise of traffic and city-life."
,,Awesome for experience hikers,5.0,,"The Macritchie nature trail combine with tree walk, buket timah reservoir make whole hiking awesome.Be ready for really long hiking ..minimum 10 km and near to rain forest , nature.."
,,"Venus Loop, MacRitchie suitable for kids",5.0,,"It is a great place to escape from hustling and bustling city. If you are nearby, or just ended a brunch in one of the cafe in the stretch of Upper Thomson Road, visit Venus Loop. Detail: http://scrapmumloft.blogspot.sg/2014/08/fun-for-free-singapore-venus-loop.html"
,,A great escape,5.0,,"We frequently walk this trail. It's amazing that you can feel like your in the middle of a jungle in an otherwise highly urban city state. The wild monkeys are always a favourite with us, but be a little wary of them as they can get a little aggressive. Superb views from the treetops walk."
,,Well worth a visit to see a different side of Singapore,5.0,,"Take lots of water, insect spray and enjoy. I really enjoyed seeing the wild monkeys. There were lots. We also saw a snake and lizards as well as some lovely birds. It was very muddy on some of the trails and so we got quite...More"
,,Great both times,5.0,,"Went on the tree top walk (2.5 hrs) and around the reservoir (1 hr), they are both lovely walks. The river walk in particular has lots of wildlife including monkeys, skints and monitor lizards."
,,healthy yet scenic,4.0,,"If you love adventure and trail walking/running, you will enjoy this scenic trail. Have done some cross country running when I was a student and gone back with friends for some casual running. Nice view and calming. A place even for relaxing. But remember to...More"
,,Best kept ....,5.0,,"A jungle habitat in Singapore. Best kept to nature's design. No fanciful sculpture, fountains or gardens, just basic jungle and trail. Good to get away from it all. Stick to the route that brings you to the treetop crossing. Lots of canopy but warm, so...More"
,,Great Escape into Nature,5.0,,"Great walking trails through one of Singapore's few national parks. Adjacent Bukit Timah park also offers excellent opportunities for nature-loving hikers, cyclists, etc within very easy reach of downtown Singapore."
,,Excellent but be ready for a long day,5.0,,With Singapore being a small country I was caught off guard at how large this water catchment area is. It was almost 6 miles on a short loop. The treetop walk is what most people are after so you should still check it out. It...More
,,Nature Trail and Tree Top Walk!,5.0,,It's a Mother's Day date with the family. An easy 3 hour walk to enjoy the nature and be greeted by monkeys along the way. Marvel at the aged trees and even the huge fallen trees along the path. However the heat is to be...More

,,Very nice walt to get away from the city,4.0,,"After a week in Singapore, if you are not a shopping addict, you may feel like escaping somewhere quieter and more natural. MacRitchie Nature Trail is a very good place to go, and the 10 km walk around the reserve takes about 3 hours for...More"
,,Monkeys at MacRitchie,4.0,,Really lovely walk (11K) around the reservoir. Watch out for the monkeys stealing bottles and plastic bags. But enjoy the walk.
,,Superb walk!,5.0,,"We did the 12k walk, starting from the visitor centre. There is a plan on the wall clearly showing the various walks and starting points. The walk goes firstly up towards the nature trail boardwalk, which includes a swing bridge over a valley, in the tree canopy. Then on around the reservoir and eventually back to the visitor centre. It takes a good 3 hours or more, as you don't walk very fast in the heat and humidity, and be sure to take plenty of water with you, as there is nowhere en route to buy refreshments. We saw a large family group of monkeys, and it was lovely to get so close to them. It's hard to believe, when you are walking through the jungle, that you are so near to a city."
,,a forest in the heart of the city,5.0,,"just go if your spending more time in Singapore, because there is a lot of things to see before. But if you are looking for trails and adventure this is the place. Be prepare to Walk miles and miles and please don't miss the tree top walk. Very good experience. We saw lots of monkeys and a snake. we loved!"
,,Yes we have been here with my family!,5.0,,"And yes! We are going back and ready! When you want to visit this place, you have to be ready on a long walk and hike. And if you are bringning your kids you must have many bottles of water and snacks and water and more water! Because no water to buy when you are in the forests! And you must have comfortable shoes and hat and towelettes! A hard lesson for us!;) but we did enjoy the treck!"
,,"Wonderful, unspoilt, original Singapore",5.0,,"We've been here twice, during consecutive visits to Singapore. The contrast between this patch of woods and completely 'developed' Singapore is what makes it so appreciated and beautiful. A thickly wooded trail which winds around a reservoir, this is great for long walks and jogs or even a picnic. Dont come just for the tree top walk, as part of the entire experience it adds to it. My favourite place in all of Singapore."
,,Beautiful walking area but disappointing treetop walk,5.0,,"Don't come here only for the treetop walk, you'll be disappointed for sure.

We started our walk at Venus drive (which has a car park and bus stop in the area). First up was the treetop walk. The first part of the trail runs along the road which isn't so nice (you can see the entrance of the golf club at some point) but after 2 or 3 km, you arrive in the actual park. From here the treetop trail goes up and it was nice but little artificial with wooden paths and stairs. Signs indicating the treetop walk are good. The treetop bridge itself was really disappointing for me, I expected a longer and higher bridge. There is a security guy at the entrance of the bridge allowing only a small number of people on the bridge at the same time, of course understandable for safety reasons but queuing in the forest takes out the charm...
After the treetop we decided to continue on the yellow trail (left side on the map), which was very pretty and a little more 'rough' than the treetop but still very manageable!! And some point you pass the golf course which gives a nice change of scenery. We continued along the Chemperai trail, very beautiful walk along the water! Peaceful and serene. Recommended. We stopped in Macritchie park and took a cab back to Venus drive.
Tips/facts:
We walked for little over 4 hours.
Take enough water (/food), there are no shops!!
Toilets are also limited!
Food possibilities are limited (I saw only one stand, no veggie)
See website of National parks Singapore, DIY walks, download maps and walks.
I was wearing sandals, which was perfectly dueable but most people had sport shoes.
Some height differences but all manageable."
,,Great hiking trails!,5.0,,"Wonderful trails through the forest. We did the big round, it took us about 2.5 hours.
The Tree Top Canopy Walk was amazing! You can see the whole forest from above. We even met some monkeys up there. Remember to bring enough water and good shoes with you.

Nearest MRT: Caldecott (10 minutes walk)"
,,Great place to run!,5.0,,"Must visit early in the morning for a run. Absolutely beautiful trails awaits. Also watch out for the sun-bathing monitor lizards on the trail in the afternoon. Must -see: HSBC tree tops walk trail , entrance from Venus Drive."
,,Enjoy the long walk but remember to bring water along,4.0,,"Do note that it's possible to spend up to 4-5 hours in this trail and it's good that you have a bottle of water with you. There is a ranger hut inside where you can find a toilet and also water cooler for you to refill you water bottle.
Do be careful while walking as route can be slippery and occasionally there maybe uneven and rocky pathway. Keep to the main path to avoid getting lost though you do not have to worry as you get telecommunication signal everywhere you walk here.
You may bump jnto monitor lizards or monkeys along the way just be careful and try not to disturb them in anyway.
Get out of the trails before night fall and take note of the directional signs and map to track where you are heading for."
,,Fantastic Way To Relax and Keep Fit,5.0,,"I drove to McRitchie and there is plenty of parking places. There is a small charge for parking which deducted electronically.
There is also restaurants to choose from.

I walked to the tree top trail which is a 5k walk. Even if your not fitness fan it's a easy walk. Remember to talk plenty of water, trainers and loose fitting clothes.

It's so relaxing and I look forward to doing it again."
,,Trail Run,5.0,,I have been to Singapore many times yet this is the first time I have taken time out and explored this trail. It was well maintained and in excellent condition. I really enjoyed my run! Well worth a few hours away from the busy CBD area!
,,Great hike up to the suspension walkway,5.0,,"Experienced a leisurely hike up to the suspension bridge sighting butterflies,birds & monkeys. Great to get away and see some of Singapore's wild side (nature that is)!!!"
,,"A humid, but nice run.",4.0,,"If you are looking for a good place to get your sweat on in the jungle, stop by the nature trail. There are monkeys, lizards, and crazy birds, all within a few miles of the hustle and bustle of Singapore. It's warm under the canopy, but you're outside, so you'll get over it. By the way, don't feed the monkeys. The fine is steep. . ."
,,Walking in singapore,5.0,,"Simply beautiful, it doesn't feel like your in the hustle and bustle of a city. Great walks and place to escape from city life."
,,Stormy weather,4.0,,"Great place to get away from all the busy stuff. Trails are clearly marked and well maintained. Got caught in a torrential downpour part way round, so headed for cover."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,I recommend spending 3 hours for this outdoor activity within the city. It is free of charge. You can get there with the MRT.
,,DA SEX,5.0,,"Had an absolutely beautiful experience while hiking along this serene trail. Definitely one of the better ones in Singapore.

Encountered a variety of local wildlife as well (butterflies, chameleons, fishes, monkeys, monitor lizards etc.), which was cool.

Just wish the toilets weren't so far away :("
,,"Close to Nature, Close to Heart",5.0,,"Really nice and refreshing Treetop walk. Just a point to note: MONDAYS ARE NOT OPEN! So do not disappoint yourself by going all the way there and find it closed.

Try googling the fastest way to get to the Treetop walk, because the entrance from Macritchie is actually very fair. There is a closer way along Thomson Road. Just Google Treetop walk and there will be step by step guides.

Overall, refreshing experience. Good to go light but with drinks because it gets very very warm. Go with a friend and just chat it all the way through:)"
,,deep forest in the midst of the city,5.0,,Hiking this trail was quite an experience. I never expected something so rugged as what we found. Not that the trail was too difficult but it was definitely challenging. The frequent markers identifying the flora and fauna were very welcome.
,,An amazing place!,5.0,,Unbelievable that such a place is located in such close proximity. It is calm and serene. You have various options if you want to go for a hike. A getaway from hectic city life!
,,Great place to experience nature,4.0,,"A great place to experience nature first-hand that is not too far from the centre. Facilities were basic but adequate. The board walk was particularly lovely with monkeys, squirrels, lizards etc. As it was mostly shady, for those not used to the sticky heat, it was most pleasant but beware of insects and apply repellent."
,,Excellent break from the city,5.0,,I enjoy the outdoors and this walk takes you from the hustle of the city to the treetops. You experience one of the highest bridges and lovely promenade type wooden bridges. Excellent family fun. Recommendation is to do it at night. Then you have the views as well as the cooler air.
,,Let's go for a walk!,4.0,,"A very nice place to take a walk in Singapore. Jungle in the city, what other place could offer something like that in the whole world? Be careful with the monkeys, they are not afraid of humans..."
,,Real nature in a big city,5.0,,"When you're done with the culture, art, huge buildings and all those people around you, go to the MacRitchie reservoir! So much to do and so much to see. On weekdays, it's not so busy.
Try the treetopwalk if you want to have a look over the trees (closed on Tuesdays), see the monkeys, birds, turtles, dragonflies and take a longer or shorter hike. At the starting point, there is some local food and coffee."
,,Lovely Walk in Wilderness & Jungle,4.0,,Surprised to find so much uncommercialised (FREE) open space in the centre of Singapore island. A really lovely day out which made me smile a lot.
,,Excellent walk close to city centre,5.0,,"Really glad we did this walk, it was one of the highlights from our trip to Singapore, and a very different expereince to do whilst on a city break.

We got a taxi here from Bras Basah Road and it cost $13. We had asked to be dropped at Venus Drive but the driver just heard MacRitchie Reservoir so that was where we were dropped off. We were a little concerned that this would add too much onto the walk and we wouldn't manage it in the heat, but we needn't have worried. I think it only added on an extra 1km in the end, and our Garmin watches measured our whole walk from the Reservoir, around the tree top walk and back to the Venus Drive entrance as being 9km all in. Much shorter than I had expected!

The Tree Top Walk was well singposted and the heat wasn't a major issue as the vast majority of the route is shaded by trees. We spotted a few monkeys which was great - we've never seen them in the wild before! They kept their distance and posed no threat at all.

The Tree Top Walk was worth the walk. The bridge is very narrow and is one-way accross it. You appreicate how high up you are when looking down on the tree canopies below!

We got a bus back to Bras Basah from the bus stop as we exited on Venus Drive. For buses back into the city, cross the road (there's an overpass bridge). Bus was about $2.30 each.

We started the walk about 10am and the temperatures were fine, we needn't have worried (and we're 2 people who aren't used to the heat at all!). I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys nature trails and wants to see a different side to wonderful Singapore."
,,Great place of nature,5.0,,"I visited the reservoir and did the yellow walk including the tree top walk. It is a great walk, I saw plenty of wildlife including monkeys, a snake, lizards and butterflies. Quite busy with joggers so if you are walking in a pair you will be constantly moving in to let them pass.

The tree top walk is a great addition to the walk, all the better that it is free to walk along but you can only enter if walking around the reservoir anticlockwise.

I caught a cab on the way there from Clarke quay area ($10) and a bus on return. There are plenty of buses which go to orchard road. If you wish to get one of these you must cross the overpass to the far bus stop.

The mushroom cafe is a nice spot to have breakfast before or to refuel after the walk.

Nothing too strenuous but in 30+ heat it can be quite tough so just make sure you have plenty of water and a snack.

Overall a lovely place to spend a few hours out and away from the city."
,,Good spot to take visitors,4.0,,"Nice grounds with plenty to see. The monkeys are a novelty and very cheeky. There are plenty of nice walks, paved and u paved, flat and with others a little more challenging. Oh, it is also good cheap car parking!"
,,great experience,4.0,,"it was an excellent exercise, a lot of monkeys near the trails. there is a suspension bridge above the whole tree canopy, which is free to visit. bring enough snack, waters and suncream and hang out for a day. the only thing is it is a bit hard to get taxi or bus after the walk."
,,Its more Fun in the Forest.,4.0,,"It's fun during the week. Here you feel far away from the city, but she is surrounded here.It is advisable to make the walk counterclockwise. The bridge is protected by a door. These can be opened only in one direction. There are no shop. Take therefore necessarily drinks and meals. In fact, there are only natural. At the end, it passes between a golf course and being overtaken by numerous Joggers."
,,A feat in itself!,5.0,,"It was a bright sunday morning and about 8 of us friends decided to take on the 11 km long MacRitchie trail. After a quick breakfast at the Mushroom Cafe, we began our long yet exciting journey. Do carry snacks and water bottles if you are attempting the full trail. The tree top walk is an experience in itself and a must-do if you are at MacRitchie! The trail itself is beautiful and the perfect way to spend a holiday!"
,,Very Cool Hike and Attractions,5.0,,Great trail with a variety of beautiful scenery. Make sure you go to the tower (the name is escaping me right now but it says 'tower' in the title on the maps) and the treetop walk for some great views!
,,A very nice hike through the Central Catchment area of Singapore,4.0,,"For the last 3 Sundays, I have been hiking through MacRitchie Nature Trail. The 1st 2 times, we started from Mushroom Cafe and heading East towards the Canoeing Centre on your right. Following the track, you will come to two paths. One is through the forest cover, on a gravel lined, undulating path up and down to the Ranger Station. The 2nd choice, Petai Trail, is a more gentle hike on a wooden broadwalk skirting along the reservoir's water edge. This 2nd path is less arduous but slightly longer. Eventually it links back to the main trail leading to the Ranger Station. It is approximately 5km via the 1st option and slight more than 5.5 km via the Jetai Trail.
At the Ranger Station, you can rest up, refill your water bottle (there is a water cooler) and use the washroom. Just be wary of the monkeys who are so used to humans that they can snatch your food or shiny objects from your hands.
At the Ranger Station, there is a path on the right that leads up a steep hill to the Tree Top Walk. It is quite an experience to walk on a suspension bridge overlooking many treetops. At the end of the bridge, you will have a series of stairs to climb up and down to rejoin the main track to Jelutong Tower.
At the Ranger Tower, if you choose to take the easy path, turn left towards Jelutong Tower. Somewhere along the way, you will see a series of stairs but you can't enter there as it is the exit for those who had taken the Tree Top walk.
At Jelutong Tower, you can climb up the spiral stairs to the top of the tower and enjoy another breathtaking view of the catchment area.
Walking further on, after Jelutong Tower, you will come to a fork in the trail. One turns left back towards MacRitchie Reservoir and the other, a very challenging hike that continues deeper into Bukit Timah Reserve towards Bukit Timah Hill.
Let's talk about the turn back to MacRitchie Reservoir first. It is a gentle walk back on more or less level ground. You will come to the edge of Singapore Island Country Club's golf course. it is not surprising to see golfers playing along side you as you hike along the Golf Link back to Mushroom Cafe, where you started. The view of the reservoir next to the golf course is gorgeous and you may come across turtles sunning themselves along the water edge.
There is a short series of climbs ahead. But lucky for you, it is a series of stairs before you reach another set of broadwalk along the southern shore of the reservoir. Alternatively, you can also choose to walk through the forest cover through a series of climbs back to where you started.
I prefer the broadwalk as sometimes, there is a gentle breeze to cool you down, other wildlife like monitor lizards, fishes or monkeys along the broadwalk that will surprise you if you keep an eye out.
At the end of the trail, both the broadwalk and the forest trail ends at the zig zag bridge. Go across the bridge and you are nearly back to the Mushroom Cafe, where you started. This trail can take you around 2-3 hours to circumnavigate around the MacRitchie Reservoir, depending on your pace.
The other option is to head Westward, along the broadwalk of the southern shore of the reservoir, back to Golf Link towards Jelutong trail. Yes, you can go in the other direction back to the Ranger Station and the Tree Top Walk.
Or, as we did today, we did not turn left to the Ranger Station but continued on towards Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. There is a sharp right turn and bear in mind, this trail is less used and thus more quiet for you enjoy the nature surrounding. Also, it has a series of steeper climbs. At the end of this trail, you end up on a road.
This is Rifle Range Road and there are a couple of military camps there. It is okay. Just walk along the road, keeping an eye out of other vehicles, cyclists and joggers. Continue the road till you cross overhead the Bukit Timah Expressway, or BKE as we locals called it. Continuing on, near the School of Ammo, there is a metal railing on the right. Follow that an there is a steep decline down to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. You know you are on the right place where you can see an open rolling hill in front of you. On your left is actually Bukit Timah Hill Nature Reserve and on your right, the BKE, separated by a segment of forest. Here, there are a few trails. The one that immediately on your left will lead you back to the Visitor Centre of Bukit Timah Hill. If you continue a bit further uphill, after passing a a series of huge water pipelines, there should be an entrance to a trail that leads you directly to the top of Bukit Timah Hill, Singapore's 2nd highest hill, after Mount Faber.
However, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve's nature trails are undergoing restoration work till end 2016. Please check their website for more details on this.
It doesn't mean you are stranded here. As I mentioned earlier, there is a trail on your left that leads back to Bukit TImah Hill's Visitor Centre (also undergoing restoration), and back to Bukit Timah Road where is food stalls across the road.
If you prefer, you can continue up and down this open rolling hill northwards. Eventually, you will see another trail leading into Dairy Farm Nature Reserve and a short walk later, you are back on the main road, Dairy Farm Road.
Bear in mind though, this part is popular mountain bike cyclists and they share the same trail as you. Hence, be careful here.
It also take around 2.5 to 3.5 hours to do this track and it adds another dimension to your enjoyment of Singapore' nature catchment area.

Lastly, as this place is very popular with runners, joggers, trekkers and walkers, please be patient and always keep left and let others pass you. Also, the trails are mostly loose gravels or packed earth, so wear a good pair of trekking shoes. Wear appropriately for humid weather, comfortable dri fit tees and shorts. Bring your own water as the only other water point is at Mushroom Cafe and at the Ranger Station only. And if you are an insect / mozzie magnet, bring your own insect repellent. Also, I advise a light energy bar to replenish you if you going to try this for the first time.

Finally, do not litter inside the reserve. Bring out what you bring in. I hate seeing plastic bottles and plastic bags left behind inconsiderately by others who do not appreciate nature. And take nothing out of the nature reserves than photos and memories."
,,So beautiful,5.0,,"This trail is super, and Tree Top Trail as well. You can spend here a half day with hiking/walking. Wear a good shoes and bring your own drinking water with you."
,,Great workout,5.0,,"Beautiful scenery and very convenient to access. Great place for a long workout, and the trails make it a bigger challenge!"
,,Beautiful and Scenic,5.0,,"This is one trail, that makes you believe you are no longer in Singapore but inside some dense foliage with a lovely view. I walk this trail 2 times a month and cant seem to get enough. If you have enough time, include the Tree Top Trail as well. Keep in mind the paths are strewn with pebbles at some places and there are monkeys on the trail. So wear good comfortable shoes before you go on it and don't carry food in your hand!"
,,Cannot believe I'm in Singapore,4.0,,"Excellent walk through the rainforest. The walk is well marked, and fairly easy in that the paths are graded &/or paved. The walk around the lake is relaxing, it gets you in the mood after the hustle and bustle of the city. It was amazing to be on the centre of Singapore island, but feel as though you're in the middle of nowhere. The cafe was surprisingly well priced. A word of warning, don't try and get a taxi from the golf course on your way out, the answer is ""No""."
,,peaceful place in the middle of the city,5.0,,"It is so easy to enjoy this place, just go and walk, be near the lake is so incredible, so peaceful, you can totally forget your are in the middle of the vibrant city."
,,Oh so crowded,3.0,,Inspite of starting super early the park was extremely crowded and ou were always having to look at who was trying to get by. For Singapore I guess it is great but coming from a country with wide open spaces it was annoying.
,,Nice walk,4.0,,"Paved and planked trails around a natural reservoir is a lovely walk. Cool off with a Tiger Beer and lunch on site. And if you are lucky, see the wild monkeys frolicking."
,,Long walk but beautiful.,4.0,,I read the reviews but thought there was no way it would take that long to walk it. The bridge was very cool but about half way across I felt a little afraid of heights! The bridge moves a bit under your feet! Very cool over all. The main reason we went on this hike was to see the monkeys. I was sure that we wouldn't be seeing any after we had gotten past the bridge in the tree tops. But then we did! Probably saw about 6 little monkeys on a trail then another one when we winded back around to the ranger station. That monkey had stolen food from a hiker. It was pretty funny. I'd definitely suggest brining a protein bar and a decent sized bottle of water for this hike!
,,Natural Singapore,4.0,,This is a good chance to take a look at the little wilderness remaining in Singapore and what it looked like before the big city. If you walk the whole circuit it is about 11 km. There is a nice skywalk and canopy lookout you can visit. Plus you will most likely get to see some of the wildlife.
,,Fantastic Hiking,5.0,,WOW! I loved walking through the rainforest! You are able to stay on a well marked and visible trail while walking through trees feeling like the middle of nowhere. A beautiful lake is in the middle and you can choose many trails and lengths. This is on the edge of Singapore and needs a long walk from a bus stop or a private car. I took a cab there easily but had troubles getting one back.
,,"Hot, sticky and nothing particular interesting",3.0,,"Nothing special unfortunately - just a walk through a tropical-like forest. Nothing particularly exotic, no animals or monkeys to be seen. Hot as anything. Suspension bridge was a bit lame with nothing particular to see beneath it."
,,long walk,3.0,,"the brochure or tourist information didnt say how long the walk is from the mrt. NO signs when you exit to guide you eithe to bus or trail.
once there 6km walk to tree top walk and 6 back so be prepared.
trail uneven wear good shoes. not sandals like many i saw.
avoid hot days or go early."
,,Tranquil place in Singapore City,5.0,,"Best place to do trail running/walking. Lots of monkeys but generally harmless, but don't feed them. Many race canoeists train here, but you can also rent a sit on top kayak for leisure paddling."
,,I love this nature walk,5.0,,"Best enjoy during late evening, with nice trail walk within the dense landscape. It’s near to the city yet an oasis on this own, away from the buzz. Nice place to come by with family n pets."
,,A must for nature lovers!,5.0,,"Many people don't realise how much Singapore has to offer in terms of nature beauty! MacRitchie Nature Trail is one of the places one should go to discover the beauty of this country. Many trails, paths, beautiful nature, great views. Good for one day, or even more!"
,,Nice Escape From The City,5.0,,"I really enjoy visiting the reservoir and trails. The treetop walk is a fairly easy hike and offers a bit of jungle and tree top views. The reservoir trail is 11km and a really great hike and trail run for Singapore. The terrain changes throughout the trail. If you start out at the main entrance at the carpark, restaurants and, toilets and go left you'll walk along the water on a boardwalk. You'll make your way through the jungle and up some small hills where it opens up to more water and grass fields. Walking alongside a golf course you'll end up back in the jungle and eventually make your way around to the paved path and back to where you started. Watch for pretty birds, lizards, and of course monkeys. It's a very peaceful place to visit and even with crowds it doesn't feel like Orchard Road. haha.

If you aren't up for the hike or run; I've seen plenty of people strolling and casually walking while their children play. There are plenty of grassy areas to take a seat and benches along the way. There's also a nice restaurant up on a hill, Vava Bistro Bar & Grill. It's very casual during the day and if you sit outside under the trees with the breeze you'll have a pleasant view without any buildings in your way.

And if you still have energy at the end of the day, make sure you pick up some fresh cut flowers around the corner at Thompson Road's Far East Flora. Plus, if you're hot the almost 3,000 sq. ft. cold room where the flowers are stored will be nice and refreshing.

Enjoy!"
,,Nice 10Km trail,5.0,,"This is one nice trail with nice view and nature walk. Guess is one of his kind in Singapore. There are few sports activities can be done along as run, kayak, walk along the reservoir and enjoy the breeze and the nature. Car Park available. Washroom, shower and keylocker availability."
,,Nature walk,4.0,,"this place is quite calming to the senses, just a stroll or brisk walking can be catered to this kind of place."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a great walk. You are surrounded by nature and can see lots of wildlife one wouldn't expect to see in Singapore. On my walk I saw snakes, turtles, monitor lizards, monkeys, spiders and lots of butterflies.

It is a long walk, so best to start early in the day when it is cooler and take plenty of water, snacks, a hat and comfortable shoes."
,,Thought we'd die.,4.0,,"With temps around 90 degrees f, we foolishly decided to take the trail to the Tree Top Walk. The trail goes up and down and a lot of it is small rocks and stones so DON'T WEAR SANDALS. Its a LONG, hot hike....bring lots of water. The elevated tree top walkway is neat, but not sure it was worth the hike. We exited onto a private road at a golf course and talked security into calling us a taxi....yes...we were THAT exhausted and hot..lol."
,,brilliant get away from the busy city,5.0,,Brilliant especially because majority of Singaporeans do not like to walk in the heat. this gives you a bit of feel of loneliness enjoy what it must have been 30 years ago in Singapore.
,,Indeed a Nature Trail,5.0,,"I should say it's a must visit to sporty people..Prepare for a long hike, so should wear rubber shoes..You wouldn't enjoy your visit if your in a heeled sandals. Amazingly beautiful for the trees are well preserved even if it's located near sg's city proper. Prepare to see monkeys roaming around (don't worry they seem to be harmless) and turtles. It's like a forest in a city."
,,Ideal for a group picnic,5.0,,"This is Singapore's first reservoir built in late 1860s. It has since been expanded twice to cater to the growing demand if water on the city.
The park is smack in the centre of the city state Singapore and is a huge nature reserve with a beautiful lake in middle.
Last great place for family outing with kids or friends or a couple as well as solo.

What to do there ?
You can go with a group of friends for a half / full day picnic... Find a shade below a tree and enjoy.
Beware of monkeys if you plan to picnic closer to the nature reserve. Avoid feeding them. Loose plastic bags attract them.

The leisurely walk around the convenient walkway on perimeter of the reservoir is a bliss.

You can kayak or go for tree top walking. To get to tree top walk- you have to walk 3.5-4.5 km depending on your starting point. The last entry to the walk is 4:45 pm.

How to get there?
The car park and entry is bang opposite Mount Alvernia Hospital.
By MRT: 10-12 mins walk from Caldecott MRT
By Bus: There is a bus stop less than a minute from the park entry.
By Taxi: Is conveniently located and should cost less than $15/- from most places in city.

Facilities:
Toilets are far and few between.
There is a cafe (Cafe Vava), but is to bring your own food for flexibility.

Tip:
To enjoy most, go on a big group picnic."
,,"Really, really enjoyable",5.0,,"Great amenity to have so close to the city - you are definitely in a rain forest - lots of things to see, good trails - we did 10km. You can do considerably more. Bring plenty of water, sun screen, insect repellent.
Stay calm with the monkeys (lots of them) and there are no issues. We even got to see a Giant Forest Ant (about 1 inch long).
ENJOY"
,,Great spot to exercise and see nature,4.0,,"Lots of walking and trails! You can always see loads of monkeys. There is a suspension bridge that is above the whole tree canopy. It is free to visit. Pack a bag with snacks, water, sunscreen, camera, etc. and head out there.

Might be hard to get a taxi after you finish up. There are also a few bus stops around."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Great to see some wildlife and a view of the harbour and bay, this takes you to where all the cruise liners come in. Good walk, a must if you have some time in Singapore"
,,Great walk.,5.0,,"I always go for the trail around the lake. It is tiring but rewarding, a lot of animals, and nature is so beautiful! SO sad that people keep feeding monkeys and then they become aggressive. Please respect wildlife and you can still have a wonderful experience."
,,Teeming with life. A rain forest experience!,5.0,,"There are a number of routes to follow. Some wide avenues, some little better than narrow tracks!

Walk them or run the 10k route on a Sunday morning you will see a rainforest teeming with reptiles - cloud monitors, snakes, sqirrel type mammals, monkeys and much more.

Huge hardwood trees, fruit trees covered on fruit and blossom. A wide varity of birds from raptors to sun birds.

Plant to spend a day wandering the trails. Take plenty of water and be prepared for the occasional heavy shower - remember, it's the rain forest!"
,,Don't develop it too much!,5.0,,"Its fantastic! But too much sealing of trails!!! They keep putting stones and pavement on the trails, it will be better if it was more natural."
,,11KM walk around the perimeter of this beatiful reservoir,5.0,,"If you like peace and solitude this is for you. At certain times of day there are a lot of runners, but they really do not disturb you. I was able to see two different squirrels, a 2m water monitor lizard, plus various different species of birds. Plus numerous feuding monkey's. Guide says it takes up to 4 hours to walk around, I managed it in 2.5 hours, although I did not complete the tree top walk as it closes at 4.45pm. You really get a feel of the jungle as you walk around, the signposting and information boards supplying copious info on the Flora and fauna, was very useful. Yet again there is no entrance fee to this attraction."
,,Prepare for a long hike!,4.0,,"Great place lots if space and monkeys - however - to get to the treetops walk is about 5k with some reasonable little slopes. Not hard but in the heat was quite a work out. There were no facilities beyond the start so take plenty of fluids. From the tree tops it was another 5k back to the start which takes you around side of golf course. Saw some monitors, birds and turtles - but 10k walk in the heat was pretty trying! The mushroom cafe by car park was a welcome stop point at the end. Thankfully we hailed a taxi directly outside - to save our feet!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We came to macritchie expecting a brisk stroll. We were so wrong. 14km through the forest. But it was awesome. We saw wild monkeys, lizards and snakes. Was a really good day. Just be warned there is alot of walking."
,,Definitely make time for this one. Really worthwhile.,5.0,,This was an awesome thing to do in Singapore. We came in the long way though. If you are looking to do the treetop walk the shorter way in seems to be via Venus Drive which is not the main entrance. From the main entrance we did a 4.5km walk. Which is really doable for us as we are used to walking and are used to high humidity being from QLD. If you are from a country/city that doesn't have high humidity I would recommend extra water (not too much) cool comfy clothes and comfortable shoes. We saw a couple of monkeys the day we went. All the trails are very clear and it's amazing to go from the city to a rainforest. You can't here the city at all. We caught a bus from bugis to the main entrance which was easy. If you are staying more than 1 or 2 days I'd recommend the tourist travel card. I used the regular travel card and just ended up with extra credit left on it. It is easier to be able to just scan on and off the transport though instead of mucking around with tickets and change.
,,Worthwhile hike to see nature,4.0,,"Relatively close to the city, with easy access via public transport, the MacRitchie Reservoir had a lot of opportunities to get away from the city and lost in nature. We took the blue hike (10 km) that took us to the TreeTop walk. Relatively moderate hike with monkeys on the way. Make sure to wear proper shoes with good grip because the paths could get a little slippery if wet"
,,Close to nature!,5.0,,"We had a great walk through the forest and around the reservoir. You really get close to nature, it's very well set up to be safe and fun."
,,Nice inner-city hike but ridiculous signage,4.0,,"The MacRitchie reservoir area offers some delicious (though hot and humid) hiking/walking in a rain forest in the middle of Singapore. But the signage is very poor and it's not always easy to figure out which way to go, where you are, or how far you've come or need to go. There are food and drink concessions at the trailhead but nothing in the park itself so be sure to bring plenty of water."
,,Monkey Families Up Close and Personal,4.0,,"It is delightful to escape the tall buildings and office workers and take a walk in this nature preserve. The trail is boardwalk and asphalt in order to preserve the area from foot traffic and the views of the reservoir are memorable in early morning and late afternoon. There are Macaque monkey families living in the forests and they come to the beach for water and to play. It is advised to use common sense and not to feed them but you can watch them and take photos to your heart's content. They are very entertaining, especially the little ones as they tumble and play. We also saw some gigantic lizards (gigantic = 2 feet long) slither out of the forest but they were as happy to avoid us as we were to avoid them. Plenty of parking, no entry fee and reachable by MRT. Kayaks for rent. Popular with joggers, too."
,,Place to go to see Macaque Monkeys,3.0,,"We started this walk around 9am on a Sunday morning. There were many joggers running in either direction but later in the day as we walked into the rainforest we didn't see any. The track around the bottom of the reservoir from Lornie Road in the south is fairly flat and wide. You walk along the edge of a golf course on one side and the reservoir on the other before heading into rain forest and away from the reservoir. Take time to walk along the tree-top level suspension bridge. People are only allowed to walk in one direction along the suspension bridge as it is very narrow.

You are guaranteed to see Macaque monkeys in this reserve. This was the main attraction for me. They are well behaved, but it is important not to feed them as that will encourage them to be more demanding. We saw several family groups at various stages along the trail searching the undergrowth for dropped fruits. At the northern end when we emerged from the rainforest into the park heading towards Lornie Road we came across quite a few monkeys walking around the manicured lawn. I stopped to take photos and then felt a gentle tugging around my ankles. I stayed still and looked down. A group of monkeys were feeling my clothes and examining my shoes. One monkey took a gentle bit of my pants but didn't try that again - they obviously did not taste good! After they had fulfilled their curiosity they moved on. I felt that they were being politely curious and at no stage did I feel concerned about them.

The walk is fairly flat on wide paths but the paths are not sealed. The paths are covered with loose, small stones. If you have weak ankles like me you may benefit from walking boots that support your ankles, but most people would have no difficulty with walking on this trail.

Take water with you. There is a shelter shed and toilets where the trail to the treetop walk leads from. You can refill your water bottles from the water dispenser that is there. Bring your own snacks as there are no food outlets on the trail. As always with nature walks, take your rubbish with you and don't feed the animals.

If you come from a place where you have been able to experience a lot of tropical rainforest, like we have, then you will find this nature trail fairly tame and ordinary. Singapore is not the place for a wilderness experience. I wanted to see monkeys in a more natural habitat and without a fence to keep them caged in. For this reason I thoroughly enjoyed the day.

More photos of the MacRitchie Nature Trail are available on my Flickr stream."
,,"The Great Outdoors, in the City",4.0,,"We live quite close so have been taking a bus to the nearest entry.
From there we complete a 10 km loop which includes the HSBC Tree Top walk.
If the tree top is very busy, we walk down the hill and continue our loop around.
Its great with a few hills to get the blood pumping. The forest/jungle is great and if you keep your eyes open can spot green tree snakes, monitor lizards and of course, lots of monkey.
Watch out for the cross country runners! They come barreling down the paths at high speed!"
,,Dont miss the jungle,5.0,,"Nice, half day activity and a good alternative to casual sightseeing. Watch out for monkeys and do not go on mondays, since the bridge is closed"
,,Huge park,4.0,,Huge park with beautiful forest! Animals can be sighted. Walks up to 13 km can be done. A lot of stairs. Bring your own water!
,,Peaceful place,5.0,,"The park deserve to be visited.
It's a peaceful place in the middle of the city.
We entered from Singapore Island Country Club by taxi. No other available solutions.
We took the Terentang Trail to continue to Pierce Track. We wanted to pass through the suspension bridge, Three Top Walk and back to the starting point. It took us almost 3 hours to complete the loop. attached pictures to understand the scenery.

TIPS
We went there with a 19 months old baby and his stroller. Big mistake. The track is uneven and plenty steps. Better to have a piggyback rider.

Bring with you an insect repellent.

Hat, sun cream and sunglasses for those who are more sun sensitive.

Tennis shoes will be fine, no need tracking shoes. Avoid flip flops."
,,Beautiful and fun!,5.0,,"The reservoir is very easy to get to and feels like it's planted quietly in the middle of the city.
Can be crowded at times (during the weekend) but the many trails offer less crowded spots.
Offers a variety of challenges, running, walking, enjoying nature and its wildlife!
Beautiful reservoir, absolutely worth a visit!"
,,Peace of rainforest in the city,5.0,,"I loved Mac Ritchies. You can choose a trail, shorter or longer. All of them go through noisy , moist and hot jungle and you can be sure to see monkeys and snakes. Really nice atmosphere, worth a visit."
,,A lot of animals and rain forest in the middle of a city,5.0,,"You can get there by MRT or bus so it's really in the middle of the city, but after a few meters you are already in the middle of an rain forest with a lot of animals. The whole track is 10.5km so you will need a while (approx. 3h). Beside the flora I've seen so many different animals, amazing (turtles, monkeys, lizards, birds, ...). A part of the track is a tree top walk, that means you can walk on a bridge other the trees. This part was a little disappointing for m, I expected more but it's a nice gadget. If you want to do that part you should reach the Tree Top Walk before 4:45pm!!!"
,,Greenery within the city,4.0,,This is a 'hugge' green space within the heart of the city. There are different walks to hike ranging from 2km to 5 km. The HSBC tree top walk is a nice experience.
,,A nice long walk in the nature.,5.0,,"The trail is very long, almost 12KM and there is no coming exit from the halfway, so wear proper shoes and be prepared to walk a long way! The tree-top bridge is the main attraction, the view is really nice from there."
,,A walk down memory lane,5.0,,"One of the biggest catchment of waters in Singapore. This is a place for locals and long staying expats or visitors when you kinda get bored of the other attractions in Singapore. Many childhood memories, marathons makes this place a classic."
,,beautiful place for site seeing and excercise,5.0,,"at first glance the park is beautiful, but once you start trekking alongside the water, on top of the wooden boardwalk (several km long), the real beauty of the place shines thru. i only wish it was closer to my home!"
,,Nature Trail with a City View,5.0,,"Travelling to the MacRitchie trail was easy enough, a short walk from the train station and it felt like we were in another country.. While choosing our trek we were surprised to see that the information booth was covered in monkeys, if you're an animal lover then this is a must see stop for you. The walks vary from brief, to getting a bit sweaty, but with views of the lake with the city behind it, and baby monkeys as far as the eye could see, it is worth it."
,,Good and interesting,4.0,,"being Singapore, walking and hiking is somewhat limited. This however is quite good. Not very challenging, but nicely put together. Interesting war memorials and colonial housing nearby"
,,Great walking trails,5.0,,This is a great area to explore not far from the CBD? I took a cab for the 15 min ride(11.00) There are lots of trails and a beautiful lake. I would suggest taking bug spray. I didn't have any and had several bug bites.
,,Great escape inside the city,5.0,,"The best part of MacRitchie trail is from Bukit Chandu ( near the Reflection Memorial) to Kent Ridge Park and all the way to Mt. Faber around 4km. During this trail you can enjoy great walk over the leaflike bridge over Alexandra Rd., Forest Walk, Henderson Waves and all the way to Mt. Faber.
The view is spectacular and plenty of photographic opportunity.
Don't forget to take water and a umbrella with you during the raining season."
,,Great place for a run or walk,5.0,,"Nice views, great location for any outdoor activity. You can spend hours here running or walking, taking in the wildlife and fauna"
,,Nature inside the town,5.0,,"How is it posible to have a rain forest just in the middle of the crowded city. Just when you enter the trail, you stop hearing cars and start looking at the tres, monkeys (take care of your food!) and birds. A different world!"
,,Nature in the city,5.0,,"Took a short taxi ride from the city centre to the main entrance on Lornie road. Here there is a café, car park, bus stop and toilet facilities. There are several trails to walk well signposted. We walked two of them, the first on a boardwalk around the reservoir, the Prunus trail, about 2 km, the second through the forest and back via a boardwalk alongside the water, the Chemperai trail, approx. 3 km.
Absolutely brilliant. Saw numerous Macaques, turtles and lizards.
Loved hearing and seeing the forest. Many locals out walking or running. Great way to get some exercise, experience nature and see some stunning scenery.
Can't wait to return and walk the other trails."
,,Awesome place. One of the few natural sites in Singapore,5.0,,"This place is awesome for a days trek with friends. The tree top walk allows you to see the jungle from the top. Visit it early in the morning as the trek may get tiring due to the heat. We saw couple of monitor lizards and few unidentifiable birds. Overall, it was a refreshing day with nature."
,,"Nice activities, trekking and views",5.0,,"The MacRitchie Nature Trail keeps the crowded Singapore balanced. I did the 5 km treetop hill walk. It was really easy and nice to do. If you like running or exercising I would recommend you to do it here. There's a free open air gym and you'll see many runners doing the 5 or 10 km. You can also go fishing, canoeing and some other stuff. It was quite far from The Hive Hostel. I would recommend to go there in the morning and spend all day there."
,,For a Sunday morning,4.0,,Its a nice easy trail from MacRitchie to Bukit Timah - Only forest and birds - you are left alone with your thoughts. You can do a few variations with the longest one being the MacRitchie - Bukit Timah trail.
,,A Jungle in the City State,4.0,,"A jungle where you can see monkeys, squirrels birds as u walk the trail You will immigatory Birds in the December months It is also lovers haunt"
,,Good for a easy walk in the forest,3.0,,"The set of trails is located in a reservoir. It is good for a short walk of 1-2 hours around the lake in the south or a 3-5 hours walk deep into the forest in the centre. Most of the trails are easy to walk. Canopy walk is definitely a bonus. People walk on a suspended foot bridge over 200 meters high above a dale. A walk of 1.5 hours on tails should be expected for a return journey from a car park in the east of the reservoir to the bridge (or 4 hours return from south entrance). Bus stops are adjacent to the south entrance and only a few minutes walk from the east car park. The trails are well signposted. A small shop selling hot food is located near south entrance. TAKE A LOT OF WATER, since it is humid and hot in the forest and people need water quite often. Not possible to buy water on the trails.

No need to be afraid of monkeys on the trail and DO NOT FEED them. Some of them on/near the trails will simple leave you alone and do their own ""business"", and others will run into the forest when you approach.

Don't head west if you are planning to walk a circle (the yellow route) around the lake and passing the centre forest. Parts of the yellow trail at the west are closed due to maintenance work."
,,A hike well worth the time to do,4.0,,Filled with native birds and animals this hike was well worth the effort to do. Definately recommend the treetop walk and taking water with you as it is a long hike
,,Enjoyable walk,4.0,,It was a nice walk and we liked the suspension bridge. Got lost a bit on our way out . So remember where you start your trail. It's a long distance but everyone can do it.
,,Ideal for those who enjoy tropical walks,5.0,,"A large reservoir featuring a park and nature reserve, with numerous trails of varying lengths up to 11km. We started our walk by the main entrance and chose the Petai Trail which is about 3km in length, and consists of a raised broadwalk along the waters edge. Along the way we saw groups of monkeys, lizards, and numerous varieties of birds. It was an easy level walk with just a few steps along the way, but it was slippery in places where the broadwalk was wet. At the end of the Petai Trail we joined the MacRitchie Trail, which is mainly made up of loose stones, and continued our walk to the Tree Top walk. The area has a couple of restaurants and toilet facilities. Overall the reservoir offers a variety of walks, which seemed popular with both walkers and joggers. To get to the main entrance we took the MRT to Dhoby Ghaunt, and then bus 162 or 162M direct to the entrance."
,,Great Run,5.0,,This is possibly the best place to run in Singapore. The entire loop is about 11km long and it's filled with beautiful scenery. The track is moderately challenging so excellent for beginners. Run at the right time of day and you'll see a ton of monkeys!
,,Exhausting,4.0,,"The journey from the Swamp cafe through the forest is 10 kms long. I am reasonably fit but coming from North Europe, it was a challenge to me. Very hot, humid.. we didn´t have enough water with us and I was sweating a lot.
Take plenty of water with you and a small towel to wipe your face and very good trainers. It is worth the effort. You are bound to see the monkeys and lizards. The monkeys are not aggressive or pushy as in many countries with lots of tourists. But don´t feed them!
The Tree top walk has great views. Go early. You don´t want be there when it´s dark."
,,Perfect long walk,5.0,,A very nice long walk. Rejuvenating and super refreshing. Planning to do this weekly. Highly recommended. Will definitely comeback
,,Something that the locals want to keep secrete,5.0,,"The nature trial is really excellent and consists of a 9km walkround trip walk from the reservoir to the tree top walk and back. You will need a good level of fitness to tackel this walk and bring lots of water and prepare to sweat a lot on a high humidity day.
A taxi to the Reserve from the city is around $15 but, you need be ready to wave down a passing taxi on the return.
Having said that the walk is really worth it. You would believe that you are in the middle of a jungle some where and not within such close proximity of a city.
The route to the Tree top walk is well sign posted and is free. Dont miss the obervation tower on the way back"
,,Flora and Fauna Appeal,4.0,,The nature trail offer a variety of flowering plants and magnificent trees. It is not difficult and affords some great views of the downtown area as well as the beach depending on the sections walked. I enjoyed the large birds with colorful bills and the appearance of frogs.
,,Rain Forest right in the City,5.0,,"One of the few rain forest park accessible in a city center. Walking this trail is a must to understand why Singapore is the Garden City. Beautiful views of the city and the trail gets you to the Cable Car to sentosa. For nature lovers, right in the City, a Landmark of Singapore."
,,A long walk,4.0,,"Allow plenty of time for this - @ 3 hours. Basically it's just a walk through the rain forest where you will see monkeys and if you are lucky water monitor lizards but the highlight is the treetop walk over a 250m suspension bridge where you look down on the forest below. Remember to take drinks as there are no facilities except for toilets at the Ranger Hut. Not an easy place to get to - the nearest MRT station is Marymount MRT (Circle line) or take Bus number 132, 163, 165, 166, 167, 640, 52 or 980 and alight at the bus stops along Upper Thomson Road."
,,great trail running,5.0,,Keep an eye out for monitor lizards and monkeys. There are limited water points though so if you're doing the full loop be sure to drink at the rangers station.
,,A pleasant outing day,4.0,,"Trail is easy to walk on, it is meant for visitors to get close to nature. I saw a large number of fiery red baby fish of Haluan, hovering all over the large body of the mother fish in the lake. A very spectacular sighting."
,,Come back to nature,4.0,,"You have to be decently fit to enjoy the trail although there are different trails for every level of fitness. The boardwalk over the reservoir is very nice. Check when there is no park ranger around then drop a small piece of bread in the water and get the shock of your life, try it.

Avoid during rainy weather because the trail can get muddy."
,,Good walk,4.0,,it is a nice walk when youre looking into getting away from the bustling city and be immersed in nature. everything is well protected by the NEA and i love how the trail is a good challenge for joggers
,,Beautiful,4.0,,The MacRitchie reserve is a lovely place to go to and a great place to spend some time on the weekend. I have done the trial that takes you around the lake and it is beautiful. Difficult to believe you're in Singapore!
,,Oasis amongst the hustle and bustle,5.0,,"Despite my fiance being Singaporean neither her nor her parents had ever been here. They loved it! Unexpected in Singapore where high rises are the norm so to get out and enjoy some of the nature was fantastic. We saw monkeys, snakes and lizards all on the same trip!

Word of warning - take plenty of insect repellent a towel and a bottle of water!!"
,,Excellent Nature Hike Through The Jungle,5.0,,"Great hike, I've done it many times. Go early, take a bottle of water. Plan on 2-3 hours. Be sure to cross the tree tops bridge and take a pic."
,,Breath fresh Air Over Steel Bridge and Good View,4.0,,It is the outdoor walk i had never been in Singapore. You can take around 2 hours to finish a walk. Easy for everybody. But mind the wet mud after rainy day. Bring some anti mosquito - lemon grass with you.
,,Good to be out of city,4.0,,"Good to be out of city, feels like another planet, great walk, but could be long for some, but worth it"
,,Excellent Nature Walk,5.0,,"If you want a workout in a pristine natural environment, this is as good as you can get. You can tailor your walk/run to various degrees of difficulty. Remember you have to walk/run back as well. Don't feed or taunt the monkeys, birds and other creatures that you may see on your way. Early mornings and late afternoons would be a great time to start"
,,Give city life a break!,5.0,,"Well worth a trip. Very well maintained place. Read from other reviews that there are quite a lot of mosquitoes but found none. The trails are clearly marked and water is available at all the ranger stations. If you're in Singapore, do visit this trail to get some time off the concrete jungle."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"If you want to do something different in Singapore....then Pl explore this place.it's very scenic location, very good exercise."
,,Went there to see sunset and jog,5.0,,"I saw monkeys and it was my first time seeing monkeys in Singapore (other than in Singapore zoo). I went there on Sunday afternoon around 5pm for a walk / jog and see sunset. I saw so many other people jogging over there. It was a long trail and I could not jog til the end of the trail as the sky was getting darker. There were some mosquitos over there.

I wanted to go to the treetop but they have closed when I came. If you wanna visit the treetop, better go in the morning or afternoon."
,,Definitely a must do,5.0,,"If you love nature and trails this is definitely a must do. We went there on the first day of our Singapore visit and took the 10kms trail. There are few short ones and even few longer ones of different difficulty levels. Do remember to carry water bottles, cap, sun glasses etc. Wear a good walking shoe. Be mindful that there are no restaurants or shops inside the trail so you cannot buy anything. There is a restaurant at the start point where you can have light breakfast. The trail we walked on had a washroom / toilet only midway so ensure that you ease yourself before you start. We also came across few monkeys during the walk. There is also a tree top suspension bridge which had an awesome view. One of the best memories of Singapore."
,,A good hike,5.0,,"I really enjoyed the hike around the park. The best bits for me were the optional boardwalk trails next to the reservoir itself (prunus trail etc) and the open trail past the golf course . I am not at all keen on heights but found the tree top walk ok with a bit of hard swallowing and no looking down. . ...it is high but very solid. I saw monkeys and a couple of monitor lizards.

All the way around, including the boardwalk optional extensions and the tree top walk took about 5 and a half hours at plodding pace with a few stops. It's humid and I took water with me.

Bus 167 from Scotts road went straight there (as does 132, I believe), but coming back you just have to use the bridge and cross further over to the next road (outside a hospital, I think) to get the right bus, not directly opposite where you got off."
,,Great Visit,4.0,,"We took a quick visit here from our hotel. The ride was only about 10-15 minutes and 10 SGD. It was another world with a beautiful rain forest for free, and the orchid garden was only 5 SGD. It's worth the time to hang out and relax and take in the tropical beauty."
,,Tree Top Rocks!,5.0,,Lovely place for trekkers and nature lovers. Need to walk a lot to reach the suspension bridge. But great views from the top is available. Please dont feed the monkeys or they might follow you. Carry all your gears and plenty of water but believe me if you complete the entire trail you will take home one of the best experience of your life.
,,worth spending a whole day at,5.0,,"the most beautiful reservoir in singapore this place is large and as all things singapore, safe. So you can go cycling here even in the middle of the night."
,,Back to nature!,5.0,,"I have been in Singapore so many times but did not aware of this place. When I planned my recent visit in November 2014, I was browsing the web for a nice place to run in Singapore and I found an article about this trail. I told my wife and we decided to go there. We spent 3 hours walking (no, we did not run at the end) along the trek. We took the longest route and visited the tree top. It doesn't feel like we were in Singapore. I will definitely return next time to run here."
,,It is a good place to walk,4.0,,It was really nice walking around the trail.. but I did not like to have so many monkeys around .... and they look pretty agressive... so... I did not come back there...
,,Plan enough time and take enough water,5.0,,"The trail around the reservoir lake is a few hours hike (don't miscalculate time like we did). If you come from temperate climates and haven't recently visited a jungle forest, you'll be mesmerised at first: lush vegetation, monkeys and other fauna (squirrels come to mind). It is incredible that such extensive nature is surrounded by the city, it is a great contrast to 'urban' activities. The treetop walk is a must if you're not afraid of heights. We were a bit impressed by an alpha male monkey that held his position on the walk - he didn't attack us or anything, but he looked a bit menacing (maybe we're just easily impressed :D)."
,,Amazon,5.0,,"This was the highlight of my trip to Singapore, the trail was awesome, we saw a snake(deadly) and loads of wild monkeys in the trees.

The walk it quite a hefty one if you go round the reservoir but there is a map at the entrance.

Be warned the cafe by the entrance isn't great but for the price what would you expect.

Also there is no taxi rank there so you get into problem coming home. We went near the bus stop over the otherside of road but ended up flagging a taxi down."
,,Jungle Walk,5.0,,"This place reminded me of the Jungle walks we used to venture out with friends , please plan at least a few hours and trail is good fun with some pals. Do the tree top walk .. Enjoy!"
,,Good for hikes and trail runs. Bring water!,4.0,,This is very good by Singapore standards meaning that it is a real escape from the city that is easy to get to by bus or taxi. The main trail is good for a hike of a few hours if you go all the way around the lake. The forest is not virgin but it is lush. The lake is man-made but is is peaceful. The wildlife is hard to find during the daylight. There is one ranger station halfway around the lake but you will probably want to carry a water bottle because of the heat and humidity.
,,One of the best hiking trails in Singapore,4.0,,"The TreeTop Walk is accessible from Venus Drive and it is about 2.5km *45 minutes to 1 hour walk) and a round trip including the walk through the bridge and the steps leading to it is about 7km to 10km (3 to 5 hours depending on your pace). You may also take a longer walk through the park from MacRitchie Reservoir Park which is about 4.5km (1.5 to 2 hours) one way.

Time yourself well to reach the TreeTop Walk before 4:30pm as the gate closes at 5pm and rangers will not allow visitors through from 4:45pm onwards.

The bridge is open from Tuesdays to Fridays 9am to 5pm, weekends and Public Holidays from 8:30am to 5pm. The bridge is closed on Mondays, except when it is a PH, for maintenance.

,,Rugged Running,5.0,,The nature trails are very well shaded for walking at any time of the day . The terrain is challenging for a hiker and even mores for the many runners who happily navigate the trails . Trails are well marked and there are very good facilities for storage and showering at the parking area. We love it for weekly exercise.
,,Long Walk In Nature,4.0,,"If you are up for a long walk to get to the Treetop Bridge it is a good challenge and interesting. Did see the wild monkeys at the start of the walk. The TreeTop walk is about 4+ km and then you need to get back to where you started. It will take awhile to do, but you will feel completely away from the city as you go through the hike"
,,Great spot in the middle of the city,5.0,,A little difficult to find we got a 169 bus but there were several that went just ask the driver to tell you where to get off. A great little oasis in the middle of the city. There were several different walks around the reservoir for all abilities of hikers or just day trippers. We took the 5.8km walk which was just about right for us on a hot day. After just a short time walking you feel as if you are out in the middle of nowhere. There is some nice birdlife on the reservoir and a few signs with information on this and the trees and plants. There is a big cafe/restaurant at the entrance to the park with drinks machines and toilets take plenty of water with you if going out on a hot day.
,,Nature at work,5.0,,The moment you step in you find nature at work. A world away from city life. The more you are quite the better forest will sync in. I will give you guys an elaborated overview after some time.
,,A great hike and not too far from the city.,5.0,,"Never heard of this place until I google for National Park in Singapore. Friends from here over the years never mentioned that, as everyone only knows Singapore is good for shopping and eating. What a surprise, it even have a tree top walk with views of the reservoir. Bring a lot of water with you and we took the shortest route which is round trip only took about 2.5hrs.
We saw monkeys, squirrels, birds, lizards and even a snake!
Most enjoyable!"
,,Gives Singapore it's soul!,5.0,,"I think you can easily spend full day walking, enjoying, relaxing here.

Very nice nature walk although with 32 degrees Celsius of heat today it was a little difficult.

Carry water and light snacks to help you when you feel hungry.

Don't try to make a conversation with the monkeys here who generally don't bother you. There's a $5000 fine for feeding them :)

I saw one baby alligator today coming out of swampy water area and running into the forest.

Best to remain in designated trail tracks.

Really nice place to take beautiful shots.

Saw a few folks running the tracks!

Long leisure walks can be fun with friends!"
,,Get fit and enjoy nature,5.0,,"A worth while walk with friends in and around all the trails, A nice long walk that gives surprises as all different locations, as long as you take time to look around and enjoy the views."
,,Nature in the city,5.0,,The MacRitchie Natural Trail is a very beautiful place to take a hike in Singapore. To enjoy this place I do recommend to go during the week and take plenty of water with you.
,,can skip but come if you have extra time,4.0,,"This place mostly not inside to-do-list if you visiting Sg just for few days. It simply another rainforest environment, far from city, with pretty nice reservoir and the famous bridge. Good for jogging and early morning trek. The bridge close early, so come before 5pm. Nothing much to do, but saw some people fishing and organized group do kayaking. This is mostly for resident who want to escape from city environment. But as tourist going to Hort Park- Henderson waves- etc might be better choice and nearer to city center."
,,Jungle in the midst of a wonderful City,4.0,,"MacRitchie Nature trail is one of a kind Nature trail. The Reservoir is an attraction, along with the kayaks. Kayaking is a must if you visit MacRitchie, pick a cloudy day and reach early. The trails themselves are great for running. We ran the 6KM one. Has a treetop trail, which, unfortunately, we could not make in time to see. The treetop trail closes at 5PM, so be there early and wear your walking shoes."
,,Wear good shoes and take lots of water!,4.0,,"Love it - great walk. Take lots of water and remember not to feed the monkeys. Also, dress for the long walk with good shoes."
,,"Nice place for a ""walk day""",5.0,,Very nice clean place. Good choice if you want to have a day of walk amongst the Bushes. Clean air and a good exercise for you and your companions
,,Scenic,4.0,,"If ladies could adopt this walking habit instead of strolling at shopping malls, I reckon they'll burn more calories.

Set of early, say about 7am (rest assured, you will not be alone and you are not the earliest), in comfortable shorts, tees, sports shoes or sandals and a bottle of water. It gets a little warm due to the dense vegetation (there is a dirt track so you will not be bashing through shrubs).

Keep to one side. It's not your grandfathers track (I have experienced 'shoppers' hogging the entire track) Give way to runners. Sometimes they will clap once or twice and it's not to congratulate you but to give way to them.

Treetop walk is closed on Mondays. This path, to and fro takes about 1.5 hours. Choose the entire walk (It takes about 3 hours, depending on your pace) or a short comfortable stroll. The wooden tracks are a little slippery so take note.

Selfie crazies, look out for what you are stepping on because I have seen one who went for a morning swim with his phone.

And any flora and fauna belongs to nature. Some clowns tried to fish out terrapins for what, I have no idea. Let them be where they are. They will be happier without humans meddling in their lives. And if you see any iguanas or snakes (they are just passing by or having a morning stretch), for Christ sake please do not act like you have never seen one in your entire life and scream at the top of your voice. It's echoes terribly and many walkers/joggers will get startled, including our invisible friends.

Those who wish to drive, good luck in finding a parking spot after 7.15am. There are 2 entrances (for drivers).

Shall stop here. Discover it on your own. Good luck, have fun and do smile and say good morning to others..."
,,A Great Walk,5.0,,"We walked right around the reservoir on a weekday morning and thoroughly enjoyed the peace and serenity of the rainforest paths. Good paths all the way, although a little hard going in places - you certainly feel as if you have had a workout by the end. Make sure you have good walking shoes and plenty of water."
,,Lovely park,4.0,,"Were looking for some real Singapore nature and also wanted to see a bit more of the country outside the main areas.
Lovely to walk and free, lots of nature lovers, flat shoes a must but well appointed paths.
Beautiful scenerey with massive trees and a couple of monkeys.
The local people told us it is half a day walk if you want to visit elevated tree top walk, so did not go.
Tips
Make sure you have plenty of water and visit toilet at bottom of park before entering.
Time spent, an hour was enough as we did not want to trek half a day, but beautiful scenery, esay to get to by bus, when leaving back to city have to cross road over a bridge, so more steps.
Enjoy"
,,Loved It,5.0,,"We had a great time doing this. It's a little longer than some may expect - about 7 miles. Mostly easy with some up/down. We did the whole thing with our baby in a soft carrier, the trail is not appropriate for strollers. Beautiful rainforest. Saw tons of monkeys, which our daughter really enjoyed. Suggest water, snacks and good shoes. Also - unfortunately not many restaurants around here for after your hike when you're likely very hungry, so plan about that in advance."
,,Good walk to get the heart pumping,4.0,,"Did the 11km circumnavigation of the reservoir on a weekend morning. We set off quite early, still dark. This was a good idea as about an hour later the track become pretty busy with joggers and other walkers. It was still very enjoyable however and a nice calm place away from the concrete jungle. The track was not just forest and had sections of water views, swampy areas and walking alongside the golf course which was good for variety. I got a good workout and would do this track again if I ever had the chance. I did see monkeys as well, which is quite nice for someone who lives in a country with no wild monkeys."
,,"Hike, hike, hike",5.0,,"Monkeys, monkeys, monkeys are all in their natural habitat - cannot feed them or get too intimate, but they sure are fun to watch. The full trek is 11k - great for a weekend excursion and to really get some exercise. The reservoir has some areas for rowing and fishing, but the tree top walk is the crowning attraction."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"If there's only one thing you get from my review then let this be it: ignore everyone else when it comes to how to get here!

I was so put off by the horror stories of public transport I decided to taxi it. Ok it didn't cost a lot, but it was still a complete waste of money. Get off at Marymount, exit to the main road and then walk left (the station should be on your left hand side). Short walk to end of the road. I'd cross here. Walk a few hundred yards until you see a massive junction below, with steps nearby. Go down them and walk straight, you will come to a walkway over these roads. Cross to the other side, and walk about a hundred yards past the bus stop and the entrance is on your right. It's literally a five minute walk.

Hopefully the above is of use to someone as I wish it was available when I decided to visit. Yes a bus or taxi will take you straight outside but when it's not the 2 miles/20 minute walk everyone else has said you might as well save your dollars.

There's a cafe at the start, I didn't use it but definitely stock up on water. There are lockers here available for a small fee and also some just before the entrance. There's only one place to access water which is about 4kms in, and bear in mind if you do the tree top walk you're looking at a 6/7 kilometre walk back to the start. It is knackering! I didn't think it would be as hard as it was, but I well recommend it.

Monkeys and all other animals and birds cause no problems at all. Yes they're about but they never come too close. Very safe here even for the individual. Mainly frequented by locals as far as I could tell, and virtually every one of them spoke as we passed."
,,Awesome walk in the nature,5.0,,"Just arrived, we were greeted by a lovely family of monkeys: the young ones were so playful and splashed into the water while testing to grab food from dangling leaves. The journey continued through thick vegetation and a few other animals (squirrels, lizards, birds, butterflies, insects, many other monkeys, etc.).
The tree top suspended bridge was just stunning with an awesome 360 degrees view of the underlying forest. At the end day we were exhausted but extremely happy of the visit."
,,real jungle in the middle of concrete jungle,5.0,,"we decided to escape the singore buzz and have a relaxing walk in the nature. this place fits the bill. we encounter adorable monkeys, funky lezards and other unusual bugs, the walks can be easy, moderate or diffcult and the scenary is beautiful. we definitely go back"
,,Nature in the city,5.0,,"It wasn't so easy to get to on the public transit (I took the train) but it was real jungle, with birds and turtles in a lake, and monkeys and monitors in the forest. The trail takes about four hours to go around the entire reservoir, but it is quiet and serene. A treewalk closes before five, so I missed that. I recommend going early to catch the treewalk, but the shady jungle doesn't get too hot if you decide to go late like I did. I saw the army doing an exercise in the swamp area, but no live munitions fired. A beautiful way to spend a day without spending money, and reprieve from the crowds and heat."
,,Forrest in the middle of the city,5.0,,"If you don't mind carrying a lot of foods and drinks with you while hiking/strolling/exploring this place then his place is for you then. By the way, a lot of monkeys are running around. They are nice and funny but be careful of course. They are still animals."
,,Jungle within a city,5.0,,"If you love hiking/running this is the place to go. Even though it is right within the city you won't feel like you are. Beautifully kept trails. Plan on a few hours if your are only walking the full loop. Half that if you run it. Keep in mind there are a few good hill climbs and stairs especially if you are going to the tree top bridge. You will see monkeys (keep walking and don't interact at all), lizards and turtles. Great break from the hustle & bustle of the city."
,,Not so good,3.0,,"Acutally, i was expecting something so great ! The monkeys are really funny (they stole our lunch) but if you are going inside the trail, then there is nothing to see, only wood, ...
The Treee Top Walk isnt that good, I really preferred Pulau Ubin !"
,,hike in a city state,4.0,,"There's no mountains in here, only rugged trails, and the occasional monkeys. The nature trail is within a Reservoir and you can choose different trails (in time duration & intensity). One of the highlight is the ""Treetop walk""-a suspension bridge. Don't take the trail leading to it if you are afraid of heights! (there's no turning back). Bring water, some snacks if you would be hungry halfway. There's toilet only at designated pavilion rest-stops..remember this is 'jungle'..
To get there, the nearest train station can be from Toa Payoh or Caldecott, and take a bus or taxi in. Bring a portable phone if you are doing this alone (quite safe alone but better off with a friend).
Travel light."
,,Great escape from the city,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed, do carry lots of water/food as there are no shops. There a toilets and a water fountain but I saw this once in a few hours on the trail. Lots of monkeys and other animals. Was a little scared by all the 'beware of snakes' signs but we didn't see any. We got a taxi there and back and pretty sure it didn't cost that much!"
,,Great Escape!,5.0,,"If you like nature and need to get away from the concrete jungle, I highly recommend MacRitchie Reservoir. This reservoir and park are centrally located and easy to get to. Either get in a taxi or take the Circle Line of the MRT to Caldecott. It is a short 10-15 minute walk from the MRT. There are several options for hiking. Be warned though, if you choose to go to the Tree Top Walk this could be quite a long walk. Wear good hiking shoes and take water and snacks. Also, do not visit on a public holiday as all of the rest of Singapore will be there, too."
,,A Walk amongst Nature,4.0,,"If you are looking for a place to have a nice evening stroll or run, you can visit this nature park which also enclosed the Macritchie Reservoir.

If you are up for a long walk, you can walk along the perimeter of the reservoir edge, along the broadwalk and some parts are nature trails.

There is also a cafe and restaurant if you are looking for a place to sit back after all that work-out.

Also a good place for pet-lovers to bring your dogs for a walk."
,,Into the Nature's Heart,5.0,,"It is the best place for nature lovers to hang around . It has the most wonderful tree top bridge which stretch with a view of the reservoir. It Needs to walk a lot so if your going, Be prepared to take a lot of water !"
,,Best thing I did in Singapore,5.0,,"I wanted to see some wildlife but am not a fan of animals in captivity so wished to avoid the Night Safari. My hostel (Tree In Lodge) recommended this as they knew I am a keen walker and they said that there was a high likelihood of seeing wild monkeys and monitor lizards - both of which I saw!

The circuit path takes around 3 hours; wear good shoes and take plenty of water. There are toilets at the start and up at the Ranger Station near the Tree Top Walk.

I took the route up through the forest first, then did the Tree Top Walk (amazing!), then down the other side between the reservoir and the country club. There's actually a tower that you can climb up for amazing views of the park and Singapore city in the distance.

It's incredible what you have here: monkeys and other wildlife, Tree Top Walk, views, forest - and it's all FREE!!

Easy to get to by local bus - the 166 and 167 run direct from my hostel.

The only thing I would say is that the monkeys can be very aggressive so don't go too close. Also be sure not to have any plastic bags, or food out in front of them."
,,Escape the buzz of SGP,5.0,,"After a week of working non-stop in SGP, It was great to escape and do the MacRitchie Nature trail and the tree top walk. I must have had a good pace because I completed the trail in shorter time than indicated, but above all, I was at the start at 7h30am with plenty of water.
I wouldn't dare try this during a hotter time of the day. Watch out for the monkeys!!!"
,,A Great trail to reconnect with nature,5.0,,"Went to the trail as i have decided to run a half marathon at the end of the year and wanted to challenge myself to some running in the natural environment as opposed to a tread mill.
The trail is well marked and very well laid out. The gradients are challenging without being intimidating, the loops of the trail are well marked and one just cant imagine what a beautiful sight the trail is in the middle of the urban sprawl.
There are adequate locker, storage facilities at the start of the trail, off upper Thomson and would definitely stop to do the tree top walk and go to the top of the look out tower for a scenic view of the city and the Macritchie Reservoir,
the last part of the trail, if you go anti clockwise, takes you along the fringes of the Singapore Island golf club, its nice to see people playing while you are into the last leg of the trail.
Would definitely do the trail more than once, one important tip, try to begin your journey before 7.30 am if possible to get the best of the morning and the day"
,,Another side of Singapore......,5.0,,"We were in no rush and spent over 3 hours on the trail encountering many friendly faces, monkeys, squirrels, tortoise, birds, one small snake and a spider as big as your hand. Such a pleasant change from the hustle and bustle of downtown Singapore. A few tips....take plenty of water and wear shoes that are appropriate for the trail sections of which is over a rough terrain. I would also recommend a mobile phone in your back pocket in case of an emergency."
,,Great Escapate,5.0,,"Since in Singapore is so busy and rush, tohave these trails and quiet around, it´s great. You can spend the day taking pictures and just enjoying nature."
,,MacRitchie Nature,5.0,,"One of the best place to explore, those love nature of beauty with Bird Sound/Monkeys and Natural rain water dam. Reserve Water for the people of Singapore. Excellent place for jog in the evening those love jogging. Exploring to this place fully recommended and safe.

Bring along water bottle recommended."
,,NAture Trail,4.0,,It is really long trail but really interesting Please carry enough water and food as there are no shops to buy either on the way towards end Also prefer mornings for the trail to be able to complete it It takes about 3-4 hours
,,Excellent for a long jog,5.0,,The park has free entrance and it's excellent for a long jog or a quiet evening with nature. You have lockers to put your belonging in and changing rooms with showers.
,,Amazing walk,5.0,,"We walked from the Venus Drive to the Tree Top Walk and back. It took us quite a long time as we didn't walk fast and enjoyed the lovely scenery with watching many animals like monkeys, lizards and even a beautiful green snake, what a treat. Sneakers are a good idea, I had Birkenstock which was also very good. There are public toilets and drinking fountains at the Ranger's Station.
The Tree Top walk is one way only, marked everywhere but we still managed to see two people walking the opposite direction...
I would definitely not bother bringing children here unless they don't mind being hot and walking long distances.
Overall an excellent walk and we will be back to walk another route."
,,Spectacular and Amazing Eco-Adventure!,5.0,,"Prepare yourselves for an exhusting yet fun experience at MacRitchie Trail! We took the 11KM hike so if you are planning to visit here, please do bring atleast 1L of water. It's preferrable to visit early in the morning to avoid getting sunburns or too much heat while hiking.

-Don't miss the Jelutong Tower and the Tree Top Walk (hanging bridge) and take a lot of pictures!

-There will be monkeys, snakes and squirrels as you walk but it's nice to see them roam around the ""forest"". Please don't let the monkeys see your plastic bags or they will harshly drag your things because they will assume it's food for them. (It didn't happen to us but just a friendly reminder given by the guide in the tree top walk)

-Do bring some snacks too because this is really a tiring adventure. Consider bringing like energy bars and chocolates but please don't litter around the beautiful forest."
,,One of the best trail runs in the world,5.0,,"The periphery track of Macritchie is 10.6kms start to finish. It takes you around the edge of the reservoir, into thick jungle, along safe paths. I have done it maybe fifty times and have seen all manner of interesting animals including a pangolin. It is completely safe, even running at night with a head torch (although a little scary). It is my single favourite place in Singapore, and I could not recommend it more highly. There are good washrooms to change and wash at the entrance, and there is a park ranger hut and toilet half way round to get water and refresh if you need it. It takes an hour to run, and three hours to walk (roughly). There are shorter walks as well. It would be a huge error to go to Singapore and not take a breather in this lovely park."
,,MacRitchie Nature Trail,5.0,,It surrounds the reservoir. I went there jogging with friends. The atmosphere is serene and cool. It has exercise equipments for the joggers
,,One of my favorite places in Singapore,5.0,,"The 10KM walk is great. I really like it! When it turns dark, it might be a little scary. Last time, I found a 2-meter long lizard in front of me... Amazing..."
,,"Beautiful Jungle, easily accessible, friendly monkeys",5.0,,"I'd recommend allowing yourself 6 hours for your trip. took me around 3 hours to get round the reservoir at a slow pace, another 1 hour for tree top walk which i would definitely recommend (not for those scared of heights though) and another 2 hours for monkey watching and eating/re hydrating.
Take lots of fluids, there's drinks available at the start of the trail but nowhere else and its extremely humid.
Overall though, this has to be one of the most beautiful natural places I've ever been.
Only negative to my day was that they built a golf course next to it. Such natural beauty destroyed so a tiny percentage of the population can put a little white ball in a hole, shameful."
,,This is in the centre of an urban sprawl?,5.0,,Had a great morning hiking up the Sky bridge then staying up there while a Thunderstorm entertained us in the distance. Got to within a few feet of a faimily of monkees just after the sky walk who were happy to play righ in front of us for about 20 minutes. An excellent antidote to the urban sprawl that surrounds it.
,,Nice outdoor,5.0,,"It was an interesting event to find a time and visit such place as MacRitchie Nature Trail. It refresh your body and mind, helps to recreate after busy city life."
,,WOW,5.0,,"A great way to spend a few hours - walking the full loop and the tretop walk takes about 3 hours (its about 14-15K's) and is a fantastic experience.
Tip #1- Its warm and humid though, so take a few water bottles (you can refill at the ranger station near the treetop walk)
Tip #2 - take a shower when you get back to the start."
,,Jewel in the middle of a concrete jungle,5.0,,"If you are a nature buff, hiker, runner or simply wish to get some exercise this is is the place to visit. There are multiple trails which you could take. Refer the National Parks website for more details. We usually go here for weekly runs with our friends"
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"I went here on the recommendation of a friend who lives quiet near. The trail to the tree top walk is absolutely beautiful and well worth it, it takes approx under a hour hour to complete at a reasonable pace. It's a really tranquil and beautiful place to go for a hike and the tree top bridge makes for a wonderful mid point, the views are fantastic!

There are more trails around the park which I didn't get to do but if I am back here again I will definitely be heading back!"
,,fab walk with plenty of wildlife!,4.0,,"Really enjoyed this walk and got to see plenty of wildlife, including the macaques which was amazing to see. The food place wasnt open when we were there so be sure to take plenty of water."
,,Just Like a Jungle,5.0,,"We spent many hours walking in the MacRitchie park. The paths are well sign-posted & easy to walk on, but I would recommend closed shoes. The TreeTop Walk, where you walk to a bridge overlooking the tops of the trees is magnificent. Highly recommended."
,,Monkeys on the trail,5.0,,"Fabuloius trail in the woods. MacRitchie is nestled in the heartland of singapores and is a treasure trove of discoveries for every avid walker and hiker. The reservoir is cool and peaceful and is the home for many a primate species and birds and butterflies. The woods are rich with rainforest flora and fauna and lush with the sounds of its swathy undergrowth. Lovely experience, take a picnic and water bottles and do not disturb or interfere with the monkeys and you should have a fabulous day out."
,,A good workout spot,5.0,,A nice relaxing walk in the forest on a sunday morning will make your day very wonderful. Only dislike the mosquitoes and raining when walk half way
,,Tranquil and peaceful nature in the middle of SG,5.0,,"Loved it--clean, well marked for the most part (except when you get near the golf course, it's less evident where you should be walking). I did a running/walking circle around the whole thing, it took less than 2 hours. Leave early because it gets hot as the day goes on!"
,,"great outdoor, light trekking",5.0,,"There are several trails at Macritchie catering to different people/preferences. You can just stroll around the reservoir grounds and enjoy an evening picnic there (remember your mozzie repellent) or take a 3 hours hike to the tree top walk (closed on Mon) or trek to Bukit Timah nature reserve.

,,Awesome outdoor spot,5.0,,"Great place for walk, run in the jungle. Tree top walk offres great view, meeting with monkeys And lezards"
,,Great weekend detour,4.0,,"Great place to go hiking on a nice day. I'd recommend the 11 km treetop walk - the view is truly magnificent. There are maps scattered all around the park, and the trails are marked very clearly, so no need to research that beforehand. There are about 5 different hiking routes, graded from easy to difficult, but I'm not certain how the difficulty's measured: I believe none of them feature any steep climbs, so it's pretty much all the same, just different lenghts.

Travelling by bus, simply go to MacRitche Reservoir bus stop. Don't wear flip-flops - proper shoes are the best, I guess sandals should be okay too. Take water with you - 1.5 l right be good for a sunny day, as there are no places to refill on the way. Beware that the Treetop walk is closed during rain/storm."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Went there on a sunny day. We started very early around 8 am. The entire stretch takes a few hours and provides countless opportunities to click good nature pics. The walk to HSBC tree top is interesting but beware of monkeys on the way. Also stack up on some food and water as it is bit lengthy walk from the start..
,,Some peace and quiet in Singapore,3.0,,"There are not many places you can get away from civilization in Singapore !
Some real jungle with real wildlife, but you have to travel slowly to get the most out of it. If you are not used to the heat and humidity you will certainly work up a sweat.
The Nature Trail and Treetop Walk totals about 12.6km. The tree top walk is a one way 3km track with lots of steps.
It is a bit hard to find clear directions to get to the park or details about the walks however, the following link is the best source of info.
http://www.myonlinetour.com/poi/macritchie/index.htm
The paths are solid and mostly dry - even after heavy rain.
There is a limited choice of food available at the park - but there are lockers ($1 coin I think) and showers !!
Guys, check out the urinals with a view :-)"
,,Do the 11km!!!,5.0,,"me and me GF randomly went there to see how this park was, and we remained amazed, the whole tree-top-walk was amazing, very easy to follow, clean and there are even restrooms in the middle. The experience is incredible, we saw a lot of monkey, birds and those huge lizards swimming in the laguna and in the jungle. A must if in Singapore. Wear comfortable sneakers and bring water, a lot because its humid and very very hot."
,,A nice nature escape,5.0,,"Nice to see a different surrounding: if you do the entire tracks, you are almost sure to see turtles, dragonflies, monkeys. The tree top walks are fun and is the perfect escape from the city !"
,,A bit of wilderness in the middle of the city-state,4.0,,"If you want to see some jungle in Singapore, this is the place, and there is still wildlife to be seen here, from snakes and dragonflies, birds to families of monkeys. The trails can be a little rugged, but good footwear should see you right. The boardwalk and bridge are excellent. The only slight niggle - even here, there are people who think that they have to run everywhere, and it is not uncommon for one of these unthinking people to push past because their jogging is more important than your enjoyment of the surroundings. Apart from them, it is very peaceful indeed!"
,,Piece of true nature in S'pore,5.0,,Nice piece of nature in Singapore. You literally do not see any buildings while wandering in the jungle or around golf course. The tree top walk was fun and it was not crowded at all considering it was Saturday. Just make sure you have mosquito repellent and water.
,,Beautiful Nature Trail with Lovely Views,5.0,,"Accessing this trail is a little painful, but once you're here, it's heavenly. It's a great trail to walk through and the treetop walk is magical. We had a terrific time here!"
,,Slice of Nature,5.0,,Excellent place to experience nature in Singapore. Many interesting paths with beautiful jungle surrounding.
,,High amongst the tree tops,5.0,,"My son and I went here, not really knowing much about it. There are many walks, but make sure you are dressed and shod appropriately- shorts and sports shoes- if you want to go to tree top walk. It is a good one and a half hours each way through climbing rocky wet trail. I'm sure it was more than 5 km each way. But it's definitely worth the effort. Hard to remember you are in such an urbanised area here. Definitely worth the trek"
,,An oasis in the city,5.0,,From the moment you set foot in this park you feel like your in the deepest rain forest. If your fit take a taxi to the Riffle Range road gate and walk the Tree Top Walk. This will take you along the stunning foot bridge that crosses a high ravine in the forest. The walk is about 10km and our two kids are well able for it (10 &12yrs). Bring plenty of water and some food and Deet.
,,Peace and quiet,3.0,,"Its easy to forget youre in the middle of a city in this place! Big lake, lots of monkeys jumping around so be careful! There are a few war memorials about aswel so a bit of a history lesson there too!"
,,Good walk,4.0,,"We live in JB and were looking for some things to do as we have a break from work. Saw the MacRitchie Nature trail and thought we'd give it a go. Was a lovely day out. We did the big loop around and was a good long walk. Not too difficult, just long. Lots of shade from the trees. Beautiful and peaceful place. Enjoyed the suspension bridge and the tower. Towards the end we looked at the map and decided on the quicker route to the car, unfortunately this took us to the road side. It's probably worth staying on the board walk next to the reservoir and walking for a little longer!"
,,Nature,4.0,,"Good place to be if you want to get out of the buzzing city spotlight. Although, you might want to watch out for the monkeys. They tend to snatch whatever you have in your hands (if you have it in a plastic bag). Other than those crazy monkies, it's ok."
,,De-stressing naturally,5.0,,"If you times everythings is wrong than moving to Mac Ritchie Natura Trail.Here you can trudge through the jungle and you will notice after a few kilometers, as the giant trees of your negative energy you take.suddenly you see butterflies hear birds, and a smile spreads across your face. It dös not need a therapist to get rid of his stress. It takes is a day in the nature."
,,Its a trek in the jungle so come prepared!,3.0,,"We thought it would be a nice walk but not a full trek in the jungle! The taxi dropped us off at the main entrance and walking to the treetop bridge took 1.5 hours in hot and humid conditions. We had water with us but were not expecting such a hike. The path climbs up and down, which isn't too bad but after the bridge there are a lot (LOT) of stairs both up and down which you cant really avoid. Expected to see more from the bridge instead of just a few trees - lacking in birdlife. The few monkeys we saw trying to exit the park at least made up for it but once out we waited 20 minutes for a taxi and in the end took a bus (as we exited at the first place we could) soaked in sweat - not to do on your last day when you have checked out. And mind out of the joggers as the trail is narrow."
,,A nature reserve in a city,5.0,,"This is likely the most popular place in Singapore for hiking, jogging, walking or leisure strolling in the nature environment. It is absolutely enjoying for the whole family with young children to walk on the wooden boardwalk along the water’s edge. Of course all nature lovers cannot miss this place. Please see the attached photos to have some feels of the nature.
The active persons can go for the full trail round the reservoir which is approximately 11 km long. The reward will be the Tree Top Walk at about the half-way point near the ranger station with toilets and drinking water facilities. For the family with young children or the less active folks, you can stay around the Reservoir Park area close to the Lornie Road entrance and take a short stroll on the boardwalk. There are full amenities here such as toilets, drinking water, food kiosk and lockers.
The best time to go will be in the morning or late afternoon / evening. If you go in the evening please be reminded to get out before dark as there is no lighting in the nature reserve area. Also be advised not to carry plastic bags as the wild monkeys will grad them knowing that there are likely foods inside."
,,"Easy to get in, hard to get out",4.0,,"Maybe it's the route we took, since there are multiple routes with different lengths and difficulty levels. We went in through the macritchie reservoir park, and out through SICC as we wanted to go to Treetop Walk. Treetop walk was amazing. No entrance fee, and you really feel like top of the world. The journey there is really tiring though, the whole walk took us 3-4 hours. When we went out through SICC, we couldn't hail a cab and decided to just walk out. That was another 1-2 KM. Workout of my life.

But good thing is, it's not sunny inside the trails, because of all the trees. You get to see lots of birds, butterflies, monkeys, and the occasional monitor lizard"
,,Take plenty water and enjoy the wildlife/views,5.0,,"I had originally intended walking round MacRitchie with my elderly mother, but am so glad that I spoke to someone first. It is a bit on the challenging side for people with mobility problems, even if they took it slowly. For the rest of us, MacRitchie is an enjoyable stroll, jog (many people do) round and through rainforest trails. We also came upon monkeys - lots of families of them, a snake which slithered away as we approached, monitor lizard, terrapins and very many birds and butterflies. We walked over the canopy bridge which gives a superb view of the top of the tropical rainforest.

Tips: take a lot of water. There are toilets and water stations throughout the Reserve, but it is very hot and you really need to drink more than you'd think. Make sure you know where you are if the light is fading. We got a bit lost! Our fault entirely but I wouldn't have wanted to be lost as night fell.

A great family outing and one which is used by many Singaporeans."
,,Pleasant experience,4.0,,"We visited the MacRitchie reservoir in the morning at about 0730. If you go earlier it is better. It is a beautiful place. Be careful about carrying any plastic bags inside as monkeys will try to grab it. Taxis are difficult to get while returning during weekdays as it will be office going time. There is a bus stop just outside so before you go find out the bus routes for your trip back, just in case you do not get a taxi."
,,Getting up close with nature,4.0,,A very good 3hours treak with the objectives of doing the tree top walk. Total distance is about 12km from mac carpark to tree top and back to car. Constantly surrounded by trees so no problem of the sun. Worth a try everyone .
,,tropical forest walk,5.0,,"for forest junkies, it's one of the places where you can still hear the cricket's sound of a tropical island"
,,great to get back to nature from the hustle of the city,5.0,,"My 12yo son and i headed to this park to check out a different side of singapore and walked the macritchie trail, which took us about 5 hours (we are not athletes...LOL). The trail was well signed, mostly dirt/rocky track with some boardwalk areas and some great opportunities to enjoy the rainforest type landscape, wild monkeys, lots of lizards and squirrels as well as the actual reservior. It is a pretty strenous track in some places, compounded by singapore's hot and humid weather. Take plenty of water, we only came across one spot during the 12km walk where we could refill our bottles. Avoid taking food as the monkeys will be attracted to you/the food. This was great spot for the day!!"
,,Nice place for a jog,5.0,,"Meet my Singaporeans friends for a morning jog on Sunday. The air was fresh, and this beats the treadmill at any time."
,,Beautiful and serene running trails,4.0,,I go running and am always pleasantly surprised with the flora and fauna and not to mention Animals I see on the various trails. Something very peaceful running admits trees and water bodies. Great way to unwind in the evening
,,Beautiful nature in a crowded city,5.0,,"The McRitchie trail and tree top walk are an oasis of nature and tranquility with a hectic city.
Walking the trail you find yourself walking in what feels like actual jungle, beautiful plants and trees, monkeys, monitor Lizards, turtles, birds everything is there!
Also accessible for a short walk but if you have the time to spare walk the complete trail around the reservoir including the TreeTop Walk and Jelutong Tower, it´s about 15km total.
Don´t forget to take enough water, your camera and dress light especially if you are accustomed to the warm Singapore weather like me. ;-)

One of the most beautiful walks I made until now!"
,,A slice of nature,4.0,,"Easy to get to, well signposted walkways amongst jungle, monkeys and a treetop walk. Get out of the city and do it!"
,,Beautiful Nature,5.0,,"You have to prepare to walk for about 10 km or more with sneakers and proper clothes. The trail was so interesting and adventurous. So you have to walk like in the middle of the forest with monkeys, lizards, etc. The view was so great and beautiful. Bring water and food if you can."
,,Beware the monkeys,3.0,,"The MacRitchie Nature Trail is one of the few nature trails available in highly urban Singapore.

So put on a good walking shoe, spray on sun block and insect repellent and bring along your sunnies and mineral water to enjoy the walk/ jog in this forested area.

Note of caution: Always care for your personal safety and belongings as the monkeys here are aggressive and won't hesitate to attack people. Stay in groups if possible and never ever feed the monkeys!"
,,Get out of the city for a long walk,4.0,,"Jump on a taxi and head off to MacRitchie. Bring a lot of water, for there's not much offered in the forests. This is easily a whole day exercise even if you walk the shorter route, about 10 kilometers."
,,Not for the couch potato,5.0,,"Fairly arduous on a hot humid day but well worth the effort. Take at least half a day, some sturdy footwear and a bottle of water (which you can refill at Rangers stations on the way round). We reckon we did about 13km doing the shortest circuit jungle track and the tree top walk (which is the best bit). On return to the start we as usual ate well at reasonable cost."
,,Return visit,4.0,,"my husband and daughter walked the treetop trail last year and this time around we done the soft walk down the bottom of the park, despite having to find shelter from a thunder storm we had a good time."
,,Good escape from city buzz!,4.0,,"A very easy flat-ish trail running route that can vary in distance depending on which route you take. You can go about a 7km to 15km run or you can run all the way to Bukit Timah Forest Reserve (and back). First timers may want to consider bringing a hydration bag with food or at least a bottle of water.

There are a lot of shelter huts in the event of rain as well."
,,Escape the shopping mall,5.0,,"You might just realize that you have the strong need to escape Sinagpores shopping malls- well than thats the place to go. Reachable by bus you can hike a wonderful 11km trail. Most of it in shadow and the tree topmwalk is a true highlight. The forestvis simply beutiful and the track is very well maintained and marked. If you have some time in Singapore, this is a must!"
,,There is such a natural place in Singapore!Wow!,4.0,,"I went Macritchie by taking bus from AMK. It is quite an ideal location for nature lover and for those love jogging/running.
There is a big reservior with nice view and I found people kayaking there.

Macritchie is considered big. I had very enough of exercise there! Lol. Spent 3-4hrs in there.
Being in the park/forest, I was like away from Singapore. Once ask ""where am I now?""..Ohya, I am actually still at Singapore. Haha.

Will be back again."
,,Now with Directions!,5.0,,"MacRitchie is a beautiful, and wild jungle nature preserve in the middle of Singapore. I agree with the other reviewers, it is an easy hike, tranquil setting, restful, and the place to see an occasional monkey (or turquoise butterfly). I have heard that some of the monkeys can be aggressive if you have food and/or a plastic bag. We did not experience that (we didn't bring food), but we did see families of monkeys scampering in the trees and nearby brush.
What I would add to the reviews is how easy it was to get there once we figured out the bus. I had been in Singapore for a week and had been taking the MRT (subway) all over town. Getting to MacRitchie was the first time taking a city bus (a.k.a. SBS). We took the MRT to Toa Payoh (pronounced ""toe-pie-oh"") on the Red- North-South line. When we alighted to the street level we were in a bus depot. Taking the city bus to MacRitchie was $1.30 S$ and you must have exact change. You pay the fair on the bus itself, so have exact change on the ready. The bus is #157 leaving from Berth 4. Just as a note, our Lonely Planet guide book had the wrong bus number listed, so you may want to triple check at the information booth. The buses came about every 15 minutes and the ride was about 15 minutes to get to the park. The bus returning to Toa Payoh was across the street from where we were dropped off. It could not have been easier to get there and away.
To get to the nature trails you walk past the reservoir. There are signs posted for the treetop walk. We took the Petai trail which wound along the edge of the water with a well made wood boardwalk, then looped back through the jungle trail. Watch out for joggers and swinging monkeys. Enjoy!"
,,Beautiful place to run,5.0,,"You can do good 7 km, just remember it does not go in circle so you start in one place and end up somewhere else. The place is beauuuutiful!! Jungle, monkeys, lake with blue color, lots of people, as everything in Singapore, very safe. If you keep running can get to another park."
,,Monkeys on your walk!,4.0,,"This is a favorite walk in Singapore and it takes me about 1.5 hours to do the entire walk, but you can do shorter walks that are just around the lake or you can enter near the golf course and do the tree top walk. You can even see monkey's in the forest!"
,,Relax and stroll,4.0,,"Take a break from the hectic city life to enjoy the wonderful nature. Make a trip to the Treetop walk, worth the time and effort."
,,Singapore Rainforest,5.0,,"Challenging 12 km mostly nature trail but rewarding. We did it with a 3 year old kid and a pram! Really beautiful, in the middle of the rain forest"
,,Nice to see green in Singapore,5.0,,"The trail up to the walking bridge is quite challenging because of the number of steps involved…however, if you are up to it, it is worth it. The views are amazing. A very nice day away from skyscrapers."
,,Nature a few minutes from downtown,4.0,,If you like nature and want to get some exercise go here. The full loop will be about 3-4 hrs so bring water. Dont forget a camera you'll see lots of monkeys and maybe some large clouded monitor lizards if you keep your eyes open. It was about a 10 dollar cab ride from downtown.
,,"A great hike, lovely scenery, good exercise",5.0,,"We caught the bus to Venice drive and started the hike from there to the tree tops walk. Loved it, we got our morning exercise, had a lovely walk along boardwalks, over the fabulous tree tops suspension bridge and then back to a different exit, lorne drive I think and caught a bus from there. This was a longer way but the walk was so nice and it was shaded most of the way except around the golf course but that was a short stretch only"
,,Peaceful & scenic,5.0,,"I live near MacRitchie Reservoir and have popped up a few times now to get in a decent walk away from the traffic and noise of Singapore. There are several different trails you can take depending on how far you want to walk, it's very pretty to look at and the facilities are also good. There is a nice restaurant, a cafe, vending machines and loos dotted about so you can plan to be here for a while and have everything you need.

One word of warning is not to eat snacks anywhere there might be monkeys. I was charged by one (from 100's of feet away!) but luckily hid my food before he reached me and so he just wandered off. I got quite a fright, they're not as tame and calm as they first appear so give them due respect and keep your distance!"
,,Awesome Place !!,5.0,,"I should thank Trip advisor for helping us to find such a nice place right within the city of Singapore. There are quite a few trails that it is impossible to cover in one day. Took the Tree top trail and it was an excellent hike right to the tree top.

With a group of friends we reached there around 8 in the morning -which i think is the best time with the weather not that hot and to our luck - the climate was pleasant.With a couple of breaks in between and a few monkeys here and there - it was a great trek. Gets crowded at the tree top with people being allowed to cross in small groups - but its worth it. In between there is a ranger station for a quick break - it was a long one for us as it started raining heavily.

All said and done it was a wonderful trip. There are multiple entry points to this place - the one we took was getting down at the Farrer Road MRT station on the circle line and taking a bus to the MacRitchie Reservoir stop. Do pack snacks and water for the trip.

Must visit !!"
,,One day is not enough!,4.0,,"My cousin, who is based in Singapore, brought me to MacRitchie Nature Trail one time and we did have fun doing all the trails. I love the nature feel of the place, truly relaxing. I am planning to spend one whole day here on my next visit.

Please stay away from the monkeys, a bunch of them grabbed our food from the package. They are not as friendly as you think they are. Just be cautious."
,,Always a place to turn to,4.0,,"i have lost count of how many times i have hiked through the well-beaten treks along the Macritchie Reservior but no matter how many times I have been there, it will always be a place I turn to, for some respite from the busy city life, and also for some exercise in the midst of nature.

There are several trails to follow in this nature reserve, with the longest being about 11km. You can choose the trails according to your own comfort, or destination. The trails takes you through the inner forests, around the reservior and also along the boardwalks surrounding part of the reservior. A certain level of fitness will be helpful, since you will be made to climb up and down steps, walk through some slopes and distances. But it is truly an amazing walk, whichever trail you may choose. Surrounded by tall trees, which have seen the years, and hearing the birds and insects, and quite forgetting that I am living in a city country.

The trails are coloured-marked, with signposts every 100-200 meters, to indicate which coloured trail you are on. So, it is almost impossible to get lost during the hike, no matter which part of the forest or trek you are at. There are also many sigboards along the way to guide you.

One of my favourite trail is the one that brings me to the Treetop Walk, which is a suspended bridge of about 250m, across the tall canopy of trees. I enjoy the experience of being on a high groud, and viewing the lovely forest and some far away scenery like Toa Payoh town. There are lots of long-tailed macaques along the bridge but they are harmless if they are not disturbed. I just walk along and make sure they stay an arm's length from me.

i bring with me lots of water and some snacks expecially when i go on the longer trails. There are some snack corners and drink vending machines where the toilets are located, but mainly, you will have to depend on your own supplies. Some mosquito repellant is a must for me, as well as a pair of good walking shoes.

This is one place i call The Stress Reliever, as I always feel my stress and tension melting away after a busy work week when i take my walks. And I applaud the National Parks for having done such a great job with this place"
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Thanks tripadvisor. I found this on top attractions list. Today was very tiring but very worthwhile. The trek from the reservoir was ardous and a level of fitness will be required.

The path is very well signposted and a number of trails are available. If you want to cross the bridge you can expect to trek a minimum of seven kilometres. Good shoes a must as surface changes.

We saw lots of wildlife but the sounds and especially the senses were aroused at all times.

Drink lots of water before going and bring something to eat. Do not bring plastic bags as they attract the monkeys.

Enjoy"
,,Amazing Trail,5.0,,"We always hike at this place and never ever feel bored. If you are a fit person, you can easily cover the longer route. Lots of scenery, monkeys all around. There is a man-made reservoir which is truly beautiful to sit by and enjoy."
,,Hot and humid but great hike,5.0,,"This was by any means the highlight of our trip. We did all the other touristy stuff but didn't care so much about them. But this was different. Amazing this forest is right in a middle of a city! You can see many wild animals if you're lucky. Monkeys, birds and turtles! Just don't forget to bring lots of drinks and towels. We were there the first thing in a morning but already sweating bullets! It was lots of fun though!"
,,wildlife!,3.0,,"the monkey can stand in front of you without showing any sense of shyness. they tease each other around us, which make unforgettable memories to me."
,,a great surprise!,5.0,,"i was not expecting much greenery or much of a hike in singapore, but this was a very welcome surprise. once we started hiking, it felt like we were not even in singapore any more!
i was also surprised to see many monkeys roaming around and i was able to take some great pictures. the bridge had a fantastic view. this was my favorite free thing to do in singapore and it was away from the hectic city and malls. there were many signs and people along the way and also some restrooms and shaded areas to sit and relax. i highly recommend this trail!"
,,What an amazing morning at the Tree Top Walk hike today!,5.0,,"What an amazing morning at the Tree Top Walk hike today!

We spent a beautiful morning at the 13km hike at the Tree Top Walk on Sunday morning. The weather was nice and there were many local and foreign tourists there enjoying the nature too.

We love the peace and calm of the nature. Even though it was described as moderate to high in terms of the difficulty level by the website, we actually find the hike very enjoyable. The trails is well maintained and it isn't difficult or challenging. The humidity and the hot climate kicks in to tire you out, but plenty of the hiking trails are covered by the shades of the nature.

By the way, we were also greeted by a couple wild monkeys - even though my husband enjoys taking their pictures because he general loves to watch and observe animals in the wild, I just don't like them.

The summit was amazing - the suspension bridge offers a terrific view and you will regret if you miss it.

Tips:
+ Make sure you check the weather fore cast before you go - you don't
+ want to be caught in the hiking trail if its showering and during
+ thunder storming Bring insect repellent Bring plenty of water - at
+ least 1 liter of water per person (I would recommend bring isotonic
+ drinks instead of water) Visit the trail in the morning as it tends to
+ get too hot in the afternoon Sunglasses and hats"
,,A friendly nature trail,4.0,,The trail surrounded the MacRitchie Reservoir. You can decide whether to take the longer journey (slightly more than half a day walk) or the short walk (less than an hour). The tree top walk is an attraction which will take about two to three hours to complete. Suitable for family outing.
,,Good place to relax,5.0,,"Good place to walk or run. I love the nature,if u go during the afternoon u might get to see monkey. But I always got mosquito bite therefore I started to bring insect repellent !"
,,For a run,4.0,,Great place for exercise and for some fresh air. The nature around you is amazing and you will almost always see wild monkeys. (Don't fee them or they get aggressive) but it's a really cool area to get to see because it's still got a rainforest feel to it.
,,10km - Absolute nature trail,5.0,,"This is one of the best trail i had been to. wanted to cover the 3 kms trail to start with.. but interesting went for the full stretch of the trail. Visited the HSBC tree top walk. The tree top walk is above 25m from the ground and streteches for 250metres. The whole trail is good for treking, photography. From this you can connect to Bukit Timah trail also."
,,"Monkeys, monkeys, monkeys",4.0,,"This is a great place to get close to wild monkeys. But please don't feed them - they're well adapted to having humans around but if someone starts feeding them, it's going to create trouble. Reservoir is nice and the beautiful raised walkway along the edge makes for a great walk."
,,My favourite hideout,5.0,,I always head to this place for a run and i hope that the trails are maintain without having man made stones being place over the hills
,,A Taste of the Jungle,4.0,,"Highly recommended escapade if you like walking and you have plenty of time. This is a taste of the tropical rainforest 20 minutes from the city center. To get there, the closest MRT station is Marymount, but you'll have to walk about 10-15 minutes from there to get to the park entrance. It's not easy to find and Google Maps isn't very helpful. The entrance I used, which I think is the closest, is right next to the St Theresa's Home entrance. Once you're in, however, signs are plentiful and clear. Everything is well maintained and it's very easy walking/hiking, most trails are either hard packed or gravel, or wooden walkways. There's a lot of life, I saw turtles, a monitor lizard, plenty of monkeys (which were very well-behaved even when I walked very close to them), birds, butterflies, and the forest is teeming with jungle sounds. A huge contrast to downtown Singapore!
Distances are easy to underestimate, which is why you need to have plenty of time. Getting there is hard, as I mentioned, take a taxi from an MRT station close by if you want to make your life easier and save time. Take some water, it's very hot and humid, you'll be sweating a lot."
,,Long Walk!,4.0,,"We took MRT to the nearest station and then started our trek towards the treetop suspension bridge. We should have paid closer attention to the distance markers and been more prepared. We are a healthy, young group, but should have brought water and snacks. The scariest part of our trek were the monkeys on the playground near the reservoir-- very aggressive-- hold on to your belongings. We enjoyed our walk despite the distance and heat, and the treetop bridge is really very cool. Definitely worth it if you have a morning you'd like to spend exercising in Singapore. I did get stung on the foot by a very poisonous bug of some sort, but overall, highly recommend. Bring water, snacks, and maybe bug repellent. Wear comfortable walking shoes and breathable clothes as you will be out there for a while if you start at the reservoir park and do the entire loop to the bridge. As other reviewers have mentioned, the bridge loop is one way and is over 2 kilometers-- so no turning back once you get on this trail."
,,Easy to get lost,3.0,,"We set off from the water reserve on what ostensibly was going to be a 5K walk following the pink trail towards the tree top walk. Just before the tree top was a ranger station. The tree top walk can only be done in one direction and it doesn't tell you that it is over 2K!
We then looked for the exit, but the sign was broken so we asked the ranger where to go. He said there were two ways and pointed to what he said was the quickest. It went onto a road past a golf club. We asked a local walker where the exit was, and he told us another 2.9K down the road !!!
At this point I was exhausted and we managed to book a taxi from the golf club
On top of that we saw a blue and red snake. when we googled it, it turned out to be a Malaysian blue coral snake - the 10th most deadly snake in the world!
If you are going to do this walk start at the Venus drive entrance and walk back to the water reserve - at least that way you have civilisation at the end"
,,Great walk,4.0,,Well marked path and well maintained. Treetop walk was worth doing but make sure you walk the right way around as it is a one-way only walk across the treetop bridge.
,,Great escape!,5.0,,This parkland is a wonderful escape from the city of Singapore! highly recommend taking a few hours to trek around this area. Good walking shoes and water a must! Easy to get from Novena by bus.
,,Get a feel of Jungle,5.0,,Did 11.5 km trail. The trail has some real dense forest like feel. Tree top walk is worth all the walking that you would do. Do carry some water with you as you would find nothing inside.
,,"Nice walk, but chose a longer route",4.0,,"A nice walk through the park. Started at the Venus Drive entrance. The first 1-1.5 km of the trail was right beside the access road to the Singapore Island Country Club (Island location). As a result it did not seem as though you were walking amongst the forest. You should consider taking one of the longer routes. After crossing the suspension bridge, for about 1 km, the trail consists of a boarded walk way so it is very easy walking. The bridge is crossed in only one direction. The staff member on duty that day was very adamant about not turning back, despite there not being anyone else behind me. I needed about three hours to complete the route. Bring water and you can refill at the ranger station."
,,Peaceful getaway - nature like a national park,5.0,,"A piece of unspoiled nature. We could hardly believe this was within a city state. We strolled the edge of the dam, hiked the 16 km trail through Treetop Walk. There are plenty of shorter hikes/trails, don't worry. Wild monkeys (uninterested in humans, yay!), giant lizards, litter-free, plenty of shadow beneath trees. There are boards with information along the tracks, so you understand/ learn about the nature you're exploring. We happily returned."
,,Love it,5.0,,"The trails has several exit, either you want the shorter one or longer one. I had the 9km exit. I walked there alone to spend the rest of my summer holiday. I saw monkeys and a snake! A big one. Actually i had taken wrong route i guess.

But mostly, i enjoyed my afternoon there. Very quiet and relaxing. For travelers that had a long time to spend in singapore, this place is recommended as time killers"
,,Nice walk,3.0,,"Nice chance to get away from concrete jungle. Not too difficult and OK for kids, but take your time."
,,Great place in nature-scarce Singapore,5.0,,"Wonderful place to walk/jog, especially in the mornings. Foreigners will find the humidity too overwhelming. However, it is very crowded on weekends, but you can enjoy canoeing activity on the water.
The suspension bridge opens during daylight hours only, so check before you go.
Some isolated areas are dangerous, because you will see a lot of monkeys gathering around, and they will target you (their source of food) - thanks to all those inconsiderate people feeding them. Therefore, don't walk alone, especially off the beaten path."
,,Wonderful walks,5.0,,"I am reluctant to advertise this beautiful place as I don't want it to become overcrowded. The reservoir is lovely and there are a lot of old trees. There are interesting birds, snakes and monitor lizards. It can be busy on a weekend but most people smile and say hello."
,,"Run, walk, bike, paddle",5.0,,"It's quiet, there's animals, it's jungle. Get yourself there! Don't miss the treetop walk. Always a new trail to discover. Get off the beaten track :)"
,,Touch of Nature,4.0,,"Amazing to have a long trail of nature after nature with dense foliage screening the sunlight; the whole experience transferred you somewhere but in the middle of Singapore. We started from the beautiful water reserve and pond with a few monkeys around. Most trails are natural ground with some gravels, lots of roots, some would be muddy in the rainy season and requires stepping up and down. The Hanging bridge is beautiful and can only be accessed with one way ( no turning back ) continued with an open beautiful golf area on one side and wetlands on the other with group of monkeys. Incredible varieties of vegetation which definitely perfect for photography.
Disliked : Ouch ! it is a very long trail - 11 KM ! and there isn't a way out ! I am glad I did it though !"
,,Great~,5.0,,We got to see monkeys and climbing the tower is great especially if you love to see the wonderful view over the treetops and the primary rainforest in the distance.
,,Excellent jungle nature trailer,5.0,,"Walked the 7 kilometer nature trail with family? Saw several monkeys, water hen, butterflies in a jungle environment. The walk is pretty strenuous, has many stairs, boardwalk path in several places yet challenging. The trail has rest stops, rest rooms and water fountains with large spouts to fill your water bottle. Recommend good boots or climbing shoes, some rocky path in the route. Exhilarating trail. 7 km is about 4.2 miles"
,,Have a wander through a real Jungle,5.0,,"Caught the MRT train on the Circle Line to Caldecott, a short walk up Thompson Road and you can start the nature trail from the Macritchie Rservoir Park. Signs indicating the directions from the station are non-existent but it is worth the trouble to take a walk in the natural bush within the city. You can walk just 5km or the full loop, including the Tree Canopy suspension bridge, at around 12 km. Once inside the reserve there a plenty of signs to find your way. On my walk I found monkeys, squirrels, monitor lizards and birds."
,,A green paradise in the middle of a city of hights,5.0,,"If you like walking, running, nature and you need to get out of the massive building landscape and the only-drinking activity in Singapore, don't hesitate and go for it...

Don't forget the Tree-walk, it's really amazing...

I've discovered after 3 years and I do really feel bad... My whole idea of Singapore has changed..."
,,Nice but hot,4.0,,"If you're looking for pure nature to escape the dynamic life of the city, then this is the right place! But take care to be in a good form if you decide to walk the big tour around the lake, this is not that easy with the hot and humid weather! Take care of the monkeys, they are cute but hungry and will not hesitate to come and help themselves if you show them some food!"
,,"Great Place, had a good time",4.0,,"A very peaceful & calming experience. But there is a lot of technology at work, from the creation of the nature trail to the sound of Cricket played on hidden speakers to give it a natural feel to Fiberglass rocks!"
,,Oasis in the busy-land,5.0,,"The MacRitchie trail around the lower Singapore reservoir allows you to unwind from the busy citylife. Along the way you will find various sights towards the city, you'll pass an immaculate golfcourse, a Tree top walk (read the review on that), a lookout tower and quiet a view walkways along the lake. Besides a view joggers you'll hardly see anybody.
Getting there is an issue. You can get there by bus, but that takes forever. A taxi out of the city during rushhour also isn a good idea. We took the mrt to Bishan and a taxi to Venus drive, and let ourself drop off at the Singapore country club. This is near the entrance (2 km) of the tree top walk.All and all the roundtrip is approx. 10 to 12 km and well worth the time"
,,"Great escape from the city, but watch out for the monkeys!",5.0,,"The trail is well signposted and maintained and you can pick the length that you want to walk around, could maybe use a few more places to stop and get some refreshments. It's not busy even at weekends and i'd definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys being outdoors."
,,Don't Go while it's Raining,5.0,,"Just follow the signs from any entrances along Lornie Road. The whole trip takes 3 hours, about 1.5 hours to reach the bridge and another 1.5 hours to exit. Do not go while raining and bring plenty of water"
,,Walk round and Relax,4.0,,"A pleasant place to stroll around. You can watch kayakers and canoers glide across the waters of the Reservoir. Lots of people jog around the many paths. The day i visited it rained quite a lot, so i had to take shelter near the Band Stage. I watched many terrapins under the walkway as i waited for the rains to stop.There are monkeys in the trees by the trails, so be careful and read the signs."
,,Little escape from the city,4.0,,"We love coming up here for a little break from the city. It almost feels like we are not in Singapore any more, its very relaxing and perfect for a picnic or a nice long walk."
,,Nice place for running.,4.0,,"Trail running here is great as it is cooling and shady. However, it is muddy and slippery when wet after the rain."
,,A chance to experience primary forest,5.0,,"I have walked the various trails in MacRitchie many times, both alone and in groups. We often take our guests from overseas for hikes here. We mostly walk from Venus Drive up to the ranger station (nice place to tank up water bottles) and then take the Tree Top Walk. A good place to go is also Jelutong Tower from where there is a spectacular view over MacRitchie.
There area is mainly mature secondary forest, but has also patches of primary forest (e.g. the long stepping down from Tree Top Walk goes through primary forest).
We have seen monkeys, snakes, flying lemurs and many butterflies. There is lots of information around for visitors, who are not familiar with tropical flora and fauna. Great place!"
,,Great alternative activity in Singapore!,4.0,,"This is a really great place to tackle a nature trail. I agree with all the comments that the park is well-maintained; the trails are neat and quite clean.

Our children joined us on a family hike through MacRitchie. It is easy to reach the reservoir using the MRT; from the Marymount station, it is only a short walk past the fire station, then a left turn into Upper Thomson Road. A passing jogger who was on his way to MacRitchie saw us checking out our maps and stopped to ask if we needed help. He told us to just keep going until we saw some houses, then ""just go behind the houses"". Sure enough, there was a path right beside the row of houses leading right into MacRitchie (and the entrance of the 4.5 km nature trail!) This entrance-to-the-trail is a bit difficult to find when entering the reservoir from the usual drop-off point that taxis use, so it was a pleasant surprise to find it right away.

It's best to start early in the morning, when it's not so hot. Do remember to dress in lightweight exercise gear (wear shoes that have proper traction), bring bottled water (and ""trail mix"" type snacks in case anyone needs a nibble, as the completion of the trail will take a couple of hours.) I did not notice any bathroom facilities once we started on the trail, so it would be a good idea to avail of the bathroom facilities near the entrance (or before starting the nature trail.) We timed our journey to the Treetop Walk, and it took about an hour, with another hour's trip going back. Also bring foldable ponchos/rain protection gear; it started raining as we were about to cross the Treetop Walk, but luckily, we had foldable ponchos with us. The trees do provide good canopy on the trail, but one gets quite exposed on the Treetop Walk.

The scenery throughout the nature trail was simply beautiful (lots of joggers/ athletes in training/senior citizens here!), and the view from the Treetop Walk was breathtaking. Our children were very proud to have conquered the trail and were thrilled to see the monkeys up close!

We will definitely be doing a return trip to MacRitchie."
,,Nature Walk,4.0,,A good place to go if you like nature and it's right in the heart of city. Easy to get to and it's like a park even though it's a reservoir.
,,Great Escape from the City,5.0,,"The park is well maintained with nice trails for hiking. The trail to the tree top walk is long and moderately difficult for those who seldom hike. There are areas to rest along the trail. Remember to bring water to keep hydrated. A nice rain forest preserve with lots of canopy trees,bamboo stands and native flora and fauna. We spotted a few monkeys, squirrels and lizards. It is free and is not crowded at all.
If you are an ardent hiker, you can continue on to the Bukit Timah preserve since the two are connected."
,,A must do for nature lovers,5.0,,"We were warned at our hotel that MacRitchie Nature Trail is quite intense but decided to do it anyway and I am very happy we did! It is so gorgeous here!! We saw lots of wildlife – monkeys, lizards, birds, and squirrels. The few from the Tree Top walk is amazing!! Do make sure that your shoes are comfortable though as the trail can be intense. There are no litterbins in the park as the animals steal the rubbish, so whatever you bring in you must take out. Joining the trail from Venus drive next to the golf club may be a shorter walk."
,,Peace,5.0,,"Excellent way to get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Trails are both wide and narrow, making them varied between easy and difficult. Lots of wildlife and a good way to see the native flora and fauna."
,,Tranquility in busy Singapore,4.0,,"I love this place. Although it is ""synchronised nature"" as its a man-made trail, its still wonderful nature and when you breathe in the fresh air, the earth and the trees, you just can't deny that. Makes a nice change to the hustle and bustle of city life..."
,,Excellent rainforest getaway from the city.,5.0,,"Great place to go for a walk, run, kayak or whatever takes your fancy. I was expecting a small trail around the lake but was surprised to see many different trails. I'd recommend the trail that leads to the tree tops walk. From the beginning of macritchie reservoir park it's just over 5km(10km round trip). It's well worth it. You'll see plenty of wildlife and all the usual noises of rainforest. I seen monkeys, fish, turtles, squirrels and even a snake. The highlight was seeing squirrels trying to fend of a snake from their offspring! Really enjoyed this place and would highly recommend it to all levels of walkers/hikers."
,,Worth it if you like some light hiking!,5.0,,"I came here twice: once when it was a little rainy, and once when it was sunny and hot. Definitely come here early on a sunny day to beat the heat. It was certainly more crowded on the trails to the treetop walk on the sunny day, but the rainy day was nice, and we didn't get too wet with all the tree coverage. Also, on the sunny day you see all of the monkeys out and about, whereas they must seek shelter in the rain. It's about a 12k loop all together from the entrance of the park to the treetop walk so be prepared to spend about 2-3 hours there depending on your page. There aren't any steep inclines which makes for an easy trail, but there are not many shortcuts if you get tired. Views are great, and makes for a fun morning (and an excuse to eat a tasty lunch or brunch after you've burned some calories)."
,,"great hike, be prepared for a long walk",4.0,,"I did this hike with two others in the afternoon. If you are looking to go to the Tree Top bridge, be prepared for an 11km trek. The terrane wasn't all that rough, but it was a long walk. Must wear hiking or tennis shoes, no flip flops as parts of the trails can be muddy. Also, be prepared in case it starts raining. There are warnings not to do the hike if it is stormy. There is a ranger station about 3/4 of a mile before you get to the Tree Top bridge where you can use the restroom and fill up your water bottle. If you are looking for a little shorter of a hike, you can go to the Venus Drive parking lot (or bus stop near by) if you are looking for a bit of a shorter hike. Once you get on the Tree Top bridge, there is no turning back. It started raining and we ended up off the trail near the golf course, walked down the hill and caught a cab back to the reservoir park. Overall, I would recommend this trail, but wish I had a better idea of the length of the hike before I went on the hike. Enjoy!"
,,Fun Trail,4.0,,"This trail was a fun walk overrall. I'd recommend you walk its entire distance. There's the option to Kayak also, which is a fun one."
,,Go early and bring bug spray,5.0,,"It is a good walk for all levels of fitness and ages. The signs were convenient and easy to follow. Also, bring lots of water."
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,"What an amazing place - and it's free!
I went early Saturday morning (it opens at 8.30 am) and headed for the sky walk. For most of the walk I had the path to myself with only the cicadas, lizzards and Monkeys for company. Peaceful, quiet and BEAUTIFUL!!!
Bring water and comfortable shoes."
,,What a great way to spend half a day!!,5.0,,"I completed the Tree Tops walk on the MacRitchie Trail. It was a great walk. Pretty easy, but still a little bit challenging. Easy enough for a novice walker, but just enough difficulty to make it interesting and slightly taxing on the body.

The suspension bridge is awesome! We were standing on it just appreciating the forest canopy below us when we saw movement in the trees. A troop of monkeys were playing around in the treetops. They eventually made their way into the bridge and came up to us to say hello. Be careful if you've got and visible food or bags, as a few had a bit of a swipe at my bag. It was funny, but I guess it could be scary for some people.

All in all - a great free attraction just outside of the city. A $10 cab ride from Clarke Quay was all it cost us. But you could catch a bus or even the MRT if you didn't mind a bit of extra walking."
,,Manageable and really fun,5.0,,"A convenient drive from Orchard Road. Exciting (I'm in the jungle!) but not too hard (no scary inclines or unfriendly wildlife). The best part by far is the treetop walk, a suspension bridge with awesome views. And it's free!"
,,good free experience,4.0,,"This trail is great, and free! But, I expected a bigger and higher bridge... nevertheless, it worth a visit!"
,,Great way to spend half a day in nature!,5.0,,"We had a cab driver drop us off at the Venus Drive car park - 10$ cab ride from our hotel on Orchard Road. From there it was about a 60 minute walk to the start of the Tree Top Walk suspension bridge. Along the way we saw a lot of monkeys - some way up in the trees (make sure to look up as you are walking!) and others playing around close to the trail. None of them approached us or were aggressive in any way but we did the smart thing and did not have any food on us! Got some great pictures. The canopy walk on the suspension bridge was breathtaking! There was no one around at all and we were able to just take in the sights and sounds of the rainforest - AMAZING! From the end of the canopy walk we walked another 6k (about 2 hours somewhat taking our time) to the MacRitchie Reservoir Park. Other than monkeys, we saw flying squirrels, HUGE ants, a variety of cool birds, cicadas, skinks and turtles. All in all, we really enjoyed our 4 hours spent in this rainforest oasis that's 15 minutes away from the heart of Singapore. Definitely worth a visit for anyone who is up for a 3 to 4 hour not to gruelling hike! Long enough distances, but not too much uphill or downhill."
,,Great for a 3+ hour hike,4.0,,"When you're looking to get out of the city a bit without needing to go too far, MacRitchie Park is a great place to go. It has plenty of trails to spend a morning hiking or running, but is easy enough to bring your aging mother along."
,,this is probably the best nature trail in Singapore!,5.0,,"you are assured of high standards maintained as the N-Parks-Board ensures that your visit everytime is fuss free & thus, I highly rate this place for being friendly not just for fitness-freaks, but even the beginners who are visiting this place for the first time!"
,,A super place!,5.0,,It has a gigantic vairety of wildlife and some are so awesome.The HSBC treetop walk and kayaking in Macritchie reservoir are very nice.LTA plans to cut down rainforest to make way for the cross island line if you don't think this is right please google Save Macritchie and do the feedback form.Thank You
,,Nature at its best,5.0,,"We fell in love with this place, the moment we steeped on its lush green grass 2yrs ago. since then, it's our regular hangout. Just grab your walking shoes, a bottle of water and set on its nature trail. The first time we walked for 6 Kms without feeling any tiredness. The beauty of the nature calms you, relaxes you.
It surrounds a reservoir that is a treat to your eyes tired of looking at a computer screen or tall skyscrapers. The place is heavenly. A mus visit for all ages. However beware of monkeys who are ready to attack at your food anytime."
,,Ran the Reservoir Loop,5.0,,"Visited this place based upon it's high ranking of things to do outdoors in Singapore on TripAdvisor. It was ll I expected and more. I got to run amongst the nature of Singapore and as I had hoped, I saw many of the Monkey's that reviewers mentioned. They didn't bother me at all. I had hoped to see some of those Malaysian Water monitor lizards, but I didn't see any of those. A co-worker and I ran the whole 10k Loop. Nice weather & nice outdoor tropical scenery. We'll go run it again if we can & the next time we'll be sure to visit the HSBC tree-top bridge, as it had already closed for the day when I was there. I packed a change of clothes & showered at the on-site locker room. They have coin operated lockers, uses a 1 dollar Singapore coin. Showers were clean & warm. No benches to sit on in the locker room. You had to do everything standing up. The MacRitchie Trail and locker room area, and the little restaurant (Lava Cafe) area were all well maintained, clean and safe. Bring coins for the lockers, luckily the cafe changed some paper money for me. We saw alot of runners that day. The place is popular, they were many groups of school children there as well, doing Gym class activities I imagine. This is definitely a must-do. Low budget fun, exercise and you get to see macaque monkeys up close, so very cool."
,,Tree-top walk,5.0,,This trail offers a great walk around the scenic reservoir.. Make sure to go all the way to the tree-top walk because that is the best part! Kayaking in the reservoir is also great fun!
,,Monkeys,4.0,,Nice walk. Spray anti mosquito. Take water. Loved coming across troops of wild monkeys. They were not afraid of us but we did respect them and kept a few feet away.
,,Walk through the jungle,4.0,,"Very good walk, but requires a little bit of fitness (12km). If you are tired after walking half way (to ranger station), you can take a shortcut to the nearest bus stop - about 2.5km. There is one important thing - don't do this walk on Monday, as in those days treetop walk is closed due to maintenance. There is no information about this until you are half way."
,,The place to be,4.0,,"Fancy a little exercise in the concrete jungle that is Singapore?
This trail offers fantastic walking opportunity for novices and veterans alike.
Signs are discreetly placed so it would take a complete idiot to lose his way here.
Maps are available to indicate options if one were keen to walk further to join trails leading to other parts of Singapore.

Be wary of the monkeys though. They are not afraid of humans, and are attracted to bags. They are more commonly seen at the treetop trail. Please do not feed them even though they look adorable. One came so close to my bag that when I took it away, it bared its teeth at me.

All in all, a wonderful and pleasant walk in the quiet that can only be offered by a forest."
,,"trail runners, nature trippers, stressed people, etc,...go here!",5.0,,"Went here when the smog in singapore was level high but the trees covering the whole place helped a lot in oxygenation while I was running...the choices for different trail route will give d run more exciting! This was the best place I went to in Singapore! If I want tranquility, go here. If u want to train for a trail run, best place.release stress and meditate, highly recommended!"
,,Great getaway from hustle and bustle of city,5.0,,"I am expat in Singapore, coming from the outdoor rich state of Idaho. While i love the melting pot culture off Singapore i also love the quiet of nature and this little slice of jungle trails offers great getaway, so much so i have taken up jogging just to decompress on occasion two or three times a week. It has easy access, nice wide and well managed trails and boardwalks.

Now however if you do hike it note its about 12km around so take lots of water and wear good walking or running shoes. For a big treat you can work in the tree top walk, little extra distance but awesome views and experience"
,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,"Walked the blue trail to the treetop walk and the yellow trail back, approx 15 km took us 3,5 hours to complete. We took the MRT (Caldecott station) close to MacRitchie reservoir."
,,Great for nature walks,4.0,,"Peaceful and calm, it's away from the usual hustle and bustle of the city. Great place to run, bike, and clear your head. Has different trails as well depending on your preferred run/walk distance."
,,Lovely hiking but can be crowded,5.0,,"I love going to MacRitchie. I live in Singapore and we often venture out early on Saturday morning to hit the trails. You can hike as little or as much as you want. There are some great food stalls to reward yourself after the hike.

Bring plenty of water and snacks. There is a toilet and a fountain to rehydrate at in the center of the park.

Sometimes, there can be too many people on the trails, making it more of a time to watch out for others walking and running than to enjoy nature.

It can also get hot! Dress cool and bring mosquito repellant.

We always go back and we always have fun!!"
,,Watch out for the macaques,4.0,,Regularly enjoy walking round MacRichie and keep meaning to check out the Lava Edge restaurant that opened last year. Some of the macaques can be a bit of a pain and since some inconsiderate people have left their rubbish lying around they have got a taste for KFC and won't hesitate to approach you if you have food.
,,"Great Park, perfect for week end jogging",5.0,,Mac Ritchie is the place to go if you want to have a nice run during the week end. One loop is 10kg around the lake and golf.
,,Beware of the sign posts!,4.0,,"Of the 3 times I have walked here I have gotten lost twice! Although the roots are sign posted, I think that pranksters have changed the signs, so be careful! Aside from walking for a few hours longer than you anticipated (it's a circular routs mostly around the reservoir) - it is fairly safe and you will encounter other walkers / joggers. be careful of the monkeys! Carry extra water , in case you get lost!"
,,A must visit place!,5.0,,"I've been here twice, and will be more! It's just wonderful to enjoy the fresh air, be close to nature with plants, monkeys, butterflies, turtles,...around forgetting the busy life outside. A 10km walk to the Tree Top Walk is very much worth-doing!"
,,hike in the heat,5.0,,"11 km walk around the MacRitchie reservoir is a must. We have done this walk over 4 times now and every time is different. Today we saw so many monkeys, families of them with tidy vulnerable babies, the adults do growl and threatened , so its a good idea not to approach them , but to see them feeding and in their natural environment is wonderful. Also be on the look out for snakes and squirrels, frogs and beautiful butterflies.
It can be a little gruelling in places and strong walking shoes are advised. also a bottle of water .
I actually prefer this walk in the rain for two reasons , its cooler and there are less people but you don't get to see the wildlife, as they are being sensible and keeping out of the rain!"
,,wonderful walk,5.0,,"Singapore is one huge city, but still has lots of nature option. Needing to get some fresh air and exercise (way too warm to run here in my opinion ;-) ), I got the advice to go for a walk to the Mac Ritchie Nature Trail.

It's a great walk, for all levels, with varying distances depending on your needs.
I went for a longer walk, including the treetop walk which is also a must do.
The forest through which you walk is simply beautiful, with once in a while little monkeys on the side of the trail looking at you wondering what you are doing there (please don't feed them, they appear to be already way too accustomed to people)

Just once little thing, instead of going back to the start of the trail, I decided to follow the trail to Bukit Batok Nature park, where the summit of Singapore is located. It does not add more than a km or two to the original trail and it's a nice way to continue your walking."
,,we have found our escapee from the buzz of the city,5.0,,"We just relocated here from the relative quietness of panama where we were living on the edge of a park. daily walks were part of our family routines. The McRitchie will surely give us that and much more. for the first time, the kids ( 6 and 4 ) did not ask to be carried after 2 kms walk and kept enjoying their ""explorations""....this is the best rating we got today!
One has to be cautious with the monkeys. we were carrying a few apples for our kids and nearly had to fight a monkey to keep them. They look cute but may not be the cutest animals ever...
Still, no one will stop us to make the reservoir our reserve of happy green moments!"
,,a must for the visitor,5.0,,This is one of the best activities for visitors to do in Singapore. Take plenty of water and mosquito repellent. Watch out for the monkeys: they can be aggressive so ignore them. Not recommended for very young children. The walk across the bridge is one direction only and the steps going down after the bridge can get slippery.
,,nice nature walk but....,4.0,,The tree top walk is nice and scenic but the only problem is it is one way and no turning back. Luckily it was a cloudy day and it took us 2 1/2 hours to walk all the way around. Considering how hot the weather is in Singapore ( I was born here) they should at least allow turning back because it can be overwhelming for some people.
,,Best walk in Singapore,5.0,,"This is an excellent outing with teenagers. An afternoon walking in very varied terrain, not easy but not too hard. Plenty to look at in wild life, flora and fauna. And a taste of the Singapore replaced by malls and orderly housing and streets. Take plenty of water- frozen preferably and drink as it melts. And take a camera. The tree top walk is quite quite spectacular."
,,11KM walk is a must!,5.0,,Awesome trail and so good for the fitness level......Great track and good balance of up and down hill. Bit harder for small children and definitely no good for push chairs. Only in Singapore can you have beautifully clean rest rooms with flushing toilets at the half way point! Great place to refill your water bottles as well. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend. No problem with the monkeys and great natural shade cover. Best to do earlier in the morning as does heat up.
,,Watch Out for those CRAZY MONKEYS!!!!!,4.0,,"Monkeys loitering around is never a good sign. Never EVER carry a plastic bag in hand around them. Unless you enjoy a crazed monkey running at full speed towards you and snatching your bag.

The treetop walk was a tad disappointing- I expected a view of the waters below, at least.

Other than that, the trails are quite nice for a stroll when not muddy."
,,Unspoilt natural beauty,5.0,,"For a start the reserve is free which is amazing in Singapore, we did the treetop walk which was brilliant, remember the bug spray though!
Also something to note is that the tree top walk shuts at 5pm, we didn't know this until we got to the ranger hut and were really pressed for time to get up there!
It's beautiful and peaceful and amazing that it's in the middle of a city!"
,,Hidden gem of singapore.. nature at it's best!,5.0,,"This has to be one of the amazing part of Singapore, which has been largely kept unspoiled and the efforts of the Singapore government needs to be applauded. The main feature of MacRitchie Nature Park is that it is a rainwater reservoir and the jungle around it which is natural.

There are 6 defined routes on the trail, and while the Tree Top is mentioned as a must-do, it seems hyped for the efforts that it requires to make it through to this place. The Green and Purple routes are recommended for people who are not used to trail-walks, and they do have some beautiful sights for the walkers.

I would definitely recommend light wear and shoes and not too much of luggage (I had a tripod and a loaded DSLR bag on me, and it really sapped the energy off me, with the gradients in the walk!) Shorts are preferred to (as against a denim which I was wearing!) and do remember to carry sufficient water.

While in excitement to take in as much of the nature as possible, one wishes to stretch themselves, and do the harsh routes, it is recommended that you may plan for it well in advance, and know what you are going in for, as one downside of this trail is that there are no support functions or any exits to the routes: once you are in, you can either walk back the whole stretch already taken, or complete the entire route: there are no safe exits defined.

Also would strongly recommend to start early for all routes, specially for the longer ones, as the noon sun can be harsh and hit you bad while you walk through the trail.

All in all, a must do and an amazing experience that will leave you in awe. It is amazing for photographers, and for anyone who loves nature. Just ensure you the route you taking and that you have sufficient energy for it! Don't go for the longer, harsh routes for the sake of the Tree Top.. it won't be worth it if you make it there and are out of breath and are simply dragging yourself through!

Time required: 90-120 mins at minimum.. upto 5 hours on the longer route."
,,Very nice serene nature trail!,4.0,,"We occasionally go here for hiking and early morning trail runs. The nearby eating place also serves passable local dishes. Beware of the monkeys while nature walking, as they can be a bit of nuisance at times."
,,awesome,5.0,,"the tree top walk is just stunning, it is quite a long walk, and not for the faint hartet! it is 7km on gravel , roads and stairs(a lot), it was a great walk, loved the suspention bridge."
,,Relaxing place out of the city,5.0,,"Loved this place! We arrived via the Singapore Country Club and were watched very carefully by many monkeys. Make sure your bag is closed and you are not eating en-route!
We walked all around the reservoir. We are good walkers and didn't find it a struggle at all even though I was only wearing crocs on my feet. However, there were a few tricky places and if the weather is not good trainers or walking boots would be needed. We went on a Monday, and then found out the Tree-top walk was closed on Mondays!! Never mind, we had a lovely day out and saw lots of animals. Take plenty of water and cover yourself in mosquito spray! I will be back."
,,A bit of unspoiled nature in Singapore,5.0,,As we are living in Singapore this is one of our preferred place to breath nature. We enjoy the place especially early morning till 10am or late afternoon. There are nice trails also to the HSBC bridge for walking or jogging. There is also one bar/restauarant Lava Edge which offers a great view over the lake and a nice atmosphere. Don´t expect too much form the food. We just go there for a drink.
,,A place that brings you close to nature,5.0,,"This is a good place to go if you have 3-4 hours to spend. The walk is about 10km long. The place has been well preserved, its clean and there seems to have regular maintenance to ensure that the place is ideal for a walk.

Most of the path way are sheltered by the crown of trees which make the afternoon walk a breeze. A bottle of water will be ideal to be brought along for the walk. Highly recommended for the nature lover."
,,I saw it all!,5.0,,"It is a long hike, took me 5 hours but i stopped often because it seemed as if every animal was waiting for me and ready to pose for the camera. I saw: Both types of minitor lizards(one was 5 feet long or more living by the golf course under a tree on your way down from the tree bridge right hand side), 2 of the water monitors were dancing and mating, many monkeys, smaller lizards, lots of butterflies, fish in the water, centipedes, flowers, mushrooms, squirrels, turtles, and more.

definitely a great must see place if u want to escape the city."
,,Perfect for a walk,5.0,,"Clean and sturdy wooden planks for several trails. Monkeys, lizards and tree snakes all around, lovely, green and clean. I go just for the animals."
,,Jungle Singapore (as it used to be!),5.0,,"Got out of the City (15 minutes!) and wow - bang- in the jungle! Monkeys and amazing trees. Monkeys a bit agressive but that adds to the experience - just be careful! The reservoir is stunning with the jungle backdrop. Tree top walk is across a rainforrest! Great for runners, hikers, families, everyone."
,,What's Not To Love about This Hidden Gem?!,5.0,,"In a land filled countless tall buildings, this Trail is a treasure full of serenity and peace- a reconnection with nature amidst the busy city life. I went there on a Saturday morning around 8am via the Upper Thomson route -Venus Dr. There is an open carpark to park your vehicle and thereon start your walk. I was quite surprised to see there were already many people coming out of the trail, which means they may have started way earlier. Be dressed appropriately-proper apparels and shoes. It's best to have a little haversack with water and towels to wipe your sweaty face and body. I was immensely thrilled to hear the birds chirping in the background, sunlight glistening on the stream and having an encounter with the macaques! Note that these monkeys are masters in snatching your bags and food stuff. So please put all your food inside your bags. Munching on a sandwich and walking down this nature reserve is just not going to happen! It is a fairly long walk to the bridge but trust me, IT'S WORTH IT! You literally see the canopy of the rainforest trees! There is a halfway house where there are restroom and benches for you to rest. Then again, be vary of the macaques! I saw so many beetles nestled in decayed logs and leaves, so many insects and creepers that were iridescent! It was truly sensational! It's a good time for you to be one with nature and at the same time work your body out! Definitely a must experience!"
,,Well developed trail for hiking,5.0,,"There are few tracking route with different length, you may choose base on your stamina. There are clean wash room and water refill is available at the peak of the hill. Good for training or leisure walk."
,,Great fun for free with HSBC Tree Top Walk,5.0,,We took the bus to the stop nearest the 'country club'. This still involved a 2km walk to the start of the trail. The trail taking you across the HSBC tree top walk and back round to the start is about another 4km and then 2 km back to the bus stop - so a bit more than we expected in 35 degrees. Take plenty of water although there are free water fountains and toilets near the start. The children (11 &15) loved it and there are loads of monkeys wandering around and some great insects. We thought it was a great morning out (taking about 2.5 hours in total).
,,A place to rejuvenate the soul,5.0,,"The Macritchie trail has become a favourite place to run for my wife and I since we moved to Singapore from Canada 9 months ago. Away from the built up areas in town, it offers serene areas to walk, run, kayak, meditate and fish (you may need permits for fishing though, I'm not sure). One sees monkeys in the forest, monitor lizards along the reservoir edge which looks completely natural and like a regular lake, and my favourite cat friend who greets me in the evenings after my run! The reservoir is quite large and the tail that goes around it is about 11.8 km long with lots of steep hills and rough trail that gets muddy when it rains, but that's what makes it more interesting than any other spot in Singapore for running! Watch for protruding roots and rocks that can twist your ankle. I've see some ladies walking in the mud with their high heels in their hands - what were they they thinking??!!

The trail also goes past a golf course after about 3.5 km going anti-clockwise from the Lornie Road entrance. I hear one can run to Bukhit Tima Reserve which is about 10.5 km fro the main entrance but haven't tried that yet. One can take the trail towards Rifle Range which is about another kilometer after the golf course and extend the run to about 17 km as I like to do on the weekend. You can circle back when you get to the bridge on Rifle Road. No pets or bicycles are allowed once you enter the forest trails but it's okay to walk dogs around the main entrance area. The signs are pretty prominent. The facilities are excellent with separate showers and lockers for men and women, drinking water fountains, vending machines and even a couple of small restaurants. Weekend early mornings are like a zoo. I've even waited for 10 minutes to get a parking spot at 7:30 am in the morning. We like running on weekend evenings when it is quieter. We come across a fair number of other runners on the trail but it is relatively quiet overall. If you plan to run or walk around the reservoir, plan on carrying water at the very least. The humidity levels in the forest are extremely high and one begins to perspire in about 2 minutes from start! If you like nature, this is one of your best bets in Singapore."
,,A forest in the middle of the city,5.0,,"It is a great place because in the middle of the city you are in the forest, it is a really nice place but if you decide to go to the the tree top walk there is no way back!!! You have to walk at least 5km to get there and the way back is as long. When you go there bring water, sunscreen and comfy shoes, you will walk!!!"
,,MacRitchie Rocks!,5.0,,"It is a reservoir, it is a monkey hang-out, it is a major walking/jogging trail through the jungle, and it is a great suspension bridge 7 stories above the canopy. Believe me when they say that monkeys can hear the crackle of plastic (food) and they come running! We saw large ants and a millipede which was neat! There is also a nice little cafe in the park with good food."
,,Hot & steamy,5.0,,It's amazing that in the middle of 5 million people there is an oasis of wild jungle. The walk is fairly long and hot (bring plenty of water and/or your favorite electrolyte replacement beverage) but also relaxing. My favorite moment was watching a huge monitor lizard swimming in the reservoir.
,,Nature trail with monkeys and sky bridge,5.0,,"We wanted to see some monkeys in the wild and were not disappointed. They were around in several places begging for food. As long as you don't have any, they will not bother you. There is a suspended bridge that goes for a couple of hundred yards above the treetops. It is about a 5 mile roundtrip walk to get to, cross and return from the sky bridge to a bus stop or parking area. You get to see some areas that are what Singapore must have been like before all the roads and highrise apartments. The skybridge is free, but it is only a one way crossing to keep the crowds down so plan your hike properly using the maps posted in the park."
,,Family Trip with children under 12,4.0,,"A good change from the city buzz.
Flatter terrain as compared to the Bukit Timah Hill Walk.
Passed some folks who came walking in heels!
Do come with proper footwear, as the walk can be quite stressful for the feet.

Went with 3 children aged 6, 10 & 11.
The olders ones had fun and could keep up.
The youngest got tired just before we reached the treetop walk.
Considering the journey back & the looming dark clouds, we had to turn back.
Will go again!"
,,Good walking,5.0,,Great place to get some serious walking in! Did several walks here of varying lengths depending on the kids mood and our drive to convince them to walk. Love the board walk along the reservoir as well as the tree top walk. Coffee shop serves good value for money food at the end of the walk.
,,"Run, jogg, walk, enjoy !",4.0,,"for sportive, family with picnic , Sunday walks , discover the amazing nature of Singapore within a park around a reservoir."
,,Early bird running trail,5.0,,"Great circuit to start and early run, made my first 10km here with a lot of ups and downs on the way. mostly sun protected by forest. Hard to reach from downtown, taxi may be required."
,,Nice stroll in a tropical forest,4.0,,"I wanted to see another side of Singapore, so as I like walking, I went to the MacRitichie trail. You start around a lake, then through the forest itself. About 2 hours to do the big loop. Very enjoyable."
,,Stunning but strenuous walk for kids <10,5.0,,"Having lived in Singapore for 4 months I should have undertaken this attraction much sooner. I've loved hiking in England and the United States and assumed good hiking didn't exist in Singapore. I was wrong. We began our journey at the lesser known but free car park at Venus Drive (off Upper Thompson Rd - on the East side) and hiked to the tree tops. This will leave you with a 4.5 mile or 7km hike. My kids, 7 and 10, were tired but enjoyed the hike. We saw much younger kids being carried by parents and so keep in mind that this will be too strenuous for under 5's. Its not stroller-friendly either, but if you wanted to absolutely minimize walking, you could get a cab to the Singapore Island Country Club and begin the hike (5km) from that area (check a map for the exact path). Within minutes of hiking, families of inquisitive but friendly monkeys were coming over to us (within 3 feet) and we got better photos than even the Monkey Forest in Bali. The hike was strenuous, use mosquito repellant (there aren't too many mozzies) and take plenty of water. Y can refill bottles at the Rangers Headquarters about 2 kilometers in. Although I suffer from a fear of heights, I didn't feel worried on the gently swaying bridge suspended about a hundred or more feet from the air. The views are spectacular and their are good wildlife photography opportunities along the way. Just don't leave a camera unattended for a timer-produced photo else a monkey might steal it. Overall an incredibly enjoyable family activity that was a welcome break from the usual bustle of Singapore."
,,incredible rainforest in city state,5.0,,"Firstly, MacRitchie is not the only point of entry for what is known as the vast Central Catchment Area in Singapore, but it is the most recognisable landmark, especially if you're taking public transport. Other points of entry are Bukit Timah Nature Reserve which is separately listed here as a tourist attraction, as well as Pierce Reservoir. Lesser known entry points include Jalan Kampung Chantek, Rifle Range Road and Chestnut Drive. If you go from these points, you will likely have the trail entirely to yourself. As others have pointed out, Bt Timah is getting crowded and MacR is also well-used, even during week days.

At the quiet sectors you are more likely to come across (harmless, non-venomous) snakes lying across the path, monkeys that aren't aggressive because they haven't been fed by the hordes of visitors, skinks basking in the sun, brilliant birds with lilting calls, ranges of tree fungus and plenty of other wildlife and fauna.

You can take a one-hour brisk walk, 3-hr long trek or stop to stare at every fascinating part of nature, depending on your fancy and time available. The trails are not suitable for kids under 6 as the path can be rocky or criss-crossed by roots. You need to be intrepid enough.

The v young (in strollers) or old or wheel-chaired will find the board walk from MacRitchie easy going and you get to be right up to the waters' edge as well as in the jungle.

It may be useful to bring an umbrella, not only to shade from the sun (the few stretches with jungle canopy) or tropical showers but also as a useful distraction/ weapon against the monkeys that may approach. Make sure you have no food with you, even in a bag, as they can smell it and may attack you for it. This is esp if you have toddlers with snacks.

Visited January 2011"
,,Amazing .....,4.0,,"Did this trek with hubby son and his girlfriend, it was amazing the views and natural habitat breath taking - take plenty of water !!!"
,,Enjoy the tree tops,4.0,,"When you need a little break from daily hustle, do check out MacRitchie Trial. It's isolated from the mainland and the trials there are good. Do not forget to take lots of water while going there."
,,Great bit of nature & exercise in secluded area of big city life,5.0,,"Love this place. I frequently am in Singapore on business and try to sneak off for the Sky Bridge loop on a jog/walk trip (~1 hour 35 minutes) for me.

Trails are nice and wide, the hustle and bustle noises of big city are not existent and provides great escape.

Take lots of water as it is always hot and humid and note that if you tie in the sky bridge loop you best do the trail route counter-clockwise as the sky bridge is a one way."
,,Really enjoyed the Tree Tops,5.0,,"When you need a break from the city, make your way to the MacRitchie Trail. You will be surprised by the serenity and feel of isolation. It is a real gem. As a native North American, I especially enjoyed seeing monkeys and monitor lizards!! Wear a sturdy pair of shoes, take some water, and make the effort to walk the Tree Tops route. You will not be disappointed."
,,Last bit of rain forest,4.0,,As one of the last bits of primary rain forest this is a haven in singapore. various trails from 3-11km. There is also a tree top walk. If you like a trail run the 11k circular route is to be reccomended. Lots of wildlife to see but take your own water.
,,Excellent choice for morning walks,5.0,,"The natural rainforest reserve in Singapore, located in the central northern part of the island. Several walking trails for easy morning walks along boardwalks, which would take about an hour or so. Can also choose to walk along jungle paths. Full trail is about 12km, walking would take about 2 and a half hours depending on individual pace. Not easy to lose one's way with many well-placed signboards. Good way to spend time in the nature, either alone or with friends or family."
,,Real jungle so close to the concrete jungle,5.0,,"If you feel like escaping the consumer paradise that is Singapore then this is the place to do it. There are parts of the nature trail where you could be forgiven for thinking you'd been dropped in the middle of the Amazon (hmmm, well this may be overstating it, and I've never been to the Amazon, but I'm sure you get my drift). It's an excellent place to go for a run if you don't mind leaping over the occasional tree root (or monkey), or just to go for a wander!"
,,"Great walking track suspension bridge, lookout tower easy 11km walk",4.0,,"We caught the bus here. good well marked walking tracks. Walk is mainly flat. Saw monkeys on the suspension bridge, went to the lookout tower, did 11km of walking. you can hire canoes. Saw monkeys at the kiosk."
,,Nature Lovers & Keep Fit,5.0,,"The first time me going along the MacRitchie Nature Trail was purely accidental. I had been looking for some place to spend a Sunday afternoon and after searching the web, decided i wanted to visit this reservoir. Little did i realize i will get on to the trail. I kept walking in search of the Tree Top Walk. It mentioned about 4 Km, i watched the turtles, the fishes, the kayaks, the kids playing, the monkeys, the trail, the ups and downs and realized i was all alone most of the trail. After walking all the way up to tree top did i realize that i was walking a circular path and cannot exit easily. Lucky me, i was fit enough to complete the entire path, considering that never had i walked continuously like that for 3 hours before maybe in the last 10 years. I did not take water or any refreshment. The rangers station had water and i felt lucky. The walk was very motivating & the views kept changing. You walk along boardwalk, ups and downs a forest path, along a tar road, along a barb wired fence, up a steep road, tree top steel bridge, up & down steps (the toughest part for me), plain stretch in thickly wooded area, then a boardwalk along a golf course, sandy path along the lake, tar road along the lake, narrow muddy path (take care if rained recently, the path gets slushy at times), back to a good boardwalk. I got to see a really huge monitor lizard, monkeys, fishes, turtles at numerous places along the walk. Since it was a Sunday afternoon, there were very few people. I started walking regularly out there during weekends & found this place is just right for getting myself to a bit better shape. The walking time taken reduced drastically & gives me a good feel. it is crowded during morning times of weekends but quite very less crowded in the afternoon. Evenings will have the regular joggers & walkers.

For first timers who haven't walked in quite sometime, stick to the trails which are easy or take sufficient water\ energy drink and walk only if it hasnt rained atleast for a day or two. There are numerous trails out there and you can choose based on difficulty, review the route maps near the cafe & restrooms.

For causal visitors, walk over the reservoir gates, walk up to the start of the trail, see the monkeys, fishes and turtles and better turn back :) You may want to view the zig zag bridge & submerged pathway on the other end of the reservoir gates. Take lot of snaps and dont take the trail..."
,,Really worth the effort,5.0,,"I recently walked the whole way around with my mum. She is 72yrs old but fit don't attempt this if you are notof moderate fitness.
It took us 4 1/2 hrs and we started it at 7.15am I recommend you start early as it gets hot. The suspension bridge doesn't open until 9am and we got to it by 8.45am so didn't have to wait too long. Walk with a water bottle and in sandshoes. Run it by all means you will love it if you normally run 10ks. We saw plently of nature including a snake, monkey, squirrels and huge butterflies. You must do this at least once or walk it once and go another day and make it your run. There are shorter routes but hey whats the point ........?"
,,Dissapointed,5.0,,"We caught a taxi from Scotts road and it took about 10min, we were very surprised that it was so close to the city, beautiful scenery, and walk trail, we walked for about 5km and got to the Tree top walk only to find that it was closed on Monday which is the day we walked, very dissapointed that the signage was not visible at the begining of the walk as it should be, So dont go MONDAYS, although we did enjoy the walk."
,,Great exercise and nature,5.0,,"The natural trail, the quietness and most of all, the safety feeling that nothing awful like crimes etc. Great view of the golf course too"
,,Great for a Sunday morning run.,5.0,,"A stones throw from my home in University Avenue, the trail is a wonderful way to spend a Sunday morning. At about 12 kms for the loop, take plenty of water"
,,The path less travelled,5.0,,"For urbanites in Singapore, a trail run would take some extra effort. The most popular trail is undisputedly at MacRitchie reservoir, accessible only by vehicular transportation, but well worth the effort.

The full route takes 10.5 km, and you have an option of clockwise or anti-clockwise. Either way is just as tough or fun, however you perceive it.

Strava has a few segments to pit yourself against other runners.

If pressed for time, there is the shorter 5 km route used by cross country runners. If you have more time, take the detour through Rifle Range trail. Not as well suited for running, with steeper slopes and uneven surfaces, and a small stream to contend with (just a couple of feet wide, shallow with stones so as not to get your shoes wet!).

Keep an ear out for ""Fore"" when golfers at SICC send one or two your way. I picked up a few golf balls from my runs there.

Then there is the broadwalk through the swamp. About 700 to 800m long, it is a gradual downslope on the anti-clockwise route. Watch out for a dodgy step midway through and keep to the center of the broadwalk.

I entitled this review the path less travelled, but in truth, you'd find a good number of people hitting the trail. Especially to the tree top walk. No shortage of company - runners, hikers, casual strollers, and yes, dogs (on leash) too.

For more challenging trails, check out the Bt Timah and Kranji trails. But MacRitchie is a good start."
,,Lots of wildlife on this tropical walk,5.0,,"We had a great day out. Started at 12:30pm and finished at 5:15pm. More wildlife than at the Bukit Timah trail. We managed to see several families of monkeys including 4 babies, a turtle, many butterflies, several lizards (biggest was about three feet long) and a squirrel.

The heat of course is the challenging factor. If you are doing the whole 11 kilometers plus the Tree walk you might want to take a couple of litres of water for two people and top up half way.

We were going to exit at the Rangers Hut but were advised that taxis will not come that far. Not sure about this as others subsequently have suggested that it might be possible.

We ended up doing the whole 11 kilometers and got caught in a rain storm on the way back. initially quite fun and cooling but when some branches came down it gor scary briefly.

All in all a great day out to be highly recommended."
,,Great day out,5.0,,"monkeys running around, lots of people out on the water kayaking, lots of greenier and wondering walk ways. definitely worth the hike to the canopy tree top walk. if you just want to chill on the grass and watch the world go by or get amongst the bush and hike about its a great day out. Beware of the thieving monkeys tho! they want whatever it is you have."
,,Amazing place for a run,5.0,,"I come here often to run. It's an amazing, especially early in the morning when the temperature is still ""fresh"" (by Singaporean standards). Not so many tourists make their way here but it's definitely worth it for those who do!"
,,A nice nature reservoir for many years,4.0,,"Really nice and close to the expressway. This reservoir was with me for many years even I was born. Way before when I was in Secondary school, we would come here every year for our 2.4km cross country run. Now, the reservoir has become modern but not losing its nature. You can spend long hours trailing.."
,,Nature in the City,5.0,,We were delighted to find this beautiful rainforest so close to the city and went for a run and lunch there. It was easy to find some nice quiet walks away from the crowds and catch a glimpse of the local monkeys.
,,A tranquil getaway in the heart of the city,4.0,,"i have been there a few times, taking my son trekking during his school holidays. it was surprisingly beautiful and i was so thankful to have a piece of lush greenery and a sanctum of tranquility right in the heart of our loud, crowded bustling city!
the macritchie tree-tops is a gem! it may not be calypso bridge or other famous bridges, yet it does not disappoint either."
,,"Monkeys, Lizards and more!",5.0,,"MacRitchie is a truly tranquil and refreshing getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. Walk along the boardwalk and watch the still lake, complete with terrapins and tortoises. Make sure you keep your bag closed so as not to encourage the monkeys- they can be pretty inquisitive! Keep an eye out for the monitor lizards and tropical birds. A great way to enjoy the tropical weather."
,,great to get into the jungle without the noise of Singapore,5.0,,"yes it is hot like hell and full of bugs, but it is a great work out. the long trail which takes you to the tree top walk is great two hours. And the area near the reservoir is really nice too."
,,Inspiring walking trail,4.0,,"There are several walking trails of varying distances and panorama. One takes you across a golf course, another on boardwalk. The forest trails are perfect for early morning walks/runs. Clean. Ready access to toilets. There is a small coffee shop too."
,,back to nature,4.0,,"Well worth a visit - if you are hiking bring water ! Whilst not difficult it can be tricky in places --- not really suitable for small kids (unless you want to carry them for 10 KM !

regular running route for me and i simply love it"
,,Another great jogging trek,4.0,,"As I'm kind of sport person, so when come to Singapore I try to seek jogging trek. My Singaporean friend once brought me to this place. I like it also as they really make the trail easy access so we can walk comfortly and can reach the end of the trails. The view is great. I choose to walk throught the treetops, place where they made a bridge higher then the tree. So it means, you can see the tree tops or even you are higher then the treetop itself.
I wish I can be there next time."
,,Nature Trekking,5.0,,"What a great experience. I have visited there several times, and absolutely agree that this is a heaven place for nature lovers and adventurers. You can do many activities in Mac Ritchie:professional trekking of 10 km or more with tough terrain and high chance of encountering wild life such as lizard,monkeys,etc, conquering the highest HSBC tree top walk in the middle of the trails.
Besides, families can hang out for picnic and a litte nature touch for kids in the Thomson Entrance with lots of grassland near the vast and sound lake. My friends are planning play kayaking on the lake, i am gonna join them then."
,,surprising forest walk in the city,4.0,,"Most tourists don't know about this series of forest walks and man-made lake, though there are many local walkers and joggers. When I arrive at Changi on an early flight, I change to shorts and trainers, then I take a taxi to the reservoir centre. There you will find a simple and cheap open-air restaurant, toilets and many impudent monkeys. The park itself offers one other high-quality restaurant which is brand new in April 2013, with scenic views over the water.

You can enjoy shorter walks along the reservoir on boardwalks. the longest trail is 12 kms long and takes you over tracks which can be muddy in places. Good trainers are fine, but expect to get them a little muddy. Start at the centre and walk anti-clockwise,because if you go to the optional treetop walk later, it is a one-way system that closes at 5pm. After that, much of the walk is on boardwalks for a while, though you will still find yourself, in parts, on muddy pathways.

You might encounter more monkeys. Don't go near the babies. The males may be aggressive, so don't make eye contact,but do pick up a stick or stone in case. Don't ever feed them! you might also see a monitor lizard or two - they get up to 3 metres long, but are totally non-aggressive and you can just walk past them if they are on the path. I once had a snake cross and recross my path, but they won't be a problem if you don't threaten them. Just stand still until it leaves the scene.

Apart from that, take plenty water for the walk which will take around 2.5 hours for the full version. You will find only one ranger station, about 45 minutes into the walk. Use the toilets there, because there are no more until you arrive back at the centre and, this being Singapore, it is probably illegal to go behind the bushes. If you find yourself in a thunderstorm, take shelter in one of the insulated wooden shelters along the path or seek protection in one of those on the golf course until the storm passes over.

These are just a few hints - it's a lovely energetic walk that gets the blood flowing after a long flight. Enjoy!"
,,Have hour or two for a nature walk,4.0,,"I will have a walk in MacRitchie once a month. Getting deeper in to the forest makes you forget that you are in busy, noisy town. Relaxing feeling in quietness of the nature. Sure relaxing.

Either entering from Venus drive and walk a Tree Top walk. It takes for me about 1h 30 mins or from main entrance and walk around the reservoir lake 11 km trail.

It is easy to make shorter walks in there as well just to escape the town."
,,green bridge,5.0,,"wonderfull place to exit the busy city life and get back in touch with nature and the forest, I particularly like the walk on the top of the bridges surrounded by green trees, high up at tree level, looking down at so many different kind of tropical trees and feel the freshness of the air."
,,Back to Nature Trail,4.0,,"The MacRitchie Nature Trail is really a challenge even for those who are just hiking along. On my hike, I saw many teenagers jogging and racing along and told myself that it was really a wonder they didn't turn their ankles as the trail was pretty rocky and muddy at some places.

Liked the trail as it brought me into close contact with nature, heard and saw lots of birds and even a monitor lizard basking in the sun."
,,Free! Excellent outdoor adventures.,5.0,,"A variety of options to choose from at Mac Richie. We did the
12.5km walk a feet in itself with the humidity! Great little adventure and easy trails. The treetop view from the Capone bridge were amazing. Great family activity and a big plus free. there are water sports and playground also. Well worth a visit."
,,"beautiful location for walking, jogging or simply relaxing by the waters edge",5.0,,"If you're tired of shopping and highrise buildings this is a great place to recharge. Leave your thongs in the hotel and wear your runners instead. There are many trails in the park some with boardwalks stairs and sealed surfaces. Many of the tracks are on uneven ground complete with mud, treeroots, sharp stones and inclines, but don't let this put you off.

The Treetop walk over the forrest canopy is great and I found it very relaxing walking around the banks of the reservoir. There are monkeys roaming freely around the forrest and the park.

There aren't many ammenities once you leave the area near the park enterance and carrying a water bottle is a must as it can be very warm when walking. I would also recommend wearing a hat and sunscreen.

This is a huge reserve that is easy to get to by public transport with many buses stopping just outside the gate. You can catch the MRT to Farrer Park (CC20) get on the 165 or 93 bus.

If you want go to the Treetop walk, catch the MRT to Marymount (CC16) and take a taxi to the carpark at the end of Venus Drive."
,,Perfect for a Sunday walk or run,5.0,,"My boyfriend and i like to walk here be it Afternoon or Evening. In the afternoon, we suggest that you wear a sunblock, comfortable clothes, walking shoes and water. In the evening, bring a mat and food!!!! Such a quiet and tranquil location in Singapore."
,,Trail Run,5.0,,"Set among the lush vegetation of Macritchie Reservoir, the trail which for me starts where just beyond the band stand and fitness corner, is good for serious runners (and walkers), with ample hills & twists and turns to keep it interesting. Instead of turning left at the junction, turn right towards the water's edge for a run back on the boardwalk - a much more pleasant return than breathing in the smong on Lornie Road. Those hard core long distance runners can try a circumnavigation of the reservoir by starting from the wooden bridge (near the canteen) and do lefts all the way around - a far more difficult course, but equally interesting -watch out for the monkeys and keep hydrated."
,,nice trail walk,4.0,,simple but really amazing. for people who afraid of the height would also no problem. the view is very nice too
,,Great if you like the outdoors,3.0,,"We went on a day when it was pouring with rain, thunder and lightning. I have to say it was a little creepy! But, you can walk for hours through the trail, and get up close and personal with the monkeys. Just be a little cautious though, they can get a little too close!"
,,A beautiful walk with lots of wildlife!,4.0,,"It is a very beautiful walk but it can get quiet busy. You can see a lot of monkeys and lizards and birds, just make sure you don't walk around with food in your hand, the monkeys will love it too.
Bring enough water and sunscreen. It is a fairly easy walk."
,,Nice trail,3.0,,This is a nice park to visit but there's too many monkeys running around and they tend to be aggressive. They would grab our food and can be scary.
,,Hot but very relaxing and tranquil,5.0,,Subjected to the sun for most of the walk however this is a must for any outdoor fan. Take sun screen and water
,,Popular spot at the weekend,5.0,,"We started our walk around the 11km trail at 08:15, it was already pretty busy with joggers and walkers. The trail was usually fairly easy going, although some small sections require a little care. We particularly enjoyed the tree top walk."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We did the full circuit here (I think 12 or 13k) and it's beautiful. You'll see monkeys, lizards, lots of birds and some really beautiful views with the highlight being the treetop bridge.

It's really a beautiful part of Singapore and hard to believe it's in such a densely populated place.

Would recommend going in the morning (it's baking hot by noon) and go prepared with water, though there are a couple of fountains on the trail.

It's not particularly hardcore hiking, but there are some rocky bits, so don't go in flip flops!"
,,Also see kayaking here,5.0,,There are different walking trails at Macritchie and also kayaking can be done here. There is a trail which will you a real feel of Jungle.
,,"Lovely Walking, but Beware of Monkeys",4.0,,"Singapore has made a concerted effort over recent years to develop 'green spaces' to attract people away from its shopping malls and into the open air for walking, picnics, games or simply lazing away an afternoon in the tropics.

The MacRitchie Nature Trail is a perfect example of a setting developed with an eye to enjoying nature and talking an interesting and rambling walk. But beware of the monkeys. They can be quite aggressive and will steal your picnic lunch if given half a chance.

One could visit for an hour to have a look around or spend several hours wandering and relaxing. When we have visited, car parking has been available without a problem, though I imagine that might not be the case on a weekend."
,,warning the trail in the treetops is closed on Mondays,4.0,,"lovely area--easy to reach by bus but was soooooo disappointed to read the sign that the treetop walk closed on mondays did walk anyway---at least we knew but ran into some groups who at the top found out the treetop walk was closed ---saw the lizards and monkeys easily got my 10,000 steps in take water and watch out for the monkeys....."
,,Nature in the city,5.0,,"Brilliant place for long walks... A huge area with water ways, lots of trees and some wild animals in the jungle in the city"
,,Cool shaded gardens,3.0,,"Cool shaded gardens in the heart of the city, elevated so you could view singapore 360 degrees. plenty of shaded pathways to escape the heat of singapore"
,,A piece of peace and tranquility,4.0,,"Easy to access and great greenery. With fauna and flora to explore and getting close to nature, wonderful place to visit and walk about."
,,Must see trip,5.0,,"This is definitely worth doing. We did the 11k walk which is tiring but a must-do - the main reason being the views from the tree top walk. Take lots of water. The monkeys are lovely but don't feed them! Go by public transport on the way there, but treat yourself to a taxi on the way back - you'll need it!"
,,Marcrichie reservior,4.0,,"Great place to relax. Good place to your family to there and enjoy the fresh air, animals sound. Everyone know Singapore is garden city, once you enter this forest, you will find something different from city."
,,Good for nature lover,4.0,,"Can spend about 2 hour for the nature walk. Good for either group walk or alone in the morning. Located at central of Singapore Island, easy to access by car or bus.The nearest MRT station is Caldecott station. Beware of the monkeys, don't expose your food/drinks during the walk. Beware of snapped branches as trees are mostly maintain in their nature growth. Good for nature lover."
,,Watch out for monkeys,5.0,,"A really enjoyable boardwalk, but quite strenuous as the full walk is several kms with a number of climbs, combined with Singapore heat & humidity. Hundreds of monkeys in the trees as you start out, so keep tight control of food, cameras etc, but they were non threatening and added to the experience."
,,Wear good shoes,5.0,,fantastic old favourite for a good walk - it does get muddy on the trails so wear closed in shoes (trainers) - you often see a large komodo on the way - always adds a bit of excitment to the walk and makes you go faster..
,,Nice and tranquil - besides some joggers,4.0,,"Went here last Sunday with the family and made the mistake to take the buggy. The path leading to the treewalk has loose gravel/stones and according to some hikers there are treetrunks further on. We took the prunes trail instead and this had some stairs. It's doable with light buggy, but if your child can't walk on her own you need to be with two to carry her up and down. Also spotted a very large lizard!"
,,Animal walk,5.0,,"Went for a walk (10k+) beautiful place, with all sorts of animals like, monkeys and lizards living in the wild. The tree top walk was a great experience too"
,,Take water when you go for a walk,4.0,,"Within easy reach of central Singapore this is a green oasis with a very large lake/reservoir and well marked walking and jogging trails. There are changing facilities at the entrance and places to leave your stuff if you are feeling energetic and want to join the many joggers! Buy water to drink as it gets very hot and sticky walking. When you walk round the lake, look out for the turtles/terrapins some of them are really large. We also saw quite a large iguana at the edge of the lake. Don't be tempted to feed the monkeys as they can apparently get a bit aggressive."
,,Rainforest walk in the city,5.0,,"It is hard to believe this tropical rainforest walk is so close to the city. You can choose the length and difficulty of your walk, with boardwalks and nature trails. Beautiful surrounds, birdlife and monkeys. Easy access with public transport."
,,Do NOT feed the monkeys!,4.0,,"A great way to stretch your legs and see some of the more tropical scenes in Singapore, wasnt too long and the views from the bridge are incredible. One word of advice though is stay clear of the monkeys and do not feed them, one of them challanged us for food, so be careful."
,,Come if you dont mind getting yourself dirty,5.0,,"you may get yourself dirty!
if you like trekking or running please do come and visit this place! grab your PE attire and come!
this place is a little hard to find so please do your research before coming!
fantastic trail with beautiful scenery inside!
when you pass by monkeys please do not feed them and please do not leave ur belonging around as the monkeys there are very mischievous, they may just steal your stuffs away.. hahahahaha! there was once the monkey opened my friend's bag and took a packet of chips away! hahahahahaha!"
,,Perfect Getway,5.0,,"Getting There: MRT to Caldecott station, circle line. Alight and walk towards the Thompson road, cross and keep to your extreme left and 15 min later, you will reach Macritchie reservoir. Take bus 851, 54 and get down at Opp mediacorp stop and walk to the reservoir. Take 167. 980 and get down in front of reservoir stop.
In the Reservoir: walk the wooden trail behind the busstop and do up towards the reservoir gates. You can see the water flowing out at very speeds into the canals from the small dam setting. These gates will be locked by 6pm. There is also a canoeing station and you can rent them even in the eveing. Advisable and mandatory to wear the life jacket and attend a short course of the safety at the reservoirs and routes to canoe. We didnt try yet, but it looked great to see others try them.
You can then head to Mushroom cafe for small brunch to lunch sets and drinks. They have good varieties to offer and prices are very reasonable. You can use the lockers provided to change into your running gear and head up the trails. Opposite the restaurant, there is a boardwalk, with set of plants and water running through them. In the night time, its so pleasant and relaxing to sit down there. Head up to the running trail, you will come across floating deck with zig zag paths. Also there is a stretch of footpath, immersed in water and you will be walking. Its quite exciting to know, next step is so deep and yet you are safely walking across the water submerged foot path. There are 2 sets of exercise stations. The one near the newly opened bar and restaurant at the hill and other one is well 4 kms tucked away in the forests. After the first set of exercise station, civilization disappears away and you are looking in to the mystic forests.
The Mystic Forest: There are 2 ways to approach the next step of exercises station, which was our target. It was 4 pm already, and we decided to take the boardwalk along the water. You would come across friendly monkeys, dont shoo them away, if you are in the 4 foot wide boardwalk. Walk slowly and keep up a friendly stance. Else they can shoo you, and you can swim back home. walking along the boardwalk is like here or eternity, sometime its nothing but waters on one side and forest on this side, with no signs of human anywhere. The water are crystal clear or too dark and it evokes mixed feelings of awe and fear together. There are some wooden benches along the boardwalk projecting out in the water, perfect place for photography, yoga, scream the name of the person you love or curse your boss. There are some place, where boardwalk ends, and you will find your way along the water banks and pick up the trail left. It was exciting and intriguing as you prod further along the boardwalk. You can see tortoises, big fishes and sometimes small snakes in the water. Keep calm and enjoy the moment.
Second Exercise station: This exercise station is unique, nestled among deep forests, around 5.30 pm, the silence was deafening. Every noise that we heard was different, it was the real sense of being in forest, alone that makes it all the more exciting. So while heading back, decided to do the forest trial and avoid boardwalks as water looks scary, with no lights on the boardwalks and no human presence, it was utterly surreal. Once we hit the forest trial, boy we were in for a big surprise, with no lights in place and all kinds of sounds and noises and visibility down to 4 feet, we felt boardwalk was a better choice It was like a dark tunnel with no means to end. With LED lights from the mobile phones and occasional fast runners scaring us from behind, we reached the civilization around 7 pm. Even if we think now, that one time, first time experience was an experience of a life time. We are planning for other sections of the trails in the coming months and once again experience the true nirvana of being in a forest.
Pros: Well read above
Cons: Absoultely none
verdict: Good place for running, jogging, yoga, tai chi and group jogging sessions on weekends. You can also camp at few places, although better to chekc it up with the management. take waterbottles if you are going in for long run into the forests and ya, big flash lights :). Overall This is the Perfect GETAWAY for anybody."
,,best run in months,5.0,,"i was in singapore for a short time. but i as always had all my running stuff with me. i had chosen the reservoir as my running spot in singapore even before going there. i downloaded the gps file for the route into my garmin. i arrived to singapore in the morning and i was at the reservoir in the afternoon. i started my run, i was not expecting to be alone, and there were some other runners too. i was glad that there were others. i asked them to take my photos. this place is really amazing. lots of birds, squirrels, monkeys and other animals watch you run. the place gives amazing views. so make sure you take your camera with you. monkeys are not shy of cameras. there are spots for drinks and toilets along the trail. i had my best run in months and really enjoyed it."
,,Must visit,5.0,,A fantastic trail kept as original as possible complete with monkeys and nature in tact ! Great jogging route to get away from it all - every day !
,,Get out into the tropical jungle of SIngapore!,4.0,,"The trail is reasonably well sign posted, and you can do the Tree Tops suspension bridge (the separate trail for this comes off, and then back onto, the main nature trail). There are just one or two drink / toilet stops along the trail, but they seem to be well placed.

Allow a few hours for the trail; it can be rough in parts, with rocks, gravel etc. and often a bit wet, so make sure you've got some decent shoes on. (It's NOT suitable for prams, etc.) Also ensure you bring a good litre or two per person. It's often hot and almost always humid, so you will perspire.

Note: No dogs allowed, so Muttly / Rover / Pooch will have to stay home."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,Spacious and natural. We saw a sea eagle and large monitor lizard on the path in front of us. There are monkeys in the trees. It was very hot so an umbrella or good hat is definitely necessary. Good places to eat. We loved it there.
,,Singapore Nature's Trail.,4.0,,"Warm & humid at midday! That's typical of Singapore's equatorial climate. So, DO NOT start off too late in the day if you're to visit this Nature Trail. Between half an hour to an hour after daybreak in the morning is a superb time to visit. You'll have cool fresh air to fill your lungs! By mid morning, you'll be able to arrive at the cable suspension bridge to enjoy an experience looking at the on goings of our equatorial forest. And yet, it'll still be cool for you to enjoy your walk.

Do not leave your binoculars at home! Bring them along to to scour the tree top views for tiny animals, insects & butterflies.

Enjoy your walk at our Nature's Trail."
,,great way to stretch your legs!,4.0,,Its a rough track that isnt well maintained so you need to be reasonably fit but its a really nice way to get outdoors in singapore
,,rainforest walk,4.0,,Beware of the signposting and be prepared for an adventure. Path quite difficult in some places if wet but to get a sense of jungle quite lovely. The treetop section has gorgeous views it is hard to imagine how close to the city you are. Great walk.
,,Fitness Place,3.0,,"If you are looking for a nice walk around the big reservoir, do try the 10km trail, Its bound to get you flexed up. Dont expect too much sceneries around. Also, running can be done"
,,Awesome for the outdoors lover,5.0,,"So I had a free afternoon on a recent business trip and decided to escape for a hike, the trail was an easy walk from both buses and the trains but the park was large enough that you lost most of the city effects. I note that this is for an outdoors lover only because this is not flat terrain, there are hills which can be steep at times and at least while I was there a fair bit of mud to contend with in the Singapore heat; other than that the trail was well maintained and had regular signs posting progress and position. I missed the canopy part because it's closed on Monday's but still managed to find monkeys at several points on the trail."
,,A good walk,4.0,,"This is quite a big one. The walk is long, maybe 2 to 3 hours to go all around, depending on your pace. The reserve is flat and the trails can be interesting if you pay attention at the fauna and flora around. Be careful with the monkeys. They know how to open zippers and steal bag contents. Some stupid people feed them, which is against the law to do for obvious reasons, and this is what have made them so daring."
,,Just a wow,5.0,,"This is a great part of Singapore, if you do not fear face-to-face with monkeys. Great scenery! Interesting for nature lovers and photographers..!"
,,Adveture,5.0,,"Its a wonderful place but you shouldnt go during a thunderstorm and as humid as singapore is i didnt seem to mind under those rustling trees, if ur really lucky you will see some of the animals noted on the varies boards around the trail, i did see some cute monkeys towards the end.

Theres different trails you dont have to do 12k and you dont have to do the tree tops or go towards the riffle range

You can have time in a canoe

You can take it easy

Or you can get totally lost and end up by rapid water like me however i dont regret that because it was such a nice place

however one bad thing they most definitly need to give out maps i think its actually ridiculous that there were none to take with you for the trail and there are sign posts every now and again but they dont always make sense"
,,The best run,5.0,,"Did the 11km run and loved every minute of it. Saw the monkeys as well. If you are a runner, do Macritchie, you won't be disappointed."
,,Nature in the middle of Singapore,5.0,,"Would recommend as a break from the city streets. Easy to reach by bus and has good facilities, interpretive signs and is well sign posted. Took the long way around and saw heaps of wildlife - monkeys, a snake, birds and monitor lizards (one huge 2m)."
,,oasis of peace,5.0,,"The nature trail is a route round this famous reservoir. The whole area was immaculate, not a speck of litter and a chance to walk or run for 10K in both open and shady surroundings. There were even two ""keep fit"" areas. It was a welcome break from the hustle of Singapore City life. There was an information centre, with a cafe and the usual drinking fountain. A full day out at no cost at all."
,,Love it,5.0,,"Love it... i had a long walk aver the mchritchie reservoir few times. and it was nice experience.. Only get robbed by a monkey. stolen my evergy drink, so i was oblige to continue my trekking without drink"
,,Your Wake-up Walk,4.0,,"Surrounded by dense urban objects, this piece of nature - early in the morning and just before sunrise - enlightens your morning walk as the animals are up there to do their morning hunting. When the sun shines your energy goes up. Good for individual and for groups. Be there before 06:15am to avoid the crowds in the weekend."
,,Great walk,5.0,,"You should add the long 10km approx. run in on every other weekend a least. The greenery and nature is great ... You'll often see some cool wildlife as well ... Snakes, lizards, monkeys"
,,An excellent nature walk,4.0,,This is an excellent nature walk in the middle of the city. A very refreshing walk off the hectic city life. The trails are prepared safely and the place is good for people of all ages.
,,Trail Runners,5.0,,"A well marked, safe, and walkable jungle trail around Singapore's most accessible reservoir. The trail is clogged by trail runners on weekend mornings, so watch out. Monkey's are skilled at stealing food, no supermarket shopping bags should be carried, the monkeys have learned they contain food. Its a nice nature spot in the middle of Singapore, worth a nice walk (or run) through the jungle."
,,Deceptive distance,3.0,,Only attempt this before 3pm....quite a distance (12km) and can get quite dark quite quickly. Worth a trip for exercise but not alot to see. Of particular note is the old bridge foundations to the japanese Shinto shrine built by allied POW's. You can't see the shrine any more but you can see the bridge piles when the level of the reservoir is low.
,,Nature walk in Singapore,4.0,,"Since it has been upgraded few years ago, MacRitchie nature trail is my favourite morning walk location. It has build the boardwalk round the reservoir, and into the forest as well. If you are adventure enough, you can even walk till Bukit Timah Hill. You can even do canoeing on the reservoir now. One thing do remembered. not to feed the monkey."
,,A pleasant park,5.0,,"Easy to locate, easy to park our car. Lots of trees,ideal place for jogging and brisk walking .Trail is safe."
,,You don't believe it is in Singapore,5.0,,"It is really nice place to jog, walk or just relax, total trail about 13 km. It became my regular visit for walk."
,,One of my favourite spots in Singapore,5.0,,"The walk around the Reservoir begins on a boardwalk path that takes you into the jungle history of Singapore. No more lions, but lots of tropical birds in sanctuary close to the central business district. The macaque monkeys are worth the trip, and in half a day you will sense what early settlers had to deal with in flora and fauna. Peaceful, quiet, and still convenient but mind the rains when the side trails can become slippery with mud."
,,Nature in town,5.0,,"If you are lucky you can see monitors and monkeys, butterflies, birds for sure, you walk through fields and forests, there is a viewpoint on a little tower"
,,See the jungle easily,5.0,,"Check out the remaining portions of jungle in Singapore, and perhaps even detour to visit the site of the WW2 POW built Shinto shrine hidden within."
,,great escape from the city,5.0,,"We took a bus that took us to the Opp Flame Tree Pk stop, where we took Venus Drive and then followed trail signs for the HSBC Tree Top Walk, which was very well marked with occasional maps along the way. We saw several monkeys and hardly any other walkers/runners. The Tree Top Walk was very secluded and took quite a bit of walking to get to, but the walk was not strenuous by any means. We then walked to the tower, which offers more great views and even a breeze at the top.The trail is occasionally a board walk which is very nice and even. I would recommend bringing some water, because it is always humid and the few inclines and stairs can make you thirsty! And don't forget your umbrella, because storms can roll up out of no where! I'd also where shoes that you don't care about getting muddy.
If you're up for a longer hike, you can walk back along the golf course edge (but still mostly in jungle) and then on the board walk along the reservoir, which eventually leads you to a different part of the park and catch another bus back to the city. All of this walking took us about 3 hours, and was free!"
,,Place when you want to walk in or running in the morning,4.0,,I like this place especially when there are a lot of people kayaking. But beware of some monkeys around there. Their targeting your bag.
,,Reaching the Tree Top Walk wasn't too easy,4.0,,"Our taxi dropped us off in the morning at the MacRitchie Reservoir visitor centre, and based on the map drafted on the visitor centre cafeteria wall we decided to have a short walk to the HSBC Tree Top Bridge. It seemed to be only 5-6 km away, but after walking through the one-way Tree Top trail it didn't really matter any more which way to walk back as the distance from the end of the trail to any park exit was about 5-6 km. We then ended up walking around the lake + the Tree Top trail itself, in total something like 10-15 km, and it took us about 4 hrs in total.

Our walk was very moist even though it didn't rain. There was no direct sunlight in the forest, but no wind either. It was Saturday so we saw a lot of people jogging here and there, and a few monkeys which didn't seem to care about any passers by.

A few tips for the walk in this park:
- Good shoes are essential, as the trail surface is very course and rocky. After the rain it can be very muddy and slippery also, at least my sandals were full of yellow mud afterwards.
- After the visitor centre area, the only possibility to find drinking water seems to be the local ranger's office close to the beginning of the TreeTop Walk. There's a tap available for filling in the water bottles. We didn't find any toilets, cafeterias or kiosks either along the trails.
- There are a few shelters along the way for having a break, but only a few so it makes sense to carry an umbrella."
,,Very nice place away from the city but don't forget your umbrella,5.0,,Decided to walk the trail to see the Tree Top Bridge. Was a beautiful hike (took us some 4 hours to walk the full trail) and saw a lot of monkeys and other animals. View from Tree Top Bridge is very nice. We were however surprised by a rain storm and got wet to the bone. So bring an umbrella or poncho. Also bring sufficient water and food as there is nothing to buy along the way.
,,Fun hike,4.0,,"I love Macritchie! Last time I took guests from out of town we did the 7 km hike to the canopy walk, which was great fun. They could not believe they were in the middle of a tropical jungle within such an urban city."
,,"Beautiful nature, see monkeys in the wild",4.0,,"Its a long and tough walk to the HSBC Tree Top walk but you will see monkeys in the wild. Tips: The Tree Top bridge is closed on Mondays, we found out the hard way! Also take plenty of water with you as it is a long way between toilets and water fountains."
,,Good Nature Hike,5.0,,This can be 2.5-3 hours if you want it to be. You will forget for a while you are in a big city. Watch out for the monkeys at Venus Drive!
,,if you like trailing,5.0,,"beautil park, huge park, can take almost one day to walk through, a couple of trails there, small and long, you can choose yours. One to do definitely is the tree top bridge, walk through this bridge sharing your way with kind monkeys, such fun"
,,Nice place for running!,5.0,,It's definitely a perfect place for running! Watching sunset and back to the nature. I am impressed with how Singapore reserve the nature for the residents.
,,Where the wild things are..........,4.0,,A great spot to get away from the bustle of Orchard Road and even better if you are a runner. Good trails well marked and the odd monitor lizard and macaque to keep you on your toes but as yet none of the claimed crocs although investment bankers gasping as they puff around McRitchie make good substitutes!!
,,National Parks in Singapore MacRitchie,4.0,,"A little known fact is the number so parks in Singapore and this is one of them. There are nature trails, picnic Spots and lots to do."
,,Great for a walk / jog,4.0,,"Its about 11km to walk around the reservoir although you can make that a bit longer by adding on e.g. the treetop walk to your route. Part of the trail is along the water and part is through the ""jungle"". You will definitely see monkeys and probably also terrapins and iguanas."
,,Run!,5.0,,"This is a great experience and a look at sgp. The loop is about 10-12 k but you can get around to bukittimah etc so it's limitless really.

The loop is great to run or walk and the showers, cage at the end is a welcome rest bite. There's a kayak school and a treetop walk, but actually just going around is an experience in itself... Left to right is boardwalk flat and then hill, right to left is vice versa....MIT depends when you wan too hit the sun!,,, do not feed the monkeys!!!! Ignore them. The path is through jungle so walking shoes not flip flops. Walking noises ensure the snakes etc aren't a problem but you will hear/ see the monitor lizards, bird, monkeys etc. the ranger station half way around has toilets ( clean) and water."
,,Weekend outdoor activity,5.0,,"Beautiful place to go for a stroll. Boardwalks are nice, and they go really deep into the park Monkeys around - beware!"
,,Evening stroll,4.0,,"A great place to stroll in the cool early evening time. It is popular though and not so large, more like walkers and joggers in a city park. However a walk by the water on easy surfaces is a nice way to chill out for an hour before going back to the hustle and bustle of Singapore."
,,Excellent Refreshing Place,5.0,,"Likes: The place is well planned and it is very safe. In the forest it is cool and you can bring your kids for education and excising purposes. Bus is available right outside of the place.

Dislike: It might rain but there are not many shelter, please bring your raincoat!"
,,The surprising side of Singapore,5.0,,"I am a walker. I walk every day, if I can, for at least an hour, usually much longer.
Macritchie? Fantastic. Here we are in urban Singapore. Walk along the several paths, boardwalks along the lakeside, trails over hills and down dales, climb up to a tree top walk, take two to three hours and walk through to Bukit Timah or even as far as Chua Chu Kang, and you could be anywhere but Singapore.
Monkeys, birds, wildlife, monitor lizards, a few snakes even, squirrels, wild pigs - you will see them. Guaranteed.
I read somewhere that 40% of Singapore, by law, remains green area. It is probably right. It is over ten kilometers to walk from the main entrance at Macritchie to Chua Chu Kang, and apart from one kilometer long the isolated Rifle Range Road, it is bush all the way.
Or just do the circuit around the lower reservoir and wonder as youw ander along the boardwalks and forest paths. Beautiful. About the only danger is from the many joggers who know its attractions and exercise there mainly in the cool of the evening.
You can even cool off and shower in the excellent facilities at the main entrance.
If it rains, a few huts here and there provide shelter.
IN a word, wonderful."
,,Weekend Hike,4.0,,"My partner and I headed over to the reservoir on a Saturday morning and it was fairly easy to get to - although the journey from Pasir Ris to the park did take a significant amount of time, but all worth it. It is best to start hiking as early as 7am before the sun comes hitting its blaze on your face - and regular hikers were also seen. We decided to take a moderate trail, so as not to get lost or too tired on our first visit there. The signboards are pretty straightforward and it is unlikely that you would get lost. It was good to have many ""rest-areas"" in between with clean water to refill our bottles with. We finished at about 12pm."
,,nice to get out of the malls,3.0,,"Note: we only did the Tree Top loop starting at Venus Drive. Fun to see monkeys. Broke a sweat, but doesn't actually feel like you get out into nature. Lots of people everywhere. But it was still a break from the city which was nice"
,,Good place to Exercise,5.0,,"If you like running, go Macritchie,
If you love Nature, go Macritchie,
If you enjoy peaceful environment and escape from city noise, this is a place for you to be.

Going there need to take bus as no near by MRT, do know the route to take early, follow the map advise and don't choose to explore new one, as you may get lost. Enjoy the Run : )"
,,Best hiking in SG,5.0,,"Of course, saying this is the best hiking in SG doesn't say much, but it is a nice long stretch (almost 16+km) of mostly dirt trail where you are largely in serene (urban) rainforest. This does skirt heavy urban areas and a military base, but for being smack-dab in the middle of the city, it provides a nice time-out from urban life."
,,A near-genuine nature experience,4.0,,"You will realize occasionally that you are in a slightly artificial setting (the 'lake' is a managed reservoir and you will be often meters away from a main road or a golf course). However, it is undoubtedly one of the best (and few) ways to be in touch with nature in Singapore. Frequent monkey sightings. Many variations offered over a few trails, all easy (difficulty ratings are really family-oriented) and well maintained; I took the longest option and walked 12 km around the whole reservoir including the detour to the interesting treetop walkway. Definitely a good option if you just have half a day or so."
,,It's even baby-stroller friendly,4.0,,"Nice to get away from the city buzz for a while and sweat out all the toxins. Nice lake, good walk that even is quite baby-stroller friendly for a good part. Mind the monkeys though."
,,Great for a spot of exercise!,4.0,,"The track circumnavigates Macritchie resevoir and is 10.5 kilometres long. There is a car park below the dam from wwhich the trail is easily joined. The route is mostly shaded by the forest and is varied, with several open stretches by the golf course, a boardwalk by the resevoir and through a mangrove swamp. Lots of wildlife, including numerous monkeys, monitor lizards and beautiful birdcalls. Very special in the early morning, with mist rising off the resevoir. If you have time, climb to the top of the tower, half way around and make the detour to the HSBC canopy walk. Best avoided at weekends when it becomes pretty crowded."
,,really nice scene,4.0,,I loved How it was a nice short hike that even young kids can do. The lake is beautiful and it is really fun to do with the family.
,,Great place for a walk,5.0,,"We go here most Sundays for a walk. It's just a nice place to relax, you can walk as little or as much as you feel like. We like to walk all the way round and then indulge ourselves somewhere nice for lunch afterwards. Worth a visit."
,,Natural oasis in the middle of the urban jungle,5.0,,"MacRitchie Reservoir is a fantastic place for a run if you're craving some greenery. I'm from a very green part of the world, and even I was impressed by the existence of such a large and biologically diverse park just a few minutes by taxi from the city center.

We ran the 11 km loop, which is a great workout. There are a variety of shorter loops as well as the TreeTop walk which was closed when we were there. One thing I would recommend as a runner - go early as Singapore is so hot and humid. Also, you might want to consider bringing your own water bottles, as it there is only one water fountain while you're on the trail.

The loop was beautiful, not too crowded, and we saw a fair amount of wildlife. The best part is how far away one feels from the maddening crowds when you're in the middle of the park. It's easy and relatively cheap to take a bus or taxi to MacRitchie, there are lockers and bathrooms at the visitor's center to store your stuff, and plenty of concessions available to quench your thirst afterwards. What a fantastic place!"
,,Fun but very hot of course,4.0,,Enjoyed the walk and it is Singapore so seems very safe and well tended with rest stops/ toilets/ water but all a bit sanitised. We particularly went for the skywalk but it's really very short compared to how far you walk to get there. To do it quickly get dropped off on Venus Road after the Country Club rather than the car park at the bottom of the road. And wear decent walking shoes or trainers at the very least - some areas will not be fun in flip flops
,,Urban Rainforest,4.0,,"Reachable easily by city bus, this park, trail, reservoir is chock full of outside activities. I took a 7 mile (12km) hike from the main area around the entire reservoir and visited the TreeTop walkway and a viewing tower. There are many different trails, some very short and easy, but the trail heading into the forest is moderate, especially after the heavy rain that hit ahead of my adventure. It's a dirt and rocky path, undulating up and down but well maintained and easily walkable. I was glad I put on proper tennis shoes, you could be good with hiking sandals but nothing less. The main building has a lunch bar with drinks and simple snacks such as chicken nuggets and pastries, nice after a 2 hour hike.

Most of the hike is in rainforest, even saw a few monkeys. If you like outdoor activities, this should be on your list."
,,Fantastic jungle experience for newbies,4.0,,I took my wife to MacRitchie this weekend. It was the first time either of us had experienced real tropical jungle and I have to say it was great doing this in a safe well-marked environment. Still struggled with the heat but the highlight was the jungle canopy walk - superb. And very surprising for high density Singapore.
,,Challenging 10 km run,4.0,,"I went there only once with some colleagues for a run on a Sunday afternoon and the only regret is that I never manage to repeat it!
It is a very nice, quite and challenging track. I did not know that such a place was available in Singapore. It is a good place for a walk and couple of hours of green and ""fresh"" air however I think its best side is towards running. The track is about 10 km (for some reason I have in mind 11 or something) and varies from the pavement around the lake to challenging uphill off-road trial.
It is well organized with lockers and showers as well as some soft drink to enjoy after exercise.
The only small problem I had to to find a cab later in the afternoon once our job was completed. Not a big deal anyway, still I wish i could make it again soon."
,,Nice place to be with Nature!,4.0,,"This is one of the most beautiful reservoir i have visited in Singapore. You can do boating, watch monkey, fishes ;)"
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"While it is green,there are too many people who hog and block the trails, slow in giving way to joggers//runners. The track has too many loose peebles, a real safety hazard for serious runners,"
,,Great 10km run,5.0,,"If you run round MacRitchie Nature Trail, it works out just over 10km, most of which is blissfully shaded from the sun. You can run it either way - maybe just run with someone who knows the trail the first time, as there's a couple of turns you may miss (and which lead you to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, making for a far longer run). There's a restroom and watering stop at Ranger Station, about 4.5km into the run if you run the reverse route which is more hilly. Bring just your running shoes and yourself, no food (to avoid attracting the monkeys), a water bottle and have fun!"
,,Beautiful natural haven,5.0,,Absolutely stunning place in the middle of the concrete jungle that is Singapore. We live here and visit it when we need a retreat! Love the curious monkeys and the beautiful natural tracks - highly recommend it. Remember to wear a hat and take a water bottle - do not take food in or the monkeys will enjoy your company! If the monkeys annoy you squirt water near them or wave a stick - try quickly retreat :)
,,A nice long and spectacular walk,4.0,,"Wee done trail, takes you through nice forest and you can hear and see many animals (careful with the monkeys). The bridge is amazing and....there should be more of that. Hope they will expand."
,,Lovely nature trails...,5.0,,"I can't even count how many Sunday afternoons my partner and I hit the trails at MacRitchie Reservoir. A great way to get out of the city and commune a bit with nature. Expect to see monkeys, (Stay away from them! They can be fierce!) possibly monitor lizards and quite a variety of plant, birds and other small animals. The trails easy enough for almost anyone and some of the views are stunning."
,,Back to Nature,5.0,,"In the center of this bustling city is a place to go back to nature... Amazing running trails in the ""lungs"" of this city... Some interesting pieces of information along the way..."
,,Great place to walk around,5.0,,Nice east hikes that range from 1-4 hours. Close to the main areas and easy to get there and back. Would do it again anytime.
,,Singapore nature but not a patch on real rainforest,3.0,,"I do love McRitchie because I regularly run the 11k trail around its perimeter as it's one of the few places in Singapore where you can escape the urban. McRitchie Reservoir Park at the South end of the lake by the dam is a pretty and pleasant place for a walk, but the rainforest is mostly not original, the walking trails are very busy at weekends and the nature-trail parts give only limited insight into the forest.

The HSBC forest bridge is probably the coolest part, but unfortunately it's a long 3k+ walk from the nearest car-park, so this is not a casual walk for families with young kids, more of a serious hike. The two short nature trail boardwalks which start from the eastern end of the lake near the dam are more accessible and pleasant, but nothing special.

The best nature walk in Singapore is really Sungei Buloh: if you're a tourist with limited time, do that one then eat at nearby Bollywood Veggies: skip McRitchie unless you have time to do several walks and see all Singapore's urban attractions as well."
,,Wonderful walking trails,4.0,,"Shady and well-marked walking trails. Popular with weekend crowds and best to explore during the week if you can afford a half-day off since you can explore the area without having to encounter fellow hikers. also, birds and other fauna are easier to spot."
,,Nothing much but Good in the mornings,3.0,,"This is a place to go for a good jog in the morning. However, a little far from the city and you gotta drive to get there. Mornings are best times to go there by the water way."
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Insect repellent is a must but for those who like forrest/jungle walks, this is a fun day out. Lots of monkeys, some interesting birds, different insects (a treat for my two boys, bug hunters) and even lizards. Good way to spend your active Saturday."
,,Cool,4.0,,"If you love nature and want to forget the city life try to visit and spend your day in this beautiful park. Me and my friends used to jog and completed a 13 km trail every sunday morning here in the last few months. there's a lagoon, a downhill and uphill trail and theres a canteen that serve light meals after or before you jog. less crowded on the weekdays as a lot of joggers on weekends. expore the hanging brigde to experience and have good view of the thick forest."
,,Fantastic hike,5.0,,"Took the yellow path all the way around and over the bridge for a fantastic hike full of monkeys, birds, skinks and rainforest views. The full loop is about 12km or 7miles, but easy to follow, great signs and only a few steep sections."
,,Great walk under and over the rainforest,5.0,,It is one place you will forget that you are in Singapore. Peaceful and wonderful trail with various views
,,My favorite nature reserve in Singapore,5.0,,"I went there only once but I would like to come back. It 's a very beautiful reservoir, and there are different trails among which you can choose. I did the 11-km one and it was quite easy. Definitely the best nature reserve in Singapore!"
,,Monkeys are scary!,4.0,,"Beautiful sanctuary in the chaos of SGP, great walks and a lovely attraction hidden in the middle of an international city!"
,,A beautiful hike,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the walk up the MacRitchie Nature Trail, along the Treetop Walk, and back down past the golf course (about 10-11 kms). It was a great experience, well-signposted, on good trails or boardwalks. Fortunately much of the very attractive trail is shaded by foliage, but do take plenty of water, a snack, sunscreen, hat/parasol, and wear good walking shoes. (We didn't have any problems with insects/mosquitoes, but an insect repellent just in case might be a good idea.) We were fortunate enough to see several groups of macaques in the wild (look up into the trees above you!) - we also glimpsed some on the ground that appeared to be eating heliconias. We also spotted monitor lizards. It was a lovely experience I'd highly recommend.
If arriving by public transport, take the MRT to Toa Payoh, then catch bus 157 into Lornie Road. We got off at the bus stop at Lampost 57 (!), then crossed Lornie Road and walked back in the direction the bus had come from for about 500 metres. The entrance here isn't signposted, but look for a driveway turnoff just before the overhead bridge.
Also be aware that the Treetop Walk is currently closed Mondays (and may be a bit daunting for those with a strong fear of heights!)."
,,Great hike!,5.0,,We enjoyed doing the circuit around the reservoir and doiing the canopy walk. Next time we will take the alternate route over to Bukit Timah.
,,Cool walk,5.0,,The suspension bridge is a must when you visit the nature trail. It is close on certain days. Do call before going to check on the opening hours. Do put on loads of insect repellent. Bring along a camera for you may find something exciting to capture in your camera. Great place for family with older kids.
,,A haven on earth,5.0,,"Great place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the island and to enjoy nature.

From the main entrance there are multiple options for walks, all well laid out and marked. There is a small cafe / machines providing cans / drinks.

From the northern entrance (for the HSBC Tree Top walk) there are no facilities.

So, take your own water / snacks as you feel appropriate. The longest walk of 11km around the whole of the park takes a couple of hours, and apart from a water fountain towards the Tree Top walk there are no other places to refresh yourself.

Word of warning; there are monkeys. And they can be aggressive. If you take food, then be aware that they have no fear and will come up to you and steal it."
,,A natural gem in Singapore,5.0,,"Extensive trails though the woods and informative sign boards make this a good option if you have a few hours to spare and get bored with shopping, shopping, shopping. Take water, insect repellent and sun protection with you as there are no facilities here. The tree-top walkway is spectacular and you are likely to come across monkeys during you walk along the trail."
,,Go for a Walk,4.0,,After shopping and admiring the architecture it is restful walking on this trail. Just nearby. Nice to go: Top-Tree-Trail
,,Brilliant!!,5.0,,Love walking so loved this reserve. Try to finish the trial by mid day as it gets very hot. I'm a seasoned walker but it takes longer than you think because of the heat so I got caught out. Take lots of water and top at the rangers station before the tree top walk.
,,Green,4.0,,"I love the clean, green and peaceful ambience of the Mac Ritchie reservoir. It is also a wonderful place to go for a walk or run."
,,A beautiful getaway,5.0,,"This place is beautiful. It's amazing to find such natural beauty and peace fullness. There are lots of interesting plants to see if you take your time I saw lots of pitcher plants once. It's a popular place for runners, photographers and walkers. I love coming here. You must be prepared when visiting here bring plenty of water don't carry food with you because of the monkeys (there is a snack bar where you buy food and drinks) don't forget sun block and insect repellent."
,,bring a large bottle of water and a sunhat.,4.0,,"a nice easy walk around the reservoir up to the treetop walkway and back worked out about 12.2km. saw plenty of monitors and squirrels plus dragonflies and butterflies. Also the horrible macaques which are fund throughout asia and are the rats of the forest. You might not enjoy the walkway if you suffer from vertigo though.
I noticed that there were a few groups of Singapore police/medics with canteens of water so presume they were there in case of emergency.
Nice peaceful walk."
,,14 km hike between Bkt Timah Reserve & McR Reserve in 3 hrs !,3.0,,"Here is the scoop for hard core hikers/trampers/bushwalkers from wherever.

If you have not done this, this is the best long hike through dense forest.

Start from BT Reserve HO, go on a trail to the back-side, hit gravel road and then 2 kms past the satelite station and you hit the other jungle path to MacRitchie. Along the way, cross some small streams, thick secondary jungles, get to climb up the tree top bridge walk down a boardwalk and 100steps, then continue to Mc R reservior, past a golf course and then to edge of Reservior, see pristine lake and walk around the edge and at the end of the trail you would have done 12-14km and be dead tired - what a work out"
,,Away from the maddening crowd,4.0,,"Look forward to mature greenery, lots of birds, happy squirrels playing around, inquisitive monkeys, the occasional monitor lizard and very rarely, the odd snake. Wear good shoes, bring water and do not venture into the forest too late in the afternoon as you have to give yourself time to get out. It gets dark very quickly in the foliage. One complete circuit of the reservoir is 11 kilometres and will take under three hours walking at a comfortable pace. If you want to do the tree-top walk as well, you need to get to it before 4 pm. Enjoy!"
,,Nice place to escape the city,5.0,,Liked: The beauty of nature and the silence ^^ Disliked: Almost 13kms if you go for the complete trail...you better have good shoes....and lots of water
,,Nice outdoor trail,3.0,,"For Singapore it is a really nice outdoor trail with some bridges that have to crossed. Its really good for trail running and some outdoor sports. However, it can get really hot and there is no possibility to buy water once your out in the green, so remember to take water with you."
,,A great weekend getaway,5.0,,I came to this park by accident and never realise that it's so wonderful with its lush greenery and the combination of the trail and the dam is just perfect for the weekend.....
,,I could not believe I am in Singapore,5.0,,"A 20 minutes taxi ride from the bustling centre of Singapore, you are in a nature park around a 'lake' with fantastic views of the plantations, occasional colourful birds, the tranquility is just amazing."
,,Walk over the bridge and boardwalk,5.0,,"Did the 5k walk from Venus Drive up to the Treetop bridge. Nice walk. Saw 2 tortoises, a small colour-changing snake (walked a bit close before I saw it - 50 cms long but pretty thin), some large ants, a few birds, Monkeys and Squirrels

Nice walk but a fair bit of up and down on the boardwalk. Took us about 2.5 hrs. Great!

It rained (but it was warm). Not too much interest from mozzies, but we did have repellant on."
,,enjoyable day out,5.0,,Have been to the Park now on several occasions. Well worth the visit and the views. Good and refreshing change from the shopping centres. Children able to enjoy just running along in front with no worries.
,,"Very refreshing, fitness enthusiasts haven",4.0,,"I love the place. It is best to go there on a weekend morning to feel revived and to stretch those muscles. The scenery are lovely. If you want an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is the place to be.

We intended to do the tree-top adventure walk and we thought all we had to do was to cross the hanging bridge. However, we were in for some great surprise because when we went into the first entrance, we learned that from there, we have to walk for an hour (easy trail) to reach tree-top adventure walk and allot one more hour to tour around it and also more than hour to exit at the nearest exit! We were just clueless on where we are and how how to quickly leave the place. But it may be just our fault - we did not research well. So people, RESEARCH and make sure to be in proper walking/hiking attire and warm-up.

It was a real adventure!"
,,Great experience - full of delightful surprises,5.0,,"After the crowds of the city - walking the MacRitchie Tree Top walk was sheer pleasure. Well signposted. It's a long 11km walk but mostly under tree canopy so not as hot as I expected although there was a short open section along the golf course when hats were needed. There is a small shop at the beginning of the walk where you can buy drinks and there is a tap where you can fill up drinking bottles - crucial as there is no access to water or food along the hike. We did the full circuit and recommend 2 litres fluid per person. Along the walk there are lovely shelters where you can sit, picnic and enjoy the surrounds. The Tree Top Bridge was amazing - great opportunity to pause and look carefully at the variety of growth below. The last part of the walk along a boardwalk was in some ways the most exciting. A troupe of monkeys jumped onto the boardwalk ahead. There must have been 8-10 monkeys leaping around, swinging one-handed from branches, cuffing their siblings or sitting on the branches overhead. We watched for a while then slowly walked on when it looked like the monkeys were comfortable with us being there. Later we saw a komodo dragon climbing the banks along the boardwalk. So if you are up for possible more surprises - be prepared to walk the whole circuit. There are so many butterflies to see, take the time to listen to the sounds of the jungle and the leaves and flowers are amazing. We did the walk the day after heavy rain and it was fine underfoot but I wouldn't recommend if it rain was predicted that day as some sections of the path would be quite muddy."
,,My Favorite Place for Running in Singapore,5.0,,"If you like nature there is no better place in Singapore.
Monkeys, snakes, butterflies, insects, small mammals, you will find there all!
I normally go there for running the whole ring, including the suspended tree bridge, an experience to don't miss.
Also a nice place for a simple stroll or for nature photographers.
There are several entry points but the one in Lornie Road is the recommended ones."
,,Surprises every visit,5.0,,"This is a place in the heart of Singapore, where views and animal spotting is so refreshing. Take a walk, you may spot a python, black with bright yellow stripes. Take a hike from Bukit Timah, you will walk off the calories while having fun, without even realising it. Love it!!!"
,,Jungle in the City,4.0,,"Piece of the jungle in the middle of the city. The 11km trail is not easy, almost uphill all the way, but then I am not a jogger or runner. The track is nature - i.e. not cemented, tiled, its pure earth and dirt - great on the knees, but watch your step if it has rained recently, it will be slushy. Once you start in the trail, all you hear are birds calls and crunching on undergrowth under your feet. The boardwalk trail (wooden boards) borders the water and meanders through the park, with water on one side and thick jungle on the other, very peaceful, quite, and superbly maintained. Much easier if you don't don't an uphill experience. Excellent lockers to keep you stuff. Not too many large lockers, so don't take bulky bags. Shower stalls could do with an overhauling and maybe they can add a few more shower stalls."
,,Local food in the shade,4.0,,Cheap and filling. Great after the 10km walk. Nice fresh juice shakes.
,,Hilltop,4.0,,The experience going up to the Hilltop is priceless. Go there. :)
,,tree top walk,4.0,,inresting not really amazing for landscape but cool for trecking and run
,,once in my life...,4.0,,the longest path (11.5 km) is the one that reserves more attention even if it's a destructive and endless trip But definitely a thing to do .... once in your life ;)
,,A Hidden Treasure in Singapore,5.0,,"Indeed a hidden treasure in this modern city state. Well, at least for trail/nature enthusiasts like myself. The trails are of different grade - from beginner to intermediate. Distance and directional arrows are conspicuously displayed and there's also a ranger station inside. Getting up close with forest inhabitants while enjoying a good run is an awesome kind of experience at MR that will surely keep you coming back for more. :)"
,,Superb hiking trail,5.0,,"MacRitchie is the perfect way to see the way Singapore has preserved Nature among the concrete of the city. The reservoir is huge and the boardway around the lake is very well kept. The flora and fauna are fantastic and there are signs and posters explaining everything you can see and hear throughout the 14km hike. Even if the day is hot, the dense trees keep the hiking trail very cool and pleasant. However, there are steep slopes so do wear comfortable clothing and hiking shoes!"
,,The bridge is fixed and too safe to cross.,4.0,,I was imagining an Indiana Jones kind of feel after hiking 6-10 km. I should have made my expectations lesser. Fun? I tried swaying it but it just doesn't move that much.
,,Through the jungle canopy,4.0,,"Drive, bus or taxi here and do the long trail. allow about two hours for a round trip longer if you want to investigate a bit more. Its a popular place so an early morning visit is the best option. Keep on going to the bridge through the tree tops and take time here to view all of the nature but don't feed or touch the monkeys! Good idea to wear shoes for the walking, not thongs / flip flops, and please take along some water. Cafe at the start offers basic snacks and pop and theres ample parking here.
If its a short visit to Singapore (stop over) you'd be better off doing the walk in Hort Park (off Alexandra road), its more sterile but at the same time more informative."
,,Great trails!,4.0,,MacRitchie trail has some fantastic features. You would never know that you were in the middle of the city. Sky walks and challenging walkways and with a view of some of the local wildlife. Great way to spend an afternoon!
,,Great,5.0,,"You will like it if you love nature. But, not advisable to go if it rained recently because the floor can be pretty slippery."
,,a forest in the middle of everywhere! :-),5.0,,"A great way to spend a Sunday evening. Walked around a bit, sat on the benches to soak in the trees and the awesome reservoir.

Felt rejuvenated. Took my 11 month old daughter, she enjoyed the cool shade of the trees and the other children running around."
,,great trail running,4.0,,"The full loop is a 12km run, mostly through jungle, with some views of the reservoir and the neighbouring golf course. Monkeys, lizards and birds galore. Take water with you."
,,1st time visit to HSBC Tree To - loved it!,5.0,,"With few friends and children between 8 to 10yrs old, we gathered at carpark located at Venus Drive (near Sin Ming). From there, it was a trek of 2.9Km to the ranger station (toilets, water coolers available), another 400m to the Treetop bridge and trail. Estimated another 1Km back to the ranger station and back to Venus drive, slightly more than 7Km in all. Do go before 9am on weekends, as weather starts to get warm and more visitors (both locals and foreigners alike) start to appear. Wear light clothing, bringing a water bottle would be advised, trekking or cross trainer shoes preferred. Those who are prone to mosquito bites, recommend repellent as well.

Beautiful reserve and nice place to get away from the buzz of the city. Treetop walk closes by 5pm and path to bridge closes at 4.45pm. Many plaques to let you learn more about nature, great for kids.

,,A refreshing morning walk,4.0,,"went there about 7.30am in the morning on a weekday. decided to do the boardwalk. except for joggers on the path, the boardwalk has enough space for 2 persons to walk comfortably. most people we passed by said ""good morning"" which was very pleasant indeed. i was a little bothered by the monkeys which seem agressive. a leisurely walk right to the end near the golf course takes half an hour and another half hour back to the entrance. the reservoir has such calming effort and it is good to return to nature"
,,Oasis and peace away from the hustle and bustle,5.0,,"When you've just had enough of the hustle and bustle of a moisy and overcrowded city just make your way to MacRitchie Reservoir. Here you can just bask in the peace and quiet, listen to insects chirping and birds singing. Spot a monitor lizard hiding among the foliage and marvel at the horizontal tree supported across one of the trails. Marvel at the tiny monkes grooming each other. Nature at its best.

There are a number of trails you can walk ranging in length from a couple of kilometres. For the more adventurous you can run through the leafy forrestry training for your 10km. But mind your step with the leaf fall, which can be slippy in places, particularly where the sun doesn't penetrate the dense trees.

Take a picnic and just sit near the lake enjoying the peace of the day as you watch the world go by, with nothing more to do than enjoy the view and revel in the time away from the city. Superb for a Sunday chillout."
,,lovely sunday walk,4.0,,We loved the prepared boarded walks beside the macritchie reservoir returning to the start by trails through the forest. Unfortunately the cafe at the start was closed for refurbishment so we wished we had taken a picnic. We only did 5kms of trails. lots more to explore next time
,,Beautiful place for a run/walk,4.0,,"Lucky to have a friend in Singapore who took me for a fabulous early morning 12k run/walk here. Busy place on a Saturday but impressed by parking, toilet facilities and trails. Such a pristine spot - but I was glad not to see any monkeys."
,,Great exercise on a Sunday,4.0,,"Good way to spend an active weekend, instead of lying on the couch. Enjoy the good weather (hopefully), sights and sounds. Some nature in an urban jungle."
,,Nice for easy hiking,4.0,,"I like to go to MacRitchie for an easy hike, mostly on weekends after lunch. Trails are very easy. What I like is that always I get to see many monkeys :) A nice place to visit :)"
,,Good Hiking Place,4.0,,"MacRitchie Nature Trail is one of the hiking place I like as it is so natural, except the path that need to by pass the golf field as I quite hate that when it comes with 40 degree sunshine.

Best for evening walk. i like the fauna and flora, not many but green always make me feel fresh and great."
,,Worth a trip or 2,5.0,,I like this but as part of the whole as all you really see are trees :)
,,Outdoor's with some relief from the heat!,4.0,,Singapore's NP's have done a great job in establishing a series of board walks along the foreshore as well as walking and running trails. For much of the trails a thick tree canopy from the native jungle provides some relief from the heat and humidity. A great place of outdoor exercise with a difference. Just be sure to ignore the monkeys.
,,Nice place to track,4.0,,Feel like in Singapore yet not in Singapore. I totally loved the experience of tracking there in the morning or simply watching the morning goes by.
,,Do the treetop walk,4.0,,Its a bit painful to reach but its exhilarating to the treetop walk. Try it if you are a nature lover like me
,,Great place for a run,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore for the weekend with nothing much to do you can also just come here for a run. It's about eleven kilometers round the reservoir and well signed; you get to run along dirt trails through the jungle and not a car to be seen. Yes, it's hot but this is Singapore! There is a building with lockers and showers at the start (bring a dollar coin) so you can get a taxi and wash off the worst before you head back to the hotel."
,,"Take a break from Orchard Road Shops and see the ""Real Singapore""",4.0,,"For those who tire of walking through all those shopping Malls there are alternatives provided by the National Parks Service.

Catch a bus or taxi to the Upper Thompson Road entrance and choose one of the trails. On this visit we chose the boardwalk around part of the reservoir which is mostly level and easy walking. We managed to see one of the monkeys that come down to the waters edge. We enjoyed our picnic lunch and bought the welcomed chilled drinks out of the machine. Even on a short walk in Singapore take plenty of water. Also watch the cloulds in the afternoon as thunderstorms build up. We just made it back to the bus shelter befor the heavens opened. For those with more time there is a longer trail including the tree top walk which I have done on a previous visit. Again remember to allow for the extra humidity."
,,"A pristine, if not sweaty, walk in a primary forest in urban Singapore",5.0,,"Put on a pair of sturdy walking shoes for this walk. The terrain is easy on the legs with a few slight inclines here and there. Good to start walking from the Venus Road entrance. You will get to see the flora and fauna along the way. Birds such as Hill myna, Racket-tailed drongo, woodpeckers, emerald dove, dollar bird. harmless tree snakes, the occasional monkey.

What's helpful are the signs to lead you to the tree top walk, and before you reach it, there's a rest stop/forest ranger station with a cold water cooler and clean toilets.

The tree-top walk is simply great. It is a sturdy cable bridge that hovers above the forest canopy. It's green any direction that you look. It's an ideal place if you love trees that have been untouched by human presence for hundreds of years. The views are breath-taking and you would find this a surrealistic experience knowing how urbanised Singapore is.

The trail at the end of the bridge leads you back to Venus Road or if you have the legs left, to the main entrance of the picturesque McRitche Reservoir.

It's dirt track for most of the way except for the descent from the bridge where you will walk on a broadwalk for some distance. Well constructed, the broadwalk allows you survey the forest floor and appreciate the flora there.

It's the humidity that is somewhat bothersome, but there are a few sheds with benches should you need to take a rest or simply just sit there and enjoy the sounds of the jungle. Take along a water bottle if you must. No wild dogs here."
,,Relax by a Reservoir,5.0,,"The MacRitchie Reservoir is a wonderful place to ""escape to the country"". The Reservoir is one of the best preserved natural nature parks on the island. Take or do the ""Nature Trail"", but be prepared with proper running or tracking shoes, water bottle (it is humid and sweaty experience) and nature trail attire. If you do not know the area where, ask for guidance ( hire a guide, or get a map of the area).
A great way to enjoy nature at its natural best, if you love to be close to nature. Hint: an early morning outing is recommended, best before sun hits high noon."
,,a great hike with an interesting air walk,4.0,,this is about as natural as it gets in singapore. bring lots of water and bug spray and wear covered walking shoes as it may be very muddy if it has ben raining. there are monkeys there but dont feed them as they are quite naughty. i went canoeing there too which was fun
,,MacRitchie Trail and Treetop Walk,5.0,,"Wild Monkeys on the trail, walk across the treetop bridge was OK, walk through the rain forest was excellent."
,,great for hiking in the middle of a city,4.0,,"Nature trails well kept; great getaway from the city for a day of exercise hiking- make sure to bring water if you go on the longer hikes. The park also has smaller strolls for the less aggressive. Treetops worth seeing once, but not anything to go out of your way to see."
,,Extremely beautiful and peaceful,5.0,,"I visited MacRitchie Park in March, took a taxi to Venus drive, although you can easily take a bus (a lot of line stop nearby Venus drive as well) and hiked the treetop walk. It was absolutely amazing. This nature reserve was kept clean with a walkable path (bring hiking shoes and mosquito repellent), while preserving its wildlife. Be sure to arrive early, if you would like to reach the treetop bridge (it's quite a hike_2,5-3 hours roundtrip). If you're lucky, you'll see monkeys and other animals along the trail, walking right beside you! You might even see a few iguanas."
,,There is still a part of Singapore which is still a Jungle,5.0,,"Its a great place to visit and to walk and discover nature in its natural state. This is Singapore's protected nature reserve, hence you still can find a primary jungle in Singapore."
,,Excellent Hike and Great Wildlife!,5.0,,"I took the subway to the new stop that close by the main reservoir end. A quick walk to the the water and then you soon find yourself in the jungle foilage. I have hiked this with my wife at a slower pace and this time I was in more of a work out mode. Either way take the time to notice the wildlife that surrounds you, from monkeys that you can get quite close to (some are friendly than others :O) to huge forest ants, lizards, birds and more. They have done a very nice job of signage along the way for both foilage and animals. You have multiple choices in directions, distances and attractions. I hiked the entire route this time which included the tree top walk along an elevated suspension bridge as well as a multi-level tower. Again the sings were very abundent telling you everything that you need to know. I would not recommend walking the trail by the golf course side as it in my opinion isn't as nice and it can be a long walk back to the starting point if you wish to take the train back to the city."
,,Nature at its very best,5.0,,Relax by the water or jog/walk the trails at your convenience. A great cafe with piping hot food provides creature comforts when you need it the most.
,,A break from the Singapore buzz,4.0,,"Clearly marked trails with several distances to choose from, popular with local hikers and joggers or anyone wanting to get out of city buzz for a half a day. The tree-top walk was great (beware: not open on Mondays), elsewhere trees and overgrowth blocked out bit of the scenery. There's an option to have a shower and eat at the visitor center. Connected to Singapore city center with buses . Closest MRT stop is bit a ways off."
,,Jogger's paradise,5.0,,"Every decent jogger in Singapore runs regularly the 10.8km trail around the reservoir. A tough one, though (try to do it in less than one hour!)"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Take some water, get on some strong boots and be prepared for a 13km hike. Sensational"
,,A long trek,4.0,,"We read about the suspension bridge here, in another trip advisor, but I wish i'd looked into it more. I was wearing a skirt adn t-shirt and strappy, but flat, sandals. I didn't realise the trek is 5 km through jungle with all the rocky, slippery and muddiness normally associated with this type of place. Then of course when hyou've seen and walked across the suspension bridge, you've to do it all again to come back! Anyway, we did it, it was gorgeous weather and I got a new pair of shoes out of it, so not all bad. Plus i was chuffed to have got so much, well needed exercise! You see monkeys along the way, they're not shy, and you can get things dropped on your head, so beware. Many people do this trek, all, except me, dressed in shorts and trainers, with water bottles, unlike us again. Its a lovely place, with frequent sightseeing stops or seats to rest."
