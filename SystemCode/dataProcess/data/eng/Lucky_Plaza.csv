,,"Nice atmosphere, good facilities",5.0,,"A lovely location to satisfy the needs of the large contingent of workers from the Philippines. While the majority of the eateries and shops cater for the migrant worker population, there is a good mix of Indian, Malaysian, Indonesian and Chinese eateries. Prices for the meals are generally a lot better value than those in the other shopping centres on Orchard Road. There is a reasonable mix of clothing, accessories and shoe shops here. Those seeking designer labels with the associated prices should visit the adjoining shopping centres instead."
,,Cheapest shopping in Orchard Road,4.0,,"6 floors of shops, all good prices. We found the best prices and quality at the front roadside. Lots of Phillipinas shop here, the weekend is a bit too crowded."
,,Never Gets Old,4.0,,"On a flight layover my husband, my daughter and myself went to see Lucky Plaza again to see if it had changed much in the 32 years since I had seen it last. It did not disappoint with the massive range of cheap souvenir, watches, electronics and other knick knack shops. The food court was very cheap and delicious local food. Great to see that sometimes things never change and there are cheaper options for families looking for a t-shirt or some trinkets to take home and remember Singapore."
,,Cheap chocolates and personal items,3.0,,"Lucky Plaza caters to the lower income bracket, compared to the other malls along Orchard Road. There are lots of stores that sell very cheap chocolate bars and personal items (soap, shampoo, deodorant, etc). There's a small corner restaurant called Lucky Chicken Rice that serves excellent chicken rice."
,,cheap items,2.0,,"Lucky plaza is for budget conscious shoppers. But if you're looking for branded legit items, then avoid this place. I've always heard horror stories on ""SG Perfumes"". So I bought one to test it myself (Versace Eros) – very nice packaging, serial number seems legit (recently manufactured when searched online), smells exactly the same, and very cheap! It’s costs like 1/3 of mall prices!

But how would you know it’s fake – sillage. It does not last long. My verdict is, it’s a repacked authentic perfume. Most likely a mixture of 80% perfume and 20% water.

They also have value dollar store though where you can find cheap chocolates."
,,For budget conscious shoppers in Singapore,4.0,,This shopping center in Singapore caters to the lower class bracket in Singapore standards. It is also a welcoming place for asians especially Filipinos and budget conscious tourists and shoppers.
,,Not Your Typical Orchard Mall,4.0,,"This is less like a mall and more like a service and goods building dominated by Philippinos. Many Money Exchangers, Travel agents and massage parlours almost all the shops are Philippines products. We went here to go to Jollibee which on the 6th floor. You can find many cheap products here but be aware of scammers."
,,Philippines of Singapore,5.0,,"You can find toiletries, canned food, sauces, cuisine etc., of the philippines right here. Busiest on Sundays as most Filipino workers in singapore are off this day of the week, remitting and sending cargo back or just hanging with friends.

Go up to the 6th floor for some 2nd hand clothes shopping. Real cheap. Jolibee is right there too.

3rd and 4th level have wonderful filipino cafes with aunthentic cuisine and desserts."
,,Nice service Apartment on 18th Floor,4.0,,"Stayed here on the 18th floor in a service apartment by Regina Hospitalities booked on Air B&B. The two Bedroom apartment was very good and centrally airconditioned with a Kitchenette, two Bathrooms and a washing mashine as well with Microwave and sufficient crockery and cutlery. It also had a two door large fridge. The apartment is so well located that you could not ask for a better place to stay 3 nights on business right in the middle of Orchard Road. The Lucky Plaza building it self is full of all types of shopping with the best bargains and prices. There is a bus stop right in front including a taxi stand. The MRT rail is just a five minutes walk away."
,,"Understand what this place is, please!",5.0,,"There is a large contingent of Filipinos that get visas to travel to Singapore, mainly to work as domestic helpers. There is such a large population of them, that a marketplace was created in order to fulfill their needs.

I'm American, but Filipino by descent. I was visiting SIN, and my friends that live there, who happen to have Filipino DHs, told us about LP, and that it was very Filipino. Wanting to understand better, my Mom and I visited.

99% of the people that are shopping there are on a work visa from the Philippines. 100% of the businesses cater to this clientele. You will have money remittance centers, beauty salons, clothing and souvenir stores, and restaurants.

Yes, it's on Orchard Road, and no, it's not upscale. It's not supposed to be. It's a functional offering for a valuable part of the Singaporean population. Take a break from the superlatives of Singapore, and visit to understand how some other people live."
,,Average,2.0,,"This building looks like its about to collapse with how old and rundown it is but its still cool to checkout the shops and visit, its usually packed too"
,,Watch out for scammers,3.0,,"This is a low end mall as compared to the rest of the malls on Orchard Road. You can find lots of electronic products on bargain here, but there are also many scammers here too. Do compare the prices at different shops before purchasing anything."
,,Old Shopping mall,3.0,,"Lucky plaza has many shops of tailors, money changers, electronic goods, readymade garments, souvenirs, massage centers, haircut etc. There are many small restaurants and eating places. Be careful about price and quality of goods while shopping."
,,"Do not trust CAMS Access Trading, 304 Orchard Road, Lucky Plaza, #01-37A",1.0,,"Stay clear of the electronics shops here, especially CAMS Access Trading. Wish I had researched this shop before I purchased. The guy came across as trustworthily but sold me a camera accessory at almost double the price. Don't shop here for any electronic goods."
,,Good place for cheap goods and services. Good food mall,4.0,,"Likes: plenty of cheap souvenir items and clothes. Services like haircuts, massages are very affordable. Good food court with plenty of variety (and Jollibee) Be careful though, a lot of electronics are cheap and unreliable."
,,Flea Party!,4.0,,"Did twice flea market one in Dec 18 on Sat and one on Sunday, Jan 19. Very expensive on Sunday $171 with parking $21.45 compare to Saturday $90 with parking $14 plus. Good place to clear your treasures but advisable not to sell more than $10 as your buyers basically are female domestic workers. Saturday is better since they came alone and are more committed to spend and rushing home before their employer come back and Sunday is basically their day off. They came to roam around with their boyfriends and if their boyfriends said not nice, they won’t buyand not planning to carry anything or buy a lot of stuff.
Your neighbours beside your booth can be annoying if they starts selling their items $1 each from 2 pm onwards(happy hour - so ridiculous ) eventhough flea market starts from 1-7 pm cause you can’t even cover your rental and parking charges and aggressively steal your customers away buy selling fake items to them while you are selling authentic stuff and your items will get mixed up with theirs .You can sell anything like microwave, tv and their own suitcases since they are not planning to bring it back, all must go!! Our neighbour sold (their luggage with their clothes that they suppose to sell but unsuccessful) to one of them without telling the code number and left. Poor lady came back with the suitcase and can’t even open again, such an irresponsibly seller!! The fan main switch was off by one of the sellers for no reason that we have to scream to them to switch it back on since it was hot like hell and luckily no one fainted! The place is very crowded and the tables were so near that you can’t even go out unless by going under the table. Great place to sell female stuff but not male stuff. Be prepared to stand on your feet continuously from 12-7 pm since you don’t have place and time to sit. Be observant they might walk away without paying and they will bargain as low as 3 for $1 just like other booth owners selling their items from 4 pm onwards, so ridiculous way of selling things at the flea market and yet they can’t even clear away their stuff!! Depending on the stuff that you are planning to sell. If you don’t have much things to sell it’s not worth to do it. If you are looking for a good bargain, a great place to spend if you don’t mind going to a crowded and hot room. If you are looking for skimpy clothes, fake stuff, shoes, ear rings , bags, shoes, belts, why not drop by to experience it yourself!!"
,,Low-end,2.0,,This has become one of the low end black sheep along orchard road. Amusing that it’s between tangs and paragon
,,"Quick, fast shopping solo",4.0,,"I had few hours for my flight & time yo kill. Orchard road decked up for Christmas holidays was a treat got the eye.

The Lucky plaza is a mall that doesn't hurt the pocket.
Trendy shoes, outfits, gold jewellery, bags etc. All at reasonable bargains. This place is crowded.
Had lots of fun going all over the place looking at quaint shops. Lots to do.
Wear comfortable foot wear. Place for non branded stuff. Not sure if perfumes were genuine. Watches were definitely not.
Good for knick knacks, souvenirs."
,,A great place to grab a bargin,4.0,,"Went to lucky plaza on orchard road about 6 stories tall of little shops to grab a bargin. People everywhere went on sunday and that is the busiest day to go. Very interestiing things they sell , It like a market with little stalls. I enjoyed the experience"
,,Window Shopping,4.0,,"Go Visit the basement of Lucky Plaza. There is a food court and Mcdonald Fast Food Restaurant. You will be surprised to find many shops selling souvenirs, shoes and clothes. Very reasonable and cheap. A surprise because it is in Orchard Road where most things are more pricey. Took some pics of this area for those who keen on shopping for souvenirs to be brought home. Try not to go on a Sunday. Can be very crowded. Usually by phillipinos domestic helps in their offday."
,,I layk ettt,5.0,,It`s very excellent! I'm very speechless about everything. I really commend this place. I bet you would like it too. So hesitate no moreeeeee
,,"""Lucky experience""",4.0,,"Definitely the Pinoy hub here in Singapore. It’s always vibrant, always loud, always...Pinoy. With undeniably Filipino establishments like Baleno, Western Union, PNB, Jollibee, and ukay-ukays, LP makes you feel at home while away from home."
,,"Do not trust EZ Advance Trading Enterprise, Lucky Plz Blok B81-70",1.0,,Wish I had researched this shop before I purchased. Silly me. The guy came across as trustworthily but sold me a phone at almost double the price. When I went back in 1 hour later requesting a refund his polite and trustworthy manner had definitely changed! Don't shop here. They cannot be trusted!
,,Best FOREX Rates!,4.0,,"If you're looking for the best forex rates in town, Luck Plaza is the way to go! We always change our money here to get the best value. Don't visit on Sundays, it gets way crowded and going around can be hassle."
,,Local Souvenir in shopping heaven,4.0,,"Convenient place to looking for souvenir from Singapore beside Bugis and China Town . From T-Shirt, keychange, bag, pouches. Located in Orchard Road which main shopping aeea in Singapore. Orchard MRT is the nearest."
,,Not so lucky,1.0,,Terrible run down plaza. I remember it being the best one (granted that was 20yrs ago). Dirty pubs at one end with call girls out front inviting men in....yuk
,,Relatively Inexpensive Items,3.0,,"Great for souvenir shopping, cheap clothes, or electronics. Also great place to change to Singapore dollar and get the best possible rates. Big difference between next door luxury Paragon, but still interesting to walk around. Food court has wide variety of dishes and reasonably priced. Check it out if you're in the area."
,,The Filipino Hub,3.0,,"They say on Sundays Filipino OFWs flock to this building to spend the day with their kababayans. Even on an ordinary day, there are Filipinos who frequent this building along Orchard Road. So it is not surprising that many stalls here carry Filipino products and many restaurants offer Filipino food. There is a Jollibee on the 6th floor."
,,Fantastic hardware store on the 3rd Floor,3.0,,"I don't find any of the stores very interesting in this mall, though if you are the classic souvenir shopper that is seeking cheap t-shirts, tchotchke or chocolates to give to family/friends back home, this mall is for you. If you are a local, the real winner in this mall is the hardware store on the third floor. The hardware store is owned by a family that knows their business! We can always find what we need here. I really love the hardware shop and am always so grateful for the knowledge and helpfulness of the store owners. Additionally, the restaurants on the way up to the hardware store via the escalator, smell divine. I have yet to stop in to any of them sadly, but do plan to visit. My teen and pre-teen do not love this mall. There is nothing at Lucky for them"
,,More Pinoy than Pinot,3.0,,"Like many malls developed by the Far East Group (eg. Far East Plaza on Scotts or Far East Shopping Centre on Orchard near Isetan), Lucky Plaza is among the oldest, least visually attractive, and most downmarket shopping malls in its neighbourhood. The mall is more functional than aspirational. No luxury shops here (except for some reason there are lots of jewellery stores), or premium eateries. But, unlike other malls on Orchard Road, you can find cheaper goods (eg. fake branded deodorants and fragrances, footwear, luggage, souvenir gifts), or unusual stores (eg. CPAP machines for sleep apnea, a tailor specialising on alterations for Shanghai Tang across the street). Lots of Filipina domestic helpers meet here on Sundays, so you’ll find stores doing remittances to the Phil, or Pinoy eateries."
,,An unique shopping plaza for the wrong reason,3.0,,You may like it or ignore it. This is how Lucky Plaza being remembered among local shoppers in Singapore. The most famous signature of the plaza has to be a gathering point by domestic helper so it's extremely crowded on Sunday. The plaza has been renovated many times but it cannot get rid of the old fashion character of the 60s or 70s because of the building structure and rigid layout. You may walk pass it many times during your visit to Orchard Road but never need to go in once. It's the type of shopping plaza catered for certain people.
,,Good shopping and environment,5.0,,"Not sure where to go when it is hot and want to shop and not sweat it? Well, Lucky Plaza is the place to be -- especially if you have children. Okay, time to get to the cool and prepare to shop."
,,Teen nightmare,4.0,,"If you are looking for a place for your children to go for a day or three, then Lucky Plaza in Orchard road is it.
My daughter is in her early teens and was attracted like a magnet to all of the shops selling cheap bags, clothes, electronics, watches and other small trinkets.
The one small problem was getting her out of the store! She didn't want to leave even as exhaustion set in for both parents. The next day when asked ""What should we do today?"" You can guess the rest! Lol
Be warned though, there are some shops prepared to sell things at ridiculously high prices! Check online any prices you think maybe high and then barter hard.
Also Sunday is a very busy day, it was packed with Asian ladies looking for bargains."
,,T2 Electronics,4.0,,"If you are after electronic gear, T2 (bottom floor) is a great place to haggle for a bargain. If the owner, Sam, is there get into a good old haggling contest with him. Great guy. I bought some gear and although it was not actually in stock, it was delivered within hours to my hotel, nicely gift-wrapped."
,,Little Philippines in Singapore,5.0,,"This place is where most Filipinos gather. There are several Filipino shops and of course every Filipino‘s favorite, Jollibee. Here is also a place where you can get almost everything cheaper like Amusement Park Tickets etc."

,,For The Souvenir Hunter,5.0,,"I loved this shopping plaza. Lots and lots of souvenir shops. I could have spent all day there! Located right behind the Singapore Marriot Tang Plaza Hotel! Loved going to all the stores with clothing, shoes and souvenirs. Big sales on at the moment."
,,One of shopping center in Orchard Road.,4.0,,"CYC+CG ( 18.07.15 )
There was many shopping center in Orchard Road. The lucky Plaza was one of shopping center. But there was not splendid. The Lucky plaza was folksy and lower grade than another place, I think. I like this shopping center rather than high class one. I walk around inside, that's good."
,,For shopaholic!,5.0,,This place has a lot of bargain. You can spend all day around here and not get hungry. If you want to eat then go to the basement food court. If you like high end brand go across the street to ion shopping center.
,,Bargains bargains all over,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore, this is always in our a must visit list for gift buying for family and friends prior going back home. Feels like home when we are in the place! This is a highly recommended place in Singapore for bargain items!"
,,You can literally shop til you drop here,5.0,,"I went here with a friend who always visits this place. I don't really know how many floors there are here because I only managed three. The range of goods was amazing, from a bottle of Fanta to a handmade to measure suit. I purchased sandals, kimonos, tablecloths, jewellery etc. Lucky Plaza is very central and everyone knows where it is, so is easy to access. One of the best shopping places I have ever been to."
,,lucky indeed,4.0,,"if you want to bring home souvenir items at a bargain price, come to this place. the gift shops particularly sell a lot of chocolates, shirts, novelties, bags and what-have-you’s that would unknowingly entice you to buy more. it’s kinda crowded on a thursday so i could just imagine how it would appear on a weekend.

you’re lucky if you’re able to acquire all the things you need in just one go."
,,Little Barrio,3.0,,"Visited this popular area during weekend, known to be haven of Filipino community in SG. Its multi level shopping area mostly occupied by Philippine base brands, Indian and Chinese shops. Renovated since last visit, it was a lot orderly and cleaner than before. The fast food area looks like little barrio (village) at home. Food great and the hospitality lot better than you expect from other local restaurants. Be aware of some Indian and Chinese store when you bargain. Watch out for hidden cost, or you will be surprise on final price."
,,Fun shopping,3.0,,We enjoyed to look around lucky plaza and I bought sandals .It was a great bargain to buy shoes and bags .Watsons chemist has excellent different of varieties and it was special price to buy little things

,,"Outing at Lucky Plaza ""Little Manila""",5.0,,"Had a wonderful outing at ""Little Manila"" with lots people shopping and relaxing around. There are souvenirs, chocolates, clothing and food outlets to enjoy. While there, we also checkout the weekend flea market with plenty of bargains and good buys. The food outlets were packed with patrons and we have to seek lunch elsewhere. Great for family outing."
,,Old but worth a look at...,4.0,,"Many people have complained about being ripped off and not getting genuine ware. This can not be said for all shops. Go have a look and know what you are buying, just do some research first. Can highly recommend Garphil Enterprise on #03-91 for cell phones. Lewis was extremely friendly and helpful. Got a new Honor 10 and was very happy with his service which went above and beyond. Will buy there again!"
,,lucky plaza revisited after 25 years one of the oldest shopping centres on the road still has great bargains,4.0,,"Cant afford Gucci or the like? Then stop in at Lucky plaza . we first went there 25 years ago and this was the place to shop for cameras every floor had camera shops but gone are those days there is still a few camera shops in the centre.The shops are varied from supermarkets to Asian clothing stores and plenty of places to buy cheap souvenirs. The food court in the basement is great as its mostly locals who eat there, there is 20 or so small kitchens selling every type of Asian food - Korean Thai Chinese you name it they have it and at reasonable prices. we had a fried chicken with noodles which was really good. Only a few places sell cold beer but if you look you will find.
So if you want bargains come to Lucky Plaza"
,,Probably the oldest mall in Orchard Road,3.0,,"This is in memory, easily the oldest mall along Orchard Road. Thankfully they recently renovated the place so it is much cleaner and brighter now. However, the shops are still mainly geared towards the Filipino community. You do can find cheap souvenirs or merchandise in some of the shops here."
,,just nice,3.0,,if you are craving Filipino food and want to buy Filipino stuff...this is the place to go...but stay away if you plan to buy electronics...
,,$2.00 Shops on steriods,4.0,,If you want to buy trinkets cheap perfumes get clothes made Singaporeat good reasonable prices. Time to browse buy and take home reasonable trinkets for the family and fruends. Lucky plaza not to be missed.

,,Great Prices,4.0,,"We shopped at Lucky Plaza and purchased Binoculars, Ladies shoes, Men’s shoes, the prices and variety were terrific they were happy to drop the price on all the things we bought. The quality was tops, we definitely recommend it."
,,"Situated on Orchard street, but not worth",2.0,,"Experience here was poor. No variety, and it was costly compared to both Chinatown and Mustafa. There are so many individual shops inside, but we didn't find it interesting.
Also, if you are buying anything, make sure you bargain. They quote whopping high prices, try bringing them down to 1//3rd of it."
,,"EXPENSIVE, OLD",3.0,,"I hired 1 room in the plat of Lucky plaza. It was convinient because on the ground they had many kind of food and sale alot of cloths, cakes. sugar.....and change the money is very easy.
The biulding is old but the lift is good, very fast."

You have mainly small shops selling clothing, electronics, shoes, cosmetics and toileteries, perfues etc to name a few. Ten dollar shops offers great women clothing at a proce of S$ 10 for all items.

At the basement level you have a Oriental styled cuisine food court. Here you can have Cantonese, Thai, Japanese, Indonesian, Korean styled food al under one roof. Seperate I Indonesian restaurant toy can fond on Level 3. I love shopping and eating at this mall. You must visit to believe the range of product at jaw dropping prices the shops offer here."
,,wow!....cheap and good eats at Orchard Road,4.0,,"so... you're from outta town, eh? and are doing the Orchard Road trail, becoz its been described to parallel Rodeo Drive..the Champs-Elysees...the Omote-Sando..all famous shopping belts in other global cities. accordingly, rents are higher in such places, & the shopping for upscale brands makes the Orchard Road area upmarket. After meandering around, you're feeling peckish & wanna grab something local, and correctly priced. Afterall, there are lotsa F+B outlets in the various malls, but priced mid-range & upwards.

Fret not. Head for Lucky Plaza. Go the the basement, south side of the mall. There you'll find Lucky Food Center, a stark contrast to the other eat place -- Asian Food Mall, which is but a stone's throw away. Contrast? yes...the pricing point is at least 30-50% lower; it oozes of old-world charm (unlike the clinically sterile food courts), the stall-holders are pretty much the owners, who cook your meals with the care & attention of any mom-n-pop F+B outlet; ie its that homey-taste you're getting. its all local delights, ranging from nasi lemak ($4.20 starting set), economy rice sets (from $2.80 upwards), noodles/soups of the various styles (the fish stall is always having a line), vegetarian meals (from $3 onwards). Fresh cut fruit & the various juices to give you that balanced meal your doctor is always talking about.... wanna top it off with a beverage? the lone stall, run by a bevy of matronly looking but very polite ladies, offers offer the whole gamut; including beer its a hot day & your heart so desires. the crowd is typically local and as a foreigner/tourist, this place offers you an opportunity to sit alongside them, hearing their everyday chatter, stories, complains about life, joys expressed.. its just amazing to be able to find cheap, but good eats at Orchard Road"
,,Lots of choices,4.0,,"I came here for lunch on a weekday as there are many local food shops here. The shops are catering mostly to local office people, so the prices and portion of food are very reasonable.

After lunch, I went around looking for bargain as you can find souvenirs, snacks, electrical appliance and all kinds of knickknacks here.

This is one of the few malls on Orchard Road, where it is not high end and does not have any branded signature boutiques."
,,Food for ALL!,4.0,,"We just spent a week in Singapore and Lucky Plaza Food Court was our favorite place for a snack or full meals! All kinds of food, from Chinese to Indian to Filipino. Prices are good and the variety is incredible. The time between 1200 and 1300 and again 1700-1800 is VERY busy with the local workers coming for the atmosphere and food.
Sunday afternoon is the Filipina Nannies day off and they all gather at the food court to eat and talk~ quite a sight!! Duck, pork or chicken with rice, veggies and soup for S$5....."
,,good but crowded,4.0,,"a good place to pick up a bargain if in orchard road, was very busy when we visited on a weekend, not sure that i would make a special trip to visit however."
,,BEWARE! of overcharging from shops selling electronics,2.0,,"Being local, i would never purchase from them. EZ Advance Trading enterprise just made the news today, charging SGD$144 for a smartphone screen protector."
,,Lucky plaza,4.0,,Lucky plaza loads of restaurants to eat and cheap place for souvenirs and clothes very busy place loads of shops and mall surrounding this area loads of buses and MRT stations beware of ladies hanging on street corners
,,No Control at all,2.0,,"Simple simple...tourists just stay extremely clear unless you wanna your wallet to get a big extreme hole burnt! wanna to eat good meals just ask price b4 you order! Same goes to all retail shops...ask ..always ask...there are plenty con-shops around to get your head drop! As for us LOCAL..we avoid as much as we can unless friends gathering are held there~
Hopefully the management will do something or maybe we can say nothing as they only cares about their freaking monthly rentals to sustain their shareholders and managements wallets.
So guys from any part of this Earth coming over here ... do practice extra cautious !"
,,NOT SINGAPORE,1.0,,"Stay clear of the electronics shops here, especially Ez Advance Trading Enterprise Pte Ltd. Friend got cheated, paid extra for product she bought."
,,Nice Place,5.0,,"OMG always love this place ... easy to do bank, easy to found many variant yummy indonesia food ... one of the best place must visit when come to SG."
,,Strategic location in Orchard but too crowded for me,3.0,,"My friends asked me to accompanied them stayed in Lucky Plaza Apt.
Well, we enter the building from the back lobby and needed to fill guest forms to enter the building.
The apt were quite spacious, 4 bedroomd, one big living room and a kitchen and small laundry room. Not clean, dust everywhere bit at least they change a clean bedsheet when we checked in.
With the quite cheap price per room per nite, it was a good bargain to stay in the heart of Orchard Road.
But on weekend when I got out the lift and enter the plaza, oh my God there were a huge crowd. It was Asian workers gather together on their holiday of work.
So busy, so noise, so lively!!
But staying there was very convenience to get some foods, to shop souvenirs and fashions, and Ion Mall the luxury brand shops just accross the road."
,,Some good F&B Options,4.0,,"I mainly visit Lucky Plaza for food, though I imagine it may be quite good for shopping too, for products native to Indonesia and the Philippines, as domestic workers from these countries gather here on weekends. The building is conveniently located on Orchard Road, close to the Orchard MRT Station and many buses ply along Orchard Road. There are also a number of 4 to 5 star hotels located close by. Definitely worth a visit for the local colour, if you are a tourist."
,,Great for a cheap eat,3.0,,"This place looks a bit dodgy from outside and the shops arn't really great but the small food court is very good.
There is a fair variety of food all of it very well priced.
There is a beverage bar which also sells Tiger beer for a really reasonable price."
,,"""Heritage"" shopping centre",2.0,,"This was one of the first multi level plaza type shopping centres on Orchard Rd, and despite changes over the years retains some of the old ambience (although lacking the hassling by souvenir vendors, electronics salesmen and tailors from past years). It is now the home to a lot of Filipino grocery and food outlets, with still a few money changers and jewelry shops. It is worth a visit just due to its age and durability, but not worth too much time considering the high end shopping nearby. Some of the food is excellent, not to be found elsewhere."
,,MIxed feelings,4.0,,"Firstly, there are a number of money changers in here, and within a short walk around, you can find some VERY good exchange rates. It's generally my go-to place after arriving just for that.

Beyond that, it's what you think of when considering shopping at Orchard Rd. Loads of little shops vying for your business."
,,Singapore souvenir shops and Asian food court,4.0,,"This plaza has its unique attractions by offering singapore theme souvenirs and an interesting Asian food court. Affordable souvenirs, SG print shirts and so on."
,,Dirty.,2.0,,"Dirty, very grounded. Many guest are occupying tables for free WiFi use only. Tables not cleared from previous users. Noisy and generally dirty."
,,"Cheap souvenirs, clean and air conditioned",3.0,,"Came here for some last minute souvenirs to take home. This is a multilevel complex with lots of Filipino stores, electronics, snacks, T-shirt’s etc. I got what I came for and didn’t spend any additional time looking as I am all shopped out! Got lots of chocolates to take home."
,,Nice Alternative-Cheapest beer in the city,4.0,,"This was a nice alternative to the super high priced malls along Orchard Road. A lot of the products were likely knock off but regardless, it was fun, huge and interesting. Strangely enough, the food court had beer for 3.80 a can which was the cheapest beer I found anywhere during my travels to Singapore and it was right along some of the most expansive shops and restaurants in the city. That was refreshing."
,,A contrast to the fancy malls on Orchard Road.,4.0,,"Lucky Plaza is the older of the centres on Orchard Road, however, the contrast is quite interesting. There are numerous little shops throughout the plaza on a number of floors. They sell souvenirs and bargains galore as well as lots of jewellery shops. Pop in and have a look, it’s different to the fancy, high end malls."
,,Not sure about the lucky part,2.0,,"1 of the oldest malls in orchard road, and not really revamped over the years. Sad mix of shops, and filled with filipina domestic workers on sundays. Should be torn down"
,,Visit if u want some cheap,4.0,,This place is good for a cheap shopping plan. Lot of small shops. Value for the money. The building must renovation.
,,Souvenirs and bargains,3.0,,"This is a shopping center with lots of shops selling souvenirs and bargains for tourists. There are lots of money changer here too. On the weekends, this is a popular gathering place for Filipinos. There is even a Jollibee fast food outlet here."
,,Shopping on a Sunday is Very Crowded,3.0,,Beware that Sunday is extremely crowded here. Wall to wall people. I thought the best finds here were shoes. Clothes were in very smalll stalls and just piled up in stacks so you had to dig through and just too many to do that. Souvenir shopping was okay. Some good places to grab a quick local bite. If you don’t make it here I don’t think you missed much.
,,Good for shopping for jewellery ...,4.0,,"Was impressed with the range of shops in this Mall, but particularly pleased to find a good number of jewellers, as I was seeking a particular style of ring at a sensible price. Managed to find exactly the ring I was looking for at the right price, having failed to find one at other outlets in Singapore.

As others have said, this is a good Mall for souvenirs and money changers, but there are plenty of interesting stores to browse too."
,,A lot of Money Changers and souvenir items,3.0,,"This is an old mall but has a lot of souvenir items and money changers. Beware of the money changers, some of them change old money that is not acceptable in certain countries already."
,,Great shopping plaza,5.0,,"Can buy almost anything here, amazing phone shops, great prices for iPhone protector screens etc. Nice and clean and affordable."
,,Center market of Orchard,4.0,,Good place for buy souvenir and have asian food. Too crowded on weekend. Cheaper electronic things than other store even than Sim lim.
,,Excellent for Bargains & Good Food,4.0,,Lucky Plaza has something for everyone... Great bargaining... perfect for souvenirs and one of the best Asian Food Halls in Singapore... Fresh.. clean ... and affordable...
,,The best place for hunting souvenirs,4.0,,"the price is really cheap than the other place i think, have many variations of souvenir. you can get additional discount if you bargain with the seller."
,,One of the most unique shopping mall in Singapore,5.0,,"Cheap and good local food are sold around the shopping malls.

On the 6th floor there's jolibee, one of the famous restaurant around, beside it there's the flea party.
The flea party sells really affordable electronics and fashionable clothing. Ranging from just $2-$5.
Heard many overseas wholesaler bought their stocks there.

Just to note : lucky plaza shops usually close really early. 11-7 is a good time to come."
,,Cheap clothing on 6th floor,5.0,,really cheap and fashionable clothing (starting from $2) on the 6th floor of lucky plaza (just beside Jolibee) They are only opened from 11-7pm
,,Dress as an iPhone to get interest,2.0,,"We got the heads up of this plaza as a bargain mall on the high end Orchard Rd and thought that we would check it out. What we found was a tired old centre. Each shop that we passed had workers who were glued to their phones who showed vague interest when you ventured into their shop. The place had the vibe of an old pet, which in its prime would have been great fun, but as it gets older the case for putting it out of its misery grows stronger. Steer clear. If you're visiting Orchard Rd there are much better shops to look at, even if you cannot afford the merchandise!"
,,all-under-1-roof,4.0,,"shopping mall mainly visited by the resident domestic workers over the weekend. but also famous for its shopping bargains in souvenirs, jewelry, ... good for buying sim cards, money changing also got a few dining and ktv outlets bustling worth a visit"
,,Nice little established shopping centre,4.0,,This is the place to get cheap souvenirs and gifts and have a great meal at reasonable prices. It has a great food court on the basement. It popular with bargain hunters. It has not changed one bit since l came here more than 20 years ago.
,,Fab food,5.0,,"You can eat cheap in Singapore. Just visit Lucky Plaza on Orchard Rd. Downstairs is the food hall. Bak Chor Mee is a 5th generation family business. Fantastic Bak Chor Mee which has three delicate pork dumplings served in a clear broth of garlic with noodles. Absolutely delicious and cheap, no wonder the locals eat here."
,,Great for bargain hunters!,4.0,,"3 for $10, 4 for $10, 5 for $10! This place has everything you need for gift shopping or if you are looking for bargains. There is a food hall downstairs and even a McDonald's. Upstairs has about 6 floors (I lost count) all packed with goodies from watches to T-shirts, camera equipment and electronic gadgets. 5 cotton T-shirts for S$10 and they are nice quality!!! Well worth a look after wandering around the luxury shops where things are eye staggeringly expensive. If you cannot find a good watch in the 3 for $10 section then there is a Rolex store just up the road. Enjoy."
,,small little gem,4.0,,"its a ordinary size mall in singapore terms, not many big store but i always liked it, it has all what u need,not fancy but gets the job done and price is slightly lower in comparison."
,,Never changes,4.0,,This is my first return to Singapore for 16 years and Lucky plaza is just as it was then and back in the 70s. It seems a little brighter but there is still the same eclectic mix of stores which reminded me of times gone by rather than the corporate style malls popping up everywhere. Certainly worth a wander around if you are looking for a bargain.
,,Steer clear of this one!,2.0,,"We ventured into Lucky Plaza during our most recent visit to Singapore. The hope was that we would be able to find a particular electronic gadget which we had long been seeking. Quickly we realised that we had made a mistake. The place was a maze of narrow passageways along which were located a ""mish-mash"" of junky shops selling cheap and poor quality goods.
Some of the store-keepers appeared bored and disinterested whilst others applied high pressure sales techniques trying, to sell us goods which we had no interest in buying.
After a short time, we actually began to feel uncomfortable in there and decided that we should leave.
Lucky Plaza is home to ""bargain-basement"" outlets which cater mainly for the locals. There is not much here that is likely to be of interest to the average tourist."
,,Packed,3.0,,The place is too pack with foreign workers and with lots of remittance stall.. things are not that cheap and products are normally from the philippines and indonesia.. somehow there are lots of other malls which are just along the same road..
,,Lucky Plaza T2 Electronic Pte Ltd Rip Off,1.0,,"T2 Electronics Pte Ltd

304 Orchard Rd #B1-159 Lucky Plaza Singapore 238863

Do not buy anything from T2 Electonics, they rip you off.
What I bought from there store I could have gotten from another store a few
Doors down for a lot cheaper. Look around and ask for prices before you buy."
,,Best place to buy Cheap Chocolates,4.0,,"There are plenty of shops selling cheap Chocolates, perfumes and clothes.Also, a large food court is on the offer."
,,I feel ALIVE ON SUNDAY!!!,4.0,,"TIL Lucky Plaza is the world's first fully air-conditioned multi-story shopping mall. Indeed, it is actually the precursor to what we now consider a modern shopping mall - built up instead of out.

But don't go for that tidbit. Just drop it on your friend while you are there soaking up the Pinoy party on the weekend. Or while you are getting your hair done for $15, ladies. Or after the brand names of Orchard have left you soulless, choke on some halo halo and pep up with an authentic Filo meal. Or live large at Jollibee.

Soak it all up - this is the modern life of globalisation: migrant workers lining up for an hour on their day off to wire money back to their families; rubbish food but comfort food; currency exchanges still in business and competition; hairdressers; bodegas; mom and pop stores; migration agents; shipping companies; employment agencies; pervy construction workers, long neck picnics in the corridor; dodgy karaoke.

Sunday is clearly the day to go if you want the full experience in removing the veil on the invisible people of Singapore. Week days if you want a more mellow experience and a chance to see a hairdresser."
,,McDonald's at basement,3.0,,"For some people, this place is a good place to find electronic. But for us, this place is a good place to find McDonald's. You can find McDonald's at basement and in the taxi stand along Lucky Plaza walkway.
When you want to have a quick bite along Orchard road, you can visit this place"
,,Philippine's paradise,3.0,,"We were looking for a specific store in Lucky Plaza and were told to follow all the people from the Philippines who enjoyed their sunday off to do some shopping.

The Plaza was full of life, which was interesting to see and the main attraction (the shops were not that soecial)."
,,Philippino Mall Cheap Perfume,4.0,,"A bit of a find really.
Sometimes you just dont want to be in expensive brandname malls.
Quite a find really
Money changers western union pizza hut luggage shops.
Many travel agents.
Quality Perfumes at better than Duty Free prices.
Barbers confectionary ships
Many phillipinos in singapore meet there coffee shops Restaurants etc
Certainly worth a visit."
,,Always crowded on the weekends,2.0,,The popular gathering spot for Pinoys in Singapore. The lifts in the building are really slow and it can take awhile before you can get into one. Take the escalator instead.
,,A maze of shops.,3.0,,"Lucky Plaza contains seemingly hundreds of small shops of every variety, with every owner trying to hustle you like crazy. Many bargains to be had, but do your homework, as a seeming gift horse can be a bit of a fast con."
,,What a disappointment,2.0,,Not worth a visit! A couple of floors of sweets and chocolate 3 for $10 a few poor quality clothes shops.Do not partake its a waste of time!
,,Currently home of the Fidget Spinner (Hand Spinner)! Good present kids idea?,4.0,,"Spent hours here browsing the range of cheap (and not so cheap) Fidget Spinners (or Hand Spinners) for our kids at the seemingly endless shops. They'd make popular presents for family members if you're here for presents. In fact, whatever is popular is likely to be here... Last time I was in Singapore it was power banks for your mobile, next time it'll be the next ""electronic"" nerd craze. Fun place and feels like the Asian shopping I remember. Don't forget to bargain!

Whilst most stores on the bottom two floors sold them, we found the best range (and cheapest) were up on the 6th floor at a store called ""Flea Party"" (store #06-48B) - away from most of the higher traffic areas."
,,A Filipino feel right in the middle of the city!,3.0,,"The posh shopping district of Singapore -- the Orchard Road area -- houses one of the budget places in the city, where you can not only buy low-priced items ranging from electronic products to souvenir items, but also feel at home while being away from the Philippines.Yes, it is for a good reason that many call this place ""Little Manila."" The moment I stepped into Lucky Plaza I immediately felt at home (as I encountered hundreds of Filipinos haggling with vendors, or selling products themselves, or going to PNB, or simply enjoying Jollibee and what other Pinoy fast-food chains have to offer. There are also travel agencies, jewelry stores, electronic gadget stores, perfume shops, retail shops ... name it, they have it!

To reach the place you can take bus lines 1N, 2N, 3N, 4N, 5N, 6N, 7, 14, 14E, 16, 65, 106, 111, 123, 175 and 5. Of course you can also take a taxi, as you please. The place is open from 10:00 AM daily until late evening. Be sure you know how to bargain when you shop there. Also avoid going to Lucky Plaza on week-ends, especially on Sundays, when most of the OFWs flock to the place for one reason or another.

The over-all experience was exhilarating! Certainly it's not for high-end shopping as one might expect when he or she goes to Orchard Road. But it's one of the best places to go to in Singapore if you want to save on money on souvenirs you might want to take back home. TIP: roam around the place first and compare prices before you decide to buy things."
,,Tourists trap,3.0,,"The only reason I visit Lucky Plaza is for its food. The food court downstairs offers pretty decent variety and they're quite delicious. For shopping, I don't recommend this place at all, many shopkeepers are rude and the prices are higher than average. Most of the shops sell souvenirs for tourists so it's a good idea to bargain."
,,Good place for shopping,4.0,,The plaza is just along and steps off the popular Orchard road. All floors inside the plaza are accessible by both escalators and manual stairs. i discovered that prices of items here are relatively lower compared to many other shopping centres in the city.
,,Good for cheap imported Chinese stuff,4.0,,Many many stalls that carry cheaply priced Chinese stuff. Some things are good and do not forget to bargain.
,,quick visit,4.0,,short visit lots of shops cheap goods not a high end mall.... worth still having a look for bargains
,,Becoming mainstream,3.0,,"Like so many places Singapore, Lucky Plaza is losing its quirkiness to mainstream shops. The chaos of yesteryear seems to have drained from Lucky Plaza, and this piece of prime real estate is becoming just another mall.

It is still interesting for a quick look, especially for phones and watches. There is a sterile food court at ground level too."
,,typical mall,3.0,,alot of random small shops! money exchange and some restaurant which is quite cheap. didnt really do much there but there is a nice restaurant that sells ice kachang which is quite tasty.
,,Halal food in Lucky Plaza,3.0,,There are a few Halal (Indonesian) restaurants in Lucky Plaza. You can head to this mall to find Halal food if you're in Orchard Road.
,,lots of cheap stuff,3.0,,"there is the usual clothes and shoe stalls and then gadgets etc. all at cheap price if your looking for something tha tyou forgot at home , you'll probably find it here."
,,bargain shops; great money exchange,3.0,,"Located on Orchard Road - between Tang Plaza to its west and Paragon to its east - this shopping mall is for bargain tourist souvenirs mostly. However, the mall also contains a few money changers who offer very good rates and convenience. Visit a few and shop the rates for the currency you are changing. For USD to SGD, the shop at #B1-09 offered great exchange rates, with no commission."
,,Has lost the gloss of previous years,3.0,,"Lucky plaza no longer is the shopping mecca of old, there are still a couple electronic, phone or camera stores, but you can get cheaper online. Dont go on a Sunday unless you like crowds as the place is fi;; of Philippino maids. You can still get cheap shirts and touristy items but always check the quality."
,,Bargain shopping,5.0,,"Lucky Plaza is located on Orchard road and is suitable for bargain tourist souvenirs and some extra shopping to spoil oneself.
Fashionable sunglasses and perfumes reasonably priced compared to others .
Jewellery for traditional wear to suit many likes.
Food Court on lower floor caters for Halaal called Ayam Penyet Ria for local cuisine.
Give yourself some time as there are many floors with some repetition.
Wear comfortable shoes as shopping takes strain."
,,Lots of bargains,4.0,,"There are a couple of great shops here with fabulous bargains and I have shopped in Lucky Plaza a couple of times, finding the best shops to purchase gifts to bring home. Great for great deals !"
,,Good shopping mall.,5.0,,"Cheap and some great bargains if you take time to look, top floor gift shop is amazing....i have no problem buying here. I got many things here and if you just take time and look there is plenty to buy. Never felt it was dodgy at any time......."
,,Better than average plaza on Orchard Road,4.0,,"Lucky Plaza just doesnt disappoint, even after 30+ years. Hemmed in on all sides by megabrands, being able to go into shops and pick up and look at goods without having a heart attack at the prices or get pounced upon by a prowling sales assistant, have a wander around the stores, get your glasses fixed cheaply, have a coffee, look at cutting edge electronics and other goods at reasonable prices, it has it all, for me anyway."
,,not nice place,1.0,,"on Sunday, a lot of crowd specially from pinay. Not a nice place to visit. honestly it is horrible. I had visited many other part in Singapore, only this place i have a bad comments. expect this all other places are excellent."
,,"Good for Shopping, especially Singapore's merchandises",4.0,,"It has good location in Orchard and lots of places to buy Singapore's merchandise with cheap prices. It also has lots of camera & phone stores, but I'm not recommend you to buy it here. Just google it why."
,,Had to go twice it was so good,5.0,,If you want cheap shopping go to the Lucky Plaza . Great shopping heaps of shops but not enough time
,,Sunday Adventure,3.0,,"Sunday is a day off for all the hard working domestic helpers here in Singapore. This is their chance to socialize and be carefree each week and a favorite place to meet up on Sunday is Lucky Plaza. (Also Botanic Gardens). It's lively, crazy and busy- especially on this day of the week. That in itself is something to experience! Inside will find items that are inexpensive and quirky. As this tradition has established itself the food & shops cater to this particular audience. I've heard of one restaurant that completely changes it's menu for Sunday only! Clothing sizes are very small by my Euro/ American standards and likely won't fit. If you do want to shop for gifts, etc. expect to buy XL even if you are used to buying medium (6-10) in US women's back home."
,,Very busy and very repetitive,3.0,,"Visited there on a Sunday and it was so crowded. A lot of junk but if you have the patience to fight the bustling crowd you could find a bargain or two because some things are cheap.
Found that a lot of people just 'hang out' in there. Everybody is looking at phones which makes the congestion worse. Personally I wouldn't go back!"
,,Run down but still popular,3.0,,"This shopping centre is now rather run down but is still popular partly because of its good location in Orchard Road. There are now several shops catering to Filipinos , including the basement food court. There are also branches of Watsons, 7/11, casual clothing , several hairdressers, remittances stores etc."
,,Scammers beware !,1.0,,"I have visited this place many times with my family... back then i have nothing to complain, but my experience in the recent visit in the 2017 really makes me want to avoid this place as my shopping destination... The food court in the basement is now dominated with pinoy cuisine, really different since my last time visit 6 years ago... After enjoying my meal i went to a minimart that sells singtel card, the shop itself seems really dodgy its located just near the foodcourt exit to the mcD on the leftside... i bought 2 10$ singtel cards for me and my dad, after the seller seemingly borrow my passport to registrate my card, he give me the cards, then i install it one on my phone just to make sure it work... After i see the singtel signal, and some provider sms i pay him 20$ and go back to the hotel since it closing time about 9:00 pm... I just realized i've been fooled when i check the balance it was 0… not only that the card itself is already expired months ago, its different from the package label that the due date was on 2018, even worst the other card that i've not tested was defective ! I know i've been cheated after i read all the review about this place, so i quoted the other experienced traveller here... If you happens to go Lucky Plaza avoid all things: electronics, dodgy money exchange other than that you can buy shirts, souvenir (my recommendation Chinatown), travel tickets, sweets, is all good here."
,,Another shopping mall.,3.0,,"This is getting like Began's Temples, shopping malls everywhere. Did not really like this one, nothing of any interest in it. Seemed and bit cheaper and tacky, if you ask me. But if you like shopping, be in, im sure you will find something......."
,,Worth a look but probably not to shop,3.0,,"Located on Orchard Road, the multi-storey complex is air-conditioned with escalators to each level but the shops looked a little ""iffy"" .. personally, I wouldn't use my credit card here - it's just a feeling I got.

There were beauty, souvenir, electronic and jewellery shops as well as some clothing stores selling cheap & low quality items. We were amused at one of the shops signs which said they sold genuine products. There was also an eatery on the lower level.

Overall though it was clean and cool."
,,Better for people watching than shopping as all a bit seedy.,3.0,,"Lucky Plaza is a low end shopping Mall that has a lot of shady looking shops selling low quality (possibly copy) products. I went on a Sunday and so the place was packed with the local housemaid and nanny community... I had a quick look but didn't stay long. If you want to shop properly there are plenty of far better Mall's around Singapore... Like Suntec City and Marina Square next door to the hotel I was staying in at Marina Bay, and the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands."
,,Watch out for scammers,1.0,,"A lot of shops looks sketchy and one of them, selling electronic stuff scammed us by selling us a fake product. Definitely not a tourist friendly place."
,,Best of the malls we visited,4.0,,"It's more back to basic so you get to see stuff you don't have at home. Jewelry was very keenly priced and open to negotiation - I bought a nice pearl and diamond piece. There were loads of bag shops, chocolate shops, etc but just fun to wander. Food court more authentic we had some nice duck and rice."
,,Like S'pore years back,4.0,,"Lucky Plaza is a shopping mall\centre on Orchard Road. It has approximately 500 shops\stalls, and is like S'pore shopping 20 years ago. Don't be afraid to bargain, it's part of the game here. Perfume is one of the things to buy here, the prices are usually good, as in Chinatown, if not, bargain harder. Be more careful about electronic, you will usually get better products im SimLim."
,,Do Not Go to Cyber Jip,2.0,,"I had the misfortune of needing an urgent repair to my iPhone and landed up at Cyber Jip. I should have asked for a quote as they claimed it was repaired with a hefty bill of $500 which I paid as I just needed the phone working. Within four days, surprise, the phone is worse and on return to Australia I had it properly repaired for $90 and they showed me the dodgy work done by Cyber Jip. Put simply, theft and taking advantage of someone they knew was not possible to bring it back and complain. Lesson learned!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Altough its in Orchard road this is not a mall you would expect here. This mall is full of little shops which sells mostly electronica, computers, souvenirs, not branded clothes,..there are massage saloons, hairdressers,..and also some good restaurants if you love cheap but real asian food. This is also the place where the Fillipina maids will gather in evening or weekend. Also the places where the Fillipina ladies of pleasure are in evenings. Fun to go there and see the hassling and negotations between seller and buyer. You can find good cheap things here."
,,Good for Shopping Cheap items,5.0,,"Bought my pasalubong here. Tshirts, bags, keychain, chocolate. All of them are quite inexpensive compared to the rest of Singapore. A lot of Filipinos in the place. I love it!!!"
,,Not the usual Orchard Road...,2.0,,"Orchard Road is mostly expensive designer shops and huge malls full of equally expensive shops. Lucky Plaza is neither of these! It is a somewhat downbeat mall full of shops selling tourist tat (key rings t shirts, etc), cheap shoes and clothes, and a multitude of hairdressers. If you want to visit (!) don't attempt it at the weekend as it is a gathering place for home helpers and consequently packed."
,,SHOPPING ALL YOU CAN!,5.0,,"A very busy place to shop but it is a great deal :) keychain, ref magnet, bags, tshirt, etc. All souvenir is available here."
,,Very busy,3.0,,"People everywhere, train station underneath shopping centre which is overcrowded - not the best place to go for a quiet shop but has all the essential shops"
,,A little less upmarket but great bargains,4.0,,"Lucky plaza is a great place for shopping and has one of the best food courts in Singapore. Some of the food stalls have been under the same hands for 25 plus years. Fish ball soup here is fantastic - I always try to visit.
The shopping is not so glamorous as some. Alls a kind of cross between Bugis market and Far East plaza"
,,ALL the shopping you need!,5.0,,"A visit to Singapore will not be complete without a stop at one of the many shopping malls scattered trouughout the island. We prefer the Lucky Plaza, just along Orchard from the Scott Road intersection. 5 levels of every kind of shopping imaginable~ jewelry, watches, scuba, clothing, shoes, etc, with the very best food court to be found on the ground floor. Foods range from Filipino to Indonesian to Indian to traditional Chinese to McDonald's!"
,,If you're in the area pop in,3.0,,"It's an ok mall, was hopping for abit more from it though personally. Thought it would be a lot like the NBK centre in Bangkok but they aren't anything alike.

A few half decent shops but nothing fantastic. Certainly no main steam luxury stores in here."
,,Old plaza in Orchard road,3.0,,It's perhaps more than 30-40 years of time this plaza has been one of the famous plaza to Asians & still exist in modern surroundings. Shops for souvenirs & low end products. The Foodcourt is good and tasty serving many Asian choices.
,,Maybe not on Sunday,4.0,,"We stopped at Lucky Plaza on our Singapore holiday. WOW what an eye opener, it was Sunday and there was people everywhere, just hanging out, queueing at banks and postal agencies and some shopping.

We started at the ground floor and worked our way up, the bargains became more plentiful as you go higher but so does the crowds. We picked up some excellent bargains for my daughter as she is quite small. No bigger sizing found anywhere.

The crowds were on every floor which concerned us as we didn't want to loose the kids... Benefit in having one Blonde and one 6' tall, just look for the blonde hair in the crowd or the head jutting well over everyone.

Some of the shops, particularly jewellery were not open as we found out, apparently they do not get much trade on Sundays.

Picked up some interesting phone bits and pieces. Entertaining stop over between things"
,,Low end place,2.0,,The things prefer to low people. Not really clean place. But you can find a lot of food and beverages here
,,Cheap stores,3.0,,"This the the only mall within the area that sells low end cheap ware items. Food are like hawkers on all floors save for the usual standard restaurants here and there. If you are shopping on a budget, this is the the place to go in Orchard. Whereas, all others in the area are mid to high end shopping. Be ready to wait a while when dining out as the crowd comes in and tends to have that unusually long queue in any given restaurant especially over the weekends."
,,Busy during the weekends,3.0,,This is also one of the older malls along Orchard Road. There are a number of cheap eateries located inside the mall. This place gets very busy once the weekends approach and it will be flooded with many foreign workers who's having their off days. i wonder why but it seems that this mall is popular with the foreign domestic helpers here in Singapore. But it's a good place for them to have a great and chill day out!
,,Simple shopping center in Orchard,3.0,,This is a shopping mall catering to the local Filipino community. The shops are selling products from Manila and offering services to the Filipino. There are also many shops selling souvenirs and other low priced items. It reminded me that I am in Manila.
,,"A gigantic range, but it is attractive?",4.0,,"While most of the shopping centres on Orchard road sell high-end products to wealthy customers, Lucky Plaza is the only mall catering to budget shoppers. Casual clothing, simple accessories, sunglasses, low-end watches, sweet and chocolate, souvenirs, used books and medicated oil products are always on sale."
,,Go here!,5.0,,This was a fun six story shopping plaza full of good people watching and fun shops. I went here to visit a doctor friend of mine who had his office on the top floor. I didn't know that the shopping would be so much fun. There are all kinds of gift shops and food shops and this is a typical downtown Singapore shopping plaza which will not disappoint. I started my trip to Singapore here and I certainly went back for the fun of it all.
,,This centre is crazy,3.0,,"I have never been in a supermarket that seems to run for over a Km, I have no idea how they rotate stock or stocktake. Doing your grocery shopping there would take hours or days. Shops mainly smaller Chinese shops with some good bargains"
,,Beware!!,3.0,,"How to walk to Lucky Plaza from Orchard Mrt - Follow direction to Ngee Ann City(D), walk for about 4 mins, Lucky Plaza is on your left. There are many money changers in Lucky Plaza and many of them do not have display board. Beware of Maas Exchange - #B1-57. I was short changed. However they refund back my money as I showed them the misleading receipt that they did not fulfill their term of bargain. Told me RM310 - SGD100. I gave him RM350 gave me SGD105. Do not go to this money changer!!
I went to another money changer that has a proper display board and gave a proper official receipt - Everest Money Changer.

At Level 6 - I went to My Favorite Cafe yong tau fu. Chrunchy meat ball and juicy mushrooms. Nice but long queue and have to share table with others."
,,this is the best mall in singapore,5.0,,"iv been in this mall few times and i love this place . good shopping not expensive. very good . affordably restaurant , sandy very craoudy d'ont even think going"
,,grate shopping even jewlery do not go on sunday,5.0,,grate mall for everything cheap we went there to buy souvenirs from Singapore And someone recommended us where to buy ring at the moriya jewelry and diamonds boutique with excellent prices. You should go visit Moriah Diamond boutique located on the second floor outside. so happy with my new ring. on Sunday dont go You can't even walk because it's so crowded.
,,Good shopping place,4.0,,"This is good shopping attraction and provides maximum souvenirs, perfumes and other items to buy. Good place for tourists"
,,Shopping,3.0,,"I went here on the 2nd of March 2013 actually, I stayed at Lucky Plaza Apartment too and I stayed with friends. I've got few things for gifts too here."
,,Crowded and cheap,2.0,,"Do not go on a Sunday! You can't even walk because it's so crowded. The merchandise is mostly cheap chinese goods, nothing that stands out or that will last..."
,,Worth a look,3.0,,Having a Jolibee in the plaza was the main drawing card for me (if you haven't tried it before you haven't lived). A lot of Filipino stores mixed in with all the usual mall assortments. I would say the mall has probably seen better days.
,,Seedy jount,2.0,,Packed full of dodgy stores trying to get you to come into their shop. Dubious about authenticity of some of the goods on sale here. Basically a cheap bucket basement tourist trap with the odd interesting shop. Buyer beware is my advise for anything techno!
,,Cheap store on Orchard,3.0,,"Many stores in this mall. Most of them are small and so different than what you can find in other Orchard mall. It has cellphone store, camera, cheap souvenirs, perfumes, and many other things. I only bought souvenirs from this mall, not electronics or anything expensive. If you visit Orchard, you may visit this mall just to eat. Find the asian food court on the lower level. They offer good asian food, from Indonesian food to Chinese food. Not a big foodcourt but it is a pretty good place to eat."
,,Budget Buys,3.0,,"You can buy cheap goods on this place, and there are a lot of choices around, if you opt for the more expensive brands you can just cross the street to the expensive shopping centers :)"
,,My Souvenir's Shop,5.0,,"If you're looking for value for money and a fantastic variety of Souvenir's this is the shop and my favorite by far. This pot of gold is located in lucky plaza 304 Orchard Road and as you enter the shop you feel welcomed straight away and the friendliest staff make you feel like you want to come back. I noticed that other shops similar in this complex are more pushy and insincere but My Souvenir's Shop lets you browse in peace and they dont shove their souvenirs in your face. The one thing that i did admire the most was how good they were with my 1 year old son when he started to get a bit grumpy in his pram not only did they talk to him but gave him a gift which helped amuse him with their generosity also was very unexpected when my daughter, mum and myself also was given a gift. I loved this shop so much it was my most visited place which I highly recommend to anyone looking for Souvenir's in a hassle free environment."
,,Shop & Eat,3.0,,Lucky has been renovated so it has a fresh new look. I usually go for food @ Jollybee one of the few in Singapore to enjoy Philippine food. You find shopping as well as a good place to exchange money.
,,Great souvenir shopping,3.0,,This place is great for souvenir shopping. They have alot of money exchange places with good rates and well. One place i would recommend Tomi Foot Reflexology. Definitely worth the money.
,,Sunday - Mob Day!,3.0,,"We've sort of expected Lucky Plaza to be crowded - being the place to be known as a popular destination for cheap souvenir hunting - but wow this place surely is a crowded place most especially on a Sunday. Filipinos all over Singapore meet here for Sunday and I'll assure you, you can never find a place near Jollibee :)"
,,Come here for Jollibee and Tapa King,4.0,,"Located in a prime location smack in the middle of Orchard Rd, sitting alongside the highest of ends in retail establishments is the humble Lucky Plaza. Popular with (and appears now to be geared towards) the Filipino community, it houses shops offering a variety of services and meechandise. There are travel desks, brokerage firms, money transfers/exchange and even beauty salons. The most popular shops, though are two local fast food chains: Jollibee and Tapa King. Even Pinoys working for multinational corporations flock here to get a taste of their favorites from back home: chicken joy, palabok, tapa queen, among others. The place goea happy crazy on Sundays when most are on their day off. Hundreds, if not thousands enter the doors of Lucky Plaza to either send money back home, run errands, have their hair styled and eat a Pinoy merienda or two."
,,Look at the reviews before going here,2.0,,Iv been here many times over the years and its getting worse. If your a first time visitor to singapore take a look. Many years ago it was the place to shop for electronic goods a d great prices. Today its cheaper at home now. If your exchanging your currency its very good. I always get a good deal and i haggle for the best price. If your changing $100 dont bother haggling but if your got $1000 to change get a extra cent. Thats $10.
,,Used to be good,3.0,,"Well, loads of bigger, better and more modern shopping malls built in the past decades so Lucky Plaza is overshadowed. It used to be a very popular place. There are apartments around, some are cheap enough, perfect for budget travellers"
,,Very crowded on Sunday,2.0,,"It's average mall but so very crowded on Sunday, if you wanna visit better on weekdays. It's a lot Philippine goods sales on the shop there. And some Singapore Souvenir shop. Just the toilet are pretty dirty and have to pay."
,,Shopping!,4.0,,"This plaza is near the top end of Orchard Road near Ion ,Paragon etc
It has a good mix of shops selling electronics and souvenirs at reasonable prices
Inside it has many different levels and lots of shops ,truly a shoppers paradise lots of hustle n bustle
We just walked around a few of the outside shops due to time
Well worth a visit"
,,Poor shopping mall.,2.0,,"Lucky Plaza is a average mall, the only good thing about it is it's cheap to buy things there. You even have to pay 20 cents to use the toilet! and the toilet is very dirty. Best to say away if possible."
,,Good for chap shopping!,3.0,,"Cheap stuff. Good deals. Full of shopping for souvenirs - one stop shop to buy all gifts for back home in a very competitive price.

If you want the good stuff and quality assurance then this is not the place for you. While it does cater to a big crowd I found it rather a waste of time. However, I really enjoyed eating the local food at its food court."
,,A melting pot of humanity,2.0,,"Built in 1981, today, Lucky Plaza is described as home to one of the largest ethnic enclaves of Filipinos living and working in Singapore. Just why it’s called ‘Lucky’ bewilders me.

I have passed through it many times, eaten in it and shopped occasionally. It has a mixture of fashion, souvenir and textile shops, together with money changers. Upper floor have many domestic helper agencies and some medical clinics. It has undergone renovation in recent years which has made the place a lot brighter. On the weekends and especially so on Sundays it is vastly over crowded with the Filipinos who have many ethnic shops and services here. Compounding the problem on Sundays are Indian and Bangladeshi workers who swarm around the building in a quest to find a Filipina they can take away, and enjoy the company of. It is like a melting pot of humanity – stay away at the weekend."
,,Good place to buy well known singapore stuff,4.0,,"Lucky plaza is one of the few places I visit again and again whenever I am in Singapore. If you miss the souvenirs or snacks at a tourist place, this is the place to stock up your chocs, T shirts, snacks, key chains, etc
There are digital mobile, cameras and electronics stores if you need such things. The jewelry stores here are also well known. This is an old shopping store so you will find older Singapore shops here"
,,Good shopping but Fantastic Hawker food,4.0,,"The food at the Hawker food Court was fantastic. The variety, quality and price was unbelievable. for $3 to $4 SG you cold get a bowl of Asian soup with 6 ingredients. All stalls looked clean. We had lunch there nearly every day of our stay."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,Must go place in Singapore you will get tired of shopping and will get go again Good equality mid tier mall with lots and lots of options to shop and eat
,,Souvenir time,3.0,,"I think this is the right location for you who are looking for souvenirs. Its always packed especially in the weekend. For Indonesian who missed indonesian foods, try the Ayam Goreng and Sambal in the foodcourt. Yummy!"
,,So crowded!,4.0,,"You can see lots of stuffs here but not recommended to buy from here. Sunday is worst day going to this place, so many people and too noisy. Though there are lots of remittance centres to choose from."
,,Gathering Place for Filipinos,3.0,,For years this mall has become the gathering place for Filipinos working in Singapore. Many of the shops have been changed to cater to this group. You can even find a Jollibee hete，Flea markets for weekend a popular haunt for many. Of course they have other shops too. Specialty shops for electronics n souvenirs. Check and compare your prices before you confirm your purchases. Crowded on weekends.
,,Good place to shop teeny weeny stuff,4.0,,"As far as the bargains are concerned, I assure you that it happens here ! :)
However you need to be good at that. Not all products are worth spending time for. However at times, one might find good perfumes, handbags, chocolates and buy them at good deals. All in all, it is not a place to close the eyes and shop. If you like something, validate its genuineness and then spend time to bargain, in order to purchase it.
I found most of the products as not of my interest, except a couple of categories !"
,,Shopping time,5.0,,Never can stop shopping qhile you are here. Plenty of options for souvenir with affordable price. Must visit this place while you are in town
,,A must visit for bargain especially Perfumes,5.0,,Always go here when I go to Singapore. Worth a wander around for little bargains as the variety of shops is large from Perfumes through watches and toys plus of course many Tailors. My favourite is the Perfume Kiosk that is situated just inside the entrance that is just after Tangs Dept Store and the Kiosk is right opposite the McDonald's just inside the Plaza. Great prices and always genuine perfumes with a HUGE range.
,,Bargain Basement NOT Designer Brands,3.0,,"This shopping complexes has been given some bad reviews, mostly as a result of unrealistic expectations of visitors.

This is where you come for reasonably priced souvenirs, but you don't want to have to pay too much. An example is where you might want to buy a dozen souvenirs for co-workers, and you are looking for a token present only.

You might describe this place as 'tacky' and that would not be far off the mark. However, with a little searching and some haggling on price you may well come away with some bargain souvenirs to take home.

Why not give it a try? What have you got to lose?"
,,A good place for souvenirs,4.0,,"I found reasonable prices for souvenirs at the shops in Lucky Plaza. For example, I had purchased 4 fans for $13 elsewhere, then found the same fans at 5 for $10 at a shop in the basement of Lucky Plaza. Luggage tags were 10 for $10, and at other places they were 4 or 6 for $10. There is also a reasonably priced hawker's center in the basement (and it's air-conditioned). Just avoid Sundays if you can, because the place is completely jammed with people then."
,,Food court with many Filipino stalls,3.0,,"Lucky Plaza sells lots of electronic appliances like cameras, phones, etc. Bargaining is needed but you will be able to find cheap bargains too.

You can find souvenirs like t-shirts, key chains, etc.

Many Filipinos would gather here during the weekends.

There is a food court at the basement, where there are many stalls selling Filipino food. You can Jolliebee here too.

My favorite stall is Rong kee Roasted delights, which they serve delicious roast duck and pork."
,,A Good place to find a Bargain,4.0,,"A huge place to catch a bargain as lots of shops have special deals. may it be branded stores, chocolates, souvenirs, suitcases/bags you will find it all! Is extremely crowded on Sunday so must avoid!"
,,Filipino goods in Singapore,4.0,,"I think the only people who can appreciate Lucky Plaza are the Filipinos. This is the best place to find all your Filipino needs from snacks, cooking sauces, instant noodles, canned food etc... If you happen to be hungry while walking around this building, there are lots of small cafes serving authentic Filipino food. The desserts are very good. The leche flan is a must try."
,,Didn't feel lucky,2.0,,"Lucky plaza feels very rundown and old. Needs cheering up a lot. Lots of cheap shops with souvenirs, a few tailors and lots of jewellers."
,,"massive, but disappointing",2.0,,"We wandered around this plaza and found a lot of rubbish really, cheap as chips but poor quality. Thought the clothes were sub-standard. As a plaza it is worth a look at structurally, sure you could spend more time than we did. We were quite excited thinking we could find bargains and mementos but for us there wasn't so were disappointed."
,,NICE SHOPPING,4.0,,Colourfull and silly - great deal - keep an open mind and eyes to catch the spectacular occasion offered
,,Lucky plaza shopping,5.0,,This is a nice place with lot of Filipino but it is very cheap and lots of products. The prices are almost fixed. The food court is alos great and you can have lot of different experience here.
,,Great place to start shopping,5.0,,"We only got to visit Lucky Plaza on our last afternoon. But as we walked in it was apparent that we should have come here first. There are many stores, which offer great deals and will suit any travelers needs. Also good perfume / cologne deals on the ground floor level."
,,Bargain hunting in Orchard Road,3.0,,"Lots of cheap souvenirs, shirts, perfumes, and food here. Some travel agents also sell cheaper tickets to many local attractions. It feels like a really different side of Orchard Road that is otherwise filled with luxury shopping malls. The place can get very crowded on weekends though."
,,feels like home,5.0,,"most of the people who go there are filipinos. it feels like im at home. products are cheaper. if going to the salon, easier to explain what you want as you speak the same language. going to jollibee became a monthly thing."
,,Canteen in the hectic city,4.0,,"Been transiting in Singapore, we were rushed to Lucky Plaza food court to take the delicious Nasi Campur. Even tough the place is more likely canteen, the food and thai ice tea were so tasty for us."
,,An easy way to get food and souvenirs,4.0,,Go to this place is the easiest way to find local foods. There are delicious hainam chicken rice and seafoods. You also can find a plenty of souvenirs here.
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Nice place to shop,,,i stay in apartement inside that lucky plaza,, its feel like home,,, near to go everywhere,,,"
,,Shopping in singapore,4.0,,"Lucky plaza is situated on the busy shopping street of Orchard road. We were looking for iPad covers, iPhone covers and tempered glass protectors for them. The plaza is full of many different shops selling a variety of shoes, clothes, gifts/souvenirs and lots of electronic accessories shops. We found exactly what we were looking for. You have to haggle with the shopkeepers as they do start ridiculously high but they are happy to do this and I was happy with the deal we made. We then went to the food court for lunch which was a little disappointing so wouldn't recommend that but the fresh just stall was good with a huge selection of flavours. I had star fruit juice which was delicious. We then went one of the many gift shops and bought all sort of paraphernalia to take home for gift - lucky family !!"
,,I feel so at home here!,5.0,,"We went here to purchase tickets for Gardens by the Bay, Adventure Cove and USS from Cebu Air Travel but we were able to buy a lot of pasalubong, too! There were a lot of Filipino-owned stores. We got free chocolates from one of the uncles who owned a chocolate store. So we promised to come back and buy chocolates from them. That's where I bought the tiramisu almonds which was probably the best out of all the chocolates I bought in Singapore. I need to buy lots of those next time! When you're Filipino, it would be best to come here to buy stuff! :)"
,,Cheap Place on Orchard,5.0,,"I love this for shopping since it's the cheapest place I've found in Orchard. I also go here to by my chocolate. There are a couple souvenir shops and some places to eat. I like stopping here if I'm going to buy anything in Orchard. Sundays are interesting at Lucky Plaza because it's all the Helpers hanging out there and just an interesting time to visit there. Other than that, there isn't anything to see. But if you're in Orchard and you're cheap like me, this is the place to go to."
,,Cheap Shopping at Orchard Road,4.0,,Its a nice small mall with many shops. You can get very good offers for clothes bags shoes etc. They have perfume stores which also sell testers. These are original testers and much cheaper. So you can shop for your personal use.
,,Fascinating place to shop for bargains,4.0,,Not for everyone but Lucky Plaza is always on my must-visit list when in Singapore. You can get some great bargains on chocolate and perfumes and get your souvenirs here too. I made a point of taking my girlfriend for her first visit on a Sunday when the place was jam-packed with Filipinas sending money home and meeting up with friends. There's absolutely nowhere left to sit for a drink or food but I think it's one of Singapore's great people-watching experiences and my girlfriend was fascinated. The sellers are not that pushy and some are very friendly and helpful. Great way to spend an hour or so on Orchard.
,,good place to shop,4.0,,"its a good place for shopping,you will find all types of stuff,awesome locality for branded stuff,just a drive away from little India too"
,,Cheapest place to buy alot of things,5.0,,"This plaza was the best plaza i went to as the stuff was very cheap and as singapore is very expensive, we got to buy alot of things at a very reasonable price. Quality of goods are also good if you chooose right. Some goods are sold wholesale, but its the best place to buy gifts when going back ;)"
,,"Shopping place, amazing deals",3.0,,One of the good places for bargain hunters. Good offers during the independence week when we visited here. Lots of Travel & Tour agencies sell discounted tickets here. Plus you get good exchange rates with a couple of money exchangers here.
,,AFFORDABLE PLACE TO BE,5.0,,nice to place for almost everything was able to buy 2 pairs of ipanema flip flops for S$30.00 from a very nice filipina store manager......this is an alternative airconditioned BUGIS stores...
,,Dr. McCartney-Saunders,5.0,,"Awesome Deals. Everything you need you can find at Lucky Plaza. Perfume, clothes, Watches, souvenirs and more."
,,A funcheap place for your souveniers,4.0,,"This place has been here for as long as I can remember. It is a great place for your cheap souvenirs and they have a good few places where you will get a foot massage and other treatments at a good price, much cheaper than the other malls. Always make a visit here when I am in Singapore, it is a lively local mall"
,,Little Manila,4.0,,"Vibrant, boisterous and cramped full with Filipina shoppers on a Sunday, it was quite an experience to shop there. My mother found a nice blouse for the affordable price of SGD8 and I found the exact digital travel alarm clock and sampler perfume that I was looking for at great prices as well. Stay away if you are not into crowded places but if you want to experience a little piece of the Philippines and savour the local food and snacks"
,,The Filipino Heaven,4.0,,"I was here just because I want to see how's the place look like after all these years...
And I can said is......it had transformed itself into the Filipino Heaven of Singapore. With many remittance centers, shop outlets selling chocolates, accessories, souvenir or in other words, pasalubong for the pinoy.
Then, the food court..as if you are in the Philippines...all the filipino cuisine, including Jollibee.
So, if you are filipino, are you gonna to miss this place? While for Chinese like me, it's good place for me to hang out with my filipino friends. I love it!"
,,Not too special shopping centre,2.0,,"Lucky Plaza is the one of crowded place in Orchard. It has some shops and food area, but unfortunately you find another better places in Orchard because not only crowded, but i do not find something special in this place."
,,Great Money Changer,4.0,,"Lucky Plaza is the best place to change your money. Go to the Middle eastern man on the right hand side bottom floor as he gives the best rate. Avoid Lucky Plaza on a Sunday as the home helps hang out there and while its an exciting experience to see so many people enjoying themselves the noise is horrendous. Food is cheap and very tasty. Lots of shops selling jewelry, clothes, perfumes, books etc. Right in the heart of Downtown Orchard Rd and easy to locate."
,,Cheap and trustworthy,4.0,,A very good place to buy cheaper products especially chocolates and perfumes. The place has genuine products and the prices are far more cheaper than the options with the other vendors in SIngapore.
,,Less expensive shopping,3.0,,"Great place to buy Philippine food and snacks, also one of few Jollibee restaurants can be found here on level 6, same leve got some bars and a flea market on weekends. Go basement for food court with nice food."
,,Depends what you want. For some purposes there's nothing better.,4.0,,"There's a basement food court here that is very popular with the Filipino (Pinoy) community on Sundays. Every other stall here will cater to the Pinoy population. But there is one good fish slice porridge stall here that sells its various offerings (fish slice noodles, soup, etc) at about $5/dish. Not bad."
,,Good,4.0,,This is place for cheap things.Lots of migrant workers.You have bargain.A place different from other malls here.If you have time walk in and experience.
,,Worth a Look,3.0,,"Typical, market type shops. primarily set up to cater to workers, haggle for best price. Do not go on Sunday as every migrant worker is there wiring money back home at one of the many many wire transfer companies."
,,A Haven for Travelers On A Budget... and Filipinos!,5.0,,"I was in Singapore on a business trip, and my friend, knowing that I am Filipino-American, told me that it's a MUST that I vist Lucky Plaza because it was like a Little Philippines. I wasn't sure exactly what she meant so I was eager to check it out.

When we got there I was quite blown away! She's right! There were very familiar brands and stores in this building - banks, cell phone companies, restaurants. I didn't get to explore the entire building but I knew that I would definitely come back, which I did. I was on my way to the airport and I asked another friend to take me back to Lucky Plaza, not even minding that it was on a Sunday noon! I got so busy with business meetings that I completely forgot to shop for souvenirs for my family and friends back in California!

Lucky Plaza was a trip-saver for me! I found a larger bag for $10 Singapore dollars (around $7.00 US which allowed me to pack more stuff in my checked bag.) I also found a wonderful store on the first floor with both low and high quality souvenirs so I did all my souvenir and personal shopping in only 2 stores and my shopping was done for about $250 Singapore dollars. I was also able to buy nice silk dresses and robes for myself.

I didn't get to check out the food court below but from the looks of it, it was packed! The energy was vibrant and it just seemed that people there for the most part are very happy.

One thing I did notice were some of the luggage store owners. Some of them were nice, but some were downright rude. You really need to shop and compare prices because 2 different stores quoted me $200 and $250 for the same carry-on luggage.

I love the snack stores - I even stocked up on my Matcha Tea KitKat Bars and my favorite Filipino snack, DingDong. There were also delicacy stores all around, and they sell bibingka, turon, puto and other treats.

I haven't been in the Philippines for 9 years now, but as an International Flight Attendant, I have traveled many places in the world, enough to write an objective review, as an International Citizen. If I wasn't Filipino, I would still give Lucky Plaza a 5 point rating because of it's convenience, it's ease of finding things, the variety of merchandise and the price! This is the best place for bargain shoppers and travelers on a budget.

Singapore is truly a rather expensive city and depends on what you're looking for, there are certain areas for you to find it. Orchard Road has all the high end luxury goods you can ever imagine and it seems like there's luxury stores on every block! If you're looking for the trendiest luxury brand and merchandise then Lucky Plaza may not be for you. However, I have to say that they do have a great selection of luggage. You may not see any Tumi or Hartmann but they have popular American and European brands just the same.

If you have an open mind and can really appreciate the most bang for your buck, you will find great value at Lucky Plaza! Oh and if you're feeling adventurous, try their Cassava Cake (sweet cassava root baked with rice flour, coconut and condensed milk) Turon (sweet fried banana wrapped in wonton wrapper ) and Puto (rice cake topped with cheese ), you just might find it very enjoyable!"
,,If you love the Philippines this is food you otherwise not,4.0,,"I live in the uk and the Philippines
If you like the Philippines you will love this place
Good for food courts money exchange cheap souvenir
There are many more upmarket malls
Don't buy electric items here cheap souvenirs manicure etc cheap
Little Philippines in Singapore
Yes it's safe"
,,Suitable for shoppers on a tight budget,4.0,,"If you're traveling with young kids, I would recommend this place rather than Mustafa Centre nor Bugis Street. The place is air-conditioned, convenient enough for them waiting for the parents shop :) However, there was only 1 elevator, it was difficult to mobile around for us with 2 strollers.

We went there on Monday noon. So the place wasn't crowded (yeehaa!).

We had lunch at Ayam Goreng Ojolali. Delicious Indonesian food! Tasted like heavenly-home!

Here, we bought small bags for $10 (for 5 pieces). Fridge magnets for $10 (for 5 pieces). Singapore-embossed pens with case for $10 (for 3 pieces). There's also a chocolate shop at the third floor named ""Chocolate Station"". We bought Nutella Go for $12 (for 12 pieces). If you go there, please pay extra attention on the expiry dates, some products don't last longer than a few weeks."
,,Dusty fun,4.0,,"This is probably the largest and oddest flea market in Singapore, which i think happens every day. The flea market is at level 6 near Jollibee, and they really have a lot of random things and cheap clothes. The only down side is that you need to arm yourself with a mask and bodyguards if you came on a Sunday like me."
,,Only authentic secondhand flea market in Orchard Road!,5.0,,"Every weekend there is a secondhand flea market going on in Lucky Plaza level 6 by the locals. It is held either at #06-14 or #06-48b. There are as many as 70-100 sellers selling secondhand stuff, brand new old goods, affordable first hand fashion goods as well."
,,Shopping centre with cheaper food and things,4.0,,It's a mall. Like the other ones at orchard road. But the food places are cheaper and bargains can be picked up here. Most shops will be closed past 9pm.
,,"cheap, crowds and food!",3.0,,"Its not the best looking plaza/mall in singapore but it doesnt need to be. Its very functional as a food hall and as a place to buy lots of cheap souvenirs. I visited every day while i was in Singapore as my hotel was just off Orchard road,
Just 2 words of advice.
- Avoid Sundays as the whole Filipino community seems to congregate here
- Make sure you do your homework on prices on electronic goods, they try to hook you in to buy, by showing you cheap prices but often sell you last years model or a lower spec than what you are after. If you know what you want and understand the normal retail price then you will do well here."
,,Cheapest souvenir shops at the basement,2.0,,"If you are looking for cheapest souvenir itemsm this is the place. I bought 6pcs. Souvenir items, keychain, for only 10sg dollar, compare to other shops, 1 item cost about 4 sg dollars. I have been to other shops, and there is no way to compare the price but for other items such as shirts and ready to wear goods, expect it to be low quality."
,,Must visit food court,3.0,,"Food court located in the basement has a good selection of food, all is good value and the atmosphere was amazing. Visited on a Sunday evening and struggled to find somewhere to sit. Enjoyed the food and the experience."
,,Nice Food Court (on Basement Level),3.0,,"Everything I visited Orchard Road, I always have meal in Lucky Plaza. You can enter from McD and go straight to the Food Court. As Indonesian Moslem, my comfort food is of course some indonesian/malay's cuisine and the most important thing is halal."
,,Budget mall for budget travelers,5.0,,"Many many small shops Filipino style; polite crowds. Big food court/stalls on lowest floor. Jewelry, clothing, remittance banks, exchange currency, hair, and top floor one wing is medical center with a lot of specialties."
,,Shopper's paradise !!,4.0,,"Lots of cheap things here, starting from chocolate as gifts for your colleagues, perfumme for your spouse, watches, clothes, etc. Anything you need just named it and you will find it here definitely."
,,Reasonable Price to shop,4.0,,"Compare to other places in Orchard area, i think Lucky Plaza is the most cheaper place to shop souvenir such as chocolate, t-shirt and other souvenir with Singapore logo..you can find the 2 foodcourt inside with arround $3-$7, you can take a lunch here."
,,Local as well as Philippine shops,4.0,,Have found that lucky plaza is a better place to change money.... Can find good Philipines food as well.... Loads of tourist type shops.
,,Downmarket Mall,2.0,,"Lucky Plaza i a downmarket shopping mall on Orchard Road. It is a popular stop for taxis who all know where it is. The mall includes a lot of cheap imports from the Philippines and some fairly ropey goods. There are about three levels above ground and one below. The basement also includes a poor quality food court.

This is probably the place to go for cheap on Orchard Road. A lot of electronic goods are available, mostly relating to mobile phones. It is the kind of place where the initial asking price is not the final one. Walking out of a shop seems to generate a better offer. Well worth not just accepting the un-ticketed price offered, especially for those who may not seem local.

There is not much to catch the eye of those who want to buy quality. Other malls cater to that market.

The mall itself is ugly inside and out. Functional just about. Not at all pretty or aesthetically pleasing. The bright lights pick out the limited aspirations of taste here.

For locals in need of a cheap option Lucky seems to be the place to be."
,,Cheapest Shopping at Orchard Road,3.0,,It is an old shopping centre and cannot be compared to high end shopping malls of Orchard road. It is good for soveniers key chains etc and best for currency change at competitive rates. There is nothing extraordinary to detail here.
,,NOT a place for tourists,3.0,,"This rundown mall is meant for domestic workers. The mall mainly is supermarket that import products from Philippine. Clothes that selling here look like second hand or donation which sale at 5-7S$.

Souvenirs price is not lowest comparing to Mutafa or Chinatown market.

Gadgets shops kinda dicey.. You know what I mean right?

Food court price is average.. If you are tourist, better skip this mall."
,,Oldies shopping centre,4.0,,"Near by Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Paragon Mall and famous Orchard Road, Lucky Plaza is easy to find. Many local and international brands you can find here. If you want to buy souvenirs, you can find it on B1 floor, near by foodcourt. And the foodcourt, it has became a legend. My favorite meals here are Yong Tau Fu (the most delicious soup ever), Hainan Chicken Rice and Kaya Toast. As an Indonesian, sometimes I miss Indonesia's food and you can find Ayam Penyet Ria at level 1. Penyet and sambal, here I come.."
,,cheap & easy,4.0,,"Good busy place to go to for little bits & pieces as well as cheap perfumes, etc. It has a cheap & easy look & feel about it & right in the middle of the larger flashier shopping places along Orchard rd."
,,A Good and affordable place,4.0,,"Ok anyone can just look at the mall from outside and figure it out that its not a high end one so I don't see any point in comparing it with its flashy neighbours!
Its a decent shopping center with good, cheap stuff like souvenirs, all those keychains and stuff, tees, chocolates with good deals and offers. So its a great place to shop in an otherwise expensive Orchard road.
Also there are many good restaurants here especially Filipino ones (Kabayan, Lechonation, Jolibee).
Many travel agencies and tailor shops too. So overall this place deserves a visit.

Nearest MRT - Orchard"
,,Lucky Plaza,4.0,,"October 2015 . This is an old Shopping Center . I can remember , my first visit in Singapore in 1988 i visited it . It is nice and interesting .In the Basement you will find some Restaurants with inexpensive Food . I like it to walk here , much better than the Orchard Road with the High expensive Shopping malls . It is worth to spend 1 Hour here"
,,Not worth a visit,2.0,,"Disappointing shopping mall with generic, low end goods (no brand names). Better options at Bugis village for cheap and cheerful, with the exception of cheap fake pearls."
,,"Fried chicken, cheap noodles and crazy deserts",4.0,,"We wanted a cheap place to eat and stumbled upon Lucky Plaza. It became our hang out. Full of Fillipinos and locals - good mix of Aisan foods, cheap and generally good quality. McDonald's just around the corner and the kids liked the very popular fried chicken shop. Also enjoyed a pretty crazy Asian desert that seemed a mix of soya beans, cream and jelly."
,,Ok for prices in Orchard Rd.,3.0,,"Lots of little shops just like Chinatown. Money changers, tech stuff, souvenirs and food court. Prices generally ok considering the location. Know your prices before you buy."
,,"Lots of stores, good food court.",4.0,,"Love this plaza. Came across it totally by accident as we were walking on orchard road and was disappointed by the high prices of the other shopping mall on Orchard road. Wow! Lots of stores. Lots of locals come here to buy there clothes. No branded names but you can find lots of good deal in here. A place to avoid on sundays!!! I mean crowded crowed !! Most of the crowds are from the Filipinos. They're nice but really a handful of them!! Literally no space to walk!!
Place is safe, and lots of food to eat for cheap! Food court is amazing!! A must if you don't mind being win a crowd."
,,Shopping center which you can find authentic filippino food,4.0,,I went there on a weekday afternoon as weekend is really crowded. this shopping center is very popular with Filipino working in Singapore. As the basement have many shops and a foodcourt selling Filipino cuisine and mini marts selling imports from Philippines. You can find souvenirs there too but there are other places which sell same souvenirs at lower prices. Advise to go in morning during weekdays as lunch time and evenings and weekend is super crowded.
,,cheap place for souvenir,3.0,,cheap place to buy souvenir like chocolate and t shirt but dont go there on sunday coz too crowded.the food also cheap at this place compare than other malls around the orchard road.i like pinoy court on the food court and everything in the food court are really cheap and tasty.
,,Convenience Shopping all in one Plaza,5.0,,"Looking for a place to buy some sandals (mine broke) this plaza offered reasonably priced goods and services. Found two pairs, some souvenirs and some batteries. Great convenience. Especially liked Bettini Lucky Polo shop for shoes"
,,Good Asian food court,4.0,,"Can't comment on the shops in the Lucky Plaza but the Asian food court in the basement is good fun, serves simplistic but tasty food and is extremely cheap. My roast duck with rice from the Roasted Delights counter cost about £2 while a freshly juiced honeydew set me back another £1.50. The place was clean with staff cleaning the bench tables very much in evidence. There were few tourists around. The food court bustled with locals and they usually know where to go!"
,,Shopping mall with a food court,4.0,,"Nice shopping mall, for me was the food court more important.
Specially the restaurant from the Philippines .
I have there been eating the famous roast pork,Lechon Pinoy.
If you like pork with a crispy skin then this is a must to eat.
42 sing dollar for 2 times 1/2 a kilo.
A thing to do when you are in Singapore."
,,Good place for money exchange,4.0,,"The best place on Orchard Rd. for money exchange is found here. Good competitive bargains to buy your currency compared to other money exchange found outside. As for buying stuff at this mall I didn't see anything that worth mentioning (except of buying Sim cards for tourist the $15 one for 5 days from Singtel can be found there).

Tip: Ask multiple money exchange counters for better exchange rate"
,,"Huge and clean shopping centre , freezing cold",3.0,,"If you want to beat the afternoon heat,you can drop by this place if you are nearby. The air con here is freezing cold!

Huge compound with many levels. There are shops selling very cheap clothes,supermarkets,filipino eateries. Toilets here cost $0.20 and are clean.

The supermarkets here are clean as compared to those at golden mile (little thailand) and peninsula plaza (little myanmar). You can find rows and rows of canned food produced in Philippines like sardines and tuna. The supermarkets here dont carry as many fresh food as compared to golden mile's and peninsula plaza's.

I recommend Kabayan filipino restaurant located at level 3. Not so much a restaurant but bigger scale than the other smaller eateries around,this place serves a wide variety of authentic filipino food at affordable prices. Try the Sinigang (sour Assam soup with pork), Kare kare (a curry dish cooked with peanut butter sauce) and bangus (milkfish) with rice."
,,SCAM ALERT 2014,1.0,,I had terrible experience with Lucky Plaza. I got scammed by one of the shop on early 2014. I lost 200 dollars over sim card :( I wasnt sure what happened It was like being hypnotised and lead on. The shop who cheated me was near the underpass to go to Takashimaya (right side) its a small mobile shop. Becareful guys on Lucky Plaza. Im motivated to report my case to CASE and STB since the Singapore goverment is more trusted now.
,,Won't miss much not coming here.....,2.0,,"This is not a modern concept mall but a very old mall, with many small shops selling various things like souvenirs, electronics, hair salons, clothes, foodstuff, etc.

Some are cheap, some are not & don't expect much in quality. Do not recommend buying of electronic products here.

Don't come here on Sundays as this place is super packed with foreign domestic workers ( off day). Many shops here cater specifically for them.

Frankly, you won't miss much not coming here. There are so many other nice and good modern malls in Orchard Road & nearby Marina Centre. For souvenirs, best place to buy is at Chinatown ( huge varieties & very low prices)."
,,Ok,3.0,,This place had a great food court which I really enjoyed using but the other shops seemed a little run down and did not look that special.
,,A must do shopping experience,5.0,,"A shoppers delight. Small shops, large shops, all selling various articles, some cheap, some not so cheap. A wonderful experience. Do not miss."
,,Favorite mall for many Indonesian,3.0,,Not sure why many Indonesian likes this mall. It is an old mall with over crowded food court and nothing much else
,,Avoid APO Foto & Electronics - DO NOT GET SUCKED IN!!,1.0,,"I have very foolishly fallen victim to a con artist named Jason working at the above photo shop in Lucky Plaza. Once away from the shop with my ""new"" camera, sadly in exchange for my old great one plus a great deal of cash, I discover by searching prices back home (Aus) that I have paid triple the price, lost my old camera (in perfect working order just outdated) and cannot be convinced I have received new items. I got carried away in the situation, took Jason at his word, and got stung big time. Please don't make the same mistake!!!"
,,"Bargain mall, be careful",2.0,,"I never really enjoyed lucky plaza. Yes its one of the rare markets that you can bargain prices in Singapore, but be careful if you are tourism since they will rip you off with exaggerated prices. I would recommend to buy your electronics and gadgets from other big well known department stores"
,,Feeling Lucky?,3.0,,"One of many plazas along orchard road. Very down market compared to most. The main business is run on the upper levels which are money exchanges and money transfer businesses, mainly for the Bank of the Phillipines The rest of the shops are pretty average."
,,Be careful if you want to buy electronics/ gadget,2.0,,"There are few shops that sells camera, phone, electronics etc... Its cheap but you must know what you want before hand. You must ask whats included in their price, warranty and check whats inside the box. Sometimes they scam tourist that dont understand the product."
,,Popular Mall in a central location,3.0,,"This mall is located next to Tangs, close to Orchard MRT Station.

The mall has many stores which cater to the masses. There are also many money changers where you can change your foreign currency.

Do check out the eateries on the top most floor: Jollybee fast food, Yong Tau Foo and Malay fried chicken stalls."
,,Goldmine for cheap souvenirs and local culture,5.0,,Tshirts at S$2 and bargain souvenirs all of great quality. We love bargain shopping and purchased small gifts from here. From electronics to food to souvenirs and much much much more- Loved Lucky Plaza and will return here every time
,,Tourist trap,1.0,,This is a place to avoid going on Sundays. Overly crowded and feels like I am in another country and not in Singapore.
,,Cheap Souvenir Center in Orchard,3.0,,there are souvenir shops in the lucky plaza for those who prefer shopping inside a mall. probably the price is not too much different with the souvenir in Chinatown.
,,A great shopping,5.0,,"We fell in love with this shopping centre as it had so many different shops,,from one of handmade piece's of jewelery, to bags, jewelry, IT shops,,shoes,,there was even a McCafe,"
,,U are never lucky here,3.0,,"Lucky plaza is onw of the oldest buildings on orchard road...itz basically an icon..

Its full of electronics n stuff...but i wouldn't recommend buying anything here unless you.know exactly what you want and knows how to bargain

There is a good place in the basement for tennis gears....the food court is relatively clean

Avoid this place on sundays as thats when the place is swamped with Filipino workers taking their day off..."
,,Don't Go Here on a Sunday,3.0,,"It's a place where you can get good travel deals. The shops on the lower floors have good souvenirs and chocolates. Warning, unless it is for a very important purpose, do not go here on a Sunday. It is full of people and you will have a hard time navigating through the mall."
,,Avoid,2.0,,"Car parking is a disgrace and to be charged for it is woeful, took 15 to find a park on the top floor, in amongst workman. The surface is potholed and your paying whilst searching,
The centre itself is pokey, scattered and makes no sense.
I won't return...."
,,Good list on lucky plaza,4.0,,"A) there are apartments for short rent
In building , it's old but price is reasonable for location
B) halal restaurants Indonesian in level
2 , and Pizza Hut and mc Donald's and other more restaurants in food court
3) excellent security , we kept back a bag in the elevator and the security had it with lost and found great job !
4) some good stores reasonable prices
5) electronic I don't know coz I didn't make any such purchase
6) location great"
,,"Filipino foods here are very expensive."":-(",2.0,,"Working miles away from home and of course you love the food that you use to eat back in your homeland. So most of the time i need the ingredients to cook my meal as Singapore is very expensive to live. So I did ask my colleagues if where I could buy Filipino products, and yes it is indeed in lucky plaza. Went there for the first time and had my list with me. When I went to store by store to get the items I needed I am very surprised of the prices, it's at least 3 to 4 times more. When I convert it to peso I said to myself I rather buy the hokkien noodle or chicken rice at the hawker center than spending money on the items I need for cooking.this is ridiculous place to shop and eat Filipino food. If you are really craving for Filipino food then maybe once in awhile. Avoid coming here every Sunday as this place is over crowded. Lots of workers are here to meet up friends, sending money back home.
Not a place to visit again."
,,"Jolibee, Filipino Goods, Cargo",3.0,,"When we went inside Lucky Plaza i felt like i was transported back to the Philippines. Almost everyone spoke Tagalog, most of the Stores were Filipino and there was a Jolibee Branch too.

It had a vibe Similar to Harrison Plaza in Manila but much cleaner.

For Filipino Goods this is the place to Go to. To send cargo boxes to the Philippines and to send money also. Also the place to eat Filipino food. There are other shops also selling electronics, perfumes, clothes."
,,Shopping,4.0,,If you have to buy small items for your home this is the best place to buy.and you also get a lot of variety.
,,Best Place in Singapore for all things Filipino,4.0,,"If you want to buy good quality clothes and electronics-you're in the wrong place.
if you want some bargin clothes and a genuine taste of the Filipines in Singapore - you wont do better than Lucky Plaza. Avoid on a Sunday unless you want to see how really packed with people a shopping center can be. Its clearly a haven for Filipino maids. Experiencing it on a Sundaywill create a memory that will stay with you always.
Hiding away in the corners are some truely great Filipino bars, Coyote Ugly being one, cheap beers and very friendly very good looking girls who will keep you company, note though they are ""Working Girls""."
,,Avoid at all cost,1.0,,This is just another shop to add to the list of many.AIK SENG PHOTO. The usual tricks of overpriced add ons.Opening packets before you've agreed a price etc.
,,What a lively place!,3.0,,Walking along Orchard Road we saw a large amount of people around the Lucky Plaza shopping centre and wondered what was going on. We went it and found that this lively place was the meeting place for locals on a Sunday. It was jam packed with people everywhere! Shops have much cheaper prices than the high-end stores of Orchard Road!
,,Not quite so Lucky anymore!!,3.0,,"Had visited Lucky Plaza previously and grabbed some good electronic items, but now seems to be a lot of overpriced items and lots of fakes. However, it is a good place to change money and I did grab some good sandals at a great price. There is also a food mall which is very clean and the meals we had were very nice and quite comparible with pricing. I also had a dress made there and was very happy with it and the price I paid was also good. Still good to grab a few nick naks and have a wander around. If you do pay it a visit just be switched on!!!"
,,no use visiting this place for shopping,2.0,,amidst the luxurious orchard road this is a terrible place for shopping. selling cheap and fake goods. big probability of getting cheated. but this place is good for getting nice exchange rate for currency.
,,Flea!,4.0,,It maybe filled with IT con artists and fake stuff. But there is a flea held every weekend by the young Singaporean where they sell their pre loved or some interesting products! So if any tourist wanna see a different side of singapore...do go to level 6 beside Jolibee.
,,Singapore Should be Ashamed !,1.0,,"To put it bluntly , this place is filled with thieves selling grossly overpriced/poor quality products. The best advice that I could give any traveller is to stay well clear."
,,Do not bother unless you are from Asia,2.0,,"We visited this mall after Ion and were disapointed. They sell souvenirs, electronics, Philipino food and cheap clothes. If you want to buy souvenirs go to Chinatown instead. If you want to buy electronics go to Mustafa instead. I can not recommend this place."
,,LUCKY PLAZA,4.0,,"Went back to Lucky Plaza shopping centre, and there are a few of the old shops there but it is now more up market and you don't get as many of the bargains as you used to. It was still nice to visit though. We did quite a bit of shopping at the shopping centre directly across from the Swissotel Merchant Court, where the MRT is and they have several zones to shop, and they were quite good."
,,Sea Land Sports ... Dive gear,1.0,,"Was in town so dropped by to do some price comparison. I was shocked how much more a wetsuit jacket is so much more expensive then the one I saw in scuba warehouse. Sea land asked for $150 for an unknown brand of 3mm while scuba warehouse has Bare 3mm for $120. Told owner for cheaper price I can get a Bare and he is ""willing"" to give a discount to $120 since he doesn't carry the jacket wetsuit of Bare!! No thanks ... Why would I pay for a sub valued merchandize for the same price ... And the fitting weren't good either ... Loose on shoulder and owner insisted its a good fit for scuba !!! Must really think I'm a good lamb to slaughter.."
,,Heaven For Electronics,4.0,,"If you wish to buy any Electronics items like mobile phones ipads, smart phones and accessories, visit Lucky Plaza. This is also a place for sending money to overseas. Before buying anything from Lucky Plaza, you ask the price from 2-3 shops and bargain. You can find many eating places here."
,,BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1.0,,"I was in Singapore recently for a day and I went down to Lucky Plaza as I heard there was some good shopping places. I was looking for some camera accessories and I came across a vendor that had just what I was looking for after talking with what i believed at the time to be a kind salesman he gave me a ""student discount"" on an external flash and wide angle adaptor for my camera and i went on my merry way. when i got to a Starbucks i looked up the prices on the flash and the adaptor and found that the ""student discount"" he gave me on the flash dropped the price to about $20 above retail meaning he slightly overcharged me and the worse part is I could find no information about the adaptor I bought meaning it was most likely a fake. So i went back to the store and demanded a refund but the man would not talk to me not alone look at me he just sat there eating his damn chinese noodles. After returning to Japan I tried getting a quote for the adapter and was offered $5 for it!!!! I understand it was my fault for not being as informed about the products as I should have been but what these retailers do is beyond simply ripping you off. Not to mention in this area there were a ton of prostitutes. Moral of my mistake don't shop here!!!!"
,,Charge for Toilet Facility,3.0,,"It's a crowded places, fortunately there are lot of restaurants and the plus point is: there's an Indonesian restaurant. There is an office of BNI (Indonesian bank) which is very helpful for me. Not forget to mention, there is chocolate shop, Choc Spot, which offer the cheapest chocolate products in Singapore (after Mustafa). Unfortunately, this was the only place I visited when I was in Singapore, and I had to pay for toilet facility. That's why I give 3 out of 5 ratings."
,,Too many people,2.0,,"Gets very busy here all the time, and especially on Sundays when domestic workers are released and socialise with each other or send money back to their families. There are a couple of small dive shops in the basement from which I've bought items in the past: both tend to be qutie reliable."
,,Cheap place to pick a few bits and pieces,4.0,,"I was hesitant to go after seeing so many below average reviews but thought I'd check it out. Sure I didn't buy large amounts but my family picked up a few bits and pieces and good prices and sure it's not a big fancy mall but it was clean and cool inside, we would definitely visit again if we were in Singapore"
,,Conmen in EZ Advance Trading Enterprise and other shops in Lucky Plaza,1.0,,"This is a confession of an ex-staff for EZ Advance Trading Enterprise. To make it short, my friend Leo, worked for 3 months in that Company while he's waiting for his exam result.

During that period, the boss (Jason & Johnny) taught Leo how to cheat the customers via a range of tactics which range from luring customers in with low price, and sell at high price after they come in, and add on things like GST to make the price higher. The staff there all know the cost price of their products and basically will mark up their price 2x until 10x of the original price. The poor tourist not know about this, will eventually got cheated and some went back for refund (which they didn't get it), while some didn't. There was this case where a Malaysian lady bought a prepaid card for $150 which was 10x more than it should be.

Moral of the story, don't buy electronics or games consoles in ANY shop in Lucky Plaza."
,,"Good place value for money, to eat at the foodcourt with lots of selection Asian, western and fast food. Cheap souvenirs",4.0,,"Cheap food (4.5-9.0) ice kachang (2.80-3.50), selection of food stalls, cheaper than Ion and Takashimaya FC. Cheap souvenirs (bags, keychain, etc). Good for waiting spot, if you've to go to Mount Elizabeth Hospital."
,,CONMEN @ APO FOTO & ELECTRONICS STAY AWAY,1.0,,"These guys are from 19th century and really treat customers who trust Singapore dealers like brainless fools when it comes to selling their gadgets and accessories.
Placed my trust on them and they mark up everything 3 times higher than market price with a take it or leave it attitude, I chose only a camera and a few accessories and after bargaining,finalized price on calculator but they add a 10%on my credit card when swiping. When you're purchasing electronics,10% can be a lot (eg:10% of 1k SGD). Told me its 7% GST and 3% for credit card. Refused to write the breakdown of price in my receipt.

They have been surviving like this by conning many tourists.
My advice NEVER BUY ANY ELECTRONICS FROM THAT MALL

Sheathead old man and son"
,,Overcrowded Filipino mall,2.0,,"Visited this shopping mall on Sunday September 2014 ,this place was overpopulated with Filipinos maids, housekeepers and babysitters.
A lot of remittance service with long Qs on several floors of this mall.
There's several Singapore souvenir shops ,money changers, jewelry ,camera and electronics shop, clothes as low as $ 2 ( i never saw a ladies shirt priced cheaper than this, anywhere in Singapore).
Some said that electronics vendors here are untrustful, but i haven't buy nor use their services myself.
Some food hawker at the corners of the mall , mainly sering Filipino and Chinese food,quite cheap as you are in Orchard area !
Nothing much to do or buy here, i'd better avoid this place in my future trip."
,,Do you feel lucky,3.0,,OK Lucky Plaza is cheap and tacky but it is an icon and has been for decades. The souvenir shops below have great bargains. The bygone days of bargain yet reliable electronics is probably gone
,,What's good at Lucky Plaza,2.0,,Lucky Plaza is bit run down as compare to its neighbour. Luck Plaza have lots of remittance service. For traveller Lucky Plaza have numbers of money changer that offer good exchange rate as compare to others in town.
,,"Be careful at Lucky Plaza, Orchard road",1.0,,One can easily be taken for granted at lucky plaza dont buy anything out there. All electronic items sold can be misleading your eyes before you know you have paid high and lost money. Just visit the place and do not buy anything
,,You will be sorry you ever went into Lucky Plaza.,1.0,,"In complete contrast to the Mall name, you will definitely be unlucky. The place is crammed with unscrupulous vendors who will pull every trick to overcharge you by hundreds of percent. Expect to pay two or three times the actual value. The place should be closed down - sorry, I mean burned down."
,,Convenient Place for shopping,4.0,,"You can get good deals and the prices are quite affordable unlike the other high end malls, which can prove to be quite expensive."
,,Great place but be wary of some unethical transactions.,4.0,,"This place is great for looking for electronic items such as mobile phones, computer items, audio or visual items.

Here is a tip for the traveller before coming to a place like this:

Do some homework of what you require well and truly before you arrive. Check the item against their Singaporean web site.

Quite often you ask the person you wish to purchase item ""ABCD"". The seller most likely will tell you that ""ABCD"" is now obsolete but they have ""ABCC"" which is a later model and cheaper.

Quite often the model they are selling is either a previous model or a lower version and most likely they don't have the functions you want or require but they cannot be bothered in specially obtaining your model so they ""bluff"" you into purchasing a model that you require.

Stand by what you want and don't move because you made the homework."
,,For budget travelers,4.0,,"If you are on a tight budget but still want to shop, this is the place. But be cautious as you may get spammed. Do visit the chocolate store in the 1st floor. Think it's called ""chocolate spot"". It had some great deals. Also visit the flea market in one of the upper floors. The were clothes from $1 onwards. Not tree best quality, but worth it."
,,Haunt of Housekeepers on Sunday,3.0,,"Lucky Plaza on Sunday is currently a haunt of housekeepers, who are Filipino and Indonesian.
Therefore, inside there are a lot of cheap restaurants, which are Hawkers.
Among them some Hawkers are very good teste shops, for example, that is ""chocken rice"" etc.
And also there are many Philippines foods and goods shops, you can buy them inside.
If you want to feel little Manila and Jakarta, please go to Lucky Plaza on Sunday."
,,Cheap Quality Poor Service,1.0,,"Unless you are Filipino and need to speak Tagalog, I don't think it is at all necessary for you to come here. Quality is cheap, not very much variety to chose from and lousy service and attitude. Dirty, smelly place. Don't bother.

Plus they charge for the bathroom!"
,,Filipino Place,4.0,,"If you're a Filipino and you need some Filipino items, as if you are in the Philippines; you can almost find it here in Lucky Plaza..and you will also meet a lot of Filipinos here.i even tried having body massage here..its good."
,,store full of SCAMMER!!!!!,1.0,,i bought a gadget this day.. then i found out this evening that the present price of that gadget is 65% lower than the price i paid!!!! dont you ever buy something at IT3 Concepts!!!!!
,,Be careful,3.0,,"Be very careful when buying things here, especially electronics. The price they offered were low, but that's before GST. You have to search for a place where they told you that the price are before GST, if not, go to another place. They will try to sell you overpriced accesories, because that's where they'll get their commission. You have to know the price of the things you want to buy and whats included in the box. Don't show them you want it badly. Be cocky at first and they'll lower your prices. If you're lucky, you will get cheap price and a GST refund!"
,,The worst experience ! Stay away from this place!!!,1.0,,"Today , me and my husband pass by electronics store located in the basement of the lucky plaza called ' Broadway electromart Pte ltd #B1-112' There were few items that we liked and try to find out the price, salesperson lady who try to help us out, she gave us a price which was extremely high, so we negotiated for one item which we purchased later. While we were Negotiating price for the second item, she also offered to do the exchange money. Same time I was checking the price for this item online which was 3 times less she offered , so my husband tell her thank you we will not going to take it, she said we have to because she already punched in. So we ask what's the problem, she did not pack it , we did not take the change, just give us our money back, and then this lady turned into the nasty dirty person, she starte screaming and tried to kick us out of the store, you should her the words. It was outrageous!! So we call the police, which did not do much , the only thing they said is to call the consumer protection department and also , out of nowhere police show our receipt( Hand written!) which sales person , this crazy female never gave to us. On the receipts it said That the sale was final, no exchange no returns. So if this is you policy, why don't you put it outside? Anyhow, just want to warn ppl who need to by electronics , stay away from this store and a specially this female sales person !!!"
,,Souvenir shopping for the budget-conscious,3.0,,"Okay, I know Bugis is one haven for buying souvenirs in bulk when on a shoestring budget. However, if you get to be carried away till you reach Orchard with the least time possible to shop before heading off to Changi Airport, Lucky Plaza is one of the places to be. It may not be as cheap as those in Bugis, but haggling may be an option as sellers can be so generous there (or at least to me and my friends). (visited March 2011)"
,,Lucky Plaza bad experience,1.0,,"Im so sorry to hear of the bad experience at lucky plaza.
But this is certainly not rampant in other places and I would say that lucky plaza is not a representative of a conventional mall in Singapore. It is a mall largely catered to a certain group of people whose country of origin is one of the most corrupted nation in the world, i.e. Bank of Manila if you get what i meant.
Meanwhile, i hope you guys had pleasant experience elsewhere in Singapore. It is a lovely country."
,,Iconic on Orchard Road.,3.0,,"This multi storey shopping hall is in the process of getting a cut and polish and will become a more useful stop along Orchard Road. It has always been a popular stop for tourist shoppers wanting souvenirs, gold,jewellery and especially pearls. Already better shops are appearing and the new fittings are bringing the Centre in line with what many expect from the major shopping precinct. It is the food hall that we always visit on every trip that really makes Lucky Plaza for us. Plates are low price but some very appealing traditional choices in a busy atmosphere. More and more of food court style eating areas are now cropping up signalling their appeal amongst locals and tourists."
,,not worth it,2.0,,A whole heap of souvenir stores all crammed in to one place - this was a great bargain centre years ago but now becoming commercialised and sooooo not worth it. People are rude and get in your face. Not an enjoyable experience.
,,Filipino Shopping,3.0,,"This is home away from home for most Filipinos. From Filipino food to good ol Filipino hospitality. Businesses are run and some probably owned by Filipinos (and Chinese). You can get really nice and cheap luggage here too. Plus there's always a sale going on somewhere. There is also a nice chocolate store where you can get great, familiar and popular chocolates way cheaper than duty free. If you're walking along orchard, this is a nice stop for some quick cheap shopping."
,,"Souvenirs, bric a brac etc",3.0,,If your looking for not so expensive souvenirs then lucky plaza is the place to be. Also here you can find items that are not readily available in expensive stores around the orchard road area.
,,One big mess,2.0,,This place has lots of Philipino shops. The place is rather messy and difficult to navigate. This mall is a little out of place along Orchard Road.
,,Paid for GST,1.0,,Be careful when you are asking phone price there..the price they told maybe is before added GST..so end up u need paid for it..it is more expensive than outside after adding GST and export charge..
,,"A taste of the ""old"" Singapore",5.0,,"We loved Lucky Plaza and came back a couple of times to complete our Singapore shopping experience. Don't expect high end goods. If you're paying an extremely cheap price then OBVIOUSLY the goods are not genuine. We loved the vibe and being able to barter, it's so nice to see one ""old style"" shopping plaza still functioning on Orchard Road. Go there and lap it up before it gets replaced by another high end, sanitised shopping mall exactly like all the others along the strip. Good massage and nail shops, the shoes are decent quality and CHEAP (try D&G) and the souvenir shops are awesome! Go during the week when it's not so busy, or expereince the real vibe on a Sunday when it's CRAZY busy. LOVED IT!"
,,Got a SCREAM by a Shop Attendant,2.0,,"i looked for a cover for my mobile phone, i asked one of shops there. They said they didn't have it at the moment and they would take it from the storage room. I asked for the price, they said, it was 20 Singapore Dollars. I was shocked, in Kuala Lumpur, i could get it for only 20 RM (6 SGD). I talked to them i was just asking. I walked out the shop and the man was screaming to me with Chinese language furiously."
,,Good Luck,1.0,,Very difficult to do shopping here at Lucky Plaza. The prices and quality of products are questionable. I bought a simple mobile phone cover S4 sealed plastic package with correct label. When i unpacked its turn out to be an S3 model! I wont waste time here. Not fun.
,,Cheap finds!,3.0,,"I like buying my souvenirs at the stores found at the gound floor of Lucky Plaza. We were able to buy more than 20 bars of dark chocolate (with the Merlion on the wrapper) to give to officemates and family back home. There are also cheap cloth bags with ""I love Singapore"", etc on it. Money changers are also numerous in this mall."
,,Stay Away from Cyber Jip,1.0,,"Bought a wide angle lens on the basis I would take it back to the hotel where I would try it on my camera. It was completely useless so took it straight back for a refund.....no such luck, they refused to refund the money. We ended up calling the police but they could not make a ruling.
Agree, my fault for accepting his word....never again.
Leaves a very bad impression of shopping in Singapore but hope this may save the next person who considers shopping there. Remember the name CYBER JIP.... They are on the second floor shop 02-978"
,,Uncomfortable Place To Visit At All,1.0,,"Do not visit on weekend, the place is very-very-very crowded with foreign workers (mostly Philippinos). We can't hardly walk around or checking the items on the showcase. It would better to visit on weekdays."
,,Megatronics photo will make you go bankrupt,1.0,,"I bought a PS4 at Megatronics photo at Lucky plaza which costed 689 Singaporian, then the staff started bringing out weird accessories, includong the charging station which normally costs 52 singapore dollars, buy the shop charged it at 400 singaporian dollars! And including all the other useless accessories altogether it costes 2132 Singapore dollars! I was outraged and turned away the deal, until they told me I had to pay for the items that they have opened for inspection. In the end I had no choice and I had to buy it.

Here is a note to everybody:

NEVER EVER GO NEAR

M E G A T R O N I C S P H O T O"
,,Shopping at Lucky Plaza,1.0,,"Be very , very careful when shopping at Lucky Plaza, especially the Camera shops. My husband and I visited APO Foto & Electronics and wanted to buy a wide angle lens for my self and my sons Nikon camera. We bought two for $450 and were told the brand was a reputable, worlds best Japanese brand. Turns out the lens are KNOCK OFFS and we were told a lot of lies and were cheated . DO NOT BUY FROM THESE LIARS AND CHEATS!!!b Does not feel very nice to give my son his Xmas pressie and he then has to embarrassingly tell us that this is not the real thing. I hope these mongrels do not sleep at night and KARMA works on them. I am not normally this negative and regularly write positive reviews but I want to warn fellow travelers."
,,No lucky plaza for mobile phone!,5.0,,"Js two days ago my Fren came back wit the same incident.. She asked me how they actually Calcute (while she shown me the receipt), since I know account abt..
When got the receipt we straight away know the shop is cheating'
The story like something at first he phone was $460 n final when my Fren swap nets $693!!!
The next day went to the shop to ask for itemize and was tease by the seller.. Worst scolded back by the seller..
Pls pls .. Do buy electronic from appropriate shop.."
,,Good Local Shopping,4.0,,"Look I know there are some bad reviews but take it for what it is, a locals shopping area. If your looking for top notch things at a steal don't go. If your looking for some good bargains, it's a great mall. There are some good buys on limited items just like any store. This is a mall that most of the local workers shop at, don't go on Sunday unless you really like LARGE crowds. It has a great hawker stall area in the basement."
,,"Megatronics Photo, Lucky Plaza - Gangster shop",1.0,,"I was at this shop, Megatronics Photo, B1-89, Lucky Plaza. I asked for the price of a handphone and the man quoted me a ridiculous price. I handed him back the phone, thanked him and told him I need to consider. The man started scolding bad words and said if I don't have monies, should not even ask. I was shocked at his gangster behavior and this man even threaten to beat us up. We were polite and yet this man hurled vulgarities at us and even challenge us to call the police.

,,"Electronics Scam, cheats & fraud at Lucky Plaza",1.0,,"I was in Singapore a couple of days back. I went to Lucky Plaza on Orchard Road. There is a shop in the basement named ""Sirus Electronics Pte Ltd"" address of the shop is B1-60 Lucky Plaza.

On 30th October, 2013 the shopkeeper at ""Sirus Electronics Pte Ltd."" offered to sell me an iPhone 5s for SGD $950. I agreed to buy two iPhone5s from him for SGD $1900. The shopkeeper put the two iPhone5s on the table & I asked him to open the box & show me the phones. He said he can open the box only after I pay him $1900. I gave him cash $1900 for the two phones.

After showing me the two iPhone in the box & taking $1900 from me the shopkeeper said I have to pay additional SGD $798 ($399 for each iPhone). I asked him why and he replied $199 for each iPhone is for the international warranty & $200 the touch ID. This did not even make sense as we do not have to pay for warranty & touch ID feature of the iPhone separately.

I told the shopkeeper that he should have told me this before but he did not listen & kept arguing for about half an hour when I asked him to return my money. He refused to give me my money back & insisted I pay him $798 more for the phones. I told him I do not have more money to pay him. He said then I can only take one iPhone for $1400. I tried to reason with him but he would not listen to anything. Finally as he was not returning my money or giving me both iPhone I had to agree to taking one iPhone for $1400 from him. He returned me $500 out of $1900 I paid him.The shopkeeper did not give me any receipt.

I called the police & reported the phone incident the next morning as my cell was not wokring while i was in the shop.

Lesson: DO NOT BUY ANYTHING AT LUCKY PLAZA SINGAPORE & Simlim Square shops are also the same I looked on the internet."

So at the one of last vendors , we saw it & he asked. I told him they ALL speak our language, Hokkien, stop asking in english.

It is very sad when you visit Singapore for the first time and you discover a wonderful place called Lucky Plaza, Orchard Road, Singapore and choose a shop called PLAY ELECTRONICS to purchase some items. Only to find out that we were completely OVERCHARGED. We realised this before departing from Singapore and went back to the shop and demanded our money back, but the two salepersons refused to do anything about it. We said that we would report them to the police and put their photo on facebook, and they said 'go right ahead' they did not care. I would advise all visitors NOT TO SHOP at PLAY ELECTRONICS. It has left us with a very negative experience of Singapore."

Its the Lucky Plaza, Orchard Road !!!

Firstly the building has its own web site and they list all the people who have shops and businesses in the building. This means that a little research before you visit, will mean that you have a very good idea of where to go, what you are looking for.

I was on a very short time schedule, so I just found the place, went up and down and then realised that I need to put a day aside for this place ! I kid you not, there are so many places to see in the building that you will need all day !

I cannot list all the businesses that you can visit, but go to the web site and see them, and work out what you need.... but this is the place to go !"
,,Iconic shopping mall of Singapore,4.0,,This is one of the very unique shopping malls in the south east asia.

Not forgetting it's the only shopping mall that allows bargaining. Sorry for grammatically errors.
,,MEGATRONICS @ Lucky Plaza is a big FRAUD!,1.0,,"My friend just got robbed of his money there when he bought a Sony PSP 3006. They gave the item for a lower price compared to other stores and offered him to unlock the item so it can be used outside singapore. They made him pay the warranty and all sorts of accessories that normally goes with the item for free and he ended up paying 900+ sgd for a 200+ psp. They gave a receipt showing each item without the price for each, only the total price. Big time disappointment since Singaporeans are known for being law abiding and discipline that it made tourists feel safe. But shops like Megatronics make you think otherwise."

Even called the police, they came but explained they couldn't do anything about it since there was a receipt! Imagine!!! Of course we were all so angry and disappointed , even ruined the rest of the day for us---- the police should do something about this electronic scammers here at Lucky Plaza, they're ruining Singapore's impeccable image as a safe, great place to go to and shop."
,,Cheating by J Star Mobile Electronic 304 Orchard Rd #B1-87 Lucky Plaza S(238863),1.0,,"Recently, on the 31st July 2013, I went together with my friend went to this particular store, J Star Mobile, to look for a phone particularly Samsung Note II. After canvassing from the stalls, I ended up at STAR MOBILE (B1 #87) because they offered the best price of $550 for the Samsung Note II unit and $10 for the screen protector. I agreed to get the unit primarily of the price offered. The sellers, 3 chinese guys, asked me if I can by cash but I said I could only pay by Nets. Then they asked me to hand them my Nets card, asked me to sign on their receipt, but I found it fishy because they kept asking me to sign the paper without writing the price on their receipt. When I asked why wasn't the price written on it, they kept telling me to just sign first and they will just staple with my nets receipt. After he swiped my card and I entered my pin immediately, trusting that he will honour his words of charging me $560. Only when I asked for the Nets receipt, I saw and realized that he keyed a different amount which was $826.22 which was $266.22 higher than the agreed amount! I was very furious and I confronted the sellers. Initially they said that I the agreed amount was exclusive of the registration fee and 9% GST, but I found it ridiculous because I know that our GST is 7%!

I asked them how could they do such a thing to cheat their customers in broad daylight and their reply to me was ""We're doing a business what. You are also cheating yourself by buying such a cheap phone"". So I replied to the indonesian chinese guy that I trusted them but they replied me ""We don't trust you, you're not my friend"". I wanted an immediate refund and passed them back the manual receipt given to me, but they took the receipt and wrote a comment to protect their backside saying ""customer agreed and signed the receipt"". They were very rude and cocky and they told me to call the police saying ""Let's see what the police can do for you"". This is OUTRAGEOUS.

So I urge everyone who goes to lucky plaza, PLEASE DO NOT BUY any item(s) from them as they seem very professional in conning people. Don't trust whatever price they quote you because there's lame hidden charges etc etc. They will trap you into their net until you're left with no choice but to take the gadget."

,,Travelers and Singaporean don't get conned,1.0,,"DO NOT BUY any thing from G Tech Mobile at Lucky Plaza #B1-51. They are NOT honest retailer. My dad bought a memory chip from the shop and the salesman who attend to him charged a sky high price for the memory chip. They charged my dad for a Kingston 32 GB memory chip for Sin $105 and actually this product only cost sin $45. My dad knew that he is being overcharged after he saw another shop selling the exactly same product at $45.

When my dad asked for refund, the salesman is unwillingly to refund and said 'even you go to CASE, police or court doesn't matter, we still will not refund'. And the worst thing is that, the salesman said 'going to CASE and to police is very common experience in Lucky Plaza!

OMG, it is so embrassing that in Singapore we still have such shop practicing unethical selling! Hope this review can help many tourists when they come to Singapore to shop especially when they are shopping in small shops who do not have standard pricing."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Well worth a visit on Orchard Road and well located near the Orchard Road MRT. Very good selection of Pinoy and Indonesian food at affordable rates. Was impressed with the currency exchange. Costs 20 cents to use the toilet. Can be very crowded on Sunday's and good people watching opportunities. Be wary about purchasing electronic equipment from some shops within the plaza. Overall I rate the excellent breakfast, $2.80 SGD, will return when I return."
,,Megatronics Photo - Phone Shop is a professional Scammer.,1.0,,"I walked around lucky plaza basement shop yesterday 4th June 2013 around 1230h-1300h to look for a dual sim phone.Then I found the phone in Megatronics Photo Shop. The phone was galaxy y duo, the first offer was 170$ so I decline and I have told them that I will walk around first then come back if I can decide. The offer was decreased into 155$ so I decided to buy the phone then. After I gave the payment they asked me about the other charges for the tax which is 7% with the payment of the screen protector. So all in all I have to pay the amount 175$.She asked for my Singapore ic for registration. Later on the counter lady said that I need to pay with the openline service which cost 265$ and she has made another receipt for that. I was terribly shocked for the additional payment as the cost is too high than the cost of the phone. And it seems like they are putting me in a bad state pressuring me, as if I did some crime because I certainly refused the openline payment which I am not well informed of the particular payment that I need to do so.Theycwere telling that we are on cctv camera for the gst tax and they can report this behavior to my employer as my employer is the guarantor. I called my friend and asked for an advice and the lady counter became angry telling me that I am a stubborn costumer for asking an opinion for a friend.They've tried to forced me to pay the amount of 265$ but I refused and have insisted that I dont have that amount either.The lady decreased the amount from 265$ to 80$..still I decline to pay as I only have 25$ in my purse (luckily I did not show my atm and habe not withdrawn or brought a big amount of cash).I keep on telling them ""why do I have to pay this amount?"".. This
is very strange, unreasonable
..I want to report this case. I stayed in the shop for more than 30mins. And the choice of solution that they have made is to pay the 265$ (to come back when i get the money so that i can get the phone) or to give the remaining 25$ in my purse and give the ordered phone. So I have decided to just give the 25$. I have paid 200$ in total. Before that they have also given me another choices to change the model of the phone into cheaper one so that I can pay the openline payment and to cancel the order i must pay 50$. I gave them a choice to give the cancellation fee of 50$ and to give my money back without the phone but they refused to do it.

So nuisance this store retailer. All electronic seller in lucky plaza are scammers so we must be very careful not to give our card details, etc."

,,Lucky Plaza - Electronics Scam!!!,1.0,,"I recently visited Singapore with my family. We were in Singapore for 2 days only and happened to visit Lucky Plaza on one of the days. It was not on our itinerary, but after spending the morning at the Botanical Gardens and then at the ION Orchard Mall, we crossed the road to look for some restaurants for lunch. Unfortunately, we ended up the Lucky Plaza (Orchard Road, Opposite ION Orchard mall). Most of the shops seemed to offer good discounts on shoes, purses, mementos etc. It’s an underground market so we were in the Basement when we came across an electronics shop (JW Connection PTE Ltd – B1, 111). My brother inquired about the price of iPod Nano. The girl said it’s for $180 but she’ll give it to us for $ 160. We told her we’d like to buy 2 and would there be a discount if we buy 2 instead of 1. She said no, the price will remain $ 160 per piece. She asked for the money and said she needs to get the 2 pieces from another shop. So we handed her $320 (mistake # 1) and she went out with the money. There was also a fat ugly man in the shop who sat playing games on his phone. She returned shortly with the two pieces and asked if we need International warranty on the two products. We asked her if there will be additional charges. She said yes. We asked her how much and what’s the validity of the warranty. She said its $ 19.9 for 1 year and same price for 2 years as well. I remember correctly I inquired again if it’s the same price for 2 years and she said yes. So we told her we’ll also take the international warranty for both pieces for 2 years. She asked for my brother’s passport to get a photocopy. She said she needed a copy to register the products in his name online. So we gave her the passport (mistake #2) and she returned with the photocopy and returned the passport to my brother. She went to a desktop hidden from our view and spent 5 minutes there. We were under the assumption that she is registering the products online for the warranty. She came to us and asked my brother to sign a receipt for $ 19.9 warranty and also another receipt of the total payable amount. She didn’t come to us but stopped a little away so that my brother had to go to her to sign the two receipts. This ensured that we didn’t read them and my brother signed them without carefully reading them (mistake #3). She disappeared behind the computers for a few minutes more and then returned. She said the products are registered and asked us to pay the remaining amount (which we assumed was $ 19.9 *2, since we had already paid $320). On the calculator she showed us a sum of $900 and something. I thought it was some mistake and asked her about it. She said that the warranty amount is $ 19.9 per month, so for 24 months it is$ 477.6 and for 2 products it is $955.2. We were shocked to hear this. At no time she had mentioned that the amount is per month and not the total amount for a 2 year warranty. In fact when I had asked her categorically if the warranty sum is same for 1 year and 2 years, she had said yes. I understood plainly that she is lying. The ugly man on the video game now turned his attention towards us and produced the receipts that my brother had signed. One of them said $19.9 and a small ‘per month’ had been added to it, probably after my brother signed it. The other one showed that we agree to pay the total amount of $1275.2 (320 + 955.2). The figure looked manipulated as the ‘1’ was very close to the $ sign and nowhere in the receipts were the figures mentioned in words. They had stapled these receipts with the copy of my brother’s passport. As the argument continued, another hefty man walked into the shop. He was heavily tattooed and clearly there to intimidate us. It was futile to argue. The ugly man kept insisting that we signed the receipt and agreed to pay the amount. The products are registered so we can’t go back on the sale. We didn’t even ask for our $320 back because we knew that’s not going to happen. I knew it was a scam and we’ll have to settle. The ugly man said that we’ll need to settle the issue by paying the money. We kept arguing. Why would we pay $955 as warranty for products worth only $320? Finally, the ugly man said that we can settle at $540 ($270 per piece). I made a counter offer by typing the figure of 400 on the calculator. He said $450 and let’s settle it. We were stuck. We paid the extra money ($130), checked our products, tore up the receipts of the inflated prices and got the hell out of there.
We got fleeced out of $130 and more than that it was a very unpleasant experience. After reading online I realized that the exact same thing has happened to many international tourists. Apparently, a lot of shops in Lucky Plaza are running this kind of scam. In fact, people who refused to pay up have been threatened with force. People who made big purchases have lost even 1000s of dollars. I’m posting a photo of the shop to warn tourists about this shop in particular. Avoid Lucky Plaza! Also read similar reports about Sim Lim Square, although I haven’t been there personally. I hope this post is able to help some people avoid this horrible place."

When i want to cancel the deal, he asked me to pay SGD400 because he already tear the hphone box. End up, he reduce the price to SGD1412.

,,A Place for Souvenir Bargain Shopping,4.0,,"We didn't go to Lucky Plaza for electronics for we haven't ever tried buying our electronics abroad. We did go for souvenir shopping - postcards that costs SGD 1.00 to SGD 2.00 would only cost SGD 0.50 here though not all the postcard designs are available. I guess I do shop for small souvenir items only, I'm afraid.

It is indeed a sort of flea market were you can get the best bargain like 3 boxes of chocolates for SGD 10.00 (but we didn't get to buy those) and other mini souvenir items like writing pens, keychains, shirts, bags and the like.

The foodcourt would afford you a good budget meal (that's how we call it in Manila - reasonably priced healthy food). For SGD 3.00 to SGD 4.00 you already have a good meal though the drinks are not yet included. We had Hainanese Chicken Meal, Roasted Chicken Meal and Noodles for us - 4 adults.

I would have craved for Filipino food since I saw the meat being served at the Filipino kiosk or corner is much meatier and generous than what we would have in Manila. But we opted to try something different.

It's an overall good bargain souvenir shopping experience at Lucky Plaza."
,,For bargain hunters,3.0,,"I wasn't aware of the negative reviews on Lucky Plaza not until i opened the site to make my contribution this morning. Our hotel was located along Orchard Road and i wanted to purchase some souvenir items on our last day in the city. What i can say is that i bought a lot of stuff like bags, ball pens and trinkets from the shops and i found the prices very reasonable. It helped that they had the prices displayed already near the items so that there was no reason to haggle or ask for discounts anymore. I was able to finish my shopping in a jiffy. Of course, though they frowned at the idea of checking every item (claiming that they observe quality control and all items have been previously checked by them), i went through the motion just the same. They asked me to pay first before trying or checking the product which i promptly complied. Except for one ball pen that did not write (which they replaced), every product proved to be in good condition. I bought a total of seven ladies' shopping bags with Singapore logos and every single one had zippers that were in perfect condition. The other store where i bought the fancy necklaces prohibited the shoppers from trying them on but i inspected all of the three to see if the chains were not broken and the locks were in good condition. As a shopper, i always check on the items before i leave the shop and i don't buy electronic gadgets abroad for fear of scam plus the apprehension that the warranties may not cover them once i reach home."

If they informed me this situation earlier, I wont buy the phone, much. cheper if i buy in my ountry. They are big liar. This also happened to my fiends 5 years ago.

,,Do not patronise Lucky Plaza or Sim Lim Square,1.0,,"I'm a local Singaporean just doing my bit to help tourists visiting our city.

There are so many news reports of tourists getting scammed into paying ridiculous amounts of money for items. A lot of people come to these two places to buy things like cameras or mobile phones...but a good majority of the shops that sell these stuff tend to be scammers and they especially target foreigners.

If you are a foreigner and you want to buy something, please consult a local acquaintance first, or do your research online.

i personally see no reason to patronise Lucky Plaza at all. You can still go to Sim Lim to buy computer related stuff but you need to know from where. (never get anything from the first 3 levels) Check out local forums for this kind of info.

Hope this little writeup can help prevent unfortunate situations. Cheers"

I ask him why the big difference.( Maybe new edition, an extra bag,... You know... whatever...) And he answered, ""go downstairs and buy it. Better make sure it's the real deal."" And then I just asked him what about the lens? He didnt answer because he is a Jerk. Then this older guy came, but also rudely wanted me out of the store. So I try to explain that I am not saying I wont buy, but when I spend 3000$ I want to know what I'm buying, I ask about the lens again. "" Go downstairs and we dont have"" I angrily left this store to never come back. Now at home on the internet I see many bad reviews about this store. That must mean something."

It's so ridiculous and the worst trick in the world.Beware and don't buy anything from this store. I try to cancel guarantee but he always has a trick to refuse. Finally, i want to cancel this purchase but i have already paid $300 and he refuse to give me back my money.

Then i call a police, he came to the store and then G tech give me back only $250. He rob me $50 for gadget that i never i bought. Police let the incident and seemed to protect the store that I was robbed.

G tech mobile ihe is a liar and the government should be concerned with the future of its tourism by closing the store. I demanded that the store was closed as well as worsen the image of singapore.Police have closed their eyes to this criminal activity, they should be fired."
,,"“Never Buy anything at Megaelite Mobile, Lucky Plaza B1-53 Singapure”",1.0,,"No words can describe how unscrupulous this Megalite is. I repeat DO NOT purchase anything from this shop even if they quote you a lower price.

One of my customer friend, a Philippino, paid $430 for a Samsung Galaxy Tab. However, due to some reasons, she was coxed or lead to agree to download games, antivirus software ( does Tab requires antivirus? First time i hear this in my life!!!) & including their service fees of an astonishing S$290, the total bill was S$1020!

I think it was due to fear as the friend is only a young school girl, she signed on the ''invoice beside the price of $1020, but there was no breakdown of the tab prices & the downloads except a total lumpsumprice. The friend explained that there was no final price when she signed on that piece of paper.

When we told them that the girl has really no money to pay, how they wish to resolve this issue. But instead of giving a discount on the services made (since there werent any price list in their shop in the first place!), they refused knowing that the girl is in a rush for her flight back.

We have decided to make a report with CASE & hopefully they can assist us.

I myself is a SIngaporean and i am totally disgraced and angry with this dishoest merchants.

Please DO NOT buy anything from this shop forever!"
,,"Small prices, impossible for a tourist.",2.0,,"It's virtually impossible to shop in a place where everything is located with no apparent order.

,,A local guy's review,1.0,,Only reason why local go here is probably because of the perfume shop. I never buy electronics from here because it's a con shop. This place is filled with phillipines who are sending their money back home and bangladeshi meeting their girlfriends.
,,"Hustled at Eone Mobile Plus Pte Ltd @ Lucky Plaza, Scotts Road",1.0,,"Me and my parents went to the store hoping to look for an iPad Mini to purchase. A Thai girl helped us and told me the price was only 350 SGD. We were very happy to find an iPad that cheap! So, we decided to purchase 2.

She took us to the back and to do the paperwork. She introduced us this guy (5 ft. 6, orange, emo-flapped hair) who will do the paperwork. We BLINDLY signed the paperwork. He explained to us that we had to register the iPads to purchase before being able to claim it. He then told us to hand over our credit card (we said we would like to pay in cash instead) and a passport (which we left at home, so we gave our IDs instead), which was totalling up to 700 SGD.

He then explained to us further that we had to pay extra fees in order to get the promotion for the apps. We were shocked. The total balance for the whole thing was 2,898 SGD. I didn't know anything about this, I thought it was legit. We asked to cancel the purchase of the iPads but he said that the iPads has been already registered (they sent a fax to apple) and there is nothing we can do about it. We had to pay another extra 2,100 SGD which we didn't have on hand.

Another guy (fat, tall, wearing glasses) came in noticing our problems, worked in the same shop, we told him that we didn't have that much cash on hand. He said that what we could do is he would cancel one, and had to pay only one. Which was still about 988 SGD. He said that he would be ""generous"" enough to pay the restocking fee of the iPad since the iPad was already registered and the iPad that was registered would go to the Black Market stock.

We tried to desperately take the cash (700 SGD) from them, but they wouldn't budge. So, I wouldn't want to just leave the store knowing that they have the 700 SGD and leave with nothing in return, I agreed to pay the extra 288 SGD for the cancellation fee.

I left there with an iPad Mini (16 GB, only Wi-Fi) which I paid 988 SGD for.

The next day, we went to Far East Plaza to ask the prices for the iPad Mini. I asked about 5-6 different stores and they all said the prices were 440-500 SGD and they would register for FREE. They also said there was no such thing as ""promotion bundle"" for the apps. I was mad, very mad.

What I would like to tell you guys is that DON'T ever shop for ELECTRONICS there, the whole plaza you would get hustled. You can shop for other things such as perfumes (second-grade by the way, they added water, but they still offer a decent price), clothes, and food, but DON'T ever buy the electronics.

Would I would like to see is for the Registrar of Companies to shut ALL Electronics store there and would like to see them in Jail.

From,
a Foreigner that got hustled.

P.S. I couldn't sleep the next day and I was traumatized by this experience."

,,Worth a visit to experience the old fashioned atmosphere and small shops,4.0,,"Lucky Plaza is a style of shopping mall popularised in the 1970s in Singapore.

It's situated in a prime position on Orchard Road, and it's a large multi-storey mall comprising a very large number of small shops- offering a multiplicity of goods and services: clothes and tailoring, electronics, phones and cameras, money changers and so on.

It's the place where you can go to buy a used Rolex watch, or have a foot massage.

You'll find a large number of enthusiastic traders- keen to lure you into their shop!

You might find a bargain, but I'm sure you'll have some entertaining fun!"

,,J Star Mobile Electronic 304 Orchard Rd #B1-87 Lucky Plaza S(238863),2.0,,"Lucky Plaza sells an assortment of products including electronics and souvenirs, however you have to be very careful as some retailers can try and 'con' you into buying something that may not be what it seems. J Star Mobile Electronic at Lucky Plaza B1-87 is one such store. Please be very wary when buying from here especially when you buy a sim card from their store. They do not follow the correct and legal procedure in registering you as the owner of the phone number they allocate to you. This then means that your Sim card will expire 14 days from purchase and additionally if you have any problems with the Sim card the phone company that the card is from (eg Singtel) will not be able to assist you as you are not the registered owner of the Sim Card. The store assistants here are also very rude, overbearing and can get intimidating if you decide you do not want to go ahead with your purchase. Please don't hand over your money until you are absolutely sure that you want to purchase from this store. My advice is to stay away from this store and be cautious when purchasing from Lucky Plaza, especially for tourists."
,,Too many cases of cheating,1.0,,"As a Singaporean myself, i will never buy any electronic from this infamous shopping mall with too many incidents of cheating.

Police are frequently called in but little they can do. This is like MTV's Boiling Point show, except it is all true.

Best place to go for electrical item is Funan Mall but check around the prices there before you part with your money as not all shops there are honest. Same goes to Sim Lim Square, its a better place than Lucky Plaza but still 80% of the camera shops there are crooks.

Go to HWZ Forum of Singapore and ask the members there for guide on which shops to go."

,,Megaelite is an Incredible ripoff !!!!!!!,1.0,,"I took my auntie to buy a new phone at Megaelite in Lucky Plaza.

Great, so we asked Kelvin to please transfer some photos from the old phone to the new one. No problem he said and to come back in 30min.

When we returned we received a bill for SG$1064 and he said that he added various items such as: Memory stick, L/Case,Transferring of data and apparently ""upgrading done"".
Not only we didn't request for it but he never told us until when we came back and had the money on the table.

We were very shocked to get a bill for SG$1064 for something worth half of it.

Luckily I had a very quick reflex and withdrew the Money on the table took my phone and said that there is no way that we will pay more than double of what we where quoted initially!
We got into a bad argument and as a woman I was emabarassed to argue in publick about this rippoff. I waws close to call the police and still cannot believe that they tried such an obvious tactic that must repulse tourist and locals alike.

I WILL NEVER SHOP AT THE FAMOUS RIPP OFF CENTERS OF ""LUCKY PLAZA"" , ""FUNAN CENTRE"" and ""SIM LIM AGAIN"" !!! I Learned the lesson now, but am afraid that there are many more tourist that just fall into the trap and wont have the patience or means to complain or call the police."

I got so offended and I threw back with some private part as well and brought up knowing their head congress guy, insisting on getting back my 250 n cancelation from my card. Even tho I got back my money n walk out from that shop alive but it was a bad experience. Deputy was dispute not long after. so guys stay out buying stuff from lucky plaza Singapore."
,,Stay Away,1.0,,"Last week I purchased a SIM card from J Star Mobile Electronic in the basement of Lucky Plaza and was charged more than double what it should have been despite me telling them several times my exact needs.

Why SingTel permits these conmen to onsell their products at whatever price they deem fit amazes me.

Why the Singapore Tourist Board and/or govt allows these conmen to continue to trade makes me question whether Singapore really wants to encourage tourists.

I have been travelling to Singapore for more than 30 years, never been ripped off before but this incident along with other disappointing experiences this time around has left me wondering whether I'll return."
,,Robbed by Seller,1.0,,"I had a terrible experience in Lucky mall Chinatown (the store is on the first floor near the entrance door) when trying to buy an I phone 5, first the seller and I had a deal for a 16 gb I phone 5 for 950 S$ (I think it's a reasonable price, the iphone store sell 948 S$) and then when I gave him the money in cash and he had me to sign a receipt from them. Having signed the receipt from them, they refused to give the I Phone to me they said he gotta to registered first in the apple website, I refused that because I can register my I phone by myself at home and I always did it with my former I phone. The seller went upset he told me to listen to him to buy an fake additional data from Singtel for S$469 in first payment and then S$69 each month in two years, I think it's an insane so I refused that and told them the transaction is cancelled and I want my money back, the seller refused to gave back my money and he told me if I want the I phone 5 I had to pay S$1900, he wrote number 1 in the front of number 9 by himself in the receipt that I signed, I realize that I was robed that time. "" Ok I will paid that, I said, but let me see my I Phone first, after he showed the Phone near me, I snatched that and I went away from their store, they also after me and riped my bag to take the phone but I maintained that and told them to gave back my money they hit me many times but I defend myself after that they also hitted my wife and then my wife yelled for helps from the people around but they don't stop after someone set apart on us, I said "" give back my money and the bill"" they still refused that after my wife threatened to throw the i phone then they gaved back my money and the bill with said a dirty words to us. It was very shocked experience for my wife and I, but we didn't go to the police because we afraid it will took us a long time and we don't know where the police office was.
So for tourists and foreigners don't buy electronic stuff in Singapore except from reputable big stores & official store from the brands. They threat all the same things in everywhere for foreigners.
But I still have a question left in my mind, why the government of Singapore which such a wealthy and orderly country didn't do anything for this kind of seller, I think there's so much report from tourist like us everywhere."

After we gave SG$510 to the shop, they asked us to providing passport/any photo ID. We refused & the shop sales person wrote receipt & added an extra SG$290 which they claimed for unlocking the Ipad so it can be used overseas but an official Ipad store said that there is no need to unlock the Ipad to be used overseas & it's applicable in the whole Singapore. Felt unhappy & invited police to the site but nothing resolve & we couldn't get our money back so ended up of paying SG$800 for Ipad 2 which is overpriced as Ipad 3 only costs SG$860.

,,It was a terrible service for the cleaners.,1.0,,"To The Management of Asian Foods / Cleaners Management

Dear Sir/ Madam,

Im here to lodge a complaint against your service. I went down to Lucky Plaza to have our dinner yesterday (21-02-2012) at about 7.45pm after our day of work. Me n My fiancee already brought our drinks and left it on the table. Your cleaners saw we brought the drinks before we left the table to brought our foods.
Few minutes later, we went back to our table and realized our drinks are gone!!!! We ask around where there is customers were sitting next to our table, they said ""The cleaners throw away your drinks"".
We did asked your cleaners about our drinks and both of them kept denied. They even scold us a vulgar in Chinese Language in the crowd. Yes, i understand they wanna keep the food court clean but they must spare a thought for us too....
We got to waste our money again to bought another drinks again... Where is their humanity??? Where is their manners??? I was so disappointed that this kind of service do happened in our country!!!!!!!!!!
I hoped the management will do something about this and the service.Thank you."

,,DON'T SHOP AT LUCKY CENTER (level 1) in Lucky Plaza,1.0,,"I have always heard that Lucky Plaza is full of conmen and I never expected myself to be conned. We were looking around for a dSLR which was out of stock at many places and decided to try our luck there. What a mistake! We asked the price at Lucky Center (on level on, the signage has a very big SONY with Lucky Center by the left side. It is right behind the security counter. We agreed on a price and was about to pay and the salesman started hard selling his Hawkeye lens in place of a lens that we had wanted to buy, saying that it was a major discount with this bulk purchase and the performance is better. The lens looked dodgey and we didn't want them and he persisted. In the end, silly us succumbed. That night, we realised we were conned and I returned the next day to request for an exchange to the lens that I wanted. The salesman was completely rude and said I needed to pay $20 more to do an exchange when the price difference was only $10. When I protested, he insisted that he would not exchange since the receipt says so (beware! This was never told to us). Then I didn't want to waste my purchase so I requested him to honour the agreement to exchange. He upped the difference to $30 and eager to settle this, I agreed. When he took the money, he then said that I can;t return 2 items for one but instead must buy another filter for $50, which is a rip off. He didn't budge and said I can go and complain if I wanted. Extremely furious, I left without managing an exchange but luckily I got back the $30 I paid with the hawkeye lens and filter I purchased (It seemed from the feedback at this site that there could possibly be a chance I walk out with nothing!). This is an expensive lesson. I should have done my homework to understand their tactics. It's really unscrupulous. Do not fall prey to them. Best advice - don't buy anything from Lucky plaza, even if it is out of stock elsewhere!"
,,Dont buy electronic goods in G tech Mobile & Electronic Pte,1.0,,"It was my first time travelling to Singapore. I bought an iPhone 4G at G tech Mobile & Electronic Pte Ltd.

Since I had a problem with my debit card, my friend had lent her debit card to pay the phone. I was so excited about the new Phone, I didnt notice when the sales counter took 1790 $ Sing from my friend card. We realised soon after my friend got notification message from her bank informing how much money just taken from her account.

The Seller said 650 dollar just for the iphone and the rest was for 2 years guarantee, unlocking..etc. i didnt even ask them for 2 years guarantee. I asked my money back but he tried to convinced me through showing some copy receipt from previous buyers who buy the Iphone with the same price (1790 Dollars sing ), and i was convinced.

After return home, I checked in the internet and I have realised that the seller rip me off."

here i want to share my experience at this shop.. the seller cheated us.. actually i bought 1 samsung note, and he argee to give $600, and he said if we buy 2 he can gave less, just $580... so we bought 2, since 1 of my cousin also interested to that phone..then he asked for my passport (since I'm foreigner) to register to unlocked, he also asked how many years of warranty i want?

after 30 mins, i gave him $1k, he told me that the price we should pay is $2400 incl tax!!! waddahell so i asked him, why is that happening he said to unlocked cost $299, and the warranty itself is $299, and the phone..

but in the end, we paid another $2380 since we dont want to lose the $1k which is already with the bodoh, piggy boy!

p/s: to the seller i wish you and your shop to fall apart and bankrupt soon in this 2012!!! wahaha!! im sure you and your business friend will not be happy in your present and in your next life!! :p

On my return I gave it to my friend and it turned out that the only contence was a trail version of the 3P, which could be downloadet from the Internet. The full version was $ 12.50. To make the story shurt, I made en appeal to the STB,Singapore to recover my $ 300.-
after back and forward, the shop offered me to pay $ 200.- back which I refused. We then made a complaint to the Small Claims Court, which approved my claim of $ 300.- and the shop should return the money to me. They made 2 x a ""set aside request""which the first time was rejected by the court and the second time, to my surprise was grandet
and the shop only has to pay me $150.- Well, does it not leave ""food for thoughts ???
I could write a book about the procedure trying to claim something back in Singapore. For a Tourist it's impossible, it's simply too complicated. Is the government aware of the cheating which is a common happening there? They must be.

You can find all kind of shops here, also massage and money changer. Electronic shops dominated the first floor, however there is a lot of bad news and cheating happen in these shops, so recently most people will advised to to shop electronics in here.

When I agree with the price, the shoop keeper ask for the money first. I then paid $450,- wih 9 pieces of $5. The money was counted together as $450.

When I was to get the stuff that I wanted, I wasn suddenly requested to pay extra GST which summed up to $620. I thought that was crazy and I cencelled the deal and asked for the money back.

This is when the situation got out of hands.When I told them to return my money, I was only returned $00, which was 8 pieces of $50.
I tried to aurgue with the shopkeeper to return all my money, but h insisted that he had returned all my money. Bottom line, I got cheated twice. First for not returning my money and secondly, for asking me to pay GST that He never mentioned before at the initial part of the bargain.

I learnt from this experience, never shop at Lucky Plaza Singapore. Singapore is known as shopping paradise here, therefore Singapore goverment should take action to handle such shops. Otherwise, Lucky Plaza will only leave a bad scar in the face of Singapore

The proprietor then said he had to purchase it as he had now opened up the box. My son didn't have enough money and said he would have to get more. The proprietor said he couldn't leave without leaving a deposit of $100 and leave his passport so that he knew he would come back. He also asked for another $200 to unlock the phone, which is illegal to sell a locked phone in Singapore. My son said he didn't have his passport but left the $100 and came back to the hotel to get me. We returned to the shop and the proprietor refused to refund the money. I told him that he had acted illegally and unethically towards a young person and I would be following this up with the authorities. we then went down to a shop called U-First Departmental Store where they sold us the same phone for 100 dollars cheaper and the staff were extremely helpful and nice.

,,Lucky Plaza; should be called UNLUCKY Plaza.,1.0,,"Singapore was the last place I could think of where I could ever be cheated. But I was VERY wrong. I went to this shop out of curiosity, they had the logo of SONY as the name of their shop,so i thought they were really genuine. I have still have their card with me, the name is LUCKY Centre(which I think should be called UnLucky Centre for tourists & buyers that is) it's located on the 2nd flr. immediately on the right side of the escalator going up if you entered from the side next to TANGS. Actually here's the store no. #02-88,at least that's what it says on the card. I just never want what happened to me to happen to anybody else. It's just very unfortunate that I never came upon this testimonials before I went to that Unlucky, crooks & thieves infested place.
I came in to this shop just to buy the leather case for my SONY NEX-5, but I ended up paying for this blasted hawkeye lens that you attach on top of the lens which I already have. I must have been very gullible because I believed all they've told me. But the reason why I ended up buying it was because they took my credit card as it was still out because I just paid for the leather casing, & just swiped it and charged SGD150 again for I don't know why, because I wasn't even buying anything I was just looking at the things they were showing me. I don't know if there is such a thing as hypnotism or i don't know what, because these crooks eventually charged me again SGD170 for the lens that they finally convinced me into buying. I ended up getting charged SGD320 for the lens which I will later on find out to be fake & 400% overpriced.
When I came into my senses the next day I was trying to return to them what they've sold me,for I went to other shops & found out that the very same item I bought was only SGD70 with a free memory card. But they told me that they have a NO RETURN NO EXCHANGE policy. Which is just unbelievable.
So, I left the shop & went to the information counter of (Un)Lucky plaza and there I found a mother & daughter who had just been cheated SGD800 for a phone they just bought, the same as the experiences & stories written here previously.
I just can't believe how can people do something like this to unknowing and innocent tourists. well, what goes around comes around, as these crooks are chinese, I'm sure they also believe in karma. It will inevitably fall upon them for sure.

So please, if you can, just stay as FAR AWAY as possible from this dirty, wretched place."
,,A case of buyer beware,1.0,,"On a stopover in Singapore on our return journey from Europe to Australia we decided to check out camera prices. We stopped to look in the first camera shop we saw that was located in Lucky Plaza at the front on Orchard Road. Next minute we were approached by a very pushy salesman, who, after we explained what we were looking for, produced a Coolpix L120 Nikon camera. We were thinking about getting a SLR type camera, but he convinced us that this paticular camera is much better. The price started off, according to him, around $1200 Singapore dollars, and about half an hour later,at great sacrifice to himself so he said, sold it to us for $1020 , with a camera case and lens cover thrown in. We had no idea how the prices of digital cameras have dropped over the past few years and thought we'd got a good deal until we returned to Australia to discover that we could have bought the same camera here for around $300 Australian(approx $360 Singapore).
. We would like to warn other travellers to not make the same mistake as us as it appears this shop is not the only one in Lucky Plaza that is scamming the unwary."

,,Rude behaviour by Prestige Electronics louts at Lucky Plaza,1.0,,"I too had a bad experience with the louts who run Prestige Electronics in the basement of Lucky Plaza. On the advice of a salesman from the Sony Style Showroom in WISMA Atria I went to Lucky Plaza looking for a USB cable for a PSP. The Sony Style salesman told me that the price would be around S$ 10 to 15. One chubby lout got the USB cable from another shop and told me that it costed S$ 39. I told him that I was told that the price was only S$ 10 to 15 and the lout rudely told me to go and buy it from there. I told him to speak politely to me and he started asking me if I wanted to fight and started to speak rudely to me. I was very angry and I said that I would complain regarding their shop and the guys just laughed and said that nothing could be done to them. I then proceeded to take a picture of their shop using my camera phone and one of the louts rushed and tried to stop me from taking the picture. I told him that I was outside his shop and if he touched my phone then he would pay a heavy price and then the lout went back inside the shop.

I then went to the Singapore Tourist Board and tried to lodge a complaint but since I am a resident of Singapore I was asked to lodge my complaint with CASE. However since I had no transaction with them I am not able to lodge a complaint with CASE. Anyway I hope that people will read this review and stay away from Lucky Plaza and the louts at Prestige Electronics."

,,The worst place in Singpore for shopping,1.0,,"On Saturday, 16th Oct 2010, I accompany my friend to buy iPhone 4 in Lucky Plaza. Before deciding to buy the phone, we checked several shops and found one that the retailer talking nicely with us. We asked him about the price for iPhone 4 factory unlock, so that we can use with any carrier anywhere. The initial price was S$1050. To make sure, we asked him many time to confirm that the phone is officially unlocked. When we decided to buy with that price, the saga began.

It was another guy in the shop who did the registration. He took my friend passport and opened the iPhone box, and seated in front of a computer. My friend went near him and had a look at what he wrote down on the computer screen. The guy scolded him out and told him to wait until the process finished. A moment later the bad guy called him back to verify if his name and passport number had been written correctly in the registration form. This guy also read him a few more thing on the screen for a few second. Well, now the registration was completed, and it was time to pay.

Now it was time to deal with the first guy with whom we had talked about price. He asked money from my friend and my friend gave him S$1050. Then he counted and started to write a receipt by writing down my friend name and passport number. He asked my friend to verify and sign. Later on, he listed down the items and then he asked for extra charge of more than S$1000 for the SIM unlocked and SIM card cutter. It took us more than 2 hours to fight against something that we were supposed to pay, but in order to end the saga so that we could move on to other part of Singapore, we agreed to pay him S$100 more.

It is a big lesson for us we learned from Singapore."

How dumb was I? I went in to buy a camera bag and instead bought a Tamron 17-50mm lens costing me well over S$300 over what I should have paid. I was completely caught out by the charming salesman. As I was with an Australian friend, the salesman disarmed us completely by talking about his time in Melbourne, and his religious connections there! Smooth. Then he steamrolled me into buying it by taking my card and charging an additional S$60 dollars for a filter where I know normally costs only S$20, I should have realised then, but I was so happy with the purchase, I was completely fleeced. It was literally only when I got back to China that I realised how much I had overpaid.

The sales person was smart enough for not giving me an itemised bill instead just the total bill. Hence, not able to fight for it. only realised it when I got home. I must say it was partly my fault for not checking properly.

He then said he had the latest PSP 3000 but would have to pay an extra $70-$80SD for it, on top of that he said we needed to have a modified chip put in so that games purchased in Australia or elsewhere would be compatible, we could only get this done for 'free' if we paid for a package - to have 15 games installed for $150SD - some games new, most old. I had handed over the money and preceeded to read the back of the PSP box... he then got all nervous and quickly said ""..oh I can give you back the $80SD as I didn't have the PSP 3000 in the black colour you wanted so this is the 2000. It was only because i started reading the back of the package and looking at the back of the PSP we were purchasing that he owned up to the fact that we were about to pay for the latest version when in fact he had only given us the PSP 2000 - totally fraudulent!
I then found out from a great games store in the new orchard plaza shopping centre that the PSP's or nintendo DS are complatible in any country and did not need any type of modification chip...this store worker also said that both the PSP2000 and PSP3000 were equally priced.

What really pissed me off was that, I did bargain him down to not a bad price, even though i payed for some mystery modification chip, but I dont think he got as good a deal as he could of. After I gave the guy at lucky plaza the money, he tried to get me to purchase accompanying goods, such as screen protectors, cases etc, i adamantly said NO...he then said I had to pay an extra $60-$80SD for GST....I told him he could dream on and that when i asked for the price of the goods, i expect it to be inclusive of GST - A total price, as other shop dealers would quote. You dont quote a certain price, accept the money, box the goods and then ask for more money cos you realised you could have cheated the customer some more, or because you didnt make any other product sales!

We were also quoted $79SD for PSP game NBL 2K 2010, another store in lucky plaza quoted us $69SD and we knew that was still to much, they didnt even want to bargain. We had already seen it in Orchard plaza shopping centre at a viable games store for $45SD...what a difference hey!!

Do you homework, check prices and labels of products before buying anything from Lucky plaza...maybe we the customers can get a win out of those scheming pigs."
,,"Do Not Shop at Lucky Plaza Singapore, they are ripoffs",1.0,,"In August 2009, at ""Digital Specialists B1 147"" we asked to buy an Apple iPhone and were shown a device which we were told was an Apple iPhone. The merchant said it was a 32GB and the cost was AUD$798 after GST refund. He also said 2 were better than one and said he could supply the second unit for AUD$450. We agreed but he put SGD$2061 on the invoice and the credit card docket. Later that day we told him that there was an overcharge of AUD$344 on the invoice. After discussions, he made out a handwritten credit note for SGD$200 and said that was it but he never processed the credit note. We got our credit card provider to process it from our copy.

But, after leaving Singapore, we checked the items and discovered the devices were only MP5 Players, not iPhones, deliberate fraudulent deception. We were ripped off.
They also operate under the name ""Telezone"". Be warned, do not enter Lucky Plaza."
,,Thinking twice,3.0,,"I bought a few camera accessories here, and after checking out the prices of the DSLR bodies, I was quite surprised at the low prices. After reading the horror stories of some reviewers here, now I'm thinking twice about going back there for major purchases. Had similar experiences Shim Lim where everything's ok while you inquire and confirm you're buying, then things go downhill when the actual transaction starts. Looks like that's the standard operating procedure of most shop operators- lure, bait and burn.

Why does this attitude still prevail in this first world Asian country? Lucky Plaza is really cool for the variety of shops, & merchandise- and the rates are usually very good too. I hope the Tourism authority does something to curb these scammers. Just be very careful and thorough when you shop there, especially for expensive electronic items."
,,Cheated at Lucky Plaza,1.0,,My friend and I got cheated ropyally here by a shop owner called Veekay of Yeoh Tat Trading at Lucky Plaza. We had settled for a DS with all accessories and paid for it. When we went to collect it in the evning everything was not given to us and this guy denied everything and made us pay $ 120/- more. This is more exopensive than if I had bought it anywhere else. Besides he started abusing us and our children for no reason. I would advise all travellers to stay away from Lucky Plaza and do not give your credit card to any shop as they are all crooks here.
,,Cheated by Electronic Shop in Lucky Plaza SIngapore,1.0,,"My friend and I got a very bad experience with the shop ( Prestige Electronics Pte. Ltd. ), located in Basement 1, Unit 67 (#B1-67) of Lucky Plaza Shopping Mall in Singapore.

We are about to buy two 16gb iPhone 3G, what the chubby sales guy initially quoted for the price of the unlocked iPhones is SGD750. Once we agreed to buy the phones, he asked for our cards and work permits and immediately charged our cards with SGD833 each, according to him the additional SGD83 is for the GST which we can refund in the airport since we are foreigners.

After that, he asked that he will install applications, such as the 3.0 software for iPhone, and went somewhere upstairs. We waited about 45 mins and once we was back, he swiped again our cards, this time charging for SGD788 each for the applications, which he installed, and in which he DID NOT IN ANY WAY INFORM US ABOUT THE HIDDEN CHARGES. Also, when we asked the chubby guy why he’s swiping our cards again, he said it was for warranty purpose, which obviously not!

So total charges on the purchase amounts to SGD3,242! My friend and I argued that we were cheated but the two men in the shop (who both seem like Singaporean locals) were firm in the price they deviously quoted. Seemed like they really know how to argue in this kind of situations and really experts in cheating customers.

I took pictures of the shop, but the old uncle (who seems to be the owner of the shop) threatened me that he will break the phone I’m using in taking pictures.

I was only able to take 3 pictures out of fear for his threat and for the security of my friend and I.

Since I was trembling while taking picture, the only clear image is the name of the shop (Prestige Electonics Pte. Ltd), and the other two are blurry and the sellers even made it a point to hide their faces in the camera. Also, my friend and I took a picture of the actual receipt, which has lots of erasures and another proof of trickery.

Our BANK CARDS AND WORK PERMITS are with them, so in the end we just agreed to get one iphone amounting to SGD1,621! They said that they won’t issue any refund and won’t give our permits and cards, if we don’t proceed with buying even just the one iphone.

Imagine our horror paying SGD1621 for just one 16gb iPhone 3G! The money for all we care is our hard-earned money. It may be small for other people, but to us ,it’s a fruit of the sweat and the pain we endure of not seeing our families abroad that often, just to hardly work in Singapore.

These dealers in Lucky Plaza are really into tricking customers.

It’s ironic how my friend, who’s into Public Relations Company for Singapore Tourism Board (STB), has informed me that the STB would like to promote Singapore as the “Digital Hub of Asia”, when electronic dealers in Lucky Plaza are these devious to customers, especially foreigners.

They should be taught lessons and such shops should be closed as they ruin the image of Singapore in general."
,,be carefull in buying to lucky plaza,1.0,,"i and my friend was been to lucky plaza when suddenly we been amazed by the prize of one of the shop there that i cannot remenber what is the name of it, the psp which is lesser compare to the srp of other shop outside. so my friend and i ask the salesman if the item is in good condition and he tell us it is all brand new and it is made from sony so the quality is good..and he tell us that he will give us a free game downloaded inside. so my friend i with the good sales talk of the saleman decided to buy it and he also recommended us to buy the psp acc's for 50sgd which he lower it to 40 sgd. after all the things were packed me and my friend decided to go home and try the item..and then we found out the the psp the guy sell us is the version that it cannot modify and downloaded any games and u need to purchase a umd which will cost you around 30 to 50 usd that the salesman never tell us and the free games he give us downloaded is only all free demo and somehow the acc's that we also buy is all lacking of pieces.. so i hope my experience in singapore will warned you to beware singapore is great country but i'll tell you in terms of customer service and honesty they are very poor.."
,,Cheats,1.0,,"I had a terrible experience in Lucky Plaza. I actually asked my friends to help me buy my PSP. We roamed the whole ground floor of Lucky Plaza and ended up at the store at the ground floor entrance if you came from Wisma Atria.

The seller said it is just 250.00 sgd and my friend asked if that's the final price. The seller said yes. Then, he took out the receipt and his calculator. He said we need to pay the tax. We are all tired and I said okay as I think it is still cheap. He asked for an additional 25.00.

So we're about to go but then again the seller said that I just need to buy a battery if I want to use my PSP. It was terrible! I told him why is there no battery included? It should be in it. I am getting pissed off. Then, I called my friend, he said it's okay I just buy the battery, it is still cheap. So I paid extra 49.00 for the battery.

When I get back to my place, I learned that the GST in Singapore is 7 percent, and 7% of 250 is just 17.50 but we paid him 25.00 for that. And my friend saw the PSP and it is the fat or old version. So it is very expensive!

I am the only one with a brand new but fat version of PSP among my friends.

What my friends did is, they helped me go back to the store and demanded a slim version cause I paid that price. He said I am stupid for buying a PSP from him. And he admitted that he cheated me. I got annoyed that I ended up screaming to all people in there not to buy from him. He asked us to just leave them alone. All my friends who are living in Singapore were pissed off when we talked to the seller.

Given that I am so dumb to trust the sellers in Lucky Plaza, I hate the fact that the seller is a natural cheat. He enjoys cheating people especially tourists. He wasn't apologetic at all. He didn't look scared that we got back to him. He mastered con art.

So please don't shop at Lucky Plaze. Don't even try to ask around Lucky Plaza, they will tell you the cheapest price possible but will trick you in the end. It's better that you buy from Harvey Norman or Courts or during the IT shows in Singapore.

**** My friend found out that anyone cheated can file a case to the Small Claim Tribunal of Singapore. Just search it on the internet and find out more about them. I really feel bad to all those people cheated in Lucky Plaza. I suggest that you all file a case especially the one who has been cheated for the product he bought and learned that he was charged an extra 700sgd. You can win your case."
,,House of Cheaters,1.0,,"Never buy your electronics here. They'll just cheat you out. Seriously. Don't even try.

My dad bought a supposedly-slr-camera there trusting that the salesperson, who happens to come from the same country where we live in, is an honest man. He gave him a camera that was released back in 2006. It wasn't even an SLR camera. He assured him that it was a '100% SLR camera' but it turns out that it was just a complicated looking digital camera. More than that, he overpriced it by 600 singapore dollars which is about 400 USD. It was awful.

Then my sister also went there to buy rock band for wii. They were charging her 450 singapore dollars. Another store said they'd give it to her for 350 but we have to pay first before they take it from the stockroom 'because it's a heavy set'. That's crazy. They could easily take advantage of the situation with such an agreement. She ended up not buying it after getting a call from my dad.

DON'T BUY FROM THIS PLACE. I advice that you just buy from Takashimaya which is only a short walk from the plaza. Takashimaya's electronic section gives better customer service and better prices. Wayy better."
,,I've Been Had!,1.0,,"Beware of unscrupulous vendors at Lucky Plaza. Especially Asia Mobile House! I was there to buy PSP games. Got 5 of them and wanted to pay cash. The salesperson insisted on me paying by credit card, which I did. He refused to tell me how much those things cost and charged quadruple the amount for each game! Imagine, I could have backed out had he accepted the cash. He totally took advantage of me having a credit card! Never go to that place, or if you do, be very careful! Lesson learned, go to Toys R' Us or any other store chain you can buy these from."
,,Careful of this shop in LP,1.0,,"Last March 19, against the advise of a lot of friends, i bought myself a Sony Ericsson w610i at Lucky Plaza. It was in a shop called Cyber Jip Pte Ltd, located at basement 1.

soon thereafter, i got feedback from several friends that they cannot get through to me as my handphone was in out of coverage area or was off, which of course it wasn't. i tested it one time and sure enough, it cannot receive any incomng call or SMS even if the signal bar is full. I decided to bring it back to the shop for them to check it. They received the unit and advised to come back 3-7 days after. That i did...the staff advised me that they had it checked and ""fixed"" it. took the unit back home and tested it, only to find out that same night that it still had the same problem. Brought it back to the shop and told him they have not fixed it and that the unit must be defective. this guy said that they had already tested it and found nothing wrong with it. I asked him to change the unit and said that they cannot as i have already used it. (do you buy a fone for DISPLAY??!! o course ill use it! that's the reason why i found it defective! in the first place, it was there for 1 week for ""repair"") they were all too willing to replace the unit but i must top up another $200+. i asked if they brought this over to Sony to have it checked and they said yes, and if i am not convinced, ""you can bring it over to have it checked lah"" .I went to Sony @ Wisma Atria and after 2 days confirmed that the motherboard is unstable and had to be replaced. I called the CyberJip's shop again and spoke to an uncle who i have advised that Sony confirmed that there was something wrong with the unit. I have asked for unit replacement or any other alternative they may give me. This uncle told me they cannot ""fix"" it for me as I sent it to Sony for assessment and that the shop's warranty is void already. I told him that it was the staff who suggested i bring it over to Sony in the first place.. and obviously it confirmed that they haven't even checked my fone and fixed it the first time. This uncle was soooo rude over the fone, talking as if I owed him money. I asked for the manager and said ""No manager, all staff."" and then i asked for his name. ""No, i won't give you my name."" I am too tired to fight again and it's really giving me bad migraines to think i wasted good money to be duped by these people. Furthermore, i found out eventually that the price they gave me is much more than what it they sell at Sony.

Lesson learned? Never to buy at Lucky Plaza again, 'specially from this shop... They will never take responsibility of the products they sell and they hire the rudest people. That guy just said ""sorry, can't do anything. You used the fone already."" just buy at a any authorized dealer, its well worth compared to the quality of the product and the service you will be getting."
,,"Bad experience at Lucky Plaza, Orchard Road, Singapore",1.0,,"This happened in basement shop of Lucky plaza today,

Today I and my friend went to Lucky plaza to look around stuff I needed. First I looked for a glass mounting (suction) holder for keeping my mobile.GPS in the car. No shops have prices written anywhere. They do not allow you to look around as they keep trying to pull you in their shop, no matter what you looking for. The prices varied from 39 sing $ to 20 S$ for similar stuff !! and at this place where he said 15 for a piece put on show, I thought it is a relatively better price and shown interest.

Then he bought the similar one (new one in box) from inside and told it is 19 S$ ! He told us the one in display is a bad quality! later he came down to 15 S$ telling spl price. But my firend who was with me generally tried asking for much better price before sealing the deal and the shop guys started abusing us! and when we said why there is a need to use the work [--] other shop guys started shouting at us and pushed us outside the shop.

My suggestion and my friend's experience are -
1. Visit this place to do window shopping, never buy anything from here. Everything costs higher than what it costs in showroom. If it costs lesser, either it is a fake one, without warranty, partially faulty or some accessories are missing.
2. never look for something if you are not sure of themodel and product properly.
3. never speak to a shop guy if you are not intended to buy something.
4. Avoid the basement shops (food court is okay)
5. If you buy somethin ask for total price which includes 7% GST and 3% credit card charges. The price they tell will never includes this

Also advise you to go to SIMLIM square or tower for all electronics items. Simlim tower which is diagonally opposite to square has some decent shops too. I liked the Tower more than squatr as at simlim tower the shops are run by old guys and they seems to be more honest. the shop from where we bought handycam told us the prices which were included with GST. charged only 2 % for credicard charges (as against 3% in other places). But if you are looking for computer items, Square has more options and shops and it is better."
,,Lucky Plaza ruined my vacation,1.0,,"I went to Singapore for a vacation and to shop. Thought I would get a better deal at lucky plaza. I trusted the salesmen very much, bought lots of things so I didn't ask for the calculator and check the computation. Turned out they ripped me of about 345sing. Not only that when I said I would pay in credit card, they did not told me that they would charge an extra 10%!!!Later I found out the sony cybershot I bought from them was 400sing more expensive than what was selling at Sony store. Now coming home I found out they charged me an extra 700sing from my credit card!!! Beware the store is CYBER JIP PTE LTD.#B1-81/#02-97B/C, LUCKY PLAZA"
,,Mad House of Shops,4.0,,"I rate Lucky Plaza as above average just for the experience of being here. On weekends it is packed with locals. I found the place fascinating, but I wouldn't buy anything expensive from here. Downstairs is a great massage place."
,,very poor customer service,1.0,,"I purchased a ""new"" ipaq 6965 last week from a store on the second level of the lucky plaza. when i got back to the hotel i had a little play with it and discovered that some of the keys on the keypad were not working. so i returned with it to the shop the next morning.
To my suprise, they tried to say that as i signed the reciept i had accepted it in good condition. I pointed out that i did not try the item and signed to say i took delivery only.
They then tried to say i had to send it to the makers, then they said they could only refund half the price paid as it was now a used item. They only agreed to a refund after i stood there and told other customers looking around how bad they were.
I purchased it with a memory card but they would not take this back as it was not faulty.
I also found the lucky plaza traders hard work, they would not let you just look at stuff, they always try to get you into the shop and keep you there, and none of the goods are priced at all, you always have to ask and they all do the same thing - start off with a silly high price and pester you to make them an offer.
TO SUM IT UP - GO TO A PROPER BUSINESS IN A PROPER MALL WHERE YOU WON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AFTERWARDS WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE - WELL WORTH THE LITTLE EXTRA YOU MIGHT PAY."
,,Purchasing Jewellery,1.0,,"Having purchased a bracelet and ring for my wifes 50th birthday, we arrived back home (Perth, Western Australia) to find one of the stones had fallen out. Having had this repaired, the first time it was to be worn the clasp fell apart.

My issue is not with the price (S$800) , but with the quality."
