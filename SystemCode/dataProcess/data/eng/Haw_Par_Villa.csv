,,"Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim. Tourists should Visit. Free Entry. However, very Hot.",4.0,,"Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim. Tourists Should Visit. Free Entry. However, very Hot. Bring your own bottle of water. Wear a hat. Wear walking shoes. Parking cost me S$5 per entry. You can take the MRT train. Very gory exhibits. Some weird statues. For example rats fighting rabbits. Elephant carrying rifle. One visit is enough. The last time I went there was about nearly 50 years ago. I went there with friends from US who wanted to visit the place. See my youtube invest channel Dr H C Matthew Sim. Regards Dr H C Matthew Sim"
,,Very unique,5.0,,"It's a very unique place to visit in Singapore. Lots of photo ops. Located just beside the Haw Par Villa MRT station. Lots of statues about Chinese Folklore. The ""10 Courts of Hell"" was really a different experience. It depicts the Chinese mythology about the various crimes and the punishments you get for those crimes in your after life. Overall it is very well maintained. I went there early morning at 9:30 so it was not crowded at all. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Return trip after many years,5.0,,"I first went to this site in 1962 and thought it a good site to visit
I revisited it in 2009 when it had all the 'modern' attractions (ie Water slides and theatres)
This year I visited it with my wife and son again and was very pleased to see that some repainting had been done and it had reverted back to what the original Theme park was like - just the way that the 'Tiger Balm Brothers' had designed it. No water slide or Theatres
This is an original theme park based on Chinese Mythology and very interesting - no computer controlled displays -just static tableaux
Admission is FREE as the Aw Boon Brothers original conditions
The site is easy to get to as it is close to the MRT station
I would well recommend a visit to see the historical aspect of Chinese Mythology and how a Theme Park from years ago was made"
,,Garish but interesting,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa or the Tiger Balm Gardens are an easy MRT commute- the station is less than 100m from the Gardens.
Go early or later in the day when it is cool. The park is beautifully maintained and the “courts of hell” gruesome but fascinating. It’s great to get out of the city a little way and see this long standing local attraction.
It’s a pleasant place to wander and enjoy."
,,Tribute to Buddhist statues,4.0,,"Aw Boon Haw, the entrepreneur who marketed Tiger Balm, was wealthy and built a villa in Singapore upon his return from Yangon after WWII. This was turned over to an exhibit which primarily honors Buddhism. You can find out more by going inside the Jade House Visitor's Center. This park is open to the public from 0900 to 2130 daily. There is no charge for entering, but there is a charge of $10 for a guided tour. Be prepared to do lots of walking, since you start climbing the hill on a slope right away. There is some car parking inside, although the main lot is at the bottom of the hill. The park is easily accessible via SMRT and MRT stops right outside of it. The main ""attraction"" is the Courts of Hell Museum and Exhibit. It certainly details the Buddhist concept of life after death and the punishment for sin (be prepared for some pretty gory stuff!). No sin goes unpunished. Yet at the end of the 10 courts, the dead are reincarnated via samsara after being made to forget all that has gone before. It is quite sad, actually, and forces one to soberly examine one's own life. The remainder of the park is dedicated to various statues/exhibits outlining Buddhist teaching and with a statue dedicated to him in the center of the park. It is worth spending the time here to see the various exhibits. There are benches along the way to sit down. There are also toilets available. It is a real cultural eye-opener!"
,,Got to visit,4.0,,Amazing photo opportunities not found anywhere else in Singapore. Right next to the MRT and it is free. I only wished that we could have seen and bought Tiger Balm at factory prices.
,,"Quirky, interesting, and unique!",3.0,,"Not really a go-to place in my opinion. But it is one of the most unusual places you can visit in Singapore. Not for the squeamish or the deeply religious. The place is clean and well-kept, but there are multiple terrain levels which might be unsuitable for very young kids."
,,Best. Find. Ever.,5.0,,"We found this funny little park on atlas obscura as we quite like odd or unusual activities we thought it was worth checking out, since it’s next to a MTR station it’s easy to get to.

From the moment i saw the first statues and heard the nostalgic 1930s music wafting from the speakers, I loved it.

The statues are unlike anything I have ever seen! The ten courts of hell section was very educational I learnt things about reincarnation I didn’t know and the scenes depicted were great.

We took our time going around all the statues and reading the plaques, each one giving us something to talk about and we had so much fun taking photos.

The museum is a real gem, I had no idea the history of the park and the family it belonged to was as colourful as the statues. So intriguing!

This park was a highlight of our trip, and amazing that it’s free, we would easily have paid at least a little something for the experience. Unfortunately parks like this are a dying breed, but I hope the owners continue to keep it and more people get as much joy from it as we did."
,,An Unusual outing,3.0,,"A great day out. Parking is $5 per entry. Entry is free. A lot of things to see. There are some renovations going on. Enjoyed the depiction of the Chinese culture.
I assume Restoration is being done and. Continued to restore it to its former glory.
An interesting insight to the Haw Par story."
,,Full of chinese stories,4.0,,A large free park to walk around and see different decorations for chinese stories. This is an old styled park which was a famous park in parents age. But I think is worth to see if you are interested in chinese stories
,,bringing guests for a scare,5.0,,i took some taiwanese friends for a visit to this awesome place and they were scared out of their wits especially when we walked through 'HELL'.
,,Historical!,5.0,,"It was a visit with my family.. Such a good place to be educated about this chinese folklore.. Formerly known as the Tiger Balm Gardens, but renamed as Haw Par Villa Dragon World by the Singapore Tourism board. The Haw Par in the park's name is based on the Aw brothers' personal names, Haw & Par, which means ""tiger"" & ""leopard"".. Very educational!"
,,A weird and wonderful story,4.0,,"My main recommendation is to make the effort and arrive early for the daily tour at 10am. It's early in the day but there's only one tour per day so until they change the timing of the tour, you need to make the effort. You'll get so much more out of the visit if you take the tour though (worth every penny of the $10 asking price). I went on a Monday and I was the only person on the tour. It was a like a private tour really. Fascinating history and mythology behind each of the sculptures which gave me loads of context to then explore the park by myself for another hour or so.

As long as you're not easily offended, go check out the Ten Courts of Hell on your way out. Shocking, gruesome, and somewhat funny to boot.

Overall, one of the best things to do in Singapore. It's so weird and wonderful that you're unlikely to discover much else like it in the world.

My only recommendation for the Haw Par Villas would be to organise daily tours that include visits to the restricted areas of the grounds where the former theme park from the 1990s now lies in ruins and overgrown. That would be intriguing and enlightening."
,,Chinese mythology,4.0,,"Visited Haw Par villa as my dad was biggest fan of MGR and wanted to visit the place where song Chikku Mangu Chikku Mangu Chacha Pappa from the movie Ulagam Sutrum Valiban was shot. The place din't disappoint. As the song teaches some moral of life, Haw Par Villa teaches one to be honest and not do harm unto others. Built in 1937, Haw Par Villa was originally called the Tiger Balm Gardens. The park is located near the Haw Par Villa MRT Station, so it’s easy to get to and Admission is free."
,,A Benign Battlefield,4.0,,"Just off Singapore’s West Coast Highway, with its own Mass Rapid Transit station, Haw Par Villa is a welcome break from the city state’s overwhelming skyscrapers, conventions and relentless modernity.

This attraction is popular with western tourists especially; having seen all the obvious sights (or skipped them completely) there’s unique interest and entertainment to be found here.

On display are figures depicting Chinese culture’s big three: Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, plus mythology and history. Exhibits include elaborate dioramas with life-size figurines. The characters are from Monkey Mountain, Virtues and Vices, Journey to the West, The Water Margin, Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea and the gruesome Courts of Hell.

To call Haw Par Villa gaudy is like calling Mr. Ronaldo a football player; it hardly needs saying. However, as your eyes adjust to the concrete/wire frame sculptures, you begin to read in its iterations another, non-verbal way of gathering information.
A half-fish, half-human figure recalls Hieronymus Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. Other delights include a fight between rats and rabbits, a crab lady and more – I don’t want to spoil it.

You may be forgiven for thinking it all landed here from space; in fact, it was channelled through the hands of two Chinese Tiger Balm magnates who migrated here from Burma (Myanmar), as it was then known; in 1937 Boon Haw built Haw Par Villa as a gift for his brother, Boon Par. Initially private property, the brothers opened it up to the public, ostensibly to educate the world about Chinese cultural values and ethics, while plugging Tiger Balm products to boot.

This benign battlefield would not be the place to try to teach morals to children, as generations of locals I spoke to attested; as kids, this experience was more likely to ‘freak (them) out’. In modern life, the more obvious reaction is to see it as kitsch, selfie material, so don’t worry if you’re bringing your kids – just get into fun mode (with the possible exception of the Courts of Hell)! Signs prohibiting people from climbing on the statues bear this out. This would clearly amount to wear and tear, though charging a ‘selfie fee’ for a little more than projected maintenance costs could, I thought, be a solution for an ill-attended site.
Though there is information on plates in front of most of the figures, it’s still possible to find yourself confused by the kitschy offerings. To bring the stories into relatable human experience, the invaluable paying tour (around Sin $5.5, or $4 US) focuses on the trials and tribulations of the Aw brothers whose gloriously weird project this was. It lasts an hour, starting at 10 am and 4 pm.

Do save the hell experience for the end (it needs to be taken with a pinch of salt). The whole experience will take around an hour and a half. The rest of the park is out of doors, save the humble indoor museum, which is air-conditioned. Light snacks and drinks are available at the shop cabin, half-way up the incline to the left of the path.

Haw Par Villa is located at 262 Pasir Panjang Road, Singapore 118628."
,,Visiting the Hell while alive,4.0,,"It's an interesting place to get to know more about Chinese belief and visit the hell while we are still alive. It also educate us especially the kids to do more good deeds and help people and respect the elderly. I personally like it but my kids which are 7 yrs and 10 yrs old scare and even cried when inside the 10 courts of hell. The place is not advisable if it's raining as places not shelter. The visiting hours are 9am to 7pm but the 10 courts of hell close at 6pm.

It's free admission and easily accessible via MRT. Alight at Haw Par Villa Station CC25 (Circle Line) and It's just a minute walk from the entrance to the park.

Make a trip down if you have the time. You can spend about an hr and can go to Harbour Front for lunch or dinner which is about 4 stations away from Haw Par Villa station."
,,Quirky and a bit different,5.0,,"So the park is dead quiet, the statues are weird and it's run down. It's pretty much the opposite of everything that modern Singapore has to offer. There aren't many attractions in town that you can enjoy by yourself. If you enjoy mainly the finer things in life you will hate this place so don't bother. If you enjoy the weird and quirky and escaping crowds. Haw Par Villa is a must see!"
,,Most Risqué Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"We have loved Haw Par Villa since we first visited in January 2018. Very unusual and quirky and we seem to see something different every time we go. The nature of some of the statues are very different from the usually reserved Singapore. It has recently had a fresh lick of paint and looks great.

Avoid in heavy rain - the ground surface is very slippery when wet and expect to have a good hike up the hill as you wander through the attraction.

Very conveniently located right at the entrance to Haw Par Villa MRT station.

Remember to take $1 to feed the terrapins at the pond at the top."
,,"Bizarre, surreal, and totally free",5.0,,"A quick walk from Haw Par station, Haw Par Villa is a collection of one man's obsession with Taoist folk tales and the brutal morals they impart. Kind of like a theme park, it's a collection of painted statutes and scenes bringing ancient legends to life.

The best part is the 10 Chambers of Hell which illustrates the horrible, limb-tearing, blood-splattering, skull-maiming fate that awaits bad people in Hell. But don't worry! After your sentence is carried out (be it in boiling oil, getting torn limb from limb, getting your heart cut out, etc etc), you get to be reborn and try again!

The scenes were pretty unfamiliar to me, so I didn't get as much out of it as someone who grew up with this stuff, but I recognized the Monkey King, Pigsy, and a few others.

A fun (and free!) way to pass the time before an afternoon flight out of Singapore."
,,Something completely different,4.0,,"Hundreds of brightly painted statues illustrating Chinese folk tales as well as moral lessons (work hard, save your money, don’t steal...). There’s an exhibit hall with posters telling the fascinating story of Aw Boon Haw, the builder of the site and the man behind Tiger Balm ointment. 30s pop music plays in the background reinforcing the sense of the time when this attraction was created.

Despite the recent renovations, there’s an air of shabbiness about the place, and a lot of places need a coat of paint.

As others have pointed out, the depiction of hell is not for children.

All in all a pleasant way to spend an hour or two and get a sense of one aspect of Chinese culture."
,,Don't bother!,2.0,,"Haw Par Villa (also known as Tiger Balm Gardens) is a free attraction which was just as well as it was very disappointing. Advertised as the theme park, there are numerous statues to see. The Ten Courts of Hell were very dark and not suitable for children. The place is very dilapidated and despite advertising a cafe and shop we didn't find them - only empty buildings."
,,Strange and funny,3.0,,"This is free and easy to get to on MRT - haw par villa stop. Just outside station and is filled with all weird staues etc, has chinese death cave which was really strange and not everyone will want to see that, especially kids. The rest is just fun stuff. Coming from New Zealand, we found a kiwi too which was cool. Nice to wander around for half an hour or so and free entry."
,,Explore mysticism and mythology in Haw Par Villa,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa aka Tiger Balm Gardens is named after philanthropist brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par whose names mean Tiger and Leopard respective, two legendary animals in Buddhism to which the brothers are devoted.

Haw Par Villa is a place of wonder and mystery with a chequered past. It started in 1937 as the residence of the wealthy Aw Family known for their Tiger Balm products sold to this day. Their villa sat amidst sprawling landscaped grounds which they populated with numerous statutes and dioramas drawn from Buddhism and Chinese mythology. In their philanthropy the gardens were later turned into a public park for the enjoyment of all. After being damaged during the Japanese invasion, it was restored and continued to serve as a public recreational facility.

Some years ago it was turned into a modest theme park supported by entrance fees. Despite its added attraction of a boat ride into the mouth of a giant dragon to view the Ten Court of Hell, the enterprise failed. Now it is back as a public amenity with free admission, minus the dragon and boat ride.

Save for a handful of well crafted works, the statues in Haw Par Villa make no pretence to be high art, being rather basic in style and execution, yet possessing a quiet charm all its own.

Most visitors find these displays pretty awesome through their graphic portrayal of the stories they represent. It is not uncommon to find parents inculcating moral values in their children as they view the exhibits. Or adults finding their moral compass after the gentle reminders in the Vice and Virtue displays.

Highlights not to be missed:

1. The Ten Courts of Hell: a gruesome preview of retribution in store in the afterlife for transgressions committed in this life. The Angels of Death, with bull and horse heads, who escort the dead to the underworld, stand guard at the entrance. Parental guidance for little ones advised.

2. Journey to the West: Follow the exploits of the Monkey King, Pigsy and Monk Xuanzang on their quest west to bring home the Buddhist sutras.

3. The Laughing Buddha, perfect for a selfie.

4. A five-storeyed pagoda topped by a statute of Buddha, and the surrounding pond with fisherman and aquatic creatures.

5. Legend of the Mermaids whose tears turned into pearls

6. The statue of Guanyin, Goddess of Mercy

7. Diorama of The Eight Immortals

8. Collection of dioramas depicting the virtues and vices of this world.

9. International corners featuring icons from African gorillas to Japanese sumo wrestlers.

10. Memorials to the Aw Brothers and their parents.

(Adapted from a post on my blog “Singapore, virtually painted by Tan Choon Hong”)"
,,Fascinating!,4.0,,"Chinese mythology based theme park set up by developers of Tiger balm, wonderful display of Chinese folklore, legends, history, and illustrations of various aspects of Confucianism. It is famous for its vivid depictions of the Ten Courts of Hell from Chinese folklore, works of Chinese literature such as Journey To The West, Madame White Snake, and the stories of the Eight Immortals. Many people can learn about the exacting nature of traditional Chinese morality. Free entry but also accommodates paid tours. ease of access for people in wheel chairs. it can use a few improvements like vending machines and maybe a gift shop. all in all a good place. Can be a interesting place for Dark tourists."
,,Knowledge of Chinese Mythology helps,3.0,,"Har Par Villa located on Pasir Penang Road in Singapore was the creation of two brothers from Rangoon who created the Tiger Balm empire, hence its former name of Tiger Balm Garden. It sits on a hilly 8.5 hectares and was built in 1937, the last of its kind in the world. There is a red brick road and many animals and figures made of rock depicting the Chinese classics - legends, mythology, culture, history, philosophy and religion. Large variety of animals, all shapes and sizes, lurking in odd places. To be honest I did not much enjoy what was a very tired and shabby place. But perhaps the assistance of a knowledgeable guide who could have translated all the meanings behind the stone work, would have helped? Apparently, its management changed in 2015 with intent that it be brought back to its glory days – not yet apparent at the end of 2018! Easy to get to via public transport (MRT Station is green line station Haw Par Villa) and various buses stopping close to the site. Open daily 9am – 7pm (last entry 5pm) and free."
,,Oy! Foked up place! Mate!,3.0,,"It is Clappin´ Mate! And very dry! But, ya can Jam there Mate! It is makin´ me shook while seeing those Statues! However, it is tight for Mandem! But, if u get Marvin there ain't no place to get some food! Very scary... for every Roadman! But, it is a good place for all mates!"
,,Singapore Dark Tourism,5.0,,"Haw Par Villa recently re-opened its door after going through a face-lift. Entrance to the heritage site is Free Of Charge. The place is steeped with deep culture. Main attraction would be the 10 courts of hell. It depicts the gruesome afterlife in hell and how bad deeds are punished through tortures.

One will feel confusing and astonished all at the same time. The site contains sculptures that can be intimidating, but brings up the unique part of Singapore that is less well-known.

Be prepared to walk and expose yourself to the Sun. Not on the priority list of places to visit in Singapore, but if you have spare time, why not."
,,Very Unusual,4.0,,"Never seen something like this before. The park was built by two brothers, successful businessmen as a contribution to society in 1937 and recently renovated. It is storytelling park, Chinese legend and history. Interesting that to tell story sculptures were used. Must be seen."
,,How Far (Par) Villa,3.0,,"The day we (my mother, sister, and grandma) went to pay a visit in this place, Mr. Rain decided to pour heavily (nonstop) which was the reason we did not fully roamed Haw Par Villa.

This said attraction has no entrance fee. It is free for everyone who wants to see the famous Tiger Balm, and other statues/displays it can offer.

Base on our experienced, it was enjoyable (even though its raining) especially if you are a fan or lover of history, artifacts, and other things that radiates the culture of one country. Also, it had an exhibition the day we paid a visit: Ten Courts or Counts of Hell (as I can fully recall).

Recommendation: I don't recommend this as a family activity especially with children ages 10 and below since they will easily get bored, and tired (for long walks)."
,,Epic,5.0,,"Either you love this collection of figurines in plastic or you hate it. I suppose it is one or the other. I can not stop being fascinated with the visualisations of hell, incredibly kitsch and fantastic."
,,Closed until March,3.0,,"I first visited Haw Par Villa in 1977, it was then known simply as Tiger Balm Gardens. We tried to visit yesterday but unfortunately, discovered that it is closed for repairs until the very end kf February."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Well worth visiting (and it’s free) Great place to take kids but maybe miss out the 10 courts of hell, as they are a bit graphic. Plenty else to see..just go!"
,,"Gaudy kitsch, but would not have it any other way.",5.0,,"Easy to get to, free, colouful, glorioisly kitsch and actually entertaining. Lots of walking around required, but definitely wheelchair friendly. Take drinks and snacks because there isn't much on site; when the souvenir store is open.

I'll return again, as I need more time to explore the whole park and read all the signs."
,,Fascinating insight into chinese folklore,4.0,,"As many people will have said, the models and statues are fascinating. My frie ds had been to a similar place in Thailand and thrybsaid this was better. If you have never journeyed through a diorama of judgement on what will happen to you if you lie, steal, gamble, disrespect your parents this is a great. The 10 courts of hell are very gruesome and parental guidance is very much recommended"
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"We went there after reading a few recommendations, however it was a bit of waste of time. I mean there are a lot of other things you can see/do better than this."
,,Crazy kitsch wonderland!,5.0,,"What a triumphal mix of Chinese myths, Chinese philosophy, kitsch, colours, gore, animals and memorials! The brainchild of two wealthy Chinese pharmacists (the ‘inventors’ of Tiger Balm) that wanted to preserve and promote Chinese traditional values in the first part of the XX century, this is an Instagrammable dream built long before Instagram and an excellent way to spend a few hours getting familiar with Chinese hell, Lady White Snake, the Monkey King, Chinese traditional virtues through hundreds of very colourful concrete statues.
And if the concept does not appeal to you just walk around looking out for the iPad girl, King Kong, the guy smoking a giant joint, the frisbee frogs, the Statue of Liberty and the guy surfing a turtle.
Free entrance and views over the cranes of the immense Singapore port."
,,Twilight Walking Tour,5.0,,We did the ‘journey to hell and beyond’ with the family - the post sunset aura of the park was amazing! It was cool and breezy. We had an amazing tour guide Nancy who was so passionate about her job and she made the entire tour such a memorable one. Our favourite part of the tour was learning about the interesting back story of the Boon brothers who opened this park and the sad tragedies of their lives that inspired them to contemplate on the intricacies of life and death. Seeing the different religions converge was pretty interesting as well!! Also an add on was that the MRT station was right there and actually named after the park :)
,,"A must see- grotesque, kooky and a step back in time",5.0,,"This was my favourite experience in the whole of Singapore. The 10 courts of hell is a highlight as is the Journey to the West (Monkey Magic!) and the park is peaceful with few visitors. There is a small gift shop, drink machines and you can buy food to feed the turtles and fish."
,,A look back at Chinese mythology for free,4.0,,"This one of a kind asian cultural park will take you on a historical journey of Chinese cultures & beliefs. Filled will fascinating sculptures, each one depicting a vivid story.
It is disturbing to see sculptures portraying traditional Chinese morality in Ten courts of hell therefore, parental guidance is advised if visiting with young kids.
No admission ticket
Open Daily
Timings: 9am-6pm
No vending machine or refreshment center available inside – get your own water & food."
,,Curious place,5.0,,"Build around 100 year ago by the family that invented the Tiger Balm. Must have been truly impressive back then. A nice gesture from the family to convey the legends and tales to the people that might not be able to read at that time. Hence, one can learn a lot about those legends by watching the scenes of colorful sculptures."
,,Great to escape the city view,5.0,,"Wow, this is the place that absolutely you can do if you are bored with the city view of Singapore. Nice creature to be shown to you how the humans living. Give it a visit while having a time in Singapore instead of seeing high tall building at the center ❤"
,,Surreal but fun place... Enjoyed courts of hell exhibit and feeding the turtles!,5.0,,"One of the ""lost"" Singapore attractions... Easily accessible by its own MRT station. Little worse for the wear with chipping paint but enjoyed the dioramas especially the courts of hell and journey to the west (Reminiscent of our own Hindu tale Ramayana)
You should buy some fish food and feed the dozens of turtles and hundreds of fish in the main pool in the centre of the exhibits... Lots of fun
Do visit once you are done with the big flashy stuff of Singapore"
,,Like nothing I've seen before!!,4.0,,"Actually, I have seen some Hindu statues in India, but this place was a bit fascinating. We spent about 2 hours here, strolling around the statues, reading the signs about them, and seeing the history of the 2 brothers- Haw and Par- who developed Tiger Balm ointment. all us, it was a good find for us, and it's free to enter, too."
,,Worth the trip if you have time and an open mind,4.0,,"About half an hour metro ride away from the main attractions and secluded from any other tourist sites you can find Haw Par Villa.
If you know of the product Tiger Balm, this is quite an interesting place to visit to learn about its history and the family that made its name.
It's a very surreal place that needs more signs and explanation for the more wacky displays. But was still very enjoyable and has the best orange juice machine just outside.
The ten courts of hell were a highlight (mainly because they were in the shade) and the whole park is free, so if you have time it is worth going, but go when it's less sunny because there is no shade and it gets very hot inside.
Take change with you so you can feed the very appreciative terrapins! :)"
,,Eclectic park with a past,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa (formerly Tiger Balm Gardens) is a curious place! You definitely feel the air of yesteryear as you stroll through the multi-level gardens and discover the fables that inspire these art pieces.

Of particular note is the wild and gruesome Gates of Hell! I thought Game of Thrones had rendered me apathetic but after walking through I was feeling a little queasy. This part is not for kids and the designers certainly didn't hold back on showing the full extent of these punishments.

It's somewhat hilarious that the rest of the park has such a lighthearted and comical tone. The kids will love seeing the different stories and sculptural reliefs - cool for killing some time and it's all free too. Very unique and completely different to the rest of modern Singapore.

Signs are well written and although there's some decay, there's plenty of love being put into this park. Lots of terrapins are littered about the water, and you can get some food for them."
,,Very interesting but bizarre free attraction,4.0,,"A Singaporean friend recommended a visit to this public park which was formally a major tourist amusement park featuring the Chinese ""Gates of Hell"". It was originally set up by the owners of ""Tiger Balm"" to showcase Chinese mythology, educate and act as promotional tool for their health product.

For Westerns it will seem very bizarre as many photos highlight. My friend said that all SG families would have visited back in the day,"
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"Quirky and unique to Singapore; you can't possibly find this anywhere else. We went on a night walking tour, which made the experience so much better. The park is free. Tour incurs additional cost, but it was awesome. There's a lot of walking, though."
,,Tiger Balm Garden Story Guided Tour,5.0,,"It was timely that we could make use of the National Day 1-for-1 to visit Haw Par Villa! We had always wanted to bring our 11 year-old twins to visit the place where mummy and daddy had fun when we were young! Our guide for the Tiger Balm Garden Story was Carol Dragon. She is so experienced and informative. She is engaging and caring as she constantly reminded us the slippery floor due to the earlier downpour. The passionate Carol deserves another Tour Guide of the Year Award! Keep up the Good Job!
I like the Jade Room where the Haw Par brothers story was told. The Virtues and Vices were good reminders.
We missed the Ninebots trial in June, hope you will have another one soon.
Cheers!"
,,Unique attraction with an interesting history,4.0,,"My foreign friend and I, a local, had a great time touring Haw Par Villa with our wonderful guide Carol! She was interactive and friendly, we learnt a lot from her, be it the history of the villa to the stories behind the sculptures. It would be a waste to let this attraction become forgotten. The guided tour definitely adds a nice touch to the visit, helps me appreciate the place more!"
,,Weird but worth a visit,3.0,,"The giant statues greet you before you’ve even walked in. Very colourful old Chinese characters are dotted around the entrance. We went straight to the courts of hell tunnel which is interesting. There are descriptions of each court of hell and what the sins are and the punishments for the sins with little scenes to go with them in case you couldn’t visualise being sawn in half or thrown into a hill of knives. While that section is quite morbid, the rest of the park is full of weird but wonderful statues of gods and emperors and weird crab and merpeople.
It’s definitely worth a visit and my teens thought it was weird and fun."
,,Not to be found elsewhere (but bring a parasol & water),4.0,,"This place is like the lovechild of a mini-golf course, a theme park, and Buddhist teachings with random animals and a Statue of Liberty thrown in. If you like kitsch, Buddhism, or just seeing things that don't exist elsewhere, this is a must-visit for your time in Singapore. I live in Japan, where theme parks and kitsch reign supreme, and I've never seen anything on this scale. It is a fascinating walk through Buddhist Hell and other teachings that give moral guidance, so it is informative as well! PLUS it is free of charge and no one really goes, so it's largely empty. To avoid overheating, I highly recommend going early and taking sunscreen, a parasol, and lots of water. Enjoy all the quirkiness!"
,,A MUST SEE especially for Western tourists!,5.0,,Great for tourists to get an insight into Chinese culture and mythology in a quirky historical park. And I highly recommend the 10am or 4pm guided tour - really brings things to life. There’s nothing like this anywhere else!
,,Unique,4.0,,"Anything that gives you an insight into another culture is always worthwhile.

We got the mrt train, Haw Par is close by. There are similar (and smaller) theme parks dotted around Asia. Some of the features here are not suitable for young children as they portray disturbing scenes.

We made the mistake of going at midday, as most of the features are predominantly outside there is no respite from the sun. Bring plenty of water."
,,One of a must go place in Singapore!,5.0,,"One of the mysterious unique attraction that everyone must at least go once, even singaporean, to see all the different statues and stories behind each of them. Great place to take pictures there.

Free Entry for everyone.

A must to bring an bottle of water and cap to beat the heat! There's even an ice cream cart for you to purchase ice cream at super affordable price."
,,"A bit strange, but interesting",3.0,,"Very easy to get here, it's just outside of Haw Par Villa MRT station and it's free! Everything you see here looks strange, and maybe a bit scary. The figures here represent the old Chinese folklore. I wouldn't say it's a must see if you're visiting Singapore, but if you have the time then sure do so. 1 hour should be enough, and do yourself a favor to not come when it's too hot, I did that mistake."
,,"Interesting, different",3.0,,"Interesting place to visit off the beaten track in Singapore. We caught the bus out & MRT back into the main city. The 10
Stages in the Court of Hell were confronting but a great way to compare religions and beliefs. Our 9yo daughter found some of this scary.

I really enjoyed the death museum they’re trying to establish and look forward to seeing that grow over coming years.

The rest of the grounds were amazing, colourful and interesting. Some more shady and seating areas would be helpful.

The history of Haw Par Villa was the most interesting part of the visit. We wouldn’t have learnt anything about this if we hadn’t popped into the little shop. The man here, shared historical pictures and its story and it was fascinating. We were so pleased the shop was quiet when we went in to have the opportunity to listen to this amazing story of Haw Par Villa and Singapore’s history."
,,Haw Par Villa cultural experience,3.0,,"Of interest from an historical and cultural perspective. Free to enter. Next to the MRT so easy to get to. Fascinating sculptures depicting Chinese culture and stories as well as other things that once surrounded the villa that no longer exists. Once close to the sea, but reclaimed land has moved it inland."
,,Little Know Attraction,4.0,,A quick MRT trip takes you right to the main entrance of the park. This free attraction is worth the visit to explore a quirky part of Singapore's history.
,,Must see,5.0,,"This is not a theme park or a cultural exploration but for us westerners a story that can catch the imagination. There is nothing arty about this place. If we don’t continue to visit it will be lost to us and I think it’s worth the effort to keep it going. After the visit I looked up some of the tales and legends. Written well ( in western style) they would challenge lord of the rings. Loved it or loved to hate it,"
,,Kitch but Educational,3.0,,"If you want a little bit of History, go and visit Haw Par Villa. Interesting way of showing how to torture and kill people when the have sinned but also what they used to believe in. Should definitely include this while you're in Singapore"
,,Very strange,3.0,,This was a really weird experience. There were only three other people there and it was raining. Very slippery when it rains. We started with the ten courts of hell and it was very unsettling. We felt a bit uncomfortable afterwards. The rest of the park is just strange yet pretty. The status are cool and colourful but a little odd and we weren’t quite sure what was going on all the time. The entry is free which was great but unfortunately it was a bit far for us to get there from our hotel. Truly weird experience but if you like something different it can be worth the trip there.
,,The Greatest of Hidden Gems,5.0,,It's free; it's fantastic. Few Singaporeans visit it these days and it's their loss. While it has seen better days it is still a must see attraction. Absolutely unique and totally worth a visit.
,,"Totally free, Easy to get to, worth a stop!",5.0,,"This place is really weird, but you can take all kinds of crazy and cool photos here with some very unusual, colorful statues. The place is right next to the MRT station, so make this a quick stop on your trip for its uniqueness, free cost, and easy location.
Its outdoors and exposed in most areas to the sun and heat of SIngapore, so keep that in mind. It also is not very busy, it seems. Plan on spending about an hour or two here."
,,A walk down memory lane,4.0,,"This Chinese themed park was back in the days (1990s) one of the iconic parks in Singapore. I remember childhood days at this park that was generally overcrowded and a little weird.

The park still retains it quirky nature but is now a little forgotten.

The 10 courts of hell was one memorable ride in the part (it was a boat ride into a dragon). That has shrunk and is now a cave that you walk into. Still interesting to see.

The park is like lost in time (with benches from the old days) and chinese statues and stories.

Entry is free and really convenient to get to (a 2 mins walk from Haw Par Villa MRT station).

For those into the quirky and something off the beaten track, I would recommend this park. A strong sense of Chinese culture and flavour and a memorable walk back in time."
,,"Free, Weird and Interesting!",5.0,,"Friends of mine were living in Sinagpore for work and I decided to pay them a visit. We were looking for something to do that was a bit off the beaten track. Well, we got more than we bargained for here!

There's a whole back story to Haw Par Villa which is quite interesting. Built in 1937, the park was originally called Tiger Balm Gardens and, as you no doubt guessed from the name, the park was built by brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, who were the creators of Tiger Balm. Through the 80s and 90s, the park was modernized and lost huge amounts of money and never really became the oriental Disneyland that they had hoped for. Thankfully, the park now remains and is free for all the enter.

The park itself is full of colourful and strange depictions of scenes that were supposed to represent Chinese values and Chinese mythology. There's over 1000 statues and 150 dioramas. Most of these feature some pretty interesting combinations of violence or people combined with animals and all kinds of strange visuals. At times however, some scenes are actually quite dramatic or beautiful... It's a real mixed bag!

As a visiting group of adults, it was good fun and quite quirky. Definitely something different to do. It's pretty hot to walk around a big park for a couple of hours but it's worth it. I would say, however that I'm not sure some of the depictions would really be suitable for children. Especially the end walk through section where there's various scenes of people being tortured or are in hell for their various sins.

Overall - good fun to be had!"
,,Good Food,4.0,,It was a good Experience to dine ones again in this restaurant Service was good nd food also ok but sometimes very busy
,,Amazing!!!!,5.0,,"I live in singapore about 10 monthes and I have not heard of many people visiting this park. you have to go!!! Tmr!!:)

We were on an amazing guided tour at how par villa this week, Esther guided us with the help of the Rong En- amazing place !!
The mythological park is full of statues of Buddhism, Taoism and confucianism. Walking around this park is a spectacul sight in itself but without the huge addition of the mysterious interesting stories I'm sure we would not have experienced The park in its full glory. We enjoyed and were very impressed .. We were 3 adults me and my parents without kids so that the park is suitable for everyone !
He tells about 3 interesting religions in a fascinating way!
We were on a day tour, but I will undoubtedly return with my husband on the evening tour. In my opinion, the hi-light was the way Esther told us about the past of the place, the religions, and the sculptures in an experiential way full of interest and knowledge - simply amazing !!
And Rong that photographed us and shared her own knowledge of the place about events, on the re- painting and and the reconstruction of the place.
Thank you girls for a charming tour full of interest and charm, you are the best!

,,Get a glimpse of Asian culture,3.0,,"A good place to visit and understand some concepts the Asian culture, especially the traditional views on life on earth and the afterlife. Will be interesting to children as well as keen students of history and traditions."
,,Free admission,5.0,,"Theme: Chinese culture Plenty of statues telling traditional Chinese stories, incl. White snake legend, Adventures of the Monkey and many others. Must visit the '10 courts of hell'"
,,Make sure you join the guided tour!!,5.0,,"To make your visit more meaningful, make sure you join the guided tour. Both my husband and I developed an appreciation to why the park was built, the meaning behind some of the symbols and sculptures in the park, etc. For the western tourists, this is nothing like you've ever seen before. Go with an open mind and indulge yourself in Chinese culture, values and tradition."
,,A walk back in time,4.0,,"I was last here as a kid myself and things haven’t changed much but most exhibits have gotten a fresh coat of paint and overall the park is beautifully maintained, very peaceful and quiet. The themes may seem morbid with lots of “deaths by various ways” on display but this park was built during the time when humility, filial piety, hardwork, loyalty and many other traditional virtues were held in high esteem and a failure to be virtuous was “shamable and punishable”. The owners Haw Brothers sought to emphasize on these teachings by showing scenes from various Chinese mythologies. The real highlight is the 10 levels of hell and the punishments for “crimes” like being disrespectful to parents and siblings. It was an eye opener to my kids aged 8 and 10 and reminiscent to recall childhood stories told by my gran. Entry is free to all but if you drive, per entry parking is $5 (until 7pm but seriously you won’t want to be there when sun sets)"
,,Interesting...,2.0,,"Uhm i dont even know what I expected from visiting here but it was certainly interesting...
Har paw villa is a park filled with statues and figures that represent old Chinese folklore. I have to say I was very creeped out after visiting this place. It was very interesting, but very odd.
My friend and I got caught her in a thunderstorm and we thought we were never going to make it out, the longer we sat and stared and these weird creations the more we wanted to leave!

There was an exhibit on the 10 courts of hell which was kind of humorous but mostly disturbing. If you enjoy old folklore and diving into old Chinese culture this is the place for you. However this was not the place for me. I did visit a second time to show my family just because we had time and it was oddly intriguing."
,,Haw Par Villa . The old “ Tiger Balm Gardens “,5.0,,I really enjoyed revisiting this place. It had been 😕 42 yrs since I last saw it and a lot of the old exhibits are still there. It is very well maintained and so tidy as is all of Singapore. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
,,A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART!,5.0,,"To many return visitors like me, this Park is special.

My first return visit was like a trip down the memory lane. Although quite vaguely, I can still recall some of the sculptures that appeared in my childhood photos; they are still very much the same albeit with a new coat of paint.

Whilst I’m proud of the many “likes” the Park received from foreign visitors’ reviews here, I’m a little perplexed by the not-so-appreciative comments, more so coming from the locals. I like to think that the more constructive comments have been heard and currently, efforts are put in to improve the place, if not make it more interesting to visit - like having guided day tours and weekly night tours, but please be forewarned that these are no “free lunches”.

As maintenance and repainting work are currently ongoing, you may spot the artisans at work during your visit; please be kind to them, if not spare them a simple appreciative gesture. I come to know from a youtube video entitled “The Last Artisan” that delays in upkeeping the sculptures was partly due to difficulties in getting successors to Mr Teo – a gentleman who has devoted 70 odd years of his life keeping the sculptures here in good shape and colour; something that not just requires a high level of skills, but lots of devotion and dedication. In his 80s, he is now the last artisan standing after all his fellow artisans had left or retired. Thankfully, the Park had managed to seek 2 potential successors to understudy him and hopefully, they will stay on to continue upkeep the sculptures.

The selfish side of me should be least bothered that this place is not popular with locals nor tourists as it means I can enjoy the peace and tranquility whenever I visit the Park. But of course, that’s against the primary intention of its original owners. Thanks to the Aw brothers who were well-known for their Tiger Balm brands of medical products, what was once a part of a private residence built in 1937 soon became accessible to the general public. Such generosity is but one of the many the moral values they intend to share with visitors as demonstrated in the many dioramas and sculptures displayed around the park.

This place is like an open-air art-gallery although the more famous Ten Courts of Hell is housed within shelter. In its 80s’ heydays, this shelter was a 60 metre long Chinese Dragon which is often pictured in post cards then but this structure was later demolished for economic reasons.

One may also see pagoda-like structures erected within the park; these are the memorials for the Aw family members including the Aw brothers. If you noticed, the biggest and better-placed pagoda was built for their parents – a demonstration of their filial piety, which is very much a core Chinese value.

There are over 1000 sculptures in the Park, many of which are meant to depict the Chinese traditional culture, beliefs and mythologies. However, you may be amused to spot a few sculptures with international appeal – a statue of liberty, sumo wrestlers, thai-dancer, Balinese mythical beings and scenes, etc. Whilst these sculptures should never be compared with the Michelangelo’s, many of them are exquisite in their own rights, thanks to the artisans at work during those early years. My favourites are those depicting the scenes of famous myths/novels like the Eight Immortals and Fengsheng Bang.

If time permits, one should read the brief write-ups besides the dioramas/sculptures in order to appreciate them more. But even by simply admiring them per se, we are constantly reminded of the moral lessons they try to demonstrate which originated from the Buddhist/Taoist/Confuscious teachings.

I may be wrong but I guess they built the Ten Courts of Hell as a final reminder to all mortals like us to abstain from bad deeds and behaviours. Possibly the biggest of its kind in the world, the Courts of Hell were well organised and presented although the depictions of Hell scenes are quite graphic and can be intriguing to some whilst daunting to others. So for the young and less-strong-at-heart, you have a choice to bypass totally, make a u-turn any time or exit by the side door at the mid-way point. For most others, my advice is to step in with an open-mind and be rewarded visually, if not spiritually.

The best time to visit the Park is from 9am (opening time) when the sun is not too unbearable, and finishing off at the Ten Courts of Hell which is sheltered and near the entrance/exit; average duration should be around 2 hours for the whole park. Otherwise, visit from 4 to 5pm in the reverse order; take note that the Ten Courts of Hell closes at 6pm, 1 hour before the Park’s gate is shut."
,,haw paw vila tour,5.0,,enjoy e haw paw vila tour tat i had last week evening. haw paw vila was a place tat i always go when im kid. didnt know e history till e tour.
,,Nice theme park,4.0,,Good place to visit with family. This theme park has interesting statues and giant dioramas showing Chinese mythology. Has some references of tiger balm owners as well. Good place to take kids especially.
,,"Totally authentic, completely surreal experience for a foreigner",5.0,,"Haw Par Villa is a theme park from the 1930s created by the brothers behind the famous Tiger Balm brand. In Singapore, where penalties for illegal drugs are severe (as they tell you just before you land) Haw Par Villa is as close as you can get to a legal high - like a concrete embodiment of someone's good and bad trips, complete with cute animals and bizarrely domestic horror. Partly based around everyday Singapore scenes of the period (including British traffic police with baggy shorts) and partly themed on classic Chinese mythology, the mix of violent domesticity (wives cutting of unfaithful husbands heads with spurting blood, etc) reaches a climax in the Ten Courts of Hell which is designed to scare kids into respecting their parents by showing the horrible tortures that await if they misbehave. Truly worth a visit for anyone who enjoys tales of the unexpected."
,,Bizarre and run down,3.0,,It’s a sad shadow of its former self and one wonders how much longer it will exist. Everything could do with a fresh coat of paint and a good clean up - lots of stagnant water so watch out for mosquitoes
,,A family fun park from yesteryear,4.0,,It's a great laugh and very enjoyable. Check out the 10 Courts of Hell; quintessential learning for any child.
,,"So random, quite fun",4.0,,"Had some time to spare and decided to go here. A bit random. Much bigger than expected, a good insight into old myths and legends. Could do with a few more signs explaining some bizarre scenes though! Recommended for something a bit different."
,,Informative site learning about the chinese belief,4.0,,"10 courts of hells, we can see the statue displaying the situations of human in hell depending on what kind of sin has been committed. on the last stage human will reincarnate to the next creature based on their past deed.

we can also see the myth story of ""Journey to the Wesr"" scenes.

I found it very interesting to learn about Chinese cultures and beliefs."
,,Lost my STP but I love this place,5.0,,"Went to Pasir Panjang & stop in Haw Par Villa mrt station. Nice place, awesome story of Buddhist / Journey to the west / Cementery etc. Free entry! A lot stairs

We went there monday noon. A few visitors after us (4-5 people)
A lot beautiful spot to take pic & I lost my STP near cementery (i forgot)
I love this place.. cozyyyy.. and historical
Will comeback soon.."
,,"Interesting, old school creepy theme park",4.0,,"This is worth seeing. Cultural gem. It is free, it is old school. The ten courts of hell is a bit unsettling. Not that it is creepy to visit as much as the folklore behind it. This is a good insight into old Chinese folklore, brought to you by the guys behind Tiger Balm. Fun, old school entertainment"
,,It's free and it's fun.,4.0,,"Most of the other reviews say it all, but here's my speel...
Catch mrt to haw par villa station
Free entry
Very open and exposed. Take a hat, umbrella, water and sunscreen.
Not crowded (weekday).
Don't miss the turtles in the ponds.
So many photo opportunities. Lots for the kids to enjoy.
We missed the courts of hell. Like a lot of places we miss stuff because we get too hot and tired.

Very kitsch, but you have to admire the artistry and effort that went into creating this park. There is a sign board at the entry that describes the history. Maybe take a photo of the map so you see it all?"
,,Insight into Chinese Folklore,5.0,,"Went here around 10AM, easy access from MRT station with the same name (Circle Line, less than 5 stops from Harbourfront MRT). It’s mostly open air so make sure you bring some water.

The villa itself contains a lot of statues depicting Chinese mythology and you can learn a lot from it. The ten courts of hell is actually small but it’s kinda scary for kids. Better not go alone.

It’s absolutely free so don’t miss it."
,,Free entry!,4.0,,"It is free to enter this park and it was built by the founder of Haw paw cooperation (tiger balm pain relieving ointment). It is near to mrt station. We can study Chinese legends by sculpture. It is a good place to take photos, too."
,,"bizarre, quirky, kitch... but worth a look",4.0,,"Easy access; hop off the MRT at Haw Par Villa. And it's free, so if you don't love it, you haven't lost a thing!
If you have children in tow, it would be a good idea to avoid turning right as you enter; that's where the various levels of Hell dioramas are. Dismembered, writhing, angonising sinners, anyone?! Teens, of course, would probably have a grand old time!
Go straight ahead and it's all mainstream 'traditional' Chinese decorative art done in a technicolour style. You can get some nice photos. If you've an inquiring mind, at the top right of the mainstream area you can catch a glimpse of the old Haw Par Villa mostly hidden behind a cyclone wire fence.
A charming lady from the office might come out, greet you, and ask if you would like a guided tour... but you probably don't; just walk around and drink in the whole weird scene.
One hour is probably all you need for the mainstream part, two hours if you check out the Levels of Hell, too.
Unlike the rest of Singapore... There was no one else there during my roughly 2 hour visit!"
,,‘Underrated Beauty’,5.0,,"Visited the Haw Par Villa on a Friday morning, the place was deserted bar about 12 other visitors.
We stroll through the ‘10 courts of Hell’, figurines were gruesome, it was based on the punishment given to crimes committed.
However, it was really very realistically modelled.
The craftsmanship on this figurines are the only one in the world.
You have to spend time to slowly enjoy the beauty of the works.
Yes, it does look slightly worn down but given this park was around since the 1937, the hot weather in Singapore, I would say it is in pretty good nick.
This is a far cry from the modern Singapore and it is rather refreshing to see the other side.
There is only one shop selling some souvenirs and the 2 ladies inside were very helpful.
Bottled drinks and snacks could be bought there.
There is no entrance fee and is open 09:00.
Give it a go and marvel at the craftsmanship of yesteryear."
,,Mixed views,4.0,,"In 1937 opening to the public intending to provide education on moral values behind a range of Chinese legends is great. The 10 courts of Hell would scare children. It must have been very impressive you can still see the lovely colours on statues even with them peeling off. It’s free what can you say, but it’s very hot there with little or no shelter."
,,Returned after 47years - Formally TIGER BALM GARDENS,3.0,,"I have just returned from Singapore after leaving there in 1970 (aged just 3yrs). Unfortunately I didn’t remember any of it only from photos my mum has, it was sad day as it has been left to rot over the years - it has FREE ENTRY as there is nothing to do but walk around the old figures that are in need of some TLC. Could be a bit scary for younger children but it is ver y interesting to read about the figures and the founder of the park.

There was a young girl working there in the gift shop who advised a new company was looking to open it up again but not sure when, such a shame to see it like that.

You can travel by bus or go on the MRT (Metro/train) the transport is so cheap, only costs a couple of dollars!"
,,"Free attractions ,needs bit repaint though",4.0,,"To get here just alight from haw par mrt its very close by .Showing Chinese forklore plus there is loads of turtles,also hell side which I didn't visit cause I cant stand gore.Great children to learn and wander around,its free"
,,Haunting memories of my childhood,4.0,,"if like me you and your family were posted with the armed forces to Singapore in the 60's you have got to remember this place? it was in those days called Tiger balm gardens and its a theme park designed to promote the ointment of its original name.

It unique in every way, the statues depict Chinese folk law and some are very grizzly. I had haunting memories of this place being only 6 yrs old when my parents took me, it was a regular day out, how times have changed.

Anyway its not really changed and is well worth a visit if you are in Singapore ( don't take your 6 yr old into the 10 courts of hell ) it is something you will not see anywhere else, its on the metro route and its peacefully quiet and away from the hustle and bustle and free to enter."
,,Strange yet amazing,5.0,,"This is such an unusual gem. Entry is free as you enter a bizarre area filled with artwork that tells the story of various Chinese folklore and mythology. There are beautiful, unusual statues and artworks across many layers of hills with water and greenery throughout. There is also a much darker section within the cave that tells the tale of the ten courts of hell.

You'll either love it and appreciate the weird and wonderful, or completely hate it!"
,,Was not expecting this :-),4.0,,"If you like fairy tales, stories and myths you could do much worse than visit this place for an hour or two. Be prepared though as there are not many places to seek shade on a hot and sunny day. Looking at my phone I was surprised by how many photos I had taken! It is very close to the MRT."
,,Weird and wonderful,5.0,,Close to a metro station and free entry this wonderful tableau of Chinese folklore is surely a must see whilst in Singapore. It's a bit jaded and scruffy but they are in the process of doing it up. We found it an absolute delight and highly recommended spending a few hours here!
,,Well that was interesting!,4.0,,"Ok, we really did enjoy our visit to Haw Par Villa. The various depictions and stories are very interesting. I don’t think we have anything in the US quite like Haw Par. Be sure to go into the building to read about the story of the two brothers. Most of the dioramas are in good shape.

It is certainly worth an hour to visit this gem in Singapore."
,,Back after 40 decades,4.0,,"Dad took me to the park when i was little and now it was my turn as a dad to take my kids.
Like me, the display with intrigue my kids the most was the 10 Courts of Hell.
As an adult I enjoyed reading about the myths and legends which the statues depicted.
As surpised that one ointment could help the Haw Par family become multi-millionairs in the 1930s
There were vending machines , in case visitors forgot to bring water. Not much shade is available."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Not sure what to rate this. It was between average and very good but there is no half star. The ten courts of hell is quite gruesome but is it myth or history? A lot of work has gone into the park with many different statues and scenes. On the day we went the cafe was closed and only a vendor machine for cold water. Toilets very clean.
It is free so worth a visit."
,,Worth a Experience,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa, is a theme park like, not exactly an amusement park, here you will get an insight of Chinese statues and architecture, there is not much to do apart from strolling around and clicking photos with those monuments, but well, if you visit it Singapore you can make it if you've time, best of all it's Free."
,,Childhood memories rekindled,4.0,,"I try to come here if I can when I'm in Singapore. The reason is that when I was a mere infant, my father was based at RAF Changi in the 1950s. One of the places we visited was the Haw Par Villa, or Tiger Balm Gardens. Since then, the place has been shown less love and has fewer visitors, and yet, and yet, and yet ...

Yes, I still love the place. I have a favourite grotto where I had a stolen kiss. I have a favourite tiger. I enjoy one gruesome depiction. I enjoy the moralistic miniature dioramas. I love the hill with the monkeys, my favourite being the monkey with the camera. The big Happy Buddha one sees upon arrival is still a big favourite of mine, and as I have aged, so I see a certain family resemblance, and it's not the smile!

The darkened grotto of the Ten Courts of Hell, is not for the faint hearted. You are most likely to walk out off there thinking you've had it in the afterlife, since many pleasures (i.e. sins) involve rather nasty things being done to one's person. Despite my several visits to Hell, I have not changed my ways. As it seems I""m doomed already, I'm going to go Hell for leather with whipped cream and a glacé cherry on top!

Yes I love the place, childhood romance and memories of a simpler time for me and the world are all tied up with it. I wish it could be shown more love and the statues and dioramas taken better care of.

I have excluded one grisly image from the set as I am concerned it would not pass censorship. What I will say is, it may not match what happens in modern violent movies, but I think it still has a power to stop you in your tracks, albeit for a small moment.

If you ever visit the Haw Par Villa, think of a young European child in the 1950s seeing this for the first time and that child is still fascinated by it some sixty years later. Approach the place with a child's imagination and I hope you will be as enchanted I was then, and still am to some degree now."
,,"Free , worth a visit",4.0,,"This is part of Singapore’s history, so worth a visit and it’s free to get in. Easily accessible by the Metro. We went because it was a return visit for my husband who lived here as a child. It’s one thing which hasn’t changed a lot over time! Sadly it doesn’t appear to be well looked after and parts of the park are closed off. It’s quite interesting to wander around and you can read about all the displays and statues. Some of the statues might be a bit frightening for young children. Plenty of seating areas. Only a small gift shop was open , sells iced lollies and small snacks. The toilet facilities were immaculate."
,,Great experience at Haw Par Villa,5.0,,"Parents out there, to help preserve this old heritage pls find time to bring your kids over to Haw Par Villa this holiday. They have free tour everyday at 230pm, which is very enriching and educational. The kids learned some history of the place and also some stories of the myths and legends of the Chinese culture.

Great for tourists to find out more about Singapore’s or chinese culture."
,,"Formerly Tiger Balm Gardens - Love it or lose it, NOT to be missed!",5.0,,"This place was visited by my husband in 1970 with the Royal Navy and by myself by 1972 on our way back to the UK on our way back from Australia. As a child I remember being slightly scared of some sculptures set in little caves overlooking the sea and these sculptures showed punishments for various crimes. They seemed a little fearsome but for whatever reason I have always remembered them and wanted to go back.
Haw Par Villa, which no longer exists, was built on some land owned by two brothers who were the inventors of tiger balm. The elder brother had a beautiful two bedroom villa built in the centre of the park, which was ultimately taken over by the Japanese during World War II, as its position had a fantastic high vantage point over the whole of Singapore harbour. Following the end of the War and the death of his older brother, the younger brother found the Villa to be in ruins and had it demolished.
The whole ethos of Haw Par Villa or tiger balm gardens was about the brothers giving to the people of Singapore, the whole ethos was about community, heritage, culture and history and whilst the park is very old now it is still very quaint.
What I call the torture caves are still there but they have been moved in the park. The park was taken over by a private company many years ago and it was operating commercially but it was not successful, and it was left to rack and ruin.
The Singapore government took it over and tried to run it but there were more modern attractions in Singapore and it too was a failure. Two years ago Journeys Pte Ltd took over the park – a company that has various other successful attractions throughout Singapore and Asia. They are actually doing up the park but it would be fantastic if Singaporeans gave back in the same way the brothers gave to Singapore in the first place, by volunteering or visiting and supporting Haw Par Villa. It is a multicultural place in a multicultural country, made up of Malay, Indian, Chinese, and other minorities.
There are various notice boards around the park with information about virtues which are very important to the Asian way of life, but is not such a bad thing that we could not practise a little more of it ourselves – such as Confucius says “ never impose on others that which you would not choose for yourself” – such wise words, this was developed from the concept of “ren” where one’s value as a person depends on how one treats others.
We had a fantastic day and I have chosen to put quite a lot of photographs with their notice boards where necessary – but be warned a couple may be a little bit gross but they are only very old stone statues painted and sometimes tired. The whole place is tired, run down and all it need is TLC. It has free admission and if you ever come to Singapore, then you should definitely come here and support it because we both think it is brilliant"
,,Has changed focus many times over the years.,4.0,,"At the time of writing there is no charge to enter Haw Par Villa. Back in 1991 it re-branded itself as a small theme park with exhibitions, shows, rides and drama activities, for which there was an admission charge, but all this has been superseded as Sentosa and the marina took over the bulk of the entertainment, and has reverted back to a garden with weird sculptures.

There is so much weird sculpture here that one can never get bored, despite having been there 4 times previously. It is unfortunate that the theatre and much of the area around it has been cordoned off for so many years and allowed to rot. I hope that at some time in the future, this area is again incorporated into the gardens if only as an alternative source of open air drama and music.

With the MRT station being opened since our last visit ten years ago, it is now so much easier to get to from the city."
,,Unique and definitely worth to visit,5.0,,"It’s a very unique theme park, telling the Chinese myths thru the sculptures and Scenics. Some of the scene setting and art directions are mind blowing.

The fundamental idea of the park building is to remind people to keep their good heart so to avoid to go to hell after death.
I would definitely recommend people to visit here when they come to Singapore!"
,,Curious,4.0,,"As others have mentioned, this is a strange place. It seems half-open, half-closed. It is, however, worth a visit if you want to find out a bit more about various aspects of Chinese folklore. There's a website, which I don't think is kept up to date because it suggested there was an entrance charge, but in fact it was free to get in. Very close to the MRT station. Glad I went!"
,,We love this place!,5.0,,"We have come to Singapore three times in the last four years and we come every time. It's just like it was when I was a child visiting forty years ago. We brought some friends this time. Couldn't really describe to them what they were going to see. Both women, they couldn't believe what they saw. We laughed and had a great time. There were people from another country also visiting and climbing all over everything which was so disrespectful. It's free and donate has even given it a MRT stop so you have no excuse to go see for yourself!!"
,,"Crazy, weird, totally different - The Tiger Balm Gardens",4.0,,"Not sure where to start with this one! My Grandfather who was stationed with the Royal Navy out in Singapore in the 50's or 60's and used to talk about this place. Then it seemed to fall out of favour and tourists were warned off going there. Well now it's back! but still a work in progress.
It has it's own MRT station (Haw Par) and is easy to get to. There are spots set aside for catering outlets and shops but so far none are taken so you can't get any food inside apart from an ice-cream or cold drink at the very small visitor centre.
It's not a Garden even though that's what it's commonly known as. It a park full off garish, crazy statues telling Chinese myths and stories. It's fun, kitsch, surprising and startling. The statues are being repainted and restored, obviously after many years of neglect, so some are bright and shiny while others are faded and cracked.
There is a covered separate area which houses the 10 Courts of Hell tableau's, which are gruesome models of crime and punishment according to Chinese myths. The models are so kitsch that most children have probably seen worse on the internet but it's worth being cautious with sensitive children.
I'm glad I visited but probably once would be enough!"
,,Historic site,4.0,,It's place of the historical epics from the Singaporean and Chinese history .need about 1to 2hrs to scroll the area .the first entrance is free and open all days included holidays ..
,,A return visit after 45+ years!,4.0,,"I first visited here in 1972 when I traveled on my first o/s trip. Finally got back to Singapore to stay long enough to revisit this iconic sight. Well somethings change: there is an MRT station just outside so access is very easy, (if you can make it up the long hillside walk, I don't think it was quite like that then - the MRT is a 'new' entrance!?). Also the 'scary' parts have been isolated to their own little zone, close to the entrance. The rest is there, just as amazing and --weird-- as I remember them. Even the giant crab still has the ladies head on it!
The whole thing is just as incredible as it was in the past, it's something the a visitor to Singapore shouldn't really miss. Entrance is free so there is really no excuse to not have a look.
Sadly I have to say that on the day we visited, whilst it was very hot in the sun, there were very few visitors. There has been some attempt to redevelop facilities with new a/con shops etc. only one of which was open at the time. Generally, everything is in reasonably good condition with plenty of explanatory labels on the 'exhibits' etc. But, maybe it is just to 'out there' for most of the younger Singaporean generation?"
,,Weird but amazing! Must Visit.,5.0,,"The Haw Par Villa defies description. It is a huge park with all sorts of beautiful , as well as very, very strange sculptures and dioramas. There are over a 1000 statues. The most intriguing attraction in the park is the Levels of Hell depicting gruesome images of life in Hell according to the sins you commit. Completely fascinating stuff and very enjoyable if you're not the queasy kind. Entry is free, it's on a hill nearly adjacent to the Haw Par MRT. Carry a cap or umbrella because the pathways aren't covered, and wear trainers because there's a lot of wlaking to do.

There is a small shop in the premises where you can buy just chips, a few souveniers, cold drinks and water. It would be nice to have a restaurant selling, if nothing else, fast food. All that walking in the tropical ehat makes one hungry!

I wonder why it doesn't show up more often on Things Not to Miss in Singapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This place us well worth a visit, full of amazing scuptures beautifuly painted. This park is a 2 min walk from haw par villa MRT station and is free to get in. Lovely place to spend a couple of hours"
,,"colourful, amazing, bizarre, unexpected and perhaps a bit disturbing",3.0,,"Entry into Haw Par is free. It is easy to access from the MRT. In fact you cannot miss it. The park covers, apparently, about 8.5 hectares. You essentially walk around the red paths and see numerous statues and dioramas (scenes). Some of these have excellent explanations in various languages which is great because I like to understand what it is that I am looking at. It is all interesting from a cultural perspective. I am not sure how children might respond. Some of the scenes are gruesome eg depicting a person being sawn in half in the ten courts of hell."
,,A blast from the past,4.0,,"When I last visited Haw Par Villa it was called Tiger Balm Gardens and I was a baby. Going back 50 years later was a treat and a ""must see"" while I was in Singapore. Getting there is easy as it is right next to Haw Par MRT. Grab a drink from the vendor at the front as there is currently no refreshments inside. The attraction is free, can't beat that! The small park consists of oriental sculptures, largely from Chinese folklore although some I think are built just for fun. The sculptures are colourful and make great photo opportunities. Know that this attraction can be considered in bad taste by some, there are some horrific torture sculptures supposedly depicting what might happen to you if you do not follow the ""right path"" in life. These can be completely avoided if you are there with young children as they are in a covered area. I prefer to think of the garden as kitsch, fun and free.
There is evidence of some renovation, we came across a brand new gift store with some local crafts, although it was cash only at the time, having been open just a week. Don't overlook this attraction, it just needs a little more development such as a cafe which would be a great addition."
,,Great for children,3.0,,"This is part of Singapore's history and if you like your amusements to be a little quirky, then this could be for you. It is a recreation of chinese myths & legends done in moulds and plaster casts spread over a hill side. Yes it does involve some up hills but is great fun. And free. Right next to Haw Par MRT stop to very accessible. Your children should enjoy it as its very colourful, somewhat gruesome and the electric blue koala & purple kangaroo would make any Aussie feel a little homesick."
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,"An interesting place to visit in Singapore amongst the many places of interest out there .. this one is slightly out of text book for the average tourist but yet offers a lot to one who visits it and especially lot of pictures can
Be clicked out here for those interested in doing so"
,,A step back in time,5.0,,This is an amazing place to visit. The statues date back some 80 years and are currently undergoing refurbishment with about 80% seemingly completed.
,,A Big Surprise!,4.0,,"Read about this as a mustn’t be missed so decided to visit on the spur of the moment. Next door to the MRT station and easily found. A real surprise, reminded me of ‘Fantasy Island’. Must have taken ages to build - in need of renovation but still worth a visit and free of charge."
,,"Bizarre, unique place",4.0,,"Haw Par Villa was the former 1960s equivalent of Singapore Disneyland, except made back when the country was still impoverished, and filled with some of the most terrifying statues and dioramas I've ever seen. Hallway after hallway of horrifying, twisted visions of Hell are probably no place for a sensitive child (unless you're trying to scare it straight, I guess), but man does it make for a unique visit.

Strongly recommend a quick stopover here for a really unique site."
,,Showing its age,3.0,,"Just my 2nd visit here with the kids today. Again, not really that impressed. The statues are really showing their age. At least it wasn't too busy. Can get very hot when the sun is out in the middle of the day."
,,Unusual yet Unique,4.0,,"The purpose of this park is to illustrate various Chinese myths and virtues. I found the background of the stories interesting, and the displays are quite detailed. The most interesting part though is the ""Ten Courts of Hell"" exhibition. It kind of reminded me of the Circles of Hell from Dante's Inferno. This is right next to the Haw Par MRT station, so it should not be missed."
,,Haw Par Villa / Tiger Balm Gardens,5.0,,"Loved it! It's been over 40 years since I was here last and it has been improved. Great to watch the dioramas and follow the life teaching stories. Beautifully coloured, and one area was being repainted today to freshen it up. More work is being added in the future. Just when you think you've seen it all you discover more! And it's free! Can't understand why hardly anyone visits this wonderful, mystical, scary, delightful place in Singapore"
,,Extremely unique.,5.0,,"This is quite a fascinating place with an interesting back story (I won't go into detail here but I urge you to read up on it online). The fact that that is essentially a half-abandoned amusement park is enough of a reason to visit for me!

The sculptures (whilst admittedly in need of some paint work) are very interesting, especially the gory '10 courts of hell'.

Right next to the Haw Par MRT station and definitely worth an hour or two of your time!"
,,good choice,5.0,,just near to mrt station a comlpex of many goodlooking and precise maked statues is.I think it takes90min to see it all.so nice
,,Historical Haw Par Villa{Tiger Balm Gardens},5.0,,"Visited here on a very wet day and we had the whole place to ourselves in the morning. Very quiet and empty which was a real shame as this is a very interesting place to visit with plenty of ancient, mythical Chinese legends and skilful craftsmanship in all the statues.It was a real shame that the whole place needs an immense renovation to bring it up to its original glory ,as I have visited this place a very long time ago, and everything was in immaculate and pristine condition. Free admission and very easy travelling on the MRT to this attraction. Highly recommended tourist attraction to visit once, in spite of it being rather run down."
,,Bad trip Disneyland,5.0,,"Definitely not for everyone but if you like, uh, weird stuff, it’s just about the coolest place you could ever want. Literally hundreds of absurd and colourful painted concrete statues and dioramas depicting all kinds of Chinese folklore and mythology, often incredibly violent and graphic, always very strange. Crabs with human heads. Pig men groping goat women. Sinners being sawed in half by demons. Cooked stuff. If that sounds at all intriguing or funny, I highly recommend spending an hour or two wandering here. A bit out of the way but free entry and right next to a MRT station."
,,"Incredible,Tiger balm garden",4.0,,"Why are there not more reviews of this place?
Yes a little dilapidated but renewal on going.
Get better details on line but do go.
Warning it’s hot up there,guess it’s all the concrete statues and displays.
This place is easy to get to on the MRT free and a photo
taking bonanza of a place.The ethical reason for building this area is highly moralistic and all would do well to dwell on that for a while.The world would be a better place.
Do Go"
,,A visit to the legends character world,4.0,,"We can walk around the park for an hour or two, there are many statues, Chinese legends and warrior characters to enjoy"
,,Run down,2.0,,Been there for a short walk. It's run down and so sorry that they let it go this way. Give it a new fresh paint.
,,Lots to see,5.0,,"Absolutely loved it there, so many unusual statues and areas to see. Ended up having some great photos!"
,,Weird,3.0,,"The 10 Courts of Hell are gruesome. Elsewhere there are animal, religious and other statues. Quite a mix! Easy access from MRT. Paintwork could do with a new coat."
,,So Bizarre,5.0,,"This is a free admission sightseeing place and very unusual. We didn't have any preconceived ideas about it, but had been told it was worth visiting.
It is hard to describe, but it is one of a kind, with scenes from Chinese history set up around the property as well as animals from all over the world - kangaroos and kiwis. It has had millions and millions of dollars spent on it over the years to maintain it.
There is a great cafe across the road in the shopping centre called 'The Wild'. Transport by bus or MRT is easy as they stop outside."
,,Very Unusaul Free Theme Park - Go in with open mind - Not all sculptures suited for kids eyes,4.0,,"This is a run down free theme park with over 1000+ sculptures. It feels very 1980's. Some images are disturbing and not recommended for kids. Some sculptures are very ""dark"". I am glad I saw it, but came out a little confused on what I had just witnessed. Worth a look. If you are parent taking your kids, maybe try to be ahead of the kids to determine if you wish for them to view that piece. Not all are like this though. When we were there, there was some painting maintenance going on, so improvements are being made. The turtles looked hungry. Close to train line. Short walk."
,,Childhood Memory Place,3.0,,"Once it was a very famous tourist attraction place and theme park like 10+ years ago. I remember during that time , entry ticket is not cheap. Its is not free entry and less people visit. Some people feel a bit scary and it talks about Chinese religion and all sort of hell related story. It still worth a visit if you have time. There is MRT whcih make it even more accessible."
,,Crazy Brilliant Place,5.0,,"I loved Haw Par Villa. The crazy tableaux depicting chinese legends. Easy to get to and lovely for a gentle stroll or picnic,"
,,Definitely a Must Go,5.0,,"Set aside the free entrance, this place is full of amazement and it is hilarious. There is literally no other places like this on earth. Starting with the battle hill scripture with bunnies and weasels, one must naturally suspect if the builders were high on something. I had so much fun browsing around this theme park. 10 stars recommended."
,,From childhood scare to quirky park,4.0,,"My grandma brought me here and sat me on a boat ride through the 10 Courts of Hell in this place, eons ago. Too bad the boat ride was removed, but the sculptures were kept.

Instead, this is now more of a quirky place for people to see how two tycoons of Tiger Balm created a theme park to educate and entertain children back in the day. The naked, gory, and unabashedly weird animal-headed humans were to teach kids what not to do, but now it's more humorous as an adult. There are some kid-safe classic stories made into sculptures, but it's not as easy to appreciate

The park is changing, and now new enterprises are moving in to set up galleries of their own in the park. I was not able to visit them this trip, but it looks promising for a re-visit."
,,Random but worth a visit,3.0,,"Having grown up in Singapore I remember haw par villa as a must see attraction before all the new jazzy stuff came to town. It's a shame that the water ride no longer exists and that it is beginning to look a little tired. However, as a free attraction it is definitely worth a visit for a laugh. There is a section that explains the different circles of hell and what behaviours will land you in particular trouble according to old Chinese tradition. Not good for very young children as the depictions are quite gruesome. Will only take between 30 mins - 1 hour to visit."
,,Bizarre theme park,3.0,,"This public, bizarre park also called, Tiger Balm Gardens.
If interested in Chinese legends , the place to go.
Access MRT: Haw Par Villa station,
Open daily from 9am to 7pm.
Free entrance

Access MRT: Haw Par Villa station,
Open daily from 9am to 7pm.

,,Unforgettable journey,4.0,,"This villa are dedicated to the two brothers(Mr Aw boon par & Mr Aw boon haw) who created Tiger balm. the garden was built to tell the story of the chinese gods, culture life and it's to embark on an unforgettable journey into chinese folklore and mythology."
,,Unique,4.0,,"This is a free and easily accessible site seeing must do. You can go to Haw Par station and the park is right outside. It was created by the founders of Tiger Balm who were born in Myanmar, but moved to and continued to live in Singapore.

The Ten courts of hell is the main feature, but this can be gory for some. Basically, depending on what your sin is, you endure some form of torture and die, but in the end you drink a magic tea, come back in another life and don't remember how you sinned or what you endured. I know one 8 year old, who did not seem freaked out in the 10 courts of hell, started balling after his father scared him when we had just exited. The crying continued for a good 5 minutes. I would not take a kid under 10 to this unless the kid is use to horror stuff.

Apart from the courts of hell, there are some amazing statues, building, fauna and flora...a few turtles live in one of the ponds.

It can get busy and you will have to deal with the tourists that run in front of every statue and want a selfie or pic with it.

It is outdoor and is in Singapore, so it does get hot and can also rain. Bring sunblock, sunglasses, water and an umbrella.

I would recommend going here as I have not seen anything like this anywhere that I have traveled to before."
,,Chinese Mythology,4.0,,"Previously known as Tiger Balm Gardens, this place gives a little insight to some Chinese mythology transferred into Singapore Chinese Culture. The park is 90 years old and has been recently refurbished. That said, the statues and sculptures are still the originals and the detail is incredible especially on the smaller pieces. It does warn you before you enter the 10 Gates of Hell area that some may find the sculptures gruesome, however in my grown up opinion, I have seen worse in horror films, but that said, some younger children may find them frightening. The park is free to enter and is just next to Haw Par Villa MRT station, less than 2 minute walk. It took me just over an hour to walk round and take 153 photographs. There are slopes and steps to encounter so for people who are not used to the Singapore heat I would suggest taking water with you as I did not see any retail outlets around the park, the nearest being in the MRT station."
,,Fascinatingplace,5.0,,"Haw Par Villa was a small note in our guide book but is well worth visiting. Easily reached via the circle line, alight at Haw Par Station and you are there, it couldn't be easier. Entry is free. I guess the 10 Courts of hell is the highlight, it made me resolve to be better, but really there is so much more, it just keeps going up and back. The landscaping is terrific and the statues well I can't describe them properly. There is even an Australian section though where Koalas fit in Chinese Mythology I struggle. Kids will love it, the place is a bit of a maze so they will have a great time finding their way. If you have time or have overloaded with shopping and crowds this is the place for a quiet chill out."
,,Interesting.,4.0,,"Went to visit this place out of curiosity. It was interesting, to say the least.

A lot of sculptures surround the whole park, and they have an informative narrative for every sculpture so visitors can understand what they represent.

This place is very well known for its ""Ten Courts of Hell"". It was a graphic representation of the punishments of the people who lived their life doing bad deeds.

Alight at Haw Par Villa Station (Circle line) and it's just a 2 min walk from the exit. No entrance fee needed. Lots of parking spaces available. Stroller friendly, but I don't think kids/toddlers will be able to enjoy this kind of sculptures."
,,Nice experience,5.0,,Loved the place. The ten courts of hell is a great treat. You should definitely check it out. It has great sculptures that you'll find interesting
,,Definetely worth visiting,5.0,,"We spent a few months in S'pore and I made a list of things to see. Obviously, the Haw Par Villa was not too high on the list, bases on rather mixed reviews. However, I would say the place is an absolute must if you stay more than a few days - it's free, it's interesting and it's definetely something else. Even my kids behaved themselves quite well after visiting the ""ten courts of hell"". This place should be better advertised for tourists as well!"
,,Memories from the 1960s,4.0,,"I first visited Haw Par back in he early sixties. I am delighted that the gardens are open again and are being brought back to their spectacular colours. The gardens are dedicated to the two brothers who created Tiger Balm, and the gardens were built to tell the story of the Chinese Gods. The gardens are free and an interesting way to spend a few hours"
,,Interesting Visit,5.0,,Haw Par Villa is a very interesting place to visit. there are more than a thousand chinese style figurines and sculptures here. The place is very beautiful with a lot of things to sea nor is there lot of rush here. Must visit

,,Better than expected,4.0,,"I've been to Singapore 10 times, but this is the first time I've visited Haw Par Villa. I caught the MRT to Haw Par Villa station and it was just a very short walk from there.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the displays. Although it was evident that some of them needed repainting, they were very colorful, and explanations of what the scenes depicted were written in English at the front of each of them.

Yes, some of the displays can be a bit confronting and gory, but I really expected to be more shocked than I was. Actually, there were many displays which weren't in the least bit confronting and which were sculptures of beautiful animals and traditional scenes.

There weren't many people there on a Tuesday when I visited and the atmosphere in the park was very relaxing. There are plenty of seats to sit on to watch the cute squirrels run around.

Luckily, there was a nice breeze blowing while I was there or I suspect it could have been very hot. Take plenty of water with you because I didn't see any taps when walking between the displays. However, I imagine that there would have been somewhere to fill up water bottles at the toilets near the entry.

This park is on what I think would be prime land, and I thank the owners for hanging onto it and not selling to developers. Also, the fact that no charge is made for admission is admirable."
,,Far from town,4.0,,"This place was very far from town. I took a bus to go here and went to nearest shopping mall. My journey from Geylang took 1 hour plus. A lot of statues at this area, hilly and quite hot in the noon. A place to...More"
,,A bit tired but worth a wander around,4.0,,There are apparently over 250 dioramas here depicting scenes from Chinese history and mythology. Some are downright strange while some really need some TLC. It looks like they are slowly rejuvenating the displays. Great thing - at 9am when they open its quiet (unlike everywhere...More
,,Very vivid and graphic depiction of hell,3.0,,I came here a long time ago and truly terrified. Some parents take their kids here to show them what will happen if you don't behave. It's an interesting to see different culture describes what hell looks like.
,,Freaky!,5.0,,"Freaky place! Love it! I can tell everyone I have been to hell and back! Free entry, MRT at the entrance. Worth a few hours."
,,Sadly decaying masterpiece of Chinese culture,4.0,,"Recently restored for the most urgent damages, this unique amusement and educational garden dedicated to Chinese mythological and cultural background offers a unique experience for all publics. The scenes depicted along the alleys are well done and documented. But the damages due to time and...More"

,,Educational Tour,4.0,,We spent a good 1-hour to take a tour around the park. Interesting tour inside Ten stages in the Courts of Hell. Entrance is free!
,,Bringing teenager for educational tour,4.0,,"Have not been there for decades and revisit with teenager daughter during Jun holiday. Noticed some restructuring done, workers still touching up certain features. Should visit 10 courts. My daughter was a little frightened of the punishment given for wrong doings.

A very interesting place to be indeed....More"
,,A must-visit for first timers and...,4.0,,"The last time I visited was more than 40 years ago.

It's worth a visit if one has not visited before.

It was a wonderful place to get a glimpse and perspective of Chinese legends, folklore, myths, etc.

The 10 courts of hell were still a fresh memory of my last visit and my children certainly enjoyed this unusual exhibit.

It was impressive to see that this place was so well maintained and also improved."
,,Interesting though a bit run down,3.0,,"This was once called the Tiger Balm gardens and I remember visiting it many years ago when it was very popular with both Singaporeans and a must see for visitors. Today the entry is free, there are virtually no people and the iconic statues depicting Chinese mythology are looking a bit tatty. It is easy to get to with the MRT station on the Circle line being right at the front door. For anyone with a smattering of interest in Chinese mythology, please take the time to visit while you can. You will not be disturbed by large, noisy groups and you will see it before it is inevitably revamped as a major tourist drawcard. I also visited it in February 2015 (when the photos were taken) and it was deserted then as well."
,,Har Par Villa Tiger Balm Park,3.0,,Park with beautiful statues. It is free and next door to MRT Station. Full of Mythology and folk fore statues. Must read the description with each statue
,,Off the beaten track a little but worth a few hrs visit & its free,4.0,,"Wow, this park is big, it took my wife and I over 2hrs to walk around the main areas and you could easily spent a day. Hundreds of statues to look at relating to china and asian history. We had a half day to fill in before a cruise and it was very good not to mention the exercise. Beautiful gardens and lots of shady trees and a little like a botanical gardens. recommend and its free."
,,"Eccentric ,quirky and dont' miss it",5.0,,"A fascinating relic from the past. Very much an icon for Singaporeans . It's free to enter and very near the MRT so easy to get to. No cafe but small stalls outside selling water and ice cream. Quirky, sometimes kitsch and full of mythology with folklore statues and tableaux built by the founders of the world famous Tiger Balm."
,,Interesting park,4.0,,An interesting park with beautiful statues. needs to be refurbished but now there are working on it. Acces is free.
,,A new experience,4.0,,Lots of people call this place very weird- and they were right! However it is like nothing I have ever seen and I am very glad I went. The only thing that I could say against it- apart from it needing new paint in places- is that the legends it depicts aren't very well explained and I ended up looking up a lot of them online to understand the stories.
,,so sad,2.0,,this was the one place i had always wanted to visit aftre seeing pics & films of it from my childhood. unfortunately it is no longer the attraction it used to be. years of neglect have turned it in to a worthwhile if you are nearby but don't streds if you can;t get there attraction. it has improved a little in the last few years but such a shame it has lost its original character
,,An interesting park for myth/folklore lovers,4.0,,"If you are the kind of person who loves folklore and mythology this place is a must visit. Built in the 1930s by the Haw brothers the place gives you a sneak peek into Chinese mythology and stories from ancient Chinese culture. It is set on a hill and can be quite daunting to climb for older people. Children would love the colorful sculptures. But avoid going on a hot day since there is little shade. Also remember to carry water since you cannot buy anything to eat/drink at the attraction itself or immediately outside it. Except the ice cream uncle selling some snacks outside the attraction there is no other place to buy anything to eat/drink. One of the ponds has terrapins in it. If you would like to see them... make sure you stop by.
The place can be adequately covered within 1 hour. Try to reach before 5:45PM as the gates of hell display closes by 6PM while the main park only closes by 7PM."
,,Chinese mythology,4.0,,This place is free to visit and does give you I site into Chinese Mythology. It was looking a little tired but as we made our way through the displays we could see a lot of maintenance and painting was being carried out. Very enjoyable ... It would be good to learn more about the founders of Tiger Balm who built this park.
,,A very unique and interesting place,5.0,,"This is very much an acquired taste -- either you love it or you are totally disinterested. It has dozens of exhibits, which are large figurines depicting some type of events in CHinese culture, history, or mythology. Most interesting is the Ten Courts of Hell exhibit, which shows how people are judged based on their sins in the world. It's on the way to or from the bird park, so a combined trip would be effcicient."
,,An unusual attraction,3.0,,"Was recommended this by a local and I'm very pleased I went because it's incredibly strange.

Very interesting to learn about some of the Chinese mythology and what was created to teach children about morals.

It's pretty easy to get to and just 2 minutes from the MRT and it's completely free.

It was raining we went which wasn't great as it's all outdoors and built on a hill with several steps and steep paths."
,,Will be better once renovated and upgraded,3.0,,"As a child I grew up in Singapore and we visited the tiger balm gardens( haw par villa) many, many times.
I'm sure we used to pay to get in but I may be wrong! They should think about charging visitors so they can use the money for the up keep- gardens are big.
It's certainly free now and the best bit is the MRT drops you off right at the gardens.
It looks very tired from the last time I saw it and neglected. However the plus side is there is a lot of upgrading going on so I would think it will be beautiful in a strange grotesque way again.
We had our boys with us- 7&14 both were slightly freaked by the 10 gates to hell.
Haw par villa have appropriate signage up to advise parents of this.
Got some great pictures with the boys and the statues.
No cafe - there is toilets. Go beforehand would be advice and take some drinks.
Look forward to see it finished and back to its original glory."
,,Eclectic,5.0,,"If your into the odd and quirky then this place will put a smile on your face. personally I thought the concept and style of art / architecture were great and a visual relief from the every day Singapore bling. Its kind of Gaudi esque kind of place. I dont think its for kids as it has a touch of the Monty Python adult humor / story telling about the place. None the less the message is there for all to absorb and to take on board.
Tip just take the MRT to the villa. Haw Par Villa is a station stop on the Singapore underground system."
,,Scary but Interesting,5.0,,This is my favorite place that I want to visit during my trip because their show the myth of Chinese folk tales along with scary picture but their also add knowledge and idea of the story and the best thing is the place is free tourists not have to pay to enter the place.
,,Scary place,1.0,,"We have passed this place so many times that we needed to visited. It may depict much Chinese history and folklore, but for outsiders is an absurd and freaky place. Once is enough!!"
,,Whimsical and macabre depiction of Chinese folklore and mythology,3.0,,"This park is a collection of crude and primitive figurines depicting scenes in Chinese folklore and mythology. For those familiar with the subject and the language, the collection of diorama is fun to look at. For the uninitiated, the Court of Hell is quite a shocker, with its depiction of decapacitated heads near the entrance and various scenes of torture in the ten courts of hell. The place was a little rundown in most areas when I visited, but there was quite a large crew of workers doing renovation. The admission is free and it is right next to the MRT station. Given the price of admission and convenience of access, it is worth the visit, just don't go looking for Michelangelo artwork."
,,Extraordinary and one of only two in the world,5.0,,"A park created to depict scenes of Chinese Mythology and a magical underworld of death torture and reincarnation.

The park is free having been donated by the creator to the city but has deteriorated over the years. I am glad to say that it is undergoing a refurb just now but is well worth a visit in anyone's book.

Get off the MRT at Haw Par Villas station which is on the yellow circle line and you step off at the entrance."
,,Bring a cold drink,5.0,,"Absolutely Amazing place but nothing to buy.
We travelled to the Haw Par Villa station on the MRT and found the entry only feet away to the right.
The entry is free at the moment and i would have still paid something as it is worth it.
One of the local schools should do a gold coin donation to raise money here.
We didn't bring drinks as you are not allowed to consume food/drinks on the MRT.
But you can carry them.
Any cafes that may normaly be here are currently closed.
Some statures may have a bit of paint missing but the repainted statures look like new.
It might take 1 more year to finish but it will be worth it.
We still took 200 photos but every one has a story.
Weird to wonderful."
,,Past its prime,3.0,,"Filled with statues that have evidently seen better days, this park nevertheless provides some outdoor entertainment if you don't mind walking in the heat. Easy to get to, as it's a short stumble from the MRT station. Children may be a bit frightened by some of the imagery."
,,Worth it,5.0,,"I recommend this place for all of tourists. It have big statue,green environment and great ambience. You learn a lot from this place. Respect!"
,,Must see,4.0,,This park is a bit run down but the detail of the sculptures is jsut stunning. If you take some time to marvel at the depictions of gods and even everyday situations you will catch a glimpse at the old Singapore. The 10 courts of hell are not for weak stomachs or small kids.
,,This is a Must See,5.0,,"This place is like absolutely nowhere else. Huge statues in an enormous park depicting Chinese legends, mythology and folklore. The Ten Courts of Hell are the highlight. Gruesome but fascinating. Entrance is free. At the moment there is a big restoration project going on so if you can visit from late April/May onwards that would be better as some of the attractions are cordoned off. Food courts and more restrooms are planned. It is right next to the Haw Par Villa MRT and a bus stop so it's very easy to get to. We thought it was great fun and really interesting. Recommended."
,,Learn something of chinese culture,4.0,,"The Villa is full of themed stories depicted by 1-2000 statues all brightly coloured, some large some small. All of the scenes illustrate states of being, or have a moral to their story. Quite different to the norm. The visit is free. The MRT station is on the circle line - Haw Par Villa"
,,omg rofl lol,5.0,,"soo apparently this is where your parents took you as a child to put the fear of god in ya. lol. Its really crazy and demonic and wild. Americans would generally consider this to be over the top violent and terrifying for children but hey apparently this a kid friendly attraction lol.

I have no idea how this has never really shown up on travel shows I've seen of Singapore. It was pretty epically hilarious and awesome. Its just a museum of possible dismemberments for punishments and the rings of hell etc. Nice light hearted afternoon stuff.

Its really hot and there is a large ""garden"" area. Bring a bottle of water as I do not recall seeing shops or anything directly near. Its a 6-12min from the subway and there is a food court within 10 min walk. Not much on the actual premises."
,,Went over 50 years ago,4.0,,I went over 50 years ago when I was 6 and it left a deep impression to this day. Bit run down now but still powerful. Off the beaten tourist track for some reason (as is Changi Prison) but worth visiting especially if you like Dali and Tim Burton.
,,Currently parts are being renovated,3.0,,"This is the villa and grounds of the rich "" FAMOUS tiger balm of singapore"" producer brothers. They manufactured the tiger balm still so widely sold in singapore. Since parts of this are currently under renovation, we could just see the grounds and sculptures. they are strange and weird but worth one look see"
,,Warped And Beautiful Imagery,5.0,,"I live close to here and go wander around once in a while when I feel uninspired. If you're into Bhuddism and statues with a twist, this place is for you. Not really the place to bring the children if they're faint of heart and you're not yet ready to expose them to the wierd world...but for the curious, creative or candy-flipping traveller who isn't affected by strange vibrations...you HAVE to check this place out."
,,Nice,5.0,,Educational place to see different statues and the Chinese gods. I love the 7 stages of hell area and I would say that the place is well maintained.
,,Skip this place if you are a tourist,2.0,,There is nothing here for a tourist. Being locals here we pushed ourselves to visit after 6 months of stay and we were totally dejected.. It's in a rundown condition and offers no excitement neither to the kid Nor to us.
,,Wonderfully weird,4.0,,"So apparently this was the villa of a rich Chinese guy a while back. He decided, as a way to give back, to erect lots of sculptures to convey Chinese legends to the public.

This place is a riot of weird as hell statues. The highlight is the ten courts of hell, which shows the punishments for various sins, in graphic detail. If you dig the macabre, this place is for you.

There is a construction going on, and it isn't the best maintained place. But it's free, and if you are an Asia traveling veteran, your probably tired of temples and pagodas. This is something quite different."
,,"A 1930's artistic gem, hilarious, gruesome, educational, fascinating and free.",5.0,,"Well worth the cost of the MRT fare to get to this little gem by dockside. Yes it is being renovated at the moment so there are parts you cannot visit but even so there is plenty to keep you amazed for a couple of hours. The tunnel containing the 10 stages of hell is truly gruesome and graphic but it gives an explicit moral lesson into the values of these times and is sometimes hilarious. ( All the explanations are written in English so easy to understand the systems of crime and punishment) Outside the displays particularly those relating to the 1930's are a classic lesson in fashions and art of the time.
The loos were open and very modern, but there is nowhere to buy anything to drink yet.
So pleased this little gem is being preserved, go now before it becomes better known !"
,,A great place for wedding photos,5.0,,"This is by far the best tourist attraction in Singapore.

Free entry, amazingly macabre statues, a small snack stand, easily accessible by subway. My personal favourite part is the hell tunnel, specifically the dioramas of people being thrown down a hill of knives. Tree of knives comes a close second.

I wish they sold souvenirs."
,,You will believe what a complex array of imaginations gone wild can look like,5.0,,"This is right next to the SMRT station , easy walk. What a crazy place. hill and dale of statues and caverns. Thousands of painted characterized thematic displays of fairy tales and scenes of life in the last century. Demons and gods. miniature cities with all the details each has a story line and meaningful insights to contemplate. The Tiger Balm money was put to wild use. Lots of repair work going on right now but it will even more spectacular when finished. LOts of up and down hills and steps that will wear you out. Very worth the long train ride to get there. fun for everyone"
,,A tiger waiting to leap forward,3.0,,"After arriving in Singapore in 1995, InsightSuite rented an apartment at Gloria Mansion which is two minutes’ walk away from this attraction & it was a time when a close colleague mentioned that “The best things in life are free” & to me it meant entry to this garden where bus load of tourists used to arrive numbering over a million per year at its peak popularity (mu friend who said that may have meant e-mail, Wi-Fi, Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn or other stuff). After writing so many reviews on TripAdvisor I always wondered how come I missed this one & hence made it a point to get some pictures before writing this review. This place is one of the earliest constructions of over 8 decades by two businessman brothers who made fortune in sales of famous Tiger Balm ointment. It will be liked by anyone who fancy ‘Alice in wonderland’ or do & don’t type of Chinese mythology. It can be reached by MRT train station by the same name just below & according me is a prime property spot waiting for the right launch of take-off. It is recently undergoing renovation & painting but once completed with little additional modernization will be a perfect visit spot if you want to an evening in the open because you can order anything online for free then why go to the mall?"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"This is under construction & updating. It was included as part of a tour we were on. I'm glad I didn't 'pay' for this. It maybe better when update is finished. The ten stages of hell although gruesome, was the best display. Bit scary for kids. No toilets available on the day due to construction"
,,So awesomely kitchy,4.0,,"We visited Haw Par with small children. It is under a lot of construction and some of the exhibits have a lot of damage and need a lot of work. The 10 gates of hell was super awesome and pretty gruesome. My kids 7 and 5 loved it. They do have English translations of what is going on and the penalties that are being doled out. Very, very unique attraction. Glad that it is being repaired."
,,Suitable for kids,4.0,,The 10 Courts of hell as described in Buddhist traditions. It is alright to bring your kids along as it lets them know that there is always a punishment in their wrong doings and its not that scary as I have seen many adults bringing their children there.
,,Interesting,3.0,,This place is interesting yet scary at some point. Especially the 7 level of hell! Besides that it is educational to a certain extent on what you believe in. They need to restore and maintain this place soon.
,,Graphic - you've been warned!,5.0,,"10 courts of hell as described in Buddhist traditions. Very graphic in nature, but quite thorough. Not suitable for kids."
,,"For connoisseurs of naive art, fairy tales and kitsch",5.0,,"This used to be one of the most popular Singapore tourist destinations but has dropped off the radar in recent decades. Used to be known as the Tiger Balm Gardens. When I visited one Saturday morning there were very few other visitors and we had the place to ourselves. It consists of thousands of statues and tableaus illustrating Chinese deities, myths and tales. The shabbiness of the statues with their faded paint work only adds to the charm."
,,Free entry,4.0,,The colourful figurines are eye catching and interesting. The stories the figurines depicted are rich and meaningful. We enjoyed walking through the little pathways and steps. Hope there would be more information about the park and more easily navigable paths when the renovation work is completed.
,,Something different,4.0,,"A hillside park full of scenes and sculptures in a mix of cultural/traditional with the surreal plus a bit of kitsch. Some love it, others hate it. I find it interesting. The Ten Courts of Hell exhibit is not for the faint-hearted and not suitable for children due to its content of graphic violence. Best to visit in the morning: less heat, less people. Currently there is a lot of construction work going on."
,,Go for the Ten courts of hell,3.0,,"This is your cup of tea or it's not. I liked the Ten Courts of Hell, it was greatly disturbing, brilliant. The rest of the park I enjoyed less. But I presume that other people will think the other way around.
Bear in mind that the Ten Courts of Hell are no place for young children! The scenes depicted there are very disturbing!"
,,quirky and unusual,4.0,,This place is very far even by MRT. It took us almost 45 minutes to reach by MRT from orchard road. So plan travel accordingly. You do have a direct bus to orchard from the bus stop which is right outside the MRT. If i remember it correctly its 131. its adjacent to the MRT station. the place is under renovation and hence we could only see the ten courts of hell. It depicts the various punishments a person has to go through for their sins and then reach salvation. No entry fee and is made by Haw and Par - 2 brothers. Its the off beaten thing to do and I personally enjoyed visiting this place even though its far..
,,Very unusual and being renovated,3.0,,Full of Buddhist and Chinese mythology including the `10 courts of Hell. This appears to be under long term and much overdue renovation. So very noisy with all the work and quite a number of areas out of bounds and covered up. Will hopefully be much improved when renovation works are finished.
,,Bizarre and brilliant - but watch your feet!,4.0,,"This park created by the owners of Tiger balm is top of my must visit things to do in Singapore, and it's free! Even on a grey and grizzly day, the colours, animal characters and mythological stories cheer me up no end, and there's plenty of instagram-worthy photo opportunities.

However.... the park is being renovated, so watch out for construction blocking walkways and exposing holes, (with lots of interesting signage) and unfortunately on my visit the 10 Courts of hell was closed (I was obviously a good girl!), so don't leave your visit to the end of the day, try to visit before 3pm."
,,Baroque and flamboyant,5.0,,"Wow I absolutely love this place! The whole place is so detailed, gives you history and background of the Chinese people as well as a great atmosphere to walk around in.
10 Levels of Hell are so grotesque and amazing I could have spent hours in there.
I highly advise checking this out if you're in Singapore.
Note the 10 Levels of Hell might be a bit scary if you have young kids."
,,Chinese Mythology Park,4.0,,I've visited this place a long time ago with my father before. At that time this place is still new. Now this place is a bit run down but I'm glad that they renovate this place now. It's a pity that when I visit this place a few days ago is still under renovation so it doesn't look good as before. But it's still a good place to visit to know about Chinese Mythology.
,,Interesting to see the chinese legends,3.0,,There is lots of restoration work still going on since i last visited but you can still get the idea of the place to keep Chinese stories alive. Easy to get and entrance is free. There is no cafe there now so you need to take a drink with you although it does say no outside drinks or food.Steep pathways to the top.I hope to see it completed one day.
,,CHINESE HISTORIC CULTURE,4.0,,"Colorful theme park, nice and very good ambiance.. if you are looking for peaceful place to hang out i suggest you must visit this place."
,,Interesting (if slightly kitch) theme park,4.0,,"This is an interesting place to visit in Singapore. It was developed by the brothers who developed Tiger Balm. It depicts different dimensions of Chinese mythology and the consequences of leading a good (or a bad) life. The dioramas show what happens to people who cheat on their taxes, are not kind to their parents, who drink and gamble, etc. It is not too far from Vivo City."
,,An interesting intro to Chinese mythology,4.0,,"We visited this attraction after reading good reviews. It was very interesting and a bit quirky but a great free fun activity. It's right next to the Haw Par Villa MRT which is very convenient. There is lots of walking and climbing stairs involved, would recommend bringing a hat, sunscreen and plenty of water as it was very hot when we visited. It was a bit disappointing that there was construction and maintenance work taking place when we visited but this will make the attraction even better for those visiting on the future."
,,A Trippy Trip to the one of a kind garden in the world,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa aka Tiger Balm Garden, was a villa build out of a brotherly love. In 1937 Aw Boon Haw (Tiger) decided to build this beautiful Villa for his younger brother, Aw Boon Par (Leopard). Hence the name Haw Par Villa, the Villa of Tiger and Leopard.
With myth and stories from Buddhism, Toaism and Chinese Folklore, it intertwined to creat this fascinating, even trippy Garden of wax figurines. It has lots of gore, violence and even nudity depicted here. And to boggle the mind further, there are some totally out of place foreign figurine added to the mix.
To be there, one needed to suspense one's belief and logic and just be weirdly surprise by all that are in display there.
Be warned that not all figurines are child friendly, the most infamous display is in the Ten Gates of Hell tunnel. Well, most of the kids born in the 80s and before had been scared shitless in this tunnel. There was a time it can be ""enjoyed"" by taking a boat ride through this tunnel of hell. Imagine those kids that were tricked into this ride by their parents, it must have left a scar. So be warned!
The entrance is free and it is open from 9am to 7pm, with a MRT conveniently locate beside it.
Do note that it is undergoing renovation in part of the garden, so does get messy some what.
Oh, btw, if you ask any Singaporean, most will deny its existence!
So have a trippy fun!"
,,Park Under Major Renovation,2.0,,"Visited Haw Par Villa on 5 Nov 2016. The themepark is under major renovation. Doing repair to their drainage system. The repair works caused closure to few attractions within the park. Cordons were almost everywhere. One of the famous one is ""10 Stages Of Hell"". Also seen huge monitor lizard moving about. Contractors moving all over. Everything were simply so messy.

Little disappointedt that unable to enjoy the attraction and the irresponsible themepark did not put any notice and continued to.collect $5 parking fee from visitors.

Visitors to check the exact dates of the repair works completion otherwise its not worth the effort to make a trip there. My humble opiniin it will be fortunate to comllete by December."
,,Very Interesting,3.0,,"An interesting place if you wanna learn about the Chinese culture, how their concept on life after death. Some statues were scary looking."
,,"Chinese myths garden, great number of sculptures, nice walk",3.0,,"Nice ground, good place to walk aimlessly since there's something to be seen in every turn; there were even underground tunnels. Think it would be fun for kids. Easy enough to navigate, so kids could run freely to look around. Great number of sculptures, would be better if you're already familiar with classic chinese stories. Some sculptures were jumbled together, even with some explanatory note it was hard to find what they were all about. Lots of place to sit, some place were shaded and large enough for family to have picnic. Pity about 1/3 of the whole area were closed for renovations, but I could imagine it needs huge effort to maintain all the sculptures stay in the good condition outdoor. The 10 courts of hell were really nastily graphic, I do think it's not for children. I sounded the bell of prosperity and longevity, and thrown a coin for a wish into the wishing pond. The most unique structure for me was the signature pond, would be even more beautiful if the pond taken care of properly. Lots of beautiful spot could use more maintenance, not just fresh paint. Lots of nice selfie spot, if you're into it. Bring your hat and water on sunny day."
,,Remarkable FREE tour in an amusing place,5.0,,"I was so entertained to see those thousand of statues which project different stories. Some are amusingly weird with the faces of animals and bodies of humans. Other sculptures depict the culture and history in Singapore.

Haw Par Villa is one of my most fave attractions and in Singapore."
,,Fascinating.,5.0,,"This park is free, we spent the whole afternoon there fascinated by the sculptures and displays. The facial expressions, detail and bright colours make the park well worth a visit. We were very surprised to see a couple of yellow kiwi standing on the grass."
,,Still worth a stop if you're close,2.0,,"I wouldn't put this on your must see list. I gave it a ""poor"" because ""average"" would not be accurate for Singapore. However, it's still worth a visit if you are close by and have an extra half hour to be stuck in the heat. As of late October 2016, it is undergoing a remodel. I don't know how much they are going to do, but it desperately needs a lot of help. This is an old plaster and concrete statue structure. Like Disney's Pirates of Caribbean style of statuettes... some of it quite dark if you read the stories, and look closely. There is a lot of art here, and a lot of effort went into building this a long time ago. There is no respite from the heat here, so make it a quick visit, and check to see if they are done with the remodel. I would go again to check out what they did, but I'll probably not be making another trip to Singapore, this was a chance 10 day visit to see where my wife has been working."
,,Punishment for Every Sin,5.0,,"This attraction is unique in that the place is dominated by huge statues important to Chinese Mythology. Each huge figure carries a story with it. It becomes even more interesting because it tries to preserve the Chinese culture in Singapore.

The main focus of the park though, is the Ten Courts of Hell. You may omit the other areas but never skip this cave encased exhibit. The different dioramas speak of the crimes one can commit and its commensurate punishment in hell. Most of the scenes are gory and may need parental guidance for children 13 years old and below. It is pretty engaging to know how bad ones will suffer in hell. The court may serve as a reminder to guests to be good at all times while still living on earth.

Haw Par Villa has its own MRT station. You wouldn't find it difficult to reach the place. Remember to bring your umbrella, fan, water and an open mind!"
,,A crazy theme park on Buddhist and Chinese mythology,4.0,,"This theme park is free of charge and is definitely worth a visit. There are many statues/sculptures on Buddhist and Chinese mythology, one of the most memorable being the Ten Courts of Hell. Whoever designed the park must have been on drugs because many of the sculptures are just crazy. However, it is an easy way to learn more about Chinese and Buddhist beliefs. The area is deceptively big so make sure you have a couple of hours to visit this place.

Although there were lot of renovation going on, meaning that some areas were inaccessible, it didn't bother much."
,,Crazy place,5.0,,"I had seen pictures of this place sometime back and it seemed to me to be completely bonkers. I was not disappointed. As I had a bus to catch to Malaysia, I was short on time, so couldn't fully enjoy it. Plus there is a lot of on going construction happening around the Area so you can't really see the whole thing (visited 30th September).
Anyway , as you get off the MRT , the main gate is right there and the crazy statues welcome you. The place is usually deserted and if you find someone their either its a ghost or someone searching for Pokemon's. I had not been initiated with Chinese concept of hell so the 10 gates of hell exhibit was fantastic learning experience. Everything was killing every other thing in the whole theme park. The state of affairs of the place is kinda sad and crumbling but I think because it is so unique now it should be completely preserved."
,,This theme park is in need of a major revamp as even USS's Halloween theme is much better,3.0,,"This theme park has been around and opened since 1937. Its the 21st century now and the management of the theme park should seriously look into bringing this theme park into the 21st century instead of staying in the post World War 2 era.

The exhibits are shabby looking and should be revamped. Include some other activities that would draw in the crowds - especially the younger generations."
,,Free Attraction in Singapore,4.0,,Haw Par Villa is owned by the same owners of Tiger Balm. Entrance is free to all visitors. There is a wax museum exhibit and lots of activities available to visitors.
,,Bizarre and strangely Brilliant,5.0,,"If you have time in Singapore, pop this one into your itinerary to mix it up a little.
Before TV there was this place, and Singaporean families visited to entertain and educate their kids. A great place to learn about about Chinese mythology.
Yes, it's sadly run down, according to one person we spoke to, there's just one man looking after all the maintenance, but it appears that there's lots of work occurring, so maybe it's about to have a huge upgrade.
The '10 gates of hell' is just as you'd expect!! Creepy and fascinating.
There is a food place directly across the road if you get hungry. Not much shade so take hats etc. Easy access via MRT.
Completely free of charge to enter, and completely bizarre. In a good way."
,,Quirky but feels a bit abandoned :).,3.0,,"This is a wonderfully quirky place to learn about Chinese folklore, history and mythology through various statues and displays. The star attraction is the 10 courts of hell, which I am told by fellow Singaporean friends is where their parents used to take them to punish them for being naughty. I can understand why though as the displays are pretty graphic, especially for young children.

Haw Par Villa is free to enter but the place does feel a bit abandoned and has the vibe that it is past its glory days. When mum and I visited in the morning, we noticed there were more staff working on maintaining the grounds than there were tourists.

I would recommend wearing mosquito repellent when visiting as there were lots of mosquitoes about the 10 courts of hell area, which was quite darkly lit. The whole attraction can be completed in under 2 hours even when walking at a leisurely pace. The garden area is quite pretty and they have ponds filled with baby tortoises! :)"
,,See it while it's still there.,4.0,,"Other reviews I've seen about Haw Par Villa sum it up quite well in that it is 'quirky' and informative of Chinese mythology. It's a park full of brightly painted sculptures and dioramas that I, as a westerner, found very amusing and bizarre. I went on my own but can't wait to bring my wife and teenage kids there for a good laugh. Many of the scenes were quite graphic (depictions of violence and 'adult' concepts) so parents of young kids might want to go to Sentosa instead.
I was there on a hot afternoon and was very glad I took water with me - there didn't seem to be any shop or kiosk open when I was there, and there's some shade but not much. Good thing there was only me and a few other people there.
It seems like the type of place that used to be popular...but not now. The whole place looks a bit...tired. Some of the older, more faded sculptures were being refurbished so hopefully that's an indication that the park is there to stay. It's on prime land that is ripe for re-development so I'd say don't wait too long to see it.
It's not a big park but it's on a hill with a variety of paths from roads to rickety narrow paths with steps so wheelchair access would be somewhat limited but not impossible. Older visitors might struggle with the incline and dodgy paths.
I wouldn't come here for a picnic as I remember seeing a sign about not bringing your own food - maybe that was an old sign from back when the park was a bustling hive of activity with a busy shop and cafe. The only staff I saw there was 1 or 2 painters...no-one likely to tell you off for bringing food. Entry was free...or maybe there was just no-one on duty to sell me a ticket.
The MRT couldn't be any closer unless it was inside the park. It's right at the entrance. Easy. Enjoy."
,,Haw par villa,4.0,,Haw par villa is nice recreational park in Chinese style . It was also known as tiger balm gardens . It has colourful sculptures of Chinese God and goddess . Specially laughing Buddha .something different and very picturesque.amust
,,Very Strange,5.0,,A very strange place but very eye opening. It's definitely worth doing a tour around here so they can tell you exactly what it is about. Again be prepared to walk a little
,,It's alright,3.0,,It's something you must have seen if you're into the Asian mythology and religion. In my opinion it's really boring. But it's definitely worth a quick visit if you're nearby.
,,Quirky and amazing!,5.0,,"As lovers of abandoned and semi-abandoned places, theme parks, and mythology, this place was right up our alley. An incredible free experience in Singapore, and very entertaining. I think we took more photos here than anywhere else in Singapore, and have recommended it to all our friends. Not your typical tourist attraction.
Note: the vision of hell is quite graphic (unsurprisingly!) and may be unsettling, especially for small kids!"
,,"Weird, wonderful and very informative",5.0,,"A friend told us about this place and we thought that it was worth a visit.
Wow.....they were right. Full of history and lots of weird and wonderful statues / scenes.
If you go to where the lady and her husband sell snacks, there are lots of information boards for you to have a read of.
It gives you a breakdown of how Tiger Balm was invented.
Definitely worth a visit and it is free.

There is quite a bit of renovation works being carried out, so you cannot visit all areas. But once l works are competed it will be even better!!"
,,Chinese Mythology Haw Par Villa,4.0,,"For people who is interested in History of Haw Paw Villa, Tiger Balm Garden, Chinese Mythology, Buddhism teaching,Journey to the West and Ten Court of Hell. Interesting story but had to spend some time to read. Entrance fee is free and it's just outside of Haw Paw Villa Mrt Station.Best time to go is early in the morning more cooling."
,,Worth Your Time,4.0,,It's next to the Haw Par Villa MRT. It's free. That's the positive. The negative it's a little bit run down. It's all about Chinese Folklore and Buddhism teachings. Good people succeed and bad people go to the ten gates of hell.
,,The place to learn Chinese mythology,4.0,,"It's Easy to reach this place by Haw Par Villa MRT station, the entrance are free. I learn a lot Chinese mythology there including: journey to the west, Ten court of hells ( oh my God I was thinking this is will happens after we're die), eight immortal, tiger balm, white snake tale.
Just 1 hour max to finish this place to visit. Worth to visit."
,,"Very odd, but enjoyable",4.0,,"You only need 30 mins here. It's a very strange place with statues and sculptures representing Chinese mythology.
I found it very quirky (no offence intended) and quite enjoyed walking around reading the placards.
As it doesn't take much out of your day, I'd definitely recommend visiting."
,,Visit Haw Par Villa!,5.0,,"A very unique place in Singapore where you can wander off to a world of Chinese mythology sculpture display, it looks very real before your eyes. It had this very cool cave that display 18 level of hell, the various type of punishment given to you after death. Take a train to Haw Par Villa for visit. Take lots of pictures and make sure you bring your own water."
,,"Equal parts fascinating, tacky and nightmare-inducing",4.0,,"This is a (free!) park filled with various dioramas of various aspects of Chinese mythology, including Journey to the West. There's about ten areas in total, the most (in)famous being the depictions of hell. They are extremely graphic - you see individuals being sawed, impaled and all other gruesome manners of death. It's a unique experience certainly, though maybe not for children."
,,Learning Experience,5.0,,You can take the MRT and get there or take a taxi. It is far from the main area but well worth your time. It explains the belief systems of the culture and has some very real art sculptures of how things happen as they do or why. You learn about the family that once lived and donated that great park area. It is old but has been redone and freshly painted. Go for a walk and learn about the culture in a way you will never forget.
,,A must see before they tear it down,4.0,,Haw Par Villa is definitely something you will not see at home. We would have liked to know more about the stories behind the statues. A little creepy but go with an opened mind.
,,A bit boring,3.0,,"You can see a lot of statues, some of them in bizarre or cruel positions. But without a background in Chinese history the context is missing most of the times and it seems a bit pointless to wander around in the garden of statues. Go there if you're in the area, but not really worth a longer detour in my opinion."
,,18 Levels of Hell...,4.0,,"Fascinating and creepy experience, Definitely a must go for all tourists to take a sneak peek into the Taoism/Buddhism beliefs.
Can be a little scary for the small ones, so it's better to stay outside if they are afraid.

Generally teaches about some Chinese values and all. Most of the structures are revamped, so it looks quite nice now."
,,Different!,4.0,,Interesting story behind the park and interesting if slightly strange sculptures. Could do with a little more TLC and perhaps a small coin fee for entering the park could go towards improving the upkeep. Still worth a visit if looking for something different.
,,Kooky and crazy place to visit,4.0,,"This theme park has a long history. It was someone's private garden that he opened up to the public before becoming a theme park.

The theme park is free and when you are in, you can see weird and wonderful statues that tell you many stories. One of the story being told is what happens when someone goes to hell.

All the stories are morality tales so even they are a bit creepy and weird it is family friendly.

If you like something kooky and weird do visit Haw Par Villa."
,,"Great, interesting place, creepy which is why I liked it.",5.0,,"I highly recommend visiting here. It was a bit creepy, but I found it to be one of the most memorable parts of my visit to Singapore."
,,A lovely quirky attraction that is a must-see,4.0,,"We were taken here by a local who felt it was worth seeing on our last sightseeing day in Singapore. The level of detail (as well as the ongoing upkeep) necessary this construction is very impressive and can only be appreciated by a visit. For me the highlight was the 'Ten Courts of Hell', flanked by the Ox-Headed and Horse-Faced Guards of Hell. For one who was under the misunderstanding of Buddhism as a kind, benevolent religion the level of gore gloried in here was a bit of a revelation."
,,Free and interesting forklore,4.0,,"Great experience, there was a free entry to the venue and it is conveniently located steps from the Haw Par Villa train station. It has a lot of statues and some are very interesting.

There is a section called gates of hell - it shows the various ways people were punished- it is very graphic intensive and definitely not recommended for the kids. But after seeing this section, now I know where Mortal Kombat got their fatalities ideas from ;-)"
,,Weird but unique,4.0,,"This was described to us as a theme park without rides which was the builders intention, apparently....

Now it is very unique, it was built by the owners of tiger balm and depicts a lot of Chinese mythology and stories. It's is well worth a visit just for how graphic some of the scenes are but where it comes to life is the waterfalls and the setting.

There isn't a lot to do there except enjoy the decorations etc but it's well worth seeing"
,,The lesser known weird theme park in Singapore,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa in Singapore is what Universal Studios is to the world...its filled with funny looking characters and statues telling a folklore/story less the buzz, thrilling rides, numerous merchandise and snack stands...LOL

Steeped in Taoist/Chinese folklore, Haw Par Villa was built by two brothers from the Myanmar who happen to be the founding fathers of the brand - Tiger Balm. If you can't read Chinese, fret not, the signage or explanation of each scene /statue has descriptions in English.

The main highlight is the 18 levels of hell exhibit which depicts scenes from Hell with relevance to the different crimes/ moral transgressions and their relevant punishments dealt out by hell's minions. Think a horror house but without the mechanical scares.

A great place to bring my overseas friends to see weird stuff and have a good scare/ laugh about it. Best part in expensive Singapore is that this attraction is FREE!

PS: Remember bring a bottle of holy water and mosquito repellent for the bloodsuckers in this place are hungry af. :D"
,,Free & Ineteresting,5.0,,It's different and worth the visit if you like statues. I went to it after the botanical garden since it was on the same line.
,,Chinese culture,2.0,,Used to be a popular tourist site in the 80s. However it is now faded and needs an upgrade. It is free to enter and worth a visit if you have time to kill.
,,Chinese cultural,5.0,,It is free admission and takes you through Chinese mythology of gates of hell. It was a fascinating tour. Worth a couple of hour of one's time.
,,Land of Many Chinese Tales,4.0,,"Visited Haw Par Villa today. Little visitors on this Saturday afternoon. Admission to the park is free but $5 parking fee for those who drives.

Spent 1.5 hours walking inside this park, perspiring throughout under the 33 degrees heat. There's no restaurant inside just a little beverages stall. Few drinks vending machines.

Not much maintenance done, the exhibits are still old with faded paint. Good education for people who wishes to understand the Chinese methodology such as (1) Madam White Snake; (2) 8 Immortals; (3) Journey to The West; (4) Buddha Teachings; etc.

Enjoyed."
,,"Faded glory from a bygone age, totally bonkers to this westerner but a must see since it's free!",4.0,,"It was almost deserted when we visited this weekday in June. Apart from myself and Mrs Vicar there were just five other visitors and a maintenance man halfway up some scaffolding repairing a statue. We had no idea why he chose that piece to renovate since it looked like the best part of the park. The whole place has seen better days with peeling paint on the sculptures aplenty. It all harks back to a bygone age. However, this does give it a unique charm all of its own and it would be a shame if the site fell in to the hands of property developers and this heritage is lost. One can only imagine when this would have been teeming with visitors but they would now prefer to stare into their smart phones for stimulation instead.

Mrs Vicar visited this park several times when she was a teenager in the early 70's. What was once a glossy attraction then, just looks run down and tired to her now. To me, it looked totally bonkers, especially when we came across a row of kangaroos and emus next to a gorilla and a tortoise riding a multi coloured goose cum peacock with human legs. It reminded me of the time I had a night of hallucinations after a spell of violent sunstroke.

There are a lot of tableaux depicting very moral and valid stories which hold true today and should be respected, irrespective of culture or religion. It's free and has a MRT and bus station right by the entrance and offers a glimpse back in time. It's well worth an hour of anyone's time since you won't see the like of it anywhere else. (We didn't see the gruesome part of the park since it was incredibly hot and we'd seen enough by the time we came across it)"
,,Complete waste of time,1.0,,"This was part of a well-organised Viator ""Round the Island"" tour, but for most of the group it was a complete and utter waste of time, as we were rushed through the Changi Museum visit.
The majority of the exhibits are of a gruesome nature man with people being skewered, cut in half, subject to various barbaric tortures, etc- are you getting the picture? This was for me, the nadir of any aspect of Singaporean life/culture and should not have been included in the itinerary. However what else can one expect from an exhibition entitled ""The ten stages in the Courts of Hell"".
Facilities on site are extremely limited and vending machines empty, so self cater."
,,One of the strangest sights in Singapore,4.0,,"Like the title says... From a distance, it almost looks like a put-put course. It's a bizarre ""theme park"" that you can walk through in about an hour. DO NOT MISS the 10 Stages of Hell. It must be seen to be believed!"
,,Worth a couple of hours,4.0,,"I never visited Haw Par Villa when I lived in Singapore but a recent trip back gave me the opportunity on a day off. It's easy to get to on the MRT, having it's own stop just outside, and entry is free. I will admit to being unable to follow many of the stories set out in the sculptures but, nevertheless, it was an interesting couple of hours. The sculptures themselves varied in style from traditional to gruesome with all sorts of weird and wonderful things in between. I'd happily go back again."
,,Still life freak show,4.0,,"Literally outside Haw Par Villa MRT station, this attraction is weird, spooky, amusing, interesting and culturally educational. I wouldn't call it a must-see but it's free and a good way to spend 2 - 4 hours, depending on your endurance. There is much to see and read. The Ten Courts of Hell is an eye-opener! If it doesn't scare you into a highly moral citizen, nothing will. Displaying much blood and gore, I suggest checking it out before taking little ones into this dim section.

It is a hot place with concrete everywhere. There are toilets and an undercover eating area but not much in the way of food and drinks except a few vending machines. The drink machines were mainly empty when I was there. Bring your own.

There are hardly any restaurants within walking distance of Haw Par Villa. We got back on the train and alighted at Pasir Panjang station. The Pasir Panjang Food Centre is next to the station (look behind you after exiting) with heaps of hawker stalls."
,,Must- Visit Attraction!,4.0,,"Har Paw Villa is a unique theme park based on the Chinese mythology, folklore, legends, history, and illustrations of various aspects of Confucianism and Buddhism. The most famous part of Har Paw Villa is the 10 courts of Hell. Har Paw Villa is easily accessible by the Har Paw Villa MRT, and it admission is free. The park is opened from 9am to 7pm while the 10 courts of Hell closes at 5.30pm.

If you are keen to know more and learn more about Chinese culture, this is an awesome place to understand it."
,,educational for all and memorable,5.0,,"the sculptures were so detailed, it really taught my family about doing good. we also learned that we should not do things to others that we do not want for ourselves. it was really memorable!"
,,Tiger Balm Gardens,4.0,,"It was wonderful to see that Haw Par Villa has been returned to it's original configuration after the disastrous attempt to turn it into a Dragon World. I congratulate the people of Singapore in keeping their heritage intact. I visited, for the first time, in 1964 and had a lot of enjoyment walking through the familiar gardens again."
,,Chinese mythology,4.0,,The place exhibits chinese mythology and history in form of statues and dioramas. Most famous is the 10 Courts of Hell.
,,A strange but fascinating place,4.0,,Definitely worth a visit. A very interesting and sort of disturbing at times (especially the Ten Courts of Hello! ) but an fascinating glimpse into some regional religion. Plus it's free!
,,A bizarre collection of slightly run-down sculptures,3.0,,"Easily accessible, right next to the MRT station that bears its name, Haw Par Villa is a bizarre exhibit that could use a little love an care. Thought the shabbiness somewhat adds to the perplexing aesthetic, it would be a lot more impressive with some updating and more information about the dioramas. The Ten Courts of Hell were very graphic and informative and a very interesting experience.

Overall, we would not pay for it, but as it is free it is a interesting way to spend an hour."
,,One of my Favorites in Singapore,5.0,,"This is such a strange collection of art and sculptures. You'll never see it anywhere else and it's a must do. I believe the creator was the one who invented the Tiger Balm. I could be wrong. But like there is so much to see and it's free. You can take a nice walk through it all in 30 minutes or walk slower and admire all the strangeness. It's my opinion that tourists should definitely go see this if you're here for 4-5 days. However, I know most people would disagree with me. But you can make it a quick experience if you're short on time. It's massive and so weird. You gotta see it."
,,Not for kids.. Chinese's 10 stages of underworld,3.0,,"The owner of Tiger Balm builded this place for public used. I was no admission fee.

I found that a lot of those torture statues was full of blood on scenes. Most of them were topless. So, this place not a good place for teaching young kid what the results when they did a bad thing. It was too hard-core.

It's OK, if you just visit this place with your partner or family with teenagers. But not for young kid below 18 years old though."
,,Fantastic atmosphere!,5.0,,"I felt in this place, was ""the collapse of the common sense."" Human beings will feel that you understand it with respect to things, the selfish meaning. However, here, it does not Spoken at all. But, take it bare the sight in front of the eye. The brain is a very peaceful place. Anything I do not need to interpret. Just simple, look, feel, enjoy. Please try a visit if you are interested in metaphysics."
,,Weird but not wonderful = Bizarre and badly maintained,2.0,,"Took an international visitor to see Haw Par Villa as she was interested in seeing things off the beaten track. Well, let's say this was right on the mosquito track. We came in the late afternoon and wandered through badly painted chipped and broken bits of statue intersperced with stagnant stinking pools of water, slapping mosquitos as we went ... (and then saw the ""you are in a dengue area sign as we drove out"" - thanks for that - had to warn her to see a travel clinic if she had fever or aches when she got home. This could be a really interesting place. But it needs a lot of investment. We wouldn't mind paying entrance if there was better information and background available but even the signage was poor. It looks like something that primary school students cobbled together."
,,Tiger Balm Garden not your average Gnomes,4.0,,"Its not everyones cup of tea - its a collection of concrete figurines telling a story and a memorial of the two brothers who brought the world Tiger Balm and the Tiger Balm Gardnes.
It has an MRT on its door step.
Its steep so bring your best walking shoes.
And its damm bizzare :) - The 10 courts of hell could pass as a script for a hellraiser movie.
If anything, you have to admire whats been achieved here. I was sceptical as well when i entered but it does have a way of drawing your in, driven by fascination."
,,AVOID,1.0,,"Myself and my wife had last visited Haw Par Villa in 1996 and I remembered a thriving tourist attraction where the dragon dance show still lingers in my memory. This trip was a complete let down.

Poor quality exhibits, practically no signage and no interactive features. I'm still trying to figure out what the Statue of liberty and depictions of popular Western children's' tales were doing in a place supposedly devoted to explaining and depicting Chinese mythology. Even the management and the staff seem to have given up, there was hardly a soul to be seen.

The location is nice though. A beautiful green hill right next to the Haw par villa station on the Circle MRT line.

Go to the main gate on the main road, take a photo of the main theme and you've about seen everything."
,,For those with a twisted humour,4.0,,"Welcome to the wonderful world created by the Tiger balm brothers. Weird statues and dioramas showing Chinese mythology and folk tales. Many of these are quite graphic with rabid rabbits warring with rats, depictions of punishments administered in hell and somehow some statues of koalas and emus (not sure what Chinese folk tale involves Australian animals). Anyway, it's all a good bit of a laugh but don't expect anything to fantastic."
,,Good Fun,4.0,,The Haw Par Villa is located next to the MRT station. It has seen better days but this is part of its charm as it is one of the few places in Singapore that is not all sparkling and new. Our four year old grandson loved climbing up the stairs and posing with the statues. The Gates of Hell is a bit gross but is interesting for its culture. Visit this place and enjoy its faded charm and hope it is not replaced by sanitised apartments.
,,Very Godd,5.0,,"One of the free attractions is Singapore, Haw Par Villa was formerly the residence of the owner of Tiger Balm. Now a garden, its well maintained. Most of the statues relate to Chinese Mythology. Worth a visit coz its free"
,,"I am glad it is FREE, for I might not be willing to pay",3.0,,"Actually I would not say it is a lousy place. Some effort has been put in to keep the place clean, the statues are not faded and still relatively brightly coloured.
Lots of interesting statues to take photos with, and I think the most interesting segment is the 10 Levels of Hell.
Overall, I think if you like just admiring the statues, or you truly love Chinese mythology, I guess it is not bad a place to try. After all, it is FREE and VERY accessible by MRT.
Try to go in the evening when it is cooler. Lest you will experience HELL as it is.

Closes at 6pm."
,,So bad it's good!,5.0,,"We have visited Singapore many times. We actually visited Haw Par Villa about 5 years ago. It was being renovated, but the dioramas are probably still similar. I loved the one dedicated to the journey of Tripitaka. The ones dedicated to the 10 terrible deaths were pretty horrific. It's a wonderful gesture for the brothers to open this park to the people of Singapore. It was great to see so many locals, especially children, enjoying the displays. I think many visitors can relate the park to something like it close to their home. A similarly passionately built depiction of an historic event or tale that isn't quite right and probably gives children nightmares. Perhaps the renovation got rid of the ""not quite right"" element. In a way it would be a pity because I guess that is why it is so well loved."
,,Culture place,5.0,,This place are more teaching us do the right things and don't do the harmful social. I strongly recommend everybody must visit the hades.
,,Are you brave enough to go though the ten courts of Hell?,5.0,,"Haw Paw Village or Tiger Balm park.
I really enjoyed this place. It is free to get in however you will not get the story behind it all.
We booked a tour with Tour East and had a guided tour with a lady Dragon.

It was well worth the money and it was a great insight to the story of the brothers who invented Tiger Balm.
If you just go and have a look it is good however having the guided tour made it excellent.
This place must be saved for the future otherwise it will end up as a block of flats.
Please visit it, you can catch a train there and it is a two minute walk from the station."
,,Chinese culture in sculptures,4.0,,"Been here for sightseeing and was occupied by the Chinese history and culture. There are sculptures of Chinese stories with brief introduction about it. The most remembered was the 10 hell court display as it depicts what would happen in the afterlife. There are also other stories like Sun Wu Kong, white snake lady and various sculptures portraying life lessons.

The admission is free and feel free to take photos. The sculptures are a bit unattended as some paint started to come off and cracks are sometimes visible on the sculptures. There are several restricted places that must not be entered. Some sculptures especially from the 10 hell court are demeaning as it might display some inappropriate scenes."
,,AWESOME !! I'd give it 6 stars if I could !!,5.0,,Loved our visit.....even the teenage son enjoyed it !!! and hubby had a chance to reminisce :) Yeah it's kind of kitschy but it's full of educational and cultural information and right next to the MRT station. I'd highly recommend it and hope you take the time to visit - please don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed !!!!
,,Chinese Story,3.0,,"It is all the Chinese story, chinese gods, hells. I just stopped by there an hour because it is too hot to walk during the day."
,,Weird place,1.0,,"This is one of the weirdest place in Singapore. If you're interested to see some old Chinese tales depicted in amateurish looking sculptures, or Chinese version of hell, again depicted in badly done sculptures, then this is the place to visit. While some of the displays were trying to communicate good moral values, there are better ways (or place) to learn those values.
Overall this is not a place worth visiting, other than if you just want to see something weird."
,,Extraordinary place! One of a Kind,4.0,,"This place is the Chinese vision of hell, and is absolutely extraordinary. The place touch do with a lick of paint, but apart from that the sometimes shocking gruesome and bizarre iconography encapsulates. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Free, close to public transport.
Take a step back in time, to Mr Tiger Balms estate.
It's run down, it's a bit like time forgot it. But it's interesting.
I was really looking forward to seeing it. It was ok, a bit weird (especially the 10 courts of hell) cultural experience. Look for the live turtles and squirrels.
I'm glad it still exists."
,,So boring,1.0,,This place is so dilapidated and seem to collapse anytime. Nothing has been done to improve the place.
,,Amazing place and historic park too,5.0,,"This is the place that all Singaporeans brought their children in the 70s and 80s. Due for extensive renovations in 2016 it's well worth visiting to see the thousands of statues and dioramas of Chinese mythology. Incredibly colourful and often surreal, you're bound to take a lot of photos. The park is below your usual standards of tidiness but that adds to the charm. I recommend booking a guided tour to really make the most of it. Journeys are the guide operators. Carol Dragon was my guide, very professional. Park entrance is free, probably the cheapest tourist attraction in Singapore!"
,,"Get the most out of one-of-a-kind Haw Par Villa by going with Original Singapore Walks. Also, bring a parasol.",4.0,,"Not perhaps the very highest-priority tourist attraction in Singapore, but I'd always meant to try to get out here. So glad we were able to take a tour with Hemlata of Original Singapore Walks, because there is a lot to understand about Chinese mythology and philosophy, as well as the Tiger Balm brothers' history, and it's not all laid out in the signs. Not by a long shot.

This is a quirky place. The Aw brothers put it together quirkily and the successive curators of the site have made quirky choices about what they saved and rearranged. So, you can see a replica Tiger Balm promotional car, a random assortment of stereotypical tourist icons from other countries and a cross-section of large dioramas and colourful sculptures drawn from Chinese myths...

... and of course the famous circles of hell. They warn now against bringing sensitive young children in there. Hemlata's grandmother used to bring her grandkids there regularly. ""Yes, we've pondered that statue of the cheating student being disembowelled, Grandma, can we go get our ice cream now?""

If you don't leave with a deep respect for Asian family values, a higher appreciation of the sculptors' sense of humour and a much improved understanding of the many uses of concrete, you haven't been paying attention. You might leave with sunstroke, though, if you don't bring a parasol. Shade is scarce and there's only so long you can take refuge in the darkened circles of hell. Good thing there are vending machines, $2 for lemon water worth every penny.

This is easy to reach on the MRT and the suburban neighbourhood is worth a wander afterwards. Kent Ridge Park is a green oasis not far away."
,,Tiger Balm,3.0,,It is quite far from the city but it is worth the ride. You can see ancient story and chinese legend. Also the tiger balm.
,,Chinese,4.0,,This is garden you must visit if you are here.A very well designed park of Chinese mythology.The statues are done well and very well placed around.
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"I love this place , great for taking visitors when you have an hour or so free. A quick look at earlier reviews and Wikipedia will explain the history.
Its an opportunity to see tales and statues related to Chinese mythology. Dont miss the 10 Courts of Hell !
Its free and right next to the MRT. If you have a car, parking is easy ($5) , and you can either park onsite or outside.
Its never that busy and in a working week there may just be a handful of people there
Its a bit of a walk up a hill and in the sun can feel pretty hot , but there are vending machines for drinks.
Its a unique experience."
,,Tiger Balm Gardens,3.0,,"I last visited this place in 1968 as a child before my recent visit Feb 2016. It is still a wonderful place and some of the original scenes remain from back when I was younger. Its true to say that a few of the statues are a tad gruesome but it adds to the charm and I don't remember loosing any sleep or having any nightmares as a child, or now as an adult!. Created by the brothers who made Tiger Balm, it illustrates Chinese mythology and folklore. Unfortunately It is well past its prime and starting to look a bit shabby in places which now which is such a shame. You get the impression that it wont be around for much longer and will soon make way for something more modern.You can still take some wonderful photographs and It is free admission and very close to the MRT station. I recommend a visit before it disappears altogether."
,,A very interesting and different experience,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa, also known as the Tiger Balm Gardens, although Haw Par Villa is more commonly used, was built by Boon Haw for his brother Boon Par. His aim was to “share the moral values behind the various meaningful Chinese legends” (Haw Par Villa signage) through sculptures depicting scenes and stories throughout the gardens.

The gardens were opened in 1937. They are built on the side of a hill, which is not too onerous, unless mobility is an issue. The figurines are varied and colourful. Quite different to what one normally sees. The Ten Courts of Hell are a bit gruesome. Have a quick look before taking a young child through. This is just one small section of the garden. It looked like more sculptures were being added - but a bit out of character I thought. You will find kangaroos and koala bears near some gorillas at the top of the hill. The view would have been something when first built.

The gardens are readily accessible by rail and entry is free. The rail stop (Haw Par Villa MRT) is four stops from the Harbour Front MRT rail station. Look for the correct exit. The villa is right beside it. It is well located for those on a cruise ship with a couple of hours to spare waiting to embark or to fly out later in the day. Baggage can be stored at the terminal."
,,Like real life. But on 12 hits of acid.,5.0,,"The most beautiful, wondrous place I have ever been. Thank you, consumers of Tiger Balm, for providing the funds that made my vision quest possible."
,,A glimpse into Chinese mythology,5.0,,Loved the place. It is a small park with statues from Chinese Mythology. The Courts of Hell being the highlight of the park. The scenes are very vivid and not fit for young audience. Located around 15 meters from Haw Per Villa SMRT station. The park is free to visit and a great place for culture and mythology enthusiasts.
,,"Bizarre and grotesque - but rather charming, too ...",4.0,,"Bizarrely, the Haw Par Villa itself no longer exists - it was pulled down after World War Two. All that remains is the theme park created by the Aw brothers (inventors of Tiger Balm) which was begun in the 1930s and extended in the 1950s.

But then this park is all about the bizarre - and the odd, the kitsch, and the grotesque. If you like Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights, or are thrilled by horror stories, you will love this display of a thousand figures - give or take a few - created to illustrate tales from Chinese mythology, or as dire warnings of what can happen when Lessons Aren't Learned!

I really enjoyed walking round this place examining all the strange tableaux, many of which seemed totally inexplicable, although some had a wistful retro charm in their depiction of figures from decades ago. It's a real contrast to some of the glitzy, high-tech attractions of modern Singapore, and I do hope that it doesn't get swept away to make room for something with more ""relevance"" to the 21st century ...

Apparently one man, now in his early eighties, has been maintaining and restoring the figures for decades, but he could probably do with some help, as there are areas which are looking rather shabby and neglected. (This is why I have given four rather than five stars).

As well, this was a chance to learn something about the developers of Tiger Balm, and it's quite a sad story ... You can still see a model of the original villa, and there are monuments to family members in the grounds.

The site can get very hot and there is little shade. There is one area which has a vending machine where cold drinks can be obtained, with a few tables and chairs. That's it. It's probably a good idea to bring a hat and a bottle of water. It's probably not a good idea to bring very young children unless you want to answer difficult questions about some of the statues or deal with tears in the face of the gory Ten Courts of Hell exhibit.

Entrance is free. The MRT station is only a short distance away."
,,A magical oasis in busy Singapore,5.0,,"A brilliant place to visit before it disappears for ever as it is rumoured that a condominium is to be built here. Created by the brothers who made Tiger Balm, it illustrates Chinese mythology and folklore. It is free to enter and adjacent to The MRT station."
,,Rich in culture..,4.0,,Nice place of attraction and rich in culture and history. Worth a visit although I agree that some parts of the park needs maintainence.
,,Nice to visit,4.0,,"Showing of the Chinese fairy tales and believes of after lives of human beings during the old days, with folk lore beliefs.."
,,Sneak preview of hell,5.0,,"Used to be a villa of the tiger balm brothers, this place has some unsual attraction depicting consequences of hell punishments, an appreciation of the chinese belief and culture. However opposite this attraction is the vegetable wholesale centre, you can find almost any types of vegetables and fruits here."
,,A different world,5.0,,"This was one of the last places I went in Singapore, and I am glad I went. Completely free and also mostly deserted, you will have the run of this place while you are there if there are not tour groups there. You can guide yourself through it, but remember to put on heavy bug spray before hand as well as sunscreen. Most of the water is stagnant so there are tons of mosquitoes and bugs here."
,,Great way to learn about Chinese mythology,4.0,,Went there this afternoon and although the place has seen better days it is still a great way to spend couple of hours. Great even for older kids to teach them some morale :)
,,Expand my horizon,5.0,,"I personally visited here and expand my horizon!great place ! My suggestion is the best time visit here are on morning or evening,fully-English translation signboard and comfortable environment."
,,"love visiting, but in sad state",3.0,,"I LOVE visiting this place as it has lovely memories for me. Unfortunately it seems to be the poor cousin in the country compared to the City. It now has the MRT nearby, which is a new development, but it does need a lot of tender care still to be administered. There was some going on, but some places were closed and the Turtles in the pond, well, it was very very green and hard to see them!"
,,"The attraction of Haw Par Villa, Singapore",5.0,,"Haw Par Villa is a theme park of Chinese mythology and this park is located at Pasir Panjang Road. You can reach this park by the MRT which stops at Haw Par Villa station or you can take bus no 188 which begins at Choa Chu Kang Bus Terminal and passes this theme park.

This park was built in 1937 by Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par who were from Burma and later came to Singapore to build this park after they had made their fortune in Burma. The Tiger Balm Gardens is popular with locals and tourists from far and afield.

Near the entrance you can see the 18 gates of hell where figurines of male and female were tortured in hell for the wicked lives they had led. There is a lake which contains lotus flowers and tortoises. The park is set on a hillside and you can see statues of sumo wrestlers and also the Chinese hero of the Opium War Lin Ze Xu who wrote to Queen Victoria to stop the export of opium to China.

There are no restaurants here and you have to bring your own drinks especially on a hot day. This is a park that is worth a visit by tourists."
,,Fascinating place to visit,4.0,,"This was an original theme park, but no rides just statues and tableaux depicting Chinese mythology, history and culture. Although obviously needing some tlc on places - read the article about the man who is responsible for the upkeep - it stil is beautiful, facinating and in the Ten Courts of Hell, slightly repulsive. The punishments after death for various crimes are graphically depicted - be warned if you have young children - but soooo interesting."
,,Unexpected and worth stopping by,5.0,,"Located right next to the aptly named Haw Par Villa MRT station CC25.

Free!

A short walk uphill will lead you into the park, and to the first of the statues. There are several different sections, with signs describing what is going on in each. Some are a little grisly, but the only I would not recommend for children is the 10 Levels of Hell. The others may be a little gory, but nothing a well adjusted child won't be able to deal with, but the 10 Levels of Hell is designed to creep out and shock, dark with red lighting and very graphic and gory displays.

Several areas to sit, easy to access, free, and entertaining, worth a visit to this oddity."
,,Not for very young children,3.0,,"This park has a place that shows the different punishments in hell. There are little statues and quite interesting to see. The art is beautful, but a little gory. Good for adults interested in mythology but not recommended for little children due to the gore factor."
,,Great chinese architecture and culture,4.0,,"If you are someone who likes to know more about chinese history and culture, you should definitely visit here. It has a lot of statues, paintings and all which will make you wondered. As it is located just beside the MRT station, the transportation is also easy"
,,For your eyes only,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa is a theme park at Pasir Panjang area. It's about the Chinese folklore and mythology. You can see the colorful statues, deity heads, and so on. Take note that some statues are not suitable for kids. Add this to your bucket list, it's just free btw!"
,,"Never seen anything like this on the Planet and boy, I've wound up in some strange places!!",5.0,,"Well this is an amazing place. In 1972-73 I lived at Wessex Estate, just off Pasir Panjang Rd, so spent many happy hours here just wandering around. You cannot go just once. The mythology of the 'theme park' is mind blowing and the Chinese / Malay have such a wonderful way of expressing their culture. When I lived in Singapore, it was then called Tiger Balm Gardens as the two brothers invented this wonderful ointment. You need to take a day and appreciate the story behind each exhibition to fully understand how they thought and prayed and lived their lives. You need to understand the culture or it's a waste of time. I'm not sure if you can buy drinks or food so take something - especially a BIG bottle of water.
Please note I selected March 2015 as I had to choose a date, but my last visit was in fact 2010."
,,Triumph of Asia,5.0,,The first time I went there I was a child and it was that deep in my fantasies that I came back 50 years later and discovered as one of the most significant monuments of Chinese heritage. Absolute must!
,,Awfull,1.0,,Not only terrible kitsch. THE maintenance is not done for Many years. THE decor is Below Any standards. THE location is away from All Nice things.
,,Interesting but Neglected,3.0,,"Obviously well past it's hey day.
Whilst the park provides some good insight into Chinese mythology and folklore around virtues for a good life, these have obviously given way to commercial factors and a distinct lack of ongoing investment or care. The park is free to enter which must account for the extreme lack of disrepair and run down nature of the whole site.
It is a shame that such a location with obvious historic ties be allowed to fall apart as it has.
Worth the visit but don't expect too much."
,,Very Poignant,4.0,,"It was almost deserted when we visited one weekday morning in January. A couple of Japanese men, a western woman, one gardener and the two of us. Back in the day this would have been teeming with visitors who'd travelled to wonder at the millions spent to craft a message to the living about what awaits them if they don't live good lives.
Some of the tableaux of the taoist ten hells are actually quite disturbing.
The site also tells the story of its creator Aw Boon Haw and his younger brother Aw Boon Par very well. It's worth a visit for a glimpse into other lives, other times nd other ways of thinking. I just wish more Singaporeans took the occasional opportunity to appreciate it."
,,History of Tiger Balm,4.0,,"This is a deeply historical place and explains lot many things than expected. This place was owned by two Brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par. Hence the name Haw Par Villa.

The current attraction gives strong messages to the society on pious activities though it now visited by children and parents mostly for fun.

It also has a segment which shows life after death and how one pays for the misdeeds done in ones life. Good place for kids to enjoy."
,,Amazing unusual free fun,5.0,,"Easily caught the train to the front door step of the unusual Haw Par Villa, free admittance into this odd amusement park of Chinese culture. Some dioramas need a new touch of paint but it only adds to the kookiness of the place. I thoroughly enjoyed my trip and highly recommend this to anyone travelling Singapore"
,,tired and run down,2.0,,"A few things near the entrance have been repainted. The rest desparately needs a touchup, or a bulldozer."
,,Unique but needs some sprucing up,2.0,,"This place has deteriorate so much, it's dull and cracking and faded so much. Some repainting was being done while i was there, hopefully they'll be able to bring it back it's former glory. Still, a unique place to visit."
,,Needs restoration,3.0,,"This is a really culturally interesting attraction that has been neglected for way too long. Lots of potential, but fails to attract people to come back again. Recommended if you want to see how bizarre Chinese culture can get."
,,Need to improve to attract more tourist,3.0,,"My last visit to Haw Par Villa is during my school day. Today I bought my 2 kids to visit Haw Par Villa. Sad to say, the place looked the same to me... there is not much changes there. Do bring along water and foods along as I don't get to see any foods or water stall inside. Do bring along an umbrella and portable fan is VERY hot walking around the place.

This place is free but not parking. It can be access by subway (door step)."
,,Unusual.,3.0,,"- The former residence of prominent Chinese businessmen Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par (yes, they're brothers) turned theme park, set up with the imparting of Confucian values in mind.
- One of the last remaining parks of its kind in the world
- Its main draw is the ""Eighteen Gates of Hell"" tour, where one walks through a gory smorgasbord of sculptures depicting various punishments meted out to evildoers in the afterlife, according to Chinese beliefs.
- Sculpture diorama depicting scenes from famous works of Chinese literature (e.g. the Water Margin, Journey to the West) adorn the park.
- Accessible by public bus and MRT (Haw Par Villa station).
- Admission s free."
,,So much potential,2.0,,"We busted this as a family with our kids and elderly father one week day morning.

The place was deserted, no visitors or staff to be seen.

The attractions are very run down, feeling paint, dried up ponds, algae growing in what water there is.

This place has so much potential, it just needs the same attention that the rest of Singapore gets"
,,One very underrated attraction,5.0,,"This attraction is always said to be a run-down theme park, which is not entirely true, at least not when I visited last week!
It is definitely unique; the theme alone is not something you are likely to see anywhere else in the world. It brings you into the world of East Asian folklores and mythology, which has a long history and its own universe. I loved the creativity and the different morals that came out of each exhibit. They provide a rare insight into the local/Chinese culture.
Make no mistake, it is bizarre! In parts the themes don't match, and it lacks explanations but you will still get a good laugh out of it, and probably a good photo if you are so inclined.
It is only small, it took me less than three hours to see everything, but I was thoroughly entertained. I would recommend it over the Universal Studios any day."
,,Old almost forgotten Gem in modern Singapore.,3.0,,"A walk back to the past for me as I came here as a 12 year old, and got traumatised by the Ten Courts of Hell. The place is a bit run down but the Tourism Board plans to spruce it up soon.
Anyway, if you want to 'enjoy' Haw Par Villa in its original form, come now before the renovations start and you might get a kitschy modern take of the place, which will not be the same.
Essentially, this is a park created to teach people to think about their actions and consequences and inculcate good morals. It wanted to teach you to be a good person in your life and afterlife. It would be good if parents can explain the stories behind the teachings.
To get here is very simple, use the Cjrcle Line and it is just outside Haw Par station.
Free Entry.
p/s : bring your mozzie spray"
,,"Off the beaten path, and desperately needing some TLC.",4.0,,"Not a lot of people care to go visit Haw Par Villa, which was evident by the fact that apart from me, there were only two other tourist in the place. It is a shame because the park really is quite fascinating.

Yes, the statues require a bit of a touch-up where the paint's peeling off, but apart from the lack of maintenance, the place is a delight. You can read about a lot of folk tales which have been interpreted in the visual form.

Also, if you have the stomach for it, go in for the brilliantly gory depictions of the 10 Courts of Hell and it's morbid punishments. It will definitely remind people of Dante's Inferno! Well, Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate people!"
,,Old world charm!,4.0,,"Slightly rundown and reminiscent of Singapore in the 70s, Haw Par Villa's draw are the kitschy statues reflecting Chinese folklore. Must see is the gruesome ten courts of hell. Best to avoid in the heat of the afternoon (a mistake I made)!"
,,A park that's retired from its hey days,3.0,,"It was about 20 over years ago when I last visited the park. At that time was very crowded and bursting with live. Today, it's in a sad state. i happen to see some new signages still wrapped in plastic wrapper about the plans of reviving the villa, I guessed it's by the newly appointed park operator. I wish in time to come, the new operator is able to transform the park but there's a lot of thing to do to be able to win back crowds. However, a good hour and a half walk with family revives memories. We would not be able to see such parks that's related to Chinese folklore which teaches good values."
,,It's Different,3.0,,"Haw Par Villa is a crazy and semi-educational look into one man's interpretation of a number of ancient Chinese mythological tales.. The park consists of a number of sculpture / scenes pieces which depict these tales.
I would recommend this if you have seen all the modern and popular sites across Singapore and are looking for something a little different."
,,Excellent,3.0,,It's so much beautifull you should have so much time that see all of it I'm sure you be glad after seeing them
,,Reminiscent - Slightly Disappointing,3.0,,"I was last here with my mum when I was 3, so we decided to go back to Singapore for my 30th birthday.

Transport here is very easy; there's an MRT stop - called Haw Par Villa, a taxi rank, and bus stop all at the entrance.

There are two drink vending machines at the entrance, but that's. Some apps and reviews mention a restaurant/cafe within the grounds, but it was closed for us - unsure if permanent. I'd suggest either eating before you go, or taking some snacks.

There's minimal shade - unless you hide in the nooks/caves. It was a hot, rainy day when we went, so we found ourselves sweating and hiding in the nooks/caves every now and then. It was more fun than annoying actually.
Definitely take sunscreen and maybe a parasol for those that burn easily. Perhaps visit later in the day also, when it's not so hot.

I mention disappointing in the title, as it seemed a lot smaller than it was 27yrs ago (mums opinion, I was too young to remember). We wanted to take a photo in the same spot a photo was taken 27yrs ago, but we couldn't find the location.

I'd recommend going if you've never been, but fair warning to your children; many of the sculptures are raunchy/devilish/uncouth etc. It's a great free attraction if you're new to it.
It was nice to go back and reminisce, but I probably wouldn't go back a third time."
,,Rich and Full of Chinese Culture,4.0,,"Have not visited it since more than 10 years ago. Brought my son along and was a great experience. Even though it looks run down, I am glad that most of the statues and figurines remains intact and largely original.
These statues depict Chinese legends and values which is a good learning experience for both me and my son.
Free entry to the park and is accessible via the Circle line MRT (Haw Par Villa)."
,,New painting with new looks,5.0,,"Haw Par Villa may have been forgotten by many peoples as this attraction doesn't appeal to most of the visitors anymore. But for me, I enjoyed it so much as they have undergo new painting job and the painter trying to do it under the hot sun.
Those statues are well maintained and new features added to it.
Worth a visit as is admission free but only pay for the car park at $5 per entry if you are driving there. Well...more to say is I love it..."
,,I only came here for nostalgic reason,3.0,,"Been here 30+ years ago when I was still a kid, and this place spooked me out bigtime with its display of 10 levels of hell.
After 30+ years, revisited this place due to recommendation of the hostel, it's such a weird nostalgic feeling. The place is quite rundown and desperately need maintenance, but on the other hand, I kinda like it (in a weird way) in its rundown state now. It's such a funny place to see in Singapore - a country that's modern, clean, orderly to an extend of almost OCD - and here you have Haw Par Villa that's a stark contrast."
,,Pretty Neat,4.0,,"We've pretty much seen everything in Sing and ate at pretty much every hawker center. So when my niece suggested Haw Par, my wife, who was born in Singapore, said great. She had wanted to bring me here a few times before, but always balked because of the weather. Well, we went despite the weather. It's kind of old and a little run down, but is undergoing renovation, albeit a little slowly.

The park retells a number of Chinese legend stories, which as an American, were pretty interesting to me. The highlight is a journey through ten levels of hell. I'm told there were originally 18 levels, so I guess inflation has taken its toll. It's actually pretty fun to go through.

As long as your expectations aren't set too high, it's a good way to spend some time in Sing well outside the usual tourist spots."
,,Can be skipped,3.0,,It is an old park with lots of figures and statues depicting stories and legends of Chinese culture. It must have been a good place many years ago but it has not kept with time at all and is poorly maintained. Also there are not many explanations about the figures which can leave you a bit lost if you are not well-versed with Chinese culture. Not a great place for tourists but a different place for locals as it is a reminder of their history and culture.
,,An unpolish gem,3.0,,The attraction is just a 3 minutes walk from the train station and no admission charge. Recommended to visit the place either in the morning or in the late afternoon as there is limited shade in certain areas. One attraction that stood out (and has adequate shade) is the 10 courts of hells. Felt that the signage and description was insufficient and one might not get much of a take-away except for the sight of the statues.
,,Little run down but free and very interesting.,3.0,,"This place is interesting. A blast from the past. If you have seen everything in Singapore and want to see something a little different, it can be worth checking this place out.

A bus stops right outside, so its convenient to get to. It used to be a big park for people to visit. It was built by the family that made Tiger Balm and used to have their house there.
The house is no longer there, but you might spot the tiger balm cars if you are lucky. The family put in all these amazing fiberglass friezes depicting chinese morality tales. There is also a scary cave filled with the circles of hell and the things you do to get there.

A pretty odd but interesting day out. Defnitely for people who want to see something a bit more eccentric and don't mind it being a bit run down"
,,Unfortunately run down attraction,4.0,,I came to see this as my father had been here in 1945 and had a photograph of the outside gates. It is a little run down as it is now a free attraction. It is worth going to see the Chinese folklore theme park. Especially go and see the 10 courts of hell.
,,Need a serious facelift !!,3.0,,"If you have an extra time to spare do pay a visit. The place is easy accessible as it is just opposite of Haw Par Villa MRT Station. Admission is free. This is a park housed a lot of Chinese famous god, goddess, fairy tales, demon figurines. I like the section of ""Hell's Gate"". It depicts the after death series of sins a persons committed and how it will be punished.

Some displays are bad in condition and colours are fading. The pond is full of algae and quite discouraging to view. Noticed many foreign visitor climbing the display which is dangerous and could damage the display.

Overall, this park need a facelift and regular maintenance to bring back its glory days in 70's and 80s'."
,,A bit boring,2.0,,I first came here a few decades back with friends. I suppose they may have updated it. I really couldn't tell. To me it was just not very interesting. Not my kind of thing. Do your research first.
,,Weird and free,5.0,,"This place was super weird, but really interesting. Free admission and you walk around and learn about different stories in Chinese beliefs, with their depictions of heaven and hell. Would not bring kids, at least through the ten levels of hell. It's even a bit more haunting that it's pretty empty and the paint is run-down. But definitely worth a visit. Didn't see any food or drink, so bring that with and be prepared to be outside."
,,Weird & Wonderful!,5.0,,"Ok this is not your usual pretty Singapore attraction...its weird, spooky, funny and even beautiful! There's a whole lot of stuff to photograph here, models, statues depicting scenes from Chinese mythology and folklore (if you have time do read the descriptions given).

And yes its free!

Nearest MRT - Haw Par Villa (park is just next to the station)"
,,An amazing place,5.0,,We had an excellent few hours here. Loads to see and really interesting. Take a hat because there's no shelter from the sun and you would need an umbrella in case it rained. The only food is a vending machine so take water but on Saying that it's still well worth a visit. Its a pity that this isn't advertised better and it's a shame that it isn't better known. It's a must see.
,,"Funky, @#$%ed up, and free!",4.0,,"Thumbs up: Free entrance, located outside metro station, and funky (sometimes spooky) sculptures. Thumbs down: If different is not your cup of tea, this is not for you. Did you know? The Tiger Balm family owns and maintains the place."
,,An enjoyable day out... free!,4.0,,An interesting place to visit. Brightly coloured Chinese sculptures and dioramas depicting old legends and moral fables. Could do with some restoration but as it's now free to enter is a little neglected. It's much larger than it first appears and all outdoors so take precautions on a vert hot day. You can easily spend an entertaining full day here and spend little money if on a tighter budget. Has a very whimsical feel.
,,Still worth a visit!,4.0,,"There is so much to see here. We went here on a weekday morning and there was no one else there for over an hour. Easy to get to, it has it's own MRT stop, and worth a trip. Some of the figures have been repainted recently, but even those that haven't are still fascinating. It was neat to learn about this attraction and how it came to be. Definitely go here if you have the time, it's a nice walk around and is free!"
,,A really unique place,5.0,,"Once a top-place to go in Singapore these days it is a rather neglected backwater, but still with a good flow of visitors. My two children (5 and 11) love it and we have had to visit twice so far. Given it is not so busy I'd recommend it for a weekend in Singapore when everywhere else can be packed. Some background knowledge on Chinese culture is useful but not essential, although you may be left wondering what everything is otherwise - even then some of it may seem opaque as it was a unique vision. The place is crying out to be lovingly overhauled and renovated, but put it on your list of top 10 places to go in Singapore for a unique cultural attraction."
,,A nice place to see,5.0,,"I visited this nice place during my stay in Singapur. It was a sunny and warm day in Singapur. This place is a bit outside but really nice. There are some great sculptures, some nice paintings and a great place to visit. You can learn a lot, get everything explained and take some nice pictures. I enjoyed my visit here and recommend to go here!"
,,off the tourist path but might not be good for children,3.0,,"This is an old theme park back in the day and now, what is left are its ""exhibits"" of Chinese stories/fables. The park is rundown which is evident by the amount of neglect that you will see around. The highlight of this attraction is the Ten Courts of Hell which I found a bit disturbing (and I am an adult). Back in the day, these were made to educate children on the punishment of the ""bad"" things, and I hope no children went away so disturbed about what they saw.

In any case, the exhibits / stories were a learning experience for those of us who are not Chinese. You will learn a thing or two from Haw Par Villa, so if you have plenty of time or just want something off the beaten path (like I did), you could visit here. This park has its own MRT stop (Haw Par Villa)"
,,Ten courts of hell,5.0,,"It was indeed different kind of a theme park! In my view, it was one of the hidden gem of Singapore and worth a visit to revisit your good vs. bad balance sheet in life!"
,,"Unusual, to say the least",4.0,,Insight into the culture with many moral parables. The 10 judgements of hell are very provocative and some should carryover to today. Definitely unique. If time allows go.
,,Side kick destination,3.0,,"If you got plenty of time at your disposal, give this destination a chance. Keep in mind some parts of this attraction might be disturbing for young children. Otherwise, you will get to see some ""interesting"" art."
,,"Just ""Eh""......Was probably good in the 80s",2.0,,"The park is about Chinese history as depicted through paster characters around a park. To me the park was old and tired, no disrepect intended for the Chinese culture and history that it was seeking to represent. It was probably pretty cool in the 80s or before Universal Studios opened.

Can't complain about the price, its free as I don't think anyone would pay much to go there.

For people on a limited budget or with time to burn... its something to do. But don't go out of you way to get here or pass up another option. Its nothing special."
,,"Interesting, unique and bizarre",5.0,,"Also known as Tiger Balm Gardens, it's full of Chinese and Buddhist statues. Definitely interesting and worth a look if you fancy something more authentic than most of things you can see and visit in Singapore. The Hell area is specially cool. Very close to the MRT station (Haw Par Villa)."
,,Eerie and Whimsical,5.0,,"The park features Chinese Myths with giant dioramas/sculptures. It also features the Gates of Hell which illustrates the judgment you will receive depending on the wrong doings you committed.

The location is really accessible because it is near an MRT station. A well maintained free attraction with a lot of eerie and whimsical feel."
,,A trip back in time,5.0,,I was living in Singapore as a child of five in the mid sixties the tiger balm gardens are one of my clearest memories of those days. They are a bit run down now but a must visit if you have the time. Fantastic place to wander round.
,,50 years from first visiting and still worth a visit,4.0,,"Although not now a massive tourist attraction, it is still worth a visit and now it's absolutely free !! Near to the Haw Paw MRT so worth seeing to understand myths and cultures, plus good experience for the kids, this was the original Tiger Balm Gardens from the brothers who owned the company"
,,This place gave me goosebumps!,5.0,,"The sculptures are beautiful and well-maintained. I must admit though, the place was a bit scary. We went there first thing in the morning so we had the park almost to ourselves."
,,Chinese philanthropists' brothers gift to Singapore. 2 hours needed. Toilets and snacks available.,4.0,,"This pre-WW2 attraction is popular with visitors and local alike. To get the simply hop on the MRT to Haw Par Villa station. Very colourful and unusual as you will soon discover. Be sure to take a camera or handphone to snap some of the gaily-painted concrete gods, animals, and gruesome torchure scenes!!"
,,"Must see in Singapore, needs a little TLC",4.0,,"Haw Par Villa was highly recommended to us to visit, and I can see why.

It's free to get into, is very close to the Haw Par Villa MRT, and most of the statues and displays have signage with a description, explaining he purpose of the displays.

This made it very easy to understand the displays and they were very interesting.

The Villa is wheelchair accessible to some areas however for most of it, had a lot of stairs.

It's in need of TLC, looks like it hasn't been looked after for a while, however one area looked and smelled like it was being repainted.

All in all, it's well worth a visit."
,,Melted birthday cake,4.0,,"Tiger Balm or Haw Par Villa

A local once told me ""don't got there, its like a melted birthday cake"". So i had to go. ITs an old amusement park that seems to be untouched sind the late 50s. Something thats pretty rare by now in singapore an i already heard roomers they are gonna close it for more skyscrapers.

The park itself was intended to display most parts o the chinese religion and beliefs in plaster or plastic figures. A truly disturbing and fascinating attempt. Just looks pictures. A highlight presents the 7 circles of hell in a dark artificial cave and bring your fantasy up too speed.

If you want to get in touch with Singapores roots you cants miss it."
,,For you who like to know about Buddhism,4.0,,"This is the second trip for me and my mom, but the first trip for my brothers and my boyfriend. We visit Haw Par Villa, the place that not so many tourist know.

This place is awesome, you will find so many statue about Buddhism. But this is an open place, not only for Buddhist.

If you like to photograph or drawing this is the best place. Every single part of this place is perfect for your photograph.

But because this place is huge, you need to walk around. Don't forget to visit this place, the entry is free. You just take an MRT to HAW PAR VILLA station and the place is in the exit."
,,Unconventional and appealing,4.0,,"This is not the most typical thing to do in Singapore, which makes it more interesting. Haw Par Villa is far from the center which reduces the number of visitors.

It offers a very unique point of view on the ancestral culture of Singapore, with many references to Buddhism and a mix of ancient Chinese religions. The 10 gates of hell is by far the most unconventional thing to see inside, but definitely worth it. Avoid going in with small children though."
,,A must visit,4.0,,Even though this attraction is considered to be old school and out of date it really is worth the visit. This was how they tried to teach Children the virtue of being good lawful citizens and what happened if you weren't. The sage of Monkey is also here and if you remember the TV programmer it is good to see it in bright coloured concrete statues.
,,kaleidoscope park,5.0,,"i expected a tiny garden but it stretched and meandered forever. nothing can prepare you for the unexpected. i don't think there's any park like this anywhere else in the world; it can aptly be termed a park on acid!
the polychromatic colours were out of the world as well as the sculptures. i know hell is gory, but that colourful as well? wow!"
,,Haw Par VIlla used to be known as Tiger Balm Gardens,5.0,,"I love ""Tiger Balm Gardens"" - the best secret of Singapore. It is a walk through the fables of Chinese culture. Good prep for your visit will be reading those fables, but it is fairly evident what you are seeing. Moralistic but fun."
,,Singapore brand theme park,4.0,,"I had been to a number of Chinese Buddhist theme parks in Taiwan, China and other South East Asian countries but none of the theme parks matches this one in terms of the scale and quantity of Chinese mythological sculptures depicted. The sculptures are glaringly and outstanding real painted with bold striking color decorated with faces of rich expression.

When I was young, my parents used to bring us here during weekends and each time the name of Haw Par Villa was mentioned, it conjures up images of hellish gruesome torture and sufferings of life after death. Each visit was a shock therapeutic session and the fear of a sinful death pervaded the mind. I remember after my first visit, I slept with restlessness, uneasiness and phobia when darkness crept in and sometime woke up in cold sweat with those scary images still lurking in my mind.

The Ten Courts of Hell was undeniably the hallmark of the attractions in this villa. The harsh, severe and retributive form of punishments meted out to those who sins were horrendously cruel. Liars had their tongues cut off, unfilial children were boiled in pans of fire, criminals, adulterers, tricksters had their eyes gouged out, tied to burning furnaces, their limbs amputated by saws, etc. Till to date, the sculptures and their images remain vividly embossed in the dark corners of my brain. I wonder if there is any study on the effect of the `shock therapy' visit on a child and the aftermath positive effect on their behavior.

The one who constructed this villa in 1937 was the Tiger Balm Burmese Chinese millionaires, Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par. Just like their popular innovative products: the Tiger Balm ointment and plaster, this villa is uniquely and proudly Singapore brand theme park. Many of us had benefited from our visits to this theme park and we are `enlightened' to be good and to live a righteous and unsinful life that contributes to societal good.

The admission is free and in my opinion, you have not visited Singapore if you have not visited this unusual theme park."
,,Unique Singapore experience,5.0,,"Haw Par Villa is like nothing I have ever seen before. My friend and I were amazed at the absurdity of it all. I am sure we did not experience the park in the spirit in which it was intended, but we had a really good time. The sculptures depict scenes from Chinese folklore as well as more modern scenes. Some of them were so crazy we could not stop laughing. Entrance to the park is free and I highly recommend going there to enjoy a nice contrast to the highly polished experiences Singapore offers."
,,Quaint and unusual Chinese park,4.0,,"Although this park was renovated many years ago, I had not visited it for more than 20 years. Brought back many memories of my childhood when my parents brought me and my siblings there to 'scare' us into obeying them. The courts of hell were a real eye-opener and the punishments for the numerous 'crimes' were indeed extreme. Was fun in a subtle way."
,,A unique experience.,4.0,,"A theme park dedicated to Chinese folklore, traditions and superstition albeit in a slightly jazzy setting. Admission is free and the park is easily accessible by the MRT (Haw Par Villa station along Circle Line).

If you have ruin lust or a love of abandoned places, this quiet park that can get slightly unsettling at times (because of gory imagery and statues) is perfect for you. Haw Par Villa is a little hilly. Bring sufficient water as it is an outdoor park. It was really a unique experience for me."
,,Newly painted,5.0,,"Great MRT to Haw Paw Village, glad very close walking. Delighted to see first part all fresh and looks newly painted. It was very very hot and humid walking. Took advantage of the many seats to look and rest along the way. Only saw 2 workers. Nice quiet visit. It was a welcome change NOT to have to pay to see something. Thank you Singapore. One lot of toilets closed for renovations ."
,,Wonderfully strange,5.0,,"Haw Par Villa used to be a full-on theme park. No longer financially viable, it has been taken over by the state and is now free to visit. It is definitely worth the diversion from the city center.

The highlight is easily the 10 Courts of Hell.

The grounds of the villa make for a very nice walk, and there is a nice breeze at the top of the hill.

Visit early in the morning for less heat, but also because there isn't much around the grounds so you'll want to be elsewhere for mealtimes."
,,Unique Chinese theme park,4.0,,"This park has been around for ages and was built by Aw Boon Har, whose fame is the Tiger Balm Ointment.

He was a generous man who donated his own land and used his own money to build a theme park for the local community many years ago. Back in those days, its like a 'Universal Studios' for the local community.

There are many statues and figurines whose underlying theme highlight Chinese folklore, mythology and traditions like filial piety and doing good for society.

An interesting place to spend a morning/ afternoon."
,,Old school park,4.0,,"this park is worth to go because is free and next to mrt station, but looks a little scary because depicting scenes from Chinese mythology, folklore, legends, and history."
,,"yum,,its different",4.0,,"easy to get too right next to the mrt station,,its free entry,,chinese folklore culture, sculptures . not many people there,interesting place,,bit run down,but its worth a look"
,,Very nice place,5.0,,Lots of amazing statues and buildings! This place would of taken for ever to construct! Great place to look around and take pictures:)
,,An extraordinary place well worth a visit,4.0,,"One could spend hours in this extraordinary place, although we only made a brief visit. Besides the gardens, pavilions and pagodas, there are numerous statues and caves full of scary scenes of ""punishment"": limbs being severed, people being drowned in blood ... and so it goes on! I believe parents bring their young children here to instill in them a sense of right and wrong.

There is no entrance fee so a good place for all the family to enjoy a couple of hours."
,,Interesting visit for children,5.0,,A great Chinese cultural heritage. My friend's 3 year old son was totally captivated by the colorful figurines!
,,Nostalgic and generally a good place to rekindle childhood,3.0,,"Visiting Haw Par Villa has never been easier, located just beside the MRT station (Haw Par Villa on the circle line), the exit is just right outside Haw Par Villa's entrance.

I reached there at around 3pm just as the sun was setting, so it's a bit hot but nevertheless it's scenic. This park is built on a hill, so there's some climbing to do, but you can get to see Chinese culture and mythology-inspired sculptures.

There's only a few things left, but it's still quite worthwhile as a revisit or a first time visit. There's the Gates of Hell, and random sculptures about the Chinese history and myths and legends.

The state of the park is a bit antiquated than what I remembered but it's definitely worth a revisit!"
,,Historical Place of Interest,4.0,,"A historical place that underwent various form of changes. It's part of my growing up memories. There wasn't many places of interest for us back in the 1980s in Singapore, hence, this is one of the few places that parents will brought kids to. As Chinese, it's a reminder for us on the do and don't and the consequence of deeds... I'm glad that this iconic villa is still pretty well maintained."
,,"It does not contain any action, just a part of Singapore Heritage Culture",3.0,,"I went there personally with a meetup group and we explored the park in around 2 hours. Easy reachable via MRT Line Har Par Villa.

Afterwards we had a nice late lunch in the russian restaurant across the road which is called Russkiy Dome (opens only at 2pm)."
,,B Movie horror in cast and design (but to much mirth),5.0,,"If you go here with low expectations on the quality but high expectations for novelty then you will surely be entertained.

Well sitauated next to the Haw Par Villa tube stop, means there is no excuse to not have a quick jaunt here. if you do decide to do the park at break neck speed, then ensure to do Ten Courts of Hell first (the highlight)

The park features randomness from badgers aiming rifles to gory torture procedures of hell. Although the above sounds a little extreme, it is all conducted in a hilariously macabre way so as not to be terrifying."
,,Quiet Creepy yet Interesting in Unusual Way,3.0,,"It's quiet complicated for me to explain about the attraction because I have a different mixed feelings when visiting this park.

I decided to explore Haw Par since this park has been there for a long time but I havent got a chance to explore it. It is actually a must visit place for certain travelers that really into the Chinese classic tales or beliefs. But if you're not into all of those things mention above, you better take off this park from your travel itinerary.

What I can say is this park is interesting in term of classic Chinese belief and tales (such as the white snake legend). The park itself is really huge and be ready to exhaust yourself if you want to explore this park to the top.

The most interesting (and strange) part is the 10 Sins of Chamber in which you can see the diorama of 10 layers of Hell. There are plenty disturbing diorama about the torture in Hell based on the Chinese beliefs. Parental guidance is also advisable for those who bring children to this chamber."
,,Can only rate the ten courts of hell,4.0,,"If you are wanting to explore Chinese thinking a bit, give this a try and take the time to actually read the texts about what will happen to you if you break the rules. Expected a bit more, but for a free entry you will value the work somebody has put into this demonstration of cultural believes. In the end, be good! ;-) Recommend if you are around. Rest of the Haw Paw villa still needs to be explored. This is by the way the origin if Tiger balm!"
,,Aka Tiger Balm Gardens.,4.0,,"I wanted to see the 10 courts of hell exhibit (which did not disappoint me), which, frankly, isn't very recommended for young kids/ those who are faint at heart. The little figurines have very graphic details on them depicting torture for various kinds of misdeeds and might be troubling for some to see. The lighting where this exhibit is housed is spotlights on each of the scenes, which create shadows (and an eerier aura on the scene), hence flash photography is a must if one wishes to take clear photos. The rest of the displays are outdoor statues, so it is advised to visit Haw Par Villa in the morning as the afternoon sun can be blazing hot. A number of older statues seem to have been removed from the displays but what's left is still worth viewing. Entrance is free but there are hardly any facilities. There are also no cafes or souvenir shops. Getting here is easy, as there is an MRT stop (Haw Par Villa) right outside the entrance."
,,interesting,4.0,,a good place to know Chinese legends and myths. I went in the morning and there were not many people at that time. can take your own sweet time walking and explaining the things displayed to the little ones.
,,Chinese Folklore Dioramas,5.0,,This is a fun place for photo taking and also for PPL interested in Chinese folk stories and some basic background story to the success of Tiger Balm. It's free and easy to access. Very quirky and unique park.
,,Its like another world in there!,5.0,,"If you dont want to do all the commercial activities and want to spend a leisurely afternoon in tales land, this is the place to be. Chinese folklore and fables are depicted with sculptures so life like that u feel like u have traveled back a century!!"
,,A Trip to Haw Par Villa - Tiger Balm Garden,3.0,,"Haw Par Villa used to be a popular spot for tourist attraction as well as for locals. The admission is free. Not sure is it because it was a Monday, therefore the park was very quiet and I only met 9-10 people throughout my journey in the park.

The park showed us a glimpse of many Chinese legends. They were many figurines and statutes built within the park.

Ten Courts of Hell is the main attraction in Haw Par Villa, where some of the gruesome depictions of Hell in Chinese mythology and Buddhism were featured.

Through the walk, we understood that one cannot do any bad deed in life because they will be punished in hell when one died. So the figurines showed the scenes at Hell where souls were being punished horribly for violating the code of filial piety, stealing, telling lies, gossiping, gambling, disrespect to elders, killing, corrupting, wasting food and etc.

It has beautiful scenery that looks like the place where people can shoot for Chinese period drama.

We took an hour to finish touring around the whole place.
If you have run out of place to visit, you might want to consider visiting Haw Par Villa as an educational trip? It is free admission and the place is convenient to visit, it is just directly above Haw Par Villa MRT station. There is no one selling food inside, remember to eat before you go and bring your own water.

To view the pictures I took, pls visit http://paradiseger.blogspot.sg/2015/01/a-trip-to-haw-par-villa-tiger-balm.html"
,,"Strange, Different but well worth visiting",4.0,,"Haw Par villa is really an attraction from a different era. It is a collection of statues telling various different stories from Asian culture. We visited on a Tuesday afternoon and the place was quite empty. Despite being a little run down the various stories were interesting and an insight into some old Chinese folklore. The ""ten courts of hell"" was quite gruesome with indications of what would happen to you upon committing various ""sins"". Worth spending an hour or so here and a good place for visitors from outside Singapore to experience some local folklore. Free admission with a $5 car park charge."
,,From a different era,4.0,,"If you are expecting roller coasters, food courts and over sized costumed cartoon characters, then this is not for you. If you are interested to understand what excited the local community 50-60 years ago, myths and legends and experience what the previous generation did for entertainment before Resorts World Sentosa and MBS were built......then this may be for you. It was a quiet day (think most are) and we wandered freely through the statues. Some of it is downright weird, but that's the attraction. I hope when we return in 10-20 years time, they will have preserved this place as a museum rather than knock it down and replace it with condos and coffee shops. Not hopeful though...."
,,A strange quirky experience but awesome,5.0,,"This place is a must see. Over a thousand dioramas and statues that depict famous chinese folklore and legends. It's a free exhibition but worth the strangeness. You will need your walking shoes as it is built on a hill so you have to walk up various steep walkways. There is no canteen so it's best you bring food from elsewhere or use the vending machine at the bottom of the hill just before the entrance. The statues create beautiful photography, although the subject matter can be a little disturbing for some as there are statues of demons and tortured mortals in hell and other strange oddities. Allow around 3 hours to really take it all in and read the various descriptions of each diorama. Easy to get to as right next to Haw Par Villa MRT."
,,Boring!,1.0,,"I decided to go on an organised walking tour with a company I had used 3 times before - quite honestly this was rubbish! I would advise to avoid this ""attraction"" unless your really bored. It is not interesting, it is not attractive, its not even entertaining! I had the full history explained in detail - even the guide appeared more interested in leaving than i did!"
,,Unique and old theme park showcasing Chinese folktale!,4.0,,"This theme park is definitely one of a kind. Considering that it was built back in 1936, it is really incredible for the two brothers of the Tiger Balm company to build this! For you guys out there who are really interested in Chinese traditions, cultures and tales, this is the place to explore! Recently repainting of the statues have been done to give this park a new look. Do not worry about not being able to appreciate the statues in this place as almost all the Chinese descriptions about them are complemented with English translations. The highlight of this park is the Ten Courts of Hell which is not for recommended for the young as there are many graphic statues. This highlight shows the different stages of Hell with different punishments for people who committed different offences before their death. What's advantageous about this place is it is near a MRT station, lots of photo-taking opportunities and there is no entrance fee! 2-3 hours is all you need to appreciate this park! The disadvantage is that you will need to have your own supply of water to hydrate yourself as some of the vending machines are either inaccessible or not working. There is a chance that there will be a cart at the entrance of this park selling drinks and ice-cream so do remember to keep a lookout for it!"
,,An amazing must visit to see old school Singapore theme park,4.0,,I was told that this was a white elephant and not worth the visit by a Taxi driver. I am glad I made the trip and went to see the old Tiger Balm Garden as it was called. (Still prefer the old name ). It must have been an amazing place in its heyday with all the fountains working. Still a must visit to see what was a top attraction and shows some very interesting statues of Chinese Gods and Mythlogical characters. Loved the 10 Courts of Hell and their teaching of solid values for the children. Remember to take plent of water as there is a lot of walking and it is all up hill and there is no shade. Haw Par Villa MRT station is right next door and a cheap and convenient way to get there. Food was unavailable in the park as all vendors were closed on the Saturday I was there.
,,Strange and Interesting,5.0,,Visited with my 10yo son. Was fascinated by the 10 courts of hell. It was nice to show my boy what happens to those who mistreat their parents - they get sawn in half. It's pretty gory so not really for the squeamish.
,,Very interesting exhibit!,4.0,,"If you're not pressed for time, you mustn't hesitate to visit this place. It's a unique display of a collection of hundreds of statues and dioramas dedicated to Chinese folklore. The exhibit is quirky and may be sometimes disturbing for young children."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"As an American visiting a ""theme park"" and seeing displays of death, it is unlike anything in America. Very interesting."
,,Surreal place,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa is a curious place indeed. There is no entrance fee, so no excuse to not go there for a short visit. The MRT brings you right to the entrance of the park.

The park of the former Haw Par Villa is full with colorful painted statues and dioramas. I found this place well worth the visit, but I can imagine it is not for everyone. Some parts of the park have been repainted and the statues look like new, in other parts the decay is very visible (the food corner was closed and you could clearly see parts of the roof came off). For me this was also part of the charm of Haw Par Villa, you can imagine it must have been quite something in the days the park was built by the owner of the Tiger Balsem company.

If you're interested in Chinese folk tales, the dioramas will guide you through the most popular ones. And if you like horror movies, you'll definitely enjoy the Ten Gates of Hell. Very gruesome indeed.

You need about three hours to visit Haw Par Villa and read the explanations provided by the sculptures."
,,Bizarre,4.0,,"This was a good way to kill a couple of hours. But very bizarre. The 10 Courts of Hell was interesting to view. Very easy to get to just get off at the Haw Par Villa MRT and it's easily signed.

The story behind it is quite sad with the destruction of the Mansion that was on site. Also tells the story of Tiger Balm in general."
,,Enchanting experience of the other world,4.0,,"Conveniently located just outside the Haw Par Villa MRT Station.

The villa is undergoing maintenance (as at October 2014) but is still open to the public. Some statues were newly repainted while others are discoloured and covered with dusts and leaves.

But it still a very fascinating experience to see how the Chinese interpret the current world and the otherworld. I have to admit that some of the statues were very out of this world.

There was a canteen but it was not open."
,,The most surreal but enchanting oriental theme park!!,5.0,,"Years ago, I was sifting through my mum's old Black and White photos from the 1960s and saw this most surreal theme park in Singapore. From that moment on, I hoped one day I would be able to visit. My opportunity came when visiting family in Malaysia. Built in the 1930s by two brothers, Haw Par Villa known as ""Tiger Balm Gardens"" is based on Chinese folklore and mythology. Here you can see acres of bizarre statues... A woman in a swimsuit trying to climb out of a shell, an old man suckling on a woman's breast and many more! There is a tunnel called, ""The 10 Courts of Hell"" which tells the punishment for each sin that is committed. The ""Eighth Court of Hell"" shows someone ones intestines being pulled out... His crime? Cheating in exams!!! So watch out students!!! Although there are no food stalls, you can take a picnic and entry is free. Sadly a little tired looking (it is nearly 80 years old!), Haw Par Villa is enchanting if not a bit freaky in places but definitely worth a visit!"
,,Heaven and Hell in a park,3.0,,"This is an old park in Singapore. I remember I visited this park when I was a teen. Well now, the park is still exist but a bit old. Maybe they don;t maintained it hard. Inside the park you can see a lots of chinese statue describing a life in hell, a live in heaven, a lots of Goddess statues too, you can find a large statue of Kwan Im Po Sat at the peak of the park. It was a bit scary but quite interesting though...
The park is very easy access. You can reach it by bus or by MRT, (Haw Par Villa station, Circle Line)
The admission is free."
,,Still good to visit.,4.0,,"Although it has changed its name since I last visited it,it is still worth a visit.When I lived in Singapore in the early 60s it was known as The Tiger Balm Gardens but it is pretty much as I remembered it from all those years ago.My husband had heard so much about it from me and he enjoyed seeing it for himself."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Where do you start..Free admission, open every day. If you take your kids, don't take them into the ""10 Courts of Hell"" very gory. The rest of it is amazing...only pity is that there is no Kiosk or souvenir shop...well worth a visit"
,,Ten Courts,4.0,,"We were living near the MRT station and walked down to the park ... it is a quaint place to visit, and I enjoyed the Court of Hell.
My mother didnt find it too tasteful as such!
But this is a different side of Singapore and I will recommend travelers to pass by and take in a bit of history and folk tales from China.
Did not have time to see more than the 10 courts of hell."
,,Review only about the then courts of hell,4.0,,"Visited on a quick stop and only went to the ten courts of hell, there are more things to discover! The ten courts were especially interesting to learn about the Chinese understanding of crimes and penalty. Made well, very illustrative, shocking for kids, be careful with taking them there. Worth a visit, especially because it is for free and offers more top see. Will come back one day for sure. Thumbs up if you are around the area anyhow."
,,Admission is free and it is a fascinating place to visit,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa, also known as the Tiger Balm Gardens, is a tourist attraction that seems out-of-this-world.

The Gardens was first built by Aw Boon Haw for his brother, Aw Boon Par in 1937 (source: Singapore infopedia). Boon Haw had acquired the hill-side property in 1935 and spent US$1.95 million and two years to build the Haw Par Villa. This place has an interesting history, so please find out more about it.

Today, Haw Par Villa is well-known for the many dioramas and sculptures that depict traditional Chinese legends. Admittedly, many of the dioramas and sculptures seem to require maintenance. Nevertheless, this is a rather fascinating place to visit to get a quick overview to some of the more popular traditional Chinese legends. Furthermore, admission is free. I will not ask too much from such a colourful Haw Par Villa which provides free admission to the general public. Furthermore, it is located very near the Haw Par Villa MRT station, along the Circle line. For the accessibility of this place and the interesting sights in Haw Par Villa, I give it a rating of ""Very Good"".

There are a few spots in Haw Par Villa which are relatively quiet and enjoy cool breezes from time to time. On a day with good weather, Haw Par Villa is a good place to visit for a respite.

There is a section at Haw Par Villa known as the Ten Courts of Hell. For anyone who prefer not to look at nightmarish-looking sculptures, you may do yourself a good favour by giving this section a miss. If curiosity urges you to step into the Ten Courts of Hell, the probable risk is that you could get a fright, which is usually harmless in most cases.

For the folks who would like an effortless way to learn about the history of Haw Par Villa and some of the more popular Chinese folklores, would be delighted that since mid 2014, The Original Singapore Walks has been conducting regular tours about the Haw Par Villa. The tours are conducted once a week, on Fridays, from. 9.30 a.m. - 12.00 noon. for a fee per person. There will be no tour on public holidays. (Information is correct at the timing of writing). The title of the tour is ""Cultured Leopard, Rising Tiger: Finding Your Tao in Haw Par Villa"". I went for this tour and enjoyed learning more about the history of Haw Par Villa and the Aw brothers.

There is no food and beverage establishment within Haw Par Villa. However, visitors can find F&B outlet across the road of the main entrance of Haw Par Villa.

While this place may not have air-conditioned facilities and some sections felt dated, I think it is one of the more interesting places in Singapore that has many interesting tales to share with its visitors. What is more, admission is free!

My suggestion is that visitors could bring along the following during their visit:
1) An umbrella or rain-coat
2) Good pair of walking shoes. (For your information, Haw Par Villa is built on a hill!)
3) Drinking water (to quench thirst and keep oneself hydrated)
4) Insect repellent (just in case you do not want to risk getting a single insect bite)

For visitors travelling on wheelchairs, please take note that some parts may not be accessible by wheelchairs. However, there are well-paved pathways for pedestrians throughout that will allow visitors on wheelchairs to access most of the more popular parts of the Haw Par Villa."
,,Lovely morning excursion,4.0,,"This was my first time back to Haw Paw Villas(formerly Tiger Balm Gardens) since the 1950s when I remember it as my father was stationed here for 3 years in the Royal Air Force.We used to visit regularly in those days and I still remembered some lovely family days out in these beautiful gardens.So when I saw they had a new MRT station at the Villas I thought I would relive my childhood so I thought I would show my wife what a lovely place it was.
We had a great morning exploring and although not quite as I remembered it was still a really great experience with the lovely statues,lakes and gardens in nice peaceful surroundings.
If you have a half day to spare on a Singapore holiday I would highly recommend an outing to Haw Par Villas.And its FREE."
,,Different,5.0,,We struck up a conversation with a lady on the MRT and she warned us not to go to Haw Par Villa as it was very run down and not much to see. I'm glad we didn't listen to her and we made the trip. We planned to get there early and spent a few hours taking in the unusual sights. Very interesting and different and so unlike anywhere we have seen before. I had to use the toilets whilst there and they were in immaculate condition! Well worth the trip and an added bonus is it's free to get into!
,,Memory Lane,4.0,,"When I was a child and live in Singapore, my parents would take me to Haw Par Villa for a day trip. I loved it then and I kinda love it now.

Its a mixture of weird and wonderful fantasy and mythical creatures based on chinese folklore. Some people will find it creepy but its different."
,,Drawn to this place!,5.0,,"Visited as a teen, visited in August, now we went again. My husband and I love roaming around here. We are from Idaho, USA, and nothing can compare to this! !"
,,Worth a brief visit,4.0,,"I am sure the place tells more to someone actually familiar with all the religious and folk stories depicted in the park; for me a sheer scale of the enterprise and the wild vivid colours of this all are enough of a reason to spend couple of hours in the park. Pity that the ""villa"" itself has not survived. BTW, do pay attention to the signs next to the tall monuments. A test question - who is the tallest monument for?"
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"Most travelers don't think of visiting the park. But if you a couple hours to share and have plans on the west side of Singapore, do plan to make a trip to the park. It is free and very interesting. There are many sculptures depicting ancient Chinese folklore. There is an area of the park that shows the 18 levels of hell with very vivid sculptures and carvings that is quite an eye opener."
,,One Time Visit,2.0,,Haw Par Villa or Tiger Balm Garden was used to be one main attraction in the past. Eventhough the management had tried to renovate the place but it still looks old and rundown.. One time visit is more than enough.
,,Worth a visit for an hour,4.0,,"I'd been meaning to come here for the last seven years and four trips to Singapore - it didn't disappoint! It's the most morbid and moribund ""theme park"" I'v ever seen - dark, macabre and gruesome! Fantastic way to get to know the ways you'd be punished for everything from stealing to lying and adultery. Been there, done that, don't need to go back - but worth it for the novelty factor if you have an hour to kill."
,,Hell and other related things.,4.0,,"What began as a villa built by a brother for his younger sibling transformed eventually into a park with dioramas from Chinese mythology and such. Now, I'm neither Chinese nor Buddhist, so I run the risk of giving a flawed account but what I have written here merely reflects what I took from my visit to Haw Par Villa.
The good points:
1. It has free admission.
2. It is right at the exit of the Haw Par Villa MRT station.
3. The place is easily accessible internally, as well, with maps and pointers for the directionally challenged (like me).
There is no place for a ""cons"" column here, because the place is as interesting as it can get. I could see similarities in the philosophies of multiple religions and cultures, and it was an extremely educative experience for me, even as an adult. The only downside (if I may say so) is that some statues do not have an explanation of their significance. Hence, as a non-Chinese visitor, I could not fathom if those statues were derived from local mythology/ folklore or just a work of a completely tripped-out mind with the most fascinating imaginative capabilities.
That said, the ten gates of hell exhibit is definitely interesting with explanatory boards in place as also many other dioramas with their backgrounds delivered to those who need it.
The only thing that constantly amazed me was that parents chose to bring their kids here. While it is a most unusual place to deliver a moral science lesson (I only said unusual. But I do agree that it is one of the most effective places, considering the impression these statues would have on young minds), it is also filled with ""disturbing"" and out-of-the-ordinary imagery. Regardless, one might issue a license to the perversion of grown-up minds for viewing this place with different eyes as opposed to innocent ones of a child.
Definitely worth a visit."
,,Like an acid trip gong wrong,4.0,,"This is one hell of a trippy place I dont know if its meant to entertain you, scare you or simply initiate flashbacks You simply HAVE to see it to believe it The seven levels of hell exihibition will guarantee you nightmares!"
,,Ok but not exceptional,3.0,,"The first time I've visited after hearing so much about it over the years. Easily accessible from Haw Par Villa mrt station. An hour is enough to get the general idea. The Ten Gates of Hell was quite good fun, although a little scary for our daughter."
,,chinese culture,3.0,,"we were staying in the orchard road area, so decided to take the MRT the most convenient. however, will take approximate 1hr to reach. this place is good for younger children to learn cause & effect and values eg. friendship and filial piety towards elders. wear comfortable walking shoes for walking in between changing trains at the MRT stations. also for walking in the park. December is a rainy season, so bring umbrellas and raincoats."
,,Amazingly unique to Singapore!,5.0,,"I don't know why this attraction is not classed as a ""MUST SEE!"" because it is! We loved learning about the Chambers of Hell and spent at least 1-2 hours taking pictures with all of the uniquely strange statues that the park is filled with. You will come across mystical creatures, fat Buddhas, princesses and large painted faces.. the list is endless! There are seats if you get tired, a little mote overwater with really pretty temple areas to relax. This is a fantastic attraction if you enjoy history or simply taking silly selfies! :)"
,,My favourite place in Singapore,5.0,,"Haw Par Villa could easily be my favourite place to visit in Singapore.

1) it's free
2) the place is well kept
3) has so much to see and so much history

The whole park takes about two hours to complete. If you like old Chinese history and folktales, you'll enjoy this park very much. The sculptures are well kept - we even saw some people working on repainting some parts of the park.

You can just take the yellow line (MRT) to Haw Par Villa and it's a two minute walk from there."
,,Different experience,4.0,,Definitely a less tourist-y kind of tour for us but certainly a memorable one for us. We learned a lot about Chinese/Buddhism culture and it made us yearn for more knowledge and experience.
,,Could be a paradise for kids,4.0,,I doubt whether there are any thing that can be entertaining for adults but I am sure kids will enjoy this place.
,,"Unbeknowst to Many, Rich in Culture and History",4.0,,"I have visited this place several times in the past few years. Having heard from my parents they they visited this place during Chinese New Year when they were children, I wanted to rediscover the place for myself. I also researched about the place and wrote a report for a school project.

It is easy to visit this attraction as there is a Haw Par Villa MRT station here. Turn right and walk straight and you will see the entrance. There is no admission fee and you can spend 1 to 2 hours here at a leisurely pace. Do take note that there is only one sheltered area near the entrance with vending machines and washrooms. I would recommend coming here in the late morning when it is nice and bright but not too hot.

This place has many statues and dioramas featuring Chinese folktales and morals. For tourists who are interested in seeing a different side of Singapore, this is the place for you. Alternatively, Singaporeans who want to look at heritage sites can also pay a visit. However, this attraction has often been named as one of the world's weirdest attractions - simply because people do not understand it. There are not many exhibition panels, hence the stories and meanings behind many statues and dioramas are lost. I would recommend taking a guided tour or reading up on the place before visiting. I've written an overview of the history and architecture of the attraction here. Do take some time to read it and I promise you will see this place with new eyes. (:

History:

The man who created Tiger Balm Oil 虎标万金油 had 2 sons named 胡文豹 (1888-1944) and 胡文虎 (1882-1954), so the name Haw Par Villa or 虎豹别墅 refers to these 2 brothers.

The 2 brothers were born in Burma / Myanmar which became a British Empire since 1886. Hence 胡文豹 received English education and became Westernised. On the other hand, 胡文虎 received Chinese education and later lived with his uncle in China for a few years, so he loved the Chinese culture and history.

After the 2 brothers moved to Singapore, 胡文虎 realised that 胡文豹 and many other Singaporean Chinese preferred the Western culture. Hence 胡文虎created a newspaper 《星洲日报》 and built a park (now known as Haw Par Villa) to teach his brother and Singaporean Chinese to appreciate the Chinese culture.

In 1934, 胡文虎 built 虎标万金油花园 (later renamed 虎豹别墅) for his brother as a garden for their house, which was also available for the public to visit. Haw Par Villa was completed in 1937. Back then, it consisted of more than 100 dioramas and statues, along with a swimming pool, zoo and many performances like puppet shows. (Today, only the dioramas and statues remain.) It was a popular recreation centre for many families, fulfilling 胡文虎's dream of educating many people about the Chinese culture.

During World War II, 胡文豹 and his family seeked safety in Burma, while 胡文虎 went to Hong Kong. The Japanese soldiers settled in Haw Par Villa because it had a good location on a mountain and overlooking the sea, so they could monitor the war situation. After the war, many Singaporeans mistakenly believed that the 2 brothers were associated with the Japanese soldiers, so they vandalized and destroyed Haw Par Villa.

After 胡文虎returned to Singapore, he was grieving about his brother’s death and the fact that Haw Par Villa had been destroyed. Hence he tore down and rebuilt the place. The last time he visited the place was to watch the workers add a statue of Buddha to the pagoda, and upon completion of this, he passed away peacefully.

Architecture:

Haw Par Villa has many architectural and design elements that are interesting to notice. For example, once you enter the villa, you will see a wall consisting of stacked spheres (Singaporeans would take photos with this wall in the past). The lamps also have spheres, and there are also 月门 with circular holes. These circles symbolize 圆满的家庭 and 家庭团聚. In addition, you will later see a pond or lake with statues of mermaids. If you look from above, the pond or lake is shaped as the calligraphy word for “胡” (the brothers’ family name, which is also a pun on the Chinese word for a lake 湖), showing 胡文虎’s love for his family and the Chinese culture.

The design of the villa is very dream-like. You’ll notice a lot of greenish-blue, wavy layers of rocky walls all around; they are supposed to imitate waves, mountains and clouds. The path also twists and turns to imitate a river. The pagodas symbolize enlightenment and knowledge. There are also many statues and dioramas about Chinese folktales and moral values, like 西游记 and 白蛇传. They are dream-like in the Chinese culture because of bright colours and half-human half-creature depictions. (For Singaporeans, because the art of Chinese painting has been lost over time, a lot of the details have been lost. If you take a picture of how they paint clouds now, you can them compare with your parents’ photos and you will realize they look very different.)

The underlying theme is mostly morals. For example, one diorama is of a duck and a chicken (extramarital affair), which  is actually to tell viewers to stay loyal to their spouse. You’ll also find that Western culture (drinking, dancing, etc luxurious or “bad” things) is often juxtaposed with Chinese culture. Some statues might seem out of place, such as sumo wrestlers, the statue of liberty or kangaroos. These were actually introduced later on by the 2 brothers’ nephew. He knew that many Singaporeans were poor and could not travel overseas. Thus he would bring back postcards from overseas and build statues to introduce Singaporeans’ to other countries. You might also see tiger statues and items such as a car with a tiger head, which were to promote Tiger Balm Oil.

One of the main exhibits is the Courts of Hell “十八层地狱”, showcasing the different punishments for different wrongdoings. It aims to promote the message “善有善报，恶有恶报；不是不报，时间未到。” (On a side note, this exhibit was ever converted into a water themepark ride and Haw Par Villa was marketed as the Asian Disneyland. However, the plan failed and Haw Par Villa is now preserved in its original state.)"
,,Singapore's best kept secret,5.0,,"I visit Haw Par Villa or Tiger Balm Gardens in Singapore over and over and never get tired of it.

This huge sculpture-park once was a theme-park. Nowadays it is creepy and intriguing, beautiful and deserted and with a fascinating history and story.

I wrote a whole series of blogposts about it.
You can read one here. The rest you can find on my blog.

,,Intriguing,3.0,,"I visited Haw Par Villa sometime ago. It was my third visit and I left with the same feeling I had the two other times I went: “What on earth did I just see?”

If you have been to Singapore multiple times and have seen almost all of the tourist attractions, you should visit Haw Par Villa.

Haw Par Villa used to be in the middle of nowhere but now has its own MRT stop named after it. it’s very easy to get there.

Entrance is free!

The place has a few signs around explaining the scenes so don’t worry about not understanding them. Heck, even I don’t understand much of it.

The park/villa is quite big so be sure to have at least 45 minutes to look at everything. It’s also best to bring a few friends who can help you take photos and bring some water and wear hats to keep you cool."
,,The Stuff of Hilarious Nightmares,5.0,,"Also called ""Tiger Balm Gardens,"" as it was built by the elder Aw brother, Boon Haw, for his younger brother, Boon Par--the two brothers who founded the Tiger Balm enterprise. Filled with spectacularly hilarious statuary and relief sculptures depicting scenes intended to instruct Chinese moral philosophy, the park originally had a didactic purpose. The Ten Courts of Hell, in particular, are a scream in more ways than one, embodying a type of secular Chinese version of Dante's Inferno. Some of the scenes are so fantastic and nightmarish, you can't help but laugh, albeit nervously sometimes! Easy to get to, as there is a Haw Par Villa MRT station on the Circle Line. The entrance is right outside the station exit. Admission is free. Give yourself plenty of time to wander through everything and read the signs, so you can absorb the significance of the various scenes."
,,Interesting,3.0,,Very interesting walking around looking at all the statues and reading the storied behind them. Very easy to get to. We caught the MRT there then wasked a very short distance. As we had done most thing thought we would try this. Deffiently not disappointed.
,,Legends come to life in vibrant colour,4.0,,"Such a change from the modern commercial city. After spending time in this fast-moving sophisticated city, here’s a chance to see the Chinese legends brought to life in full glorious colour – esp the blood :) As it’s got its own MRT station, it’s worth a short visit to see a different side to the city.
Maintaining this large attraction must be costly, and the tropics are cruel to paint. Some areas are bright and newly painted, while others are somewhat faded. They don’t charge for admission, and I’d rather it was free, even if it’s slightly less than perfect.
It’s open every day from 9am to 7pm. Google's information is incorrect.
It was very hot when we visited, so try to visit when it’s cloudy.
Everything was clean. Toilets were very clean. There are notices up about there being no water in the toilets, but no problems when we were there.
We found 3 drink dispensing machines, 1 at the park entrance, 1 at the entrance to the 10 courts of hell, and 1 near the toilets, where there’s also a snack machine. Drinks dispensers should accept notes, but the snacks machine only accepts the right amount in coins.
I’ve been several times over the years, and always enjoy coming. I wouldn’t rate it as a top attraction if you only have a few days. But if you have time, it’s really an unusual place to visit."
,,Delightfully bizarre,4.0,,"Found this while looking for some less touristy things to do in Singapore.
There is a walking tour by The Original Singapore Walks that I would recommend, because it provides information about the history of the park itself and the dioramas which would otherwise have been interesting but not overly meaningful if you don't know about the folklore behind them.
Even without a tour, I would recommend popping in, because it is something a bit different. Sort of a theme park for morality tales, free and right next to the MRT.
As some have mentioned, some of the displays are in need of repair, but some rejuvenation is happening and it did not affect our experience. It's definitely not for everyone, but I'm glad I went."
,,Cool Place,4.0,,"The place is not new and some sculptures badly need restoration but it's certainly weird in a cool way. There are a lot of expositions (mostly Chinese or Buddhist stories told through sculpture) and it may take a couple of hours to explore them all. Note to families with children: some sculptures (mermaids) are topless and some others (""10 Courts of Hell"" cave) are quite graphic so beware."
,,Chinese Diorama,4.0,,"No ticket needed to enter this venue. Inside you'll find many statue from Chinese folklore. There's hell venue also. Not recommended for children because it shows you torments in hell. It's gruesome and violent. Quite clean actually, only few leaves that falls since it's dry seasons."
,,Weird,4.0,,Easy to reach as the MRT stops just outside. Lots of colorful and weird scenes from Chinese folklore. It was set up by the family of the famous Tiger balm and it is interesting how it all came about. There is some newly painted of scenes around which has made them look much better. There is more restoration work to do and I hope they finish some of the other parts to add to history. A very interesting place to visit if a little weird
,,"Lots of fun, close by the MRT - visit hell while in Singapore!",5.0,,"A 50 meter walk from the closest subway, the Haw Par Villa is also called the Tiger Balm Shrine (yep, that Tiger Balm). Plenty of Buddhist folklore is on display, including a PG-13 rated version of the Buddhist underworld complete with the kings of hell.

For better or worse, Buddhist crime fits Buddhist punishment. Rob someone, get your hand cut off. Murder someone, get dismembered. You'll be warned about this in English, but there's plenty of information inside in English - other hell temples seen around Thailand offer very little in the way of English explanation.

Continue the exploration around the area, and rely on the signage to point the way. There's enough to keep you busy for a couple of hours, but bring some water and wear a comfy pair of shoes!"
,,Been to hell and back ........,4.0,,"It has been a very long time since I last visited Haw Par Villa and compared to the other more recent tourist attractions in Singapore, this attraction certainly looks like it has seen much better days.

There is no entrance fee but the parking you set you back SGD 5. (Cash only)

If you want to have deeper insights into the rich variety of Chinese Mythologies, this place is a must visit. For me, the highlight, has been and on this visit was the 10 Courts of Hell. Was rather amused that there was a notice advising Parental Guidance at the entrance of this exhibit. Whilst not exactly Madam Tussauds quality, the statues are graphic enough to ensure that I will always be on Santa's ""good list"".

Enough of hell. The rest of the park looks very jaded and need some more maintenance to keep it to the standards of the other attractions in Singapore.

Apart from, what I am assuming to be well known Chinese epics of Sun Wukong, aka the Monkey King, 8 Immortals etc, the ethics and philosophy of Confucianism is very evident in a lot of the exhibits.

Hint: Bring some bottled water with you. With the Pavilion which sells drinks closed, (at least when I was there) you will need a means to hydrate yourself in the tropical heat.

Conclusion: Like MacDaddySing mentioned in his earlier review, it is ""Distinctly weird"" and is a must see if you are into Chinese folk lores and mythologies."
,,Intriguing experience,4.0,,"Well, I'm a Singaporean and yesterday was my virgin trip to Haw Par Villa and I must say, I was deeply fascinated with the place.

For those interested in the Chinese Mythologies, legends, maybe you wouldn't want to give this place a miss.

I mean, it's free (except for vehicles, entrance fee: S$5)

You can see more pictures posted here: http://msrmegs.wordpress.com/2014/10/27/virgin-trip-to-haw-par-villa/"
,,Distinctly weird but you should see it,5.0,,"People rave about the zoo or Orchard Road or the Singapore Art Museum....but come here.

It's distinctly odd: acres of friezes of Chinese folklore, provided by a local millionaire in the 1930s as some sort of reminder of traditional culture, it sprawls colourfully up the side of a hill without embarrassment, despite its obvious eccentricity.

Highlight is the 10 courts of hell - probably best you don't take your kids in here, but if you thought Dante had hell sussed out, this vision might make you think the Chinese had put some effort into it too. Oh and the other thing, you remember that odd eighties TV series with Monkey, Pigsy and Tripitaka? Well that's here too, and you can learn where it really came from."
,,Abandon theme park,3.0,,"it's actually a variety theme park, Chinese culture, worldwide representative like Australia park,new York park and Africa park. Although it's not clean as other place, but it's worth to take a walk.Take photo with the creature and statues. It's convenience and it's FREE.
My suggestion, visit there at morning, because we found out there already become a secret picnic place for most of the Filipino."
,,Not a must see - but a unique attraction if you have time,3.0,,"We had read about Haw Par Villa and were intrigued.

It is basically a park that depicts stories from Chinese folklore. The most famous area is the 10 Courts of Hell - with gruesome statues showing punishments for different crimes after death.

The rest of the park contains some very peculiar statues, including a crab with a lady's face, a rat massacre and mice with guns.

Its very very dated but an interesting visit.

It takes a bit of effort on the MRT to get there so if you are short on time, it may not be worth it.

I wouldn't return - but am glad I visited. It's a very unique attraction."
,,...a little trip in the past,4.0,,"A place where you can see history in Singapore. For free!!! Ok, a lot of you will say, it looks shabby and run down - not Singapore like! Well, it is maybe exactly this, what makes it so interesting! Avoid weekends and especially PHs."
,,Bizarre and unique,4.0,,"One of the strangest and most unique tourist attractions anywhere, let alone Singapore. Built by a millionaire to teach the town folk morality lessons through statues and dioramas. A sprawling park full with colorful statues. The gates of hell where the punishments for various crimes are shown in gory detail is very striking."
,,A theme park full of statues,3.0,,"Haw Par villa originally called dragon balm villa was founded by two brothers-Haw and Par who invented the popular tiger balm Later it was named after its founders as Haw Par villa We went there as it was mentioned in guide book as a theme park located very near to the Metro station Haw Par villa and admission was free It is a sprawling park with lots of trees and greeneries and of course a few thousand statues of different sizes and a few hundred big dioramas. All of these depict various tales from Chinese mythology and Confucianism We,being from India did not understand much of these but appreciated the beautiful statues of Lord Buddha and some incidents from His life Ten courts of hell evoked our interest It is not frequented by many visitors and all of them seemed to be Chinese Drinking water and clean toilets are available inside the park"
,,"It nice,it shadowed",5.0,,"It been recommended by our hotel concierge He say it free, you must see it It more about philosophy I love 10 courts of hell"
,,Enchanting and a must-visit.,5.0,,"It is strange that I found it empty of foreign tourists though it is such a fascinating place to visit, and very Chinese. It is just a minute walk from the MRT station and entry is free. It could have been a fantasy park with so many statues & images from old traditions, animal kingdom and myths. There are some items depicting hell and other terrifying places. But plenty of places to take fun photos. I learned about the place from our local host and I did enjoy visiting it."
,,Fantastic place if you love vintage places,5.0,,"We are from Hong Kong and it used to be a Haw Par Villa there but since long demolished so we are happy it still exists one in Singapore.
It is a calm place to have a stroll around, but be aware that the canteen may not be open and the whole area is not fully accessible, but we loved it. Especially the pretty terrifying 10 courts of hell.

It is fantastic that it is still allowed to exists in the very densely populated Singapore"
,,Feeling its age,3.0,,"Many others have commented that maintenance is not great here, and that's accurate. There are a ton of statues, and it provides interesting background into Chinese folklore, which I found fascinating; you just have to look past peeling paint and dirty water. I would caution against bringing young children; there is a warning sign outside the 10 Gates of Hell exhibit, which is definitely not child friendly. But even some of the other exhibits display violence - there was one with a woman getting her head chopped off, not sure why - so I would think that children aged 7-12ish may be uncomfortable. There are a number of signs saying don't touch the statues, but I saw dozens of tourists posing with them and climbing on them, so that is not really upheld. It's conveniently located right outside the Haw Par Villa MRT, it's open seven days a week, and it's free. If you're in Singapore for a little bit longer, it's worth a look; I wouldn't prioritize it for a brief trip though."
,,outstandingly odd & unique,5.0,,"straight out of ripley's believe it or not is haw par villa, certainly the world's oddest and most colorful amusement park. it reminded me of a park full of the old, oddball roadside attractions that once lined america's first highways. words do not do it justice, you just have to google for images to believe it. the gates of hell are gruesome, you will definately think about changing your ways after looking at them lol. the rest of the park is much more light-hearted. i would absolutely not recommend the gates of hell for small children, but teens will love it. anazing what great shape the park is in considering there is no visible staff or anything around and that it is quite popular with locals. note haw par villa easy to get to via its own mrt subway stop and free of charge, so its a must do if you are spending more than a day or two in singapore (we stayed 8 days and never ran out of things to do - its a great city). afterward, we headed back a couple subway stops to visit gilman barracks, singapore's modern art gallery district. also worth a look although its a bit of a haul walking from the station."
,,Hasn't changed in 37 years. You must go see this!,5.0,,I visited Haw Par Villa 37 years ago while staying with my relatives for the summer here. I HAD to go back to see if it was still here and it is. So colorful and unique. Just as the memory I had in my mind. The MRT SPS right at it and it's free so there is no excuse not to visit this Singapore icon. I promise you won't be disappointed.
,,Childhood memories relived- go now it will be gone soon!,5.0,,"I lived with my family in Singapore in the late 60's and my memories of playing in the Tiger Balm Gardens with my sister are very strong. So when I had the chance to revisit this year... wow! 45 years later and I still remembered the Buddah, the 10 Halls of Hell and King Kong (!) There was a giant dragon but he has gone. This is a fabulous place for children although the Halls of Hell is a little gruesome so prepare them- but still take them!

Getting a bit shabby in places but so worth a visit! It's free because it can't make a profit nowadays and, I was told by a shopkeeper, it's being demolished next year. That's the last of my childhood memories sacrificed to Singaporean progress!"
,,loved it must visit,5.0,,I visited this park over 20years ago & it was a great day out. I don't know how old it is but my Nan had told me she'd loved it too when she was there many years before I can only guess that they are constantly improving & updating it. If I was to go back again I would definitely go here again to enjoy what I remember & experience any changes. I went in 1991-1992
,,a place of historical statues and wonderful place for chinese education.. ( myths and legends )..,5.0,,"i'd been to Haw Par Villa with my family when i was young.. back then.. we can see trams going up and down the roads.. i can even remember there was a water ride that bypass the 10 courts of Hell.. and down it goes like roller coaster which sent me having nightmares that night ( from the ride rather than the 10 courts of Hell ).. and also there were timely shows previewing at certain times..

i also thought that it was closed until i decided to go back again with my poly friends back in 2005 and to my surprise.. admission is now totally free.. after revisiting again with my family in 2012.. many things have changed.. they used to have a restaurant located in the premise.. but it no longer stands there.. the statues are starting to fade off and chip off.. and the wordings that tells of each tales are unable to read..

i do hope that they will not close down Haw Par Villa as it really teaches one to be honest and not do harm unto others if not the bad will befalls you.. this is one place that i will not stop going to as it really holds memories.. if ever i have foreign friends coming to Singapore.. instead of the various famous attractions.. this is the place on the top of the list that i will bring them to..

but the down thing about this place is.. as it is already a rundown place.. shades and enough fluid or even snacks needs to be brought along.. unless one can tolerate hunger for more than 3 hours.. because it will really takes time for one to really slowly walk through each part of Haw Par Villa and understand what chinese culture.. myths and legends really use to be.."
,,Bizarre but could get cult status!,3.0,,"I'd seen this reviewed by Lonely Planet and it looked so weird that I wanted to see it for myself. It's definitely an experience and if you have a bit of extra time on your hands in Singapore it is worth seeing (especially since it's free). The park is old and it is sad that it is in such a state of neglect but I guess it can't compete with newer, more exciting theme parks. There are no rides - it is a park made up of colourful statuary and dioramas (though the paint needs refreshing). The cafe is no longer open and the toilets were 'interesting' but functional. There are water features but there is so much algae in them that you walk away feeling very sorry for the fish and terrapins that reside there. We saw one member of staff who appeared to be the maintenance chap. There were just two other visitors to this large park so it felt a little desolate - but I'd expected that and it was part of the 'interest factor'.

We actually enjoyed the couple of hours we spent there and got some bizarre photos out of it."
,,An Old Cultural Garden,3.0,,"History says that this park or gardens was built by two enterprising Chinese Burmese brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par in the earlier part of the twentieth century, hence the name Haw Par Villa. It is also known as Tiger Balm Gardens after the name of the medicinal balm manufactured and marketed by the brothers.

It is a huge park where you can see many, numbering by the hundreds, very colourful statues or statuettes of Chinese mythological characters all around, with many themes depicting Chinese, Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian folklores of yore.

When we were there about a decade ago, they used to charge an entrance fee, but surprisingly now there is a big sign outside that says entrance is free. That is a good step forward and would certainly be an added attraction to tourists who come to Singapore."
,,quiet and weird,3.0,,Whilst in Singapore we decided to visit the tiger balm gardens. The journey on the mrt was a long one from where we were staying . When we arrived I noticed how quiet it was. The place looks unloved and dilapidated which I found quite sad. There was no gift shop or cafe and the toilets were very run down. There was little information on what the statues depicted which made it hard to enjoy and appreciate the place. I would not go again but it is worth a visit if you have spare time in singapore
,,Very unexpected and awesome,5.0,,"Went there on a sunny weekend day with my Chinese friend. The attraction is pretty remote from the city centre, but is completely free. Villa features statues depicting Chinese beliefs (hell), fairy tales and general moral truths. It helps to take a local along with you to introduce the background. Either way, very very awesome and fun. Try going on a sunny day if you want amazing pictures."
,,Weird and wonderful,5.0,,"This kitsch park is a surreal must see in Singapore. Built in the Thirties by the founders of the Tiger Balm medicinal empire, it is supposed to give the visitor instruction in proper behaviours through visual examples from legend and modern life. It is a riot of luminous colour, bad figurines and ludicrous situations. I love it; it’s like It’s a Knockout on steroids, a seedy carnival display fallen on hard times. Allow 45m and take a wide angle lens."
,,Weird but worth the trip out to have a look,4.0,,"This really is an interesting place to visit but probably only if you have a few days in Singapore or have been before.

Long walk up a steep hill at the entrance.

Could do with some maintenance work which appeared to be happening when we were there."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"We visited Haw Par Villa because every time I am in Singapore I like to do something different and this was different.

It is located at Haw Par Villa MRT and it is easy to get to and there is no entrance fee.

This park was built by two brothers who wanted it to be a place to teach or show traditional Chinese mythology and values. There are a lot of different statues and themes throughout the park but the best well know place is the '10 Courts of Hell' which my son was interested in because 1) he is a boy and 2) because there was an actual story that went with it.

I could have stayed longer at this park and gone through everything but it was hot. So I recommend going on a cloudy day or later in the afternoon. It is worth a visit."
,,Eccentric and gory!,3.0,,"I don't think this type of theme park would go down too well in England but as there were plenty of Singaporeans and Chinese when we visited, I guess they view things a little differently.
I found 'The Ten Courts of Hell' jaw-droppingly gory but the Asian children didn't seem too fazed by it.
The rest of the park has a wacky array of statues, both human and animal in human guise, and colourful friezes and pagodas. I'm glad I saw it but I don't think I could handle it again."
,,Weird and Wacky Theme Park,4.0,,"There is no place quite like this - a ""theme park"" filled with strange life-sized statues of humanized animals, scary Chinese mythological characters, and plenty of dioramas many with blood and gore.

And then there is the main attraction - the Ten Courts of Hell, which depict in gruesome detail what punishments befall sinners in hell.

Believe it or not all of these serve to teach morality and Chinese values.

For Singaporeans, the more than 50 year old Haw Par Villa are a key part of our growing up years as we all made an obligatory visit to the park when we were young. For visitors to Singapore, a trip to Haw Park Villa will prove an interesting and insightful visit into Chinese religion, culture and history - although you probably won't be able to make much sense of it all. No matter, it will definitely be something different from the top line tourist attractions in Singapore.

You can read my blog post about my recent visit:
untouristsingapore.wordpress.com/2014/06/28/haw-par-villa-haunting-memories"
,,Don't forget your sunscreen!,4.0,,"Haw par villa is a great free attraction. It tells you a lot about the culture and is quirky and fun. The 10 courts of hell we're fascinating, very graphic with many inventive ways punish a sinner. A lot of the statues are quite worn but I thought it gave the place more character when reading through the stories. Definitely worth a visit, I toured the park for 45 mins as there is very little shelter to shield you from exposure to the sun."
,,Educational Place for the Young!,3.0,,"This theme park in Singapore comes with Great History. There are also not many of these types of traditional theme parks left in the world.

School brought us there when we were young. In the 80's and 90's, there was not much theme park in Singapore, Haw Par Villa is one of the most visited Theme Park. It teaches young children about morale of humans, and history too. The park, originally called Tiger Balm Gardens, was built in 1937 by the Burmese-Chinese brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, the developers of Tiger Balm, as a venue for teaching traditional Chinese values.

The best known attraction in Haw Par Villa is the Ten Courts of Hell, which features gruesome depictions of Hell in Chinese mythology and Buddhism. This attraction used to be set inside a 60-metre long trail of a Chinese dragon but the dragon has been demolished, so the attraction is now covered by grey stone walls. This was a fascinating part of the theme park. It describes, in detail, the torture and punishment for each sin one commits in a lifetime. As you enter the tunnel, you are greeted by the first court’s king.

Other major attractions include dioramas of scenes from Journey to the West, Fengshen Bang, The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars, Legend of the White Snake, Romance of the Three Kingdoms; statues of mythological figures such as the Laughing Buddha and Guanyin, and historical personages such as Jiang Ziya, Su Wu and Lin Zexu; the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, and others. There are also monuments dedicated to the Aw brothers and their parents.

Getting to the theme park is much easier now as compared to last time. The Circle Line station, Haw Par Villa MRT Station (CC25), located next to it, opened on 8 October 2011. Train ride is just a stone throw away!

I still remember when i was younger, i used to hear that the place is haunted as the monuments will come to life. And strange noises will be heard from the tunnel of hell. but all those were crazy."
,,Haw Par Villa,5.0,,"I visited this in May 2014 and was absolutely astounded at how interesting this was. Foo our guide, was a bundle of information, pointing out everything he could so we did not miss a thing. I would have liked to have stayed longer, but we were on our way to Krangi and Changi - but I would not have missed this for the world and will be going back again next time I am in Singapore. The only thing not available there was Tiger Balm but I managed to get some at the Changi Musem..........."
,,Quirky free fun,4.0,,"A guidebook I'm using for my stay in Singapore described Haw Par Villa as quirky and free, so immediately I knew it was for me! It couldn't be easier to get here with an MRT station outside the entrance, but if you wanted to do some public transport sight seeing, the 51 bus also stops nearby.

Yes, some of the statues could use a touch up, but that's part of the charm. I visited on a Sunday afternoon so there were lots of families visiting and most of them had an elderly grandfather or uncle passing down the oral traditions to the kids.

If you only have a limited amout of time, don't miss the 10 Gates of Hell. It's located near the entrance and whether you find it sobering or hilarious, you be glad you saw it."
,,Terribly dated but fascinating in its own way....,3.0,,"Founded by the inventor of Tiger Balm, Haw Par Villa sets a wide arrange of Chinese mythical traditions in sculpted figures all over a beautiful hill near a subway stop. These include a nice view of one of his old cars, shrines to the sons (scaled largely on how much he liked them), the ""10 gates of hell"" with cartoon like sculpted displays of the ill treatments in the afterlife for various types of sins in mortality... It is a fun trip but not one you are likely to repeat."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa is a nice place to spend a couple of hours in. The place is full of strange and wonderful statues, some showing some myths and others are just funny. If you visit with kids, you may want to avoid the 10 courts of hell, the displays there are rather of a graphic nature. It's so easy to get there, it's right beside the MRT station."
,,Singapore's Historical Villa,5.0,,"Is memorable for every Singaporean! Hope there is a breakthrough in this place, now is getting more popular as there is MRT nearby."
,,"Interesting, free and easy to get to - what more do you need?",5.0,,"Went for a visit because we aren't interested in most of Singapore's attractions which are mainly very pricey, shopping-related and/or not particularly distinct. This place is very interesting, fascinating even, if you like the macabre and grotesque. Very interesting insight and depictions of Chinese traditional beliefs and mythology. Somewhat old and dusty, but for a free admission, how can one complain?

It is right outside the exit of Haw Par Villa MRT station and is absolutely free. The whole centre is open until 6, at which point the 10 gates of hell exhibit closes. The rest of the grounds are open until 7. Outdoors, but much of the way is shaded and the hell exhibit is is indoors. Gates of hell exhibit not recommended for young children due to scenes of torture and dismemberment, however we did observe several families taking their young kids though - depends on parental approach, I suppose."
,,Horribly Awesome!,5.0,,"This place is Amazingly Aweful - in a Rocky-Horror-Picture-Show sort of way. . .

If you are in Singapore be sure to stop in for a visit to this strange and bizarre theme park. It's FREE, so just jump on the Circle Line exit at Haw Par Villa and make a right when you exit the MRT, (you literally can not miss it) and take a stroll through what was once a popular family destination in Singapore.

This is a unique and truly authentic Singapore experience. You will not see anything like this anywhere else in the world. Be prepared though, it is a bit odd and run-down. But a must see nonetheless.

Tips:
Go early in the morning while it's cooler outside - it gets a bit hot here
Bring water, sun-glasses and/or a hat
Not necessarily a good place for little ones."
,,Just a little wierd,4.0,,"Loved this place, its a bit bizarre but you get a great insight to Chinese mythology Personal favorite the 10 courts of hell!! Get off the MRT @ HAW PAR it right there"
,,Interesting,4.0,,I came down with my family. It was quite an educational trip. Interesting reads with a little scary sculptures. Some are not really suitable for young kids. It was scorching hot and there was barely no shelter. The place is really old and not really as clean..
,,Haw Par Villa,4.0,,"HawPar Villa is a place of believe. In a city of concrete jungle, there is very few limited places to visit. But Haw Par Villa shows another side of the Lion City. Its old historical and believe. What surprises me is the people behind this place is actually the brothers who sold Tiger Balm!

Here, they have sculptures of heaven and hell, as well as cause and effects. Its a good way to teach the younger ones not to do bad things.

http://www.millymin.com/2014/05/haw-par-villa-singapore/"
,,Very interesting and different,3.0,,"My husband and I took the MRT and the park is straight outside the MRT station. You can drive and park there but the car park is very small.
It's admission is free and it's open from 10am to 7pm. We went on a public holiday and it was open."
,,"Quirky, garish, beautiful, grotesque, amazing",5.0,,"The brothers who sold Tiger Balm had unusually vivid imaginations. Their dreams have taken form here. Like nothing you have ever seen. Anywhere. Ever.
Perhaps 1,000 statues adorn a hillside telling a story no one can understand. Stunning sculptures and ceramics with ultra bright colors make this a premier art museum. The characters almost come to life, and the scenes are so realistic.
Yet it would not be good for children under 14. There are too many blood-and-guts scenes, especially in the portion labeled Hell.
Recommended as an eye-opener and easy to get to from the Metro station."
,,"Cool, Mysterious surprising place",4.0,,"A bit off the beaten track, and less touristy than other areas this gem is well worth a visit. Beautiful gardens adorned with creepy statues tell a story of times gone by. A fabulous photo opportunity for budding photographers! Would highly recommend."
,,Delightful Surprise,5.0,,"The place is next to Haw Par Villa MRT station and price is right – free. Haw Par Villa Dragon World (formerly known as Tiger Balm Gardens) is in much better shape than I remembered in 1974. I was delightfully surprised with the grounds. My expectations were an old, rundown property with weeds growing everywhere. The stories I heard are not true. This place is very well maintained. Yes, some painting is needed but the place is brightly colored with many stories. We spent 2.5 hours walking the place reading about Chinese mythology. There were few people on the grounds on this Wednesday mid morning but you will be sharing space with mosquitoes. Be prepared. There is standing water and we were bitten. If you are into Chinese mythology, legends and folklore, this is a great place to spend your time."
,,Many statue,4.0,,"Haw Par villa is a park with a lot of statue. Every statue has its story, some have an written explanation. I enjoy my visit here for one hour, laugh for some funny pose of statue. No admission fee, and located right beside MRT Haw Par Villa station."
,,"Much less touristy, much more interesting!",4.0,,"Has Par Villa is bizarre but an attraction we were glad we checked out!

It is a large park style space full of over 1,000 statues.

The 10 Halls of Hell are fascinatingly graphic and probably not ideal if you have small kids with you.

There's also an area seemingly depicting the Chinese folklore Monkey Magic is based on.

If you're looking for something different to the tourist attractions everyone has heard of in Singapore, Haw Par Villa is your place!"
,,Trip down memory lane,3.0,,"Mostly unchanged from when I went in the 70's but managed to scare the children in the ten courts of hell! Interesting for an hour, plenty of shade and free. No real facilities so take a drink or picnic."
,,Not a must visit place for tourists,3.0,,"Definitely NOT a must visit place for all the tourist, but if you have ample of time to spend and have kids with you then you must pay a visit. NO entrance fee and it opens from 9:30am.

I live in Singapore for 4 years now, never got a chance to visit this place even though we travelled thousand times in front of Haw Par Villa gate. Last Saturday, I visited this place. Seeing 10 gates of hell reminded me of all the stories my cousins used to tell me when I was a kid about why we should not lie and what happens if we do so. It was fun!"
,,Something different !,3.0,,"This place is quiet different from the regular tourist attractions - most attractive is the 10 courts of hell which gives the details of the punishments that people would suffer for the sins they did in hell.Depicted in a nice way and might not be suitable for younger kids. A parental guidance board can also seen outside this place. Though the park as a whole is open till 7 - the 10 courts are open only till 6.

Be sure to take some snacks or water as there is nothing around to eat - did find a notice board that said snacks and drinks machine available but i may have missed it.The park itself is lined up with amazing statues and depicts a lot about chinese mythology.

Easily reachable via MRT on the circle line(yellow) - it has a station of its own !! Not quite the usual attraction but a one time visit for its variance !"
,,"Unexplainable, must see for yourself!",3.0,,"I had been to Singapore before and done all the usual tourist attractions so this time I decided on something different. This amusement park sort of place without any rides will have you rethinking your thoughts on Singaporean attractions. It is different from anything else I experienced here but I would recommend it to anybody to see at least once. The stories are interesting, the paintings are intricate and you learn a bit of culture and history. It is also very strange, weird and downright gruesome but that is what makes it different from other Singaporean attractions. The park is free and takes only about an hour to walk around."
,,Truly remarkable place!,5.0,,"This is a unique and amazing place that should be on every Singapore visitor's itinerary! It is difficult to describe precisely, but it's along the lines of a statuary garden or theme park. As others have said, don't miss the 10 gates of Hell. For that matter, don't miss any of it--you can see everything in under two hours.

Other reviewers lament its neglect, but it looks about the same as I remember from multiple visits as a kid (1969-70). With one exception: it was practically deserted on this trip, on a lovely Sunday morning. Certainly some parts of it are in disrepair--and I saw a few exhibits in the process of restoration--but you can't expect the visitor center to open when there are practically no visitors.

The Tourist Board, who currently operates the place, needs to get on the ball--I met numerous people who'd never heard of the place, even longtime residents! It's free, open 9 am to 7 pm, and is immediately adjacent to its own MRT station on the Circle line."
,,A National Treasure In Need Of Love.,5.0,,"My second visit, the first being in 1968 as a merchant seaman visiting a very different Singapore quite regularly for 5 or 6 years. It brought back so many memories but I was shocked at the state that the 'Tiger Balm Gardens' had been allowed to descend into.
Here is an iconic pieces of cultural history which has been allowed to fall into disrepair. The Tea Room is deserted, The Information Centre & Shop empty, some of the tableaux looking quite shabby and un-cared for. Quite a disgrace, particularly when to look about all one can see is development of shopping centres & high-rise tower blocks.
This is such an important place that it needs to be preserved.
Curiosity in the West is so high when Far Eastern Culture is mentioned. People want to know more about the history, cultural & mythical.
Singapore has long been known as the crossroads of the Far East. What a crime if it became known as purely the commercial crossroads, without history or a soul!
Happily, some cash appears to have been spent on renovation, but this process should be accelerated to prevent more deterioration.
Perhaps the commercial side should be developed to encourage people to spend a little money which can then be applied to the site?
I would not be averse to paying an entrance fee to see this place - after all, very little, except for shopping, is free in The Lion City and so why not?

Please, Government of Singapore, pull your finger out and market the place properly with an enthusiastic young team. It will pay off and could easily be self sustaining in time. Rant over!

We enjoyed our walk around and stayed for three hours (would have loved some refreshment, not out of a cursed vending machine).

We would recommend this place, highly!

Finally, it was World famous as 'The Tiger Balm Gardens' - time to revert to the original name I think!!!"
,,Quirky...,4.0,,"I guess this attraction contradicts the general opinion of Singapore as a dull and staid place which offers little but shopping and eating. Better days have seen this attraction, but it is an interesting place to visit. As others have mentioned the ""HELL"" exhibition is the most interesting (and gruesome). You can tell this place was the mind of some pretty rich and quirky people."
,,Colourful exhibit! Don't miss the Ten Courts of Hell!,3.0,,"I went with office mates after lunch. This colourful theme park features gruesome depictions of Chinese mythology, folklore, Zodiac animals and Buddhism.

There an exhibit that shows the Ten Courts of Hell, quite gruesome. You'll also see exhibits about the Tiger Balm brothers.

A lot of walking inside the park. The food stall was closed when we went there. There was a drinks vending machine inside. It's now accessible via the Circle Line MRT - Haw Par Villa station."
,,Bit Tacky But Fun,4.0,,If you are looking to add a bit of color to your day head out here. It's a fun contrast from the more traditional sights and makes for a nice break. Worth an hour or so especially if your are at this end of town. On the same MRT line as Botanic Garden and Labrador park so combine all three for a nice day out.
,,Singapore's forgotten gem!,4.0,,"Visiting Haw Par Villa was a trip down memory lane. I last visited this attraction more than 12 years ago. While it's largely the same, the water theme park ride and amphitheater is closed.

The highlight is always the 10 Courts of Hell. There are thousands of statues in the park and a walk around should not take you more than two hours.

Entrance to the park is free and it's opened 7 days a week. There aren't any shops in or around the park so do bring your own drinks and food."
,,"Fantastic art history, story time",5.0,,"I thought I had seen everything there was to see in attractions in Singapore and was convinced I had been here many years ago but my friend had not been so off we went.As soon as we arrived I knew I hadn't been here, it was obviously the one in Hong Kong I had been to.
You cannot be disappointed with this free attraction, firstly it is right next door to the Haw par villa station, It involves a few steep walks but along the way there are so many amazing mythical characters to see you just wonder how they have managed to paint them all individually, there are some macabre scenes with sharks swallowing people and people fighting. At each display there is a story and if it is not too hot spend some time as they are quite interesting. BUT a Singaporean lady said they were talking about closing it down and using the land I think it doesn't get the patronage anymore. so if you are in Singapore try to see it before it is gone because it is FREE !!!"
,,Colourful Imagination,4.0,,This is a wildly colourful garden packed with brightly painted statues and dioramas each with its own story to tell. The garden is set on the side of a hill and the path can be a little steep if you are walking in the hot sun. There are plenty of benches available to sit and rest and take in the colourful scene around the park. BYO drinks and refreshments as there is nothing for sale. The garden is easy to reach by public transport and is located above the Haw Par Villa MRT station.
,,Eclectic - and Odd.,3.0,,"So the guys that made Tiger Balm made this place. Cool. They wanted to showcase the different layers of Chinese Hell. Also cool. The end result? Like an acid trip on a bad Monday. When we arrived the park - open all the time to the public - was relatively empty, which made it that much creepier. While I did learn a bit about the layers of Chinese Hell, I was mostly over it relatively quickly. I'm sure that kids might get a kick out of it, but I thought it really quite a bit strange. Easy to get to, so definitely check it out during some free time."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Plenty ot figures and scenes illustrating myths and history.A very interesting park but a bit abandoned.
,,LOVE this place,5.0,,"I have been here a few times, i LOVE it! it is so strange and so entertaining. Worth the extra fee is the Courts of Hell! very funny! I don't know anyone who doesn't like visiting Haw Par Villa (aka Tiger Balm Gardens)"
,,Colourful Mythological Creatures Abound,4.0,,"Everyone living in or visiting Singapore should see this very special place! I cannot believe I waited three years to do just that! The MRT station is next to these gardens. While the villa and grounds were built in 1937, the gardens, sights, and gods and goddesses are modestly maintained. There is no admission fee. You meander winding uphill paths that provide vistas of the straits and its ships. There are monuments to the memory of the Ah brothers Haw and Par. The ten gates of hell are so interesting and unforgettable with their gore ( not advisable for young children) and the crimes and associated punishments when one leads a bad life. The focus on filial piety is striking. I learned so much about the buddhas,the goddess of mercy, the myths, and the culture of Chinese values and ethics.
While certain areas are in need of fresh paint, the ponds are teeming with flora and fauna and provide a heavenly spot for a picnic. There are vending machines and today the canteen was closed ( perhaps it opens on weekends but there was none to inquire). Signs admonish folks not to climb or touch the statues, yet several people could not resist sitting on a statue for a photo op. The bright colors, intricate facades, building details, and the plaques with history and stories make the visit very worthwhile."
,,Extremely weird and worth the visit,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa is like a public park with the figures and dioramas also there. It was fascinating to see and be bewildered. It rained when I went but there were of plenty of places to take cover. On a nice day it would be fun to bring a picnic, since it's kind of a park. It's a large complex and you need about an hour to walk around and see everything.

It was free to enter which was great, and totally worth seeing. It was so weird! Regarding the 10 Courts of Hell, I was glad that I saw it and I will never go in there again. It is so disturbing."
,,Very interesting.,4.0,,"First thing I did was enter 10 courts of hell and was startled by the gory scenes depicting the very brutal fates of those who had sinned. Very gory imagery, but very interesting how offenders are dealt with in different ways. If you are brave enough, you can look into the mirror of truth and see what you looked like in those times, whether you are evil or a saint, I was apparently evil for some reason, when I saw my reflection, it showed a devil face. There is a whole lot of imagery depicting many stories from Chinese mythology, good to take kids to go and learn. Quite big so I recommend around an hour to an hour and a half. Again at the time I went I was literally the only one there."
,,"Strange place, but interesting and FREE",5.0,,"Easy to get, because Haw Par Villa MRT station is about 100 metres from entrance gate. This place is free of charge and maybe the strangest park I have ever been. Quite large place and full of all kinds of colourful strange statues etc. They have also place called Ten Courts of Hell, little dark(ish) tunnel full of really disturbing images(look my pictures)"
,,"Although it looks 'tired', it is one of the must sees",3.0,,"We had not visited the Tiger Balm Gardens for over 20 yrs. It is always VERY hot & we went prepared - although we did notice that there were some trees in the park. Previously there was only concrete.

We were disappointed with how run down the place was. When we were there last time, we had to queue to get in, there were Hawkers & Snake Charmers at the entrance, there were many people inside & the exhibits were all maintained."
,,Unusual weirdness,5.0,,"One of the few remaining pieces of Singapore that retains it's original character and hasn't been ""modernized."" Haw Par Villa is such a weird, interesting theme park. If you're into interesting things that also educates about the cultural superstition, this is one place you cant' miss."
,,"Fascinating, free, excellent photos",5.0,,"Great place to take the family, lots to look at, caves to explore, can be a little morbid at times but a fascinating venture into mythology. Let the kids learn what will happen to them when they don't listen to their parents :) Pond has lots of turtles & fish, great opportunities to take photos. Parking was S$2, bargain considering this was two hours well spent, even the kids loved it."
,,An eccentrics paradise,5.0,,"Arriving at Haw Par Villa we were welcomed by a torrential downpour, we were forced to take shelter in the ten courts of hell! This free attraction directly outside the MRT station is a real gem. Although it appears a little neglected in parts it is visually amazing and the stories that you read about the sculptures are fascinating. We felt this was one of the most fun places we discovered in Singapore. It isn't for everyone and some people would find the more graphic displays in bad taste but for us it was a like jumping down the rabbit hole and ending up in a peculiar yet beautiful imaginary land."
,,Even when it rains,4.0,,"Singaproaians think this attraction is a bit run down but I found the displays througruoghly interesting, visiting the 10 stages of hell and then seeing some of the beautifully maintained buildings. We visitied during one of the downpours and still had fun."
,,not your usual type of attaction,4.0,,"Easily reached by taking the Circle Line and alighting at the Haw Par Villa Station. Once you exit, it will be on your right and you absolutely cannot miss this unique place.

It showcases a lot of ""interesting"" statues all over the place. Some are easily recognizable while others may seem characters jumping out of the Chinese zodiac calendar. Despite visiting this place while it was raining, we still enjoyed our stay.

In case you have some spare time in your itinerary, drop by Haw Par Villa and just be amazed of what this attraction has to offer.

By the way, entrance is free so what is there to lose?"
,,Visit this freaky attraction before they knock it down!!,5.0,,"First time I visited Haw Par Villa was 20 years ago, it used to be one of Singapore's premier attractions. Now its Sad but kinda interesting to see its just been left to fall into disrepair.
Its filled with great concrete statues depicting Chinese mythology and a lot of them are actually pretty scary looking. The ten courts of hell is excellent although the dragon it used to be in is gone. It looks like they government are just itching to build a block of flats or a shopping mall on this prime real estate so visit some of Singapore's history and even try to save this amazing place! Free entry and lots to see or great to sit and relax, even a great place to take and scare the kids but make sure they don't annoy me relaxing lol"
,,Very interesting Chinese-Buddhist Dante Inferno and more,3.0,,"At the haw par villa mrt, everyday up to 7pm you can visit (for free) this peculiar commemoration park characterized by areas: the immortals, vices and virtues, pond of legacy, madam white snake and the formidable ten courts of hell. All are nice to visit, beyond the plastic appearance which always leaves me skeptical in front of these Chinese temples, but the area which surely shocked me more was the ten courts of hell. Impossible not to think of Dante's inferno and to pose questions to yourself about possible contacts, who came first, and feel astonishment on how all the cultures have some common base."
,,"Pleasantly surprised, good for tourists who are open to all things",4.0,,Very easy to get to Haw Par. There is actually a MRT station named after this. It is our second visit to Singapore and we had time to visit this off the beaten path attraction. If you have plenty of time in Singapore and have seen all the other sites that you had wanted to see I would recommend that you consider this themed park. I could not get over how colorful everything is. There is a lot of detail and very graphic. I imagined it to be quite run down since it is not a big tourist attraction but was pleasantly surprised. There is definitely work being done to restore all the colorful figures. It is the most colorful park that I have ever seen. Definitely so glad I added this to our schedule.
,,Better than expected.,3.0,,"Before coming to Haw Par Vila I read a lot of mixed reviews about it being run down, not worth the trip or a memorable experience. Negative and positive reviews.

The place is relatively clean with very beautiful sculptures of Chinese myths and beliefs.

If you are not into all the Chinese myths and beliefs, treat it as art work. It's really truly quite amazing.

It's not a must go place but if you have an hour to spare, make a trip down.

There is a Haw Par Vila MRT just outside or you can park at the car park for $5."
,,"If you have a spare hour, go!",5.0,,"I had a spare hour and got a taxi to haw par villa. It used to be a huge tourist attraction but not so popular these days, it was practically empty when I went. The park is a bit run down but still has a lot of character. It's full of different sculptures showing the ten levels of hell and many others .... It's not for the faint hearted but it's good fun and something totally different ..... Take a camera with you. It's free to get in and a nice stroll."
,,Bizarre and informative,3.0,,"I am not sure what I was expecting, but I did leave this garden satisfied and amused. There are some truely bizarre statues on display and some quite graphic content. If bringing children I would be a bit careful.

However. The garden is aged and some statues and information signs badly need loving attention. I would absolutely say it is worth a visit."
,,Unique place to visit in SG!,4.0,,"I don't underrstand why ain't so many peope come visit this unique place. For me it's really deep of myth, culture, story... and visually attractive.

It's located next to pasir panjang MRT.

There were so many statues here. There's also the story line of ""what happened after we die"". There also weird statues that I just can't easily understand... for some reason this place should offer a guide for the tourist haha.

Unfortunately, some statues ain't maintained well. There were some uncomfy parts in the area.

but still, I recommend this place to be listed in the tour plan! ♡"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"On a recent visit to Singapore with friends I thought it would be a good idea to go here as it depicts Chinese mythology and legends. I was last here over 40 years ago and remember it being interesting. ( even at age 14 )

The MRT station is Haw Par and the Villa is only a few steps away. I would suggest you wear a hat or take a parasol as it is very hot and not a great amount of shade at times. At the time of our visit there was a kiosk for drink but no café open. ( Monday)

The park is full of statues depicting various scenes of life and people. From the TV series Monkey there is Tripitaka, Sandy, Pigsy also there are many figures you can pose with like sumo wrestlers and Tiger Balm Tigers.

Most memorable is "" The Ten Courts of Hell "". This is quite gruesome as it shows what can happen if you are a criminal, cheat at exams, misuse books or disrespect your elders. With the last court you can repent and be reincarnated as an animal or human. It is obviously meant as a warning to behave in your current life!!!!

The park is free which probably explains why it looks a bit run down and I would not have minded paying something towards its upkeep.

This is a place well worth a visit."
,,Myths and Legends abound,3.0,,"Full of statuary depicting ancient Chinese myths and legends. It's obviously seen better days but the tabloids will be loved by younger children. With free admission and only a few steps from the Haw Par MRT station, it's worth a visit to see the brilliant colour of the buildings and statues."
,,Interesting place!,4.0,,"We weren't sure if we had time to visit this place but glad we went. Very interesting, somewhat alternative but it teaches you how Chinese mothers would tell their kids if they didn't behave, what could happen to them. Some of the displays are quite graphic. The place needs a bit of revamping as it looked a little tired. Having said that, it gives you that nostalgic feelings which I loved."
,,A weird and wonderful Singapore institution,4.0,,"If you want to see a very different side of Singapore - far from the sky scrapers of Marina Bay or the shopping malls of Orchard Road, spend a few hours late one afternoon at Haw Par Villa. It's not a villa at all, but an almost 80-year-old 'theme park' set on a hill a few kilometres out of town, containing an extraordinary collection of brightly painted statues and scenes - mostly from Chinese myths and legends - but with some surprises thrown into the mix, such as an Australian wildlife scene, complete with kangaroos, kuala bears and possums! I love this place for its weird and wonderfulness. It's rarely crowded and is great for practising your photography. I first visited it in 1965 when I was very small and newly arrived from the UK. It was called the Tiger Balm Gardens then.... and I found it very scary (don't miss the 10 Courts of Hell - Singapore's equivalent of the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's). Apart from several new licks of paint, it has changed very little in the almost 50 years since then. A national treasure not to be missed!"
,,"Great site to visit, only once though",3.0,,"Its not a bad place and its full of Chinese mythology which I love, but it didn't interest my husband very much. Gives you a good incite to other cultures history and beliefs, however don't think I would return - we were on a bus tour which included the stop so it was soon off to the next stop"
,,"Dated, but interesting",3.0,,"This place is rather dated and in a need for an upgrade. This place tells of Chinese Mythology as well as monuments for the Aw Family. The ten gates of hell is one of the interesting highlights. Not much explanations for certain ""exhibits"" though. It is also very quiet which is very pleasant.

The Haw Par Villa is at Haw Par Villa MRT station, a 1 minute walk. Entrance is FREE which is always great. Takes about 1-1.5 hours to walk around."
,,Quiet and free of charge,4.0,,"Its a weekend afternoon, and you hardly see any visitors to this park, which is once packed with visitors. Since he renovation of the 90's a lot of the old structures are destroyed and many are relocated. New structures included the Chinese dragon housing the boat ride for Ten Courts of Hell. Due to high cost of managing the park and dwindling visitors, the dragon is demolished in the turn of the century, the amphitheatres stopped operations, and the admission fees back to free. There is a Hua Song Museum in Haw Par Villa charging a small fee for admission, but due to poor business, has closed down too. So a visit to Haw Par VIlla these days will be a quiet experience, no crowds, no shows, and no fees. This is truly unique in Asia and for the rest of the world, to see a chinese garden packed with false cement mountains and flowers and historical characters. So for the time being the Singapore Government has decided not to demolish this place, however there are people asking for it to be demolished to make way for housing to please the ever increasing foreign population in tiny Singapore. So visit now, no one can bet it will still be there 20 years later!"
,,a taste of chinese mythology,4.0,,"My 2nd time to visit Haw Par Villa -- 20+ years apart (then called Tiger Balm Gardens)-- this time with my son who's taking Creative Writing. The huge dragon figure that used to greet visitors is no loger in sight. Though much statues had been added, the place did not lose its mysticism and lure. Great site to visit -- easily accessible, free entrance, and educational (especially for literature lovers like us!). Arm yourself with bottles of drinks."
,,"Out of the Way, But Interesting",3.0,,"I thought this was going to be fascinating based on the descriptions, but it is a pretty run down theme park based on Chinese mythology. While interesting, it is a bit out of the way. Fortunately it is easy to reach by subway, since it has its own stop. It was interesting to walk through fast and see the depictions of the macabre folk tales and see the history of the brothers who started Tiger Balm. It might be a little too scary for young children, unless your intent is to frighten them."
,,Nostalgic,4.0,,"I first visited Haw Par Villa in 1966 when I was 5 years old and it was called Tiger Balm Gardens. We were on a family trip from Malacca, Malaysia where we lived in the British Army base. It's a bizarre, gory, surreal place that appeals to 5 year old boys and 52 year old men - or at least it does to this one!

It's a bit rundown, but it's free and great fun. Cold drinks are for sale, but beware that there's little shade and few places to have a sit down."
,,Flash Back for Mum,3.0,,"We went her since my mum wanted to revisit ""Tiger Balm Garden"". Found it quite nice & very peaceful. Considering that its quite old, it needs to re-look at probably re-doing the place. I liked the turtle pond quite a lot. Quite far from where we were staying. Might go back on my next trip keeping the park timings in mind."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Been here twice. I like statues, old places and chinese mythology so for me Haw Par Villa is a very nice place to spend a day in Singapore. It's free, it's not crowded. It is not a very run down place and its so quiet. The weather may be very hot here but there's a lot of bench to rest. Some stalls are closed, despite I saw a food court (?) in it."
,,Groovius maximus,5.0,,"Great collection of gaudy statuary. Some parts even educate you on Chinese mythology. After all the sanitised white-bread attractions elsewhere in Singapore, this was easily the most interesting thing I found. And it's free. They should really clean it up a bit."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"It's showing it's age a bit, but if you know anything about Chinese mythology (e.g. Journey to the West, Sun Wukong ... the 1970's Japanese TV series Monkey!) then it's a pleasant place to walk around - good fun re-enacting the statue poses too.
It's easy to get to (right next to the MRT stop) and free (apart from the 10 Levels of Hell bit)."
,,Chinese folk tales and tiger balm!,4.0,,"Haw Par Villa was possibly one of my favourite days out in Singapore! I went during the week in the afternoon and it was pretty empty, first stop was the 10 levels of hell...talk about graphic! If you have little ones I’d stay away from here but I found it really interesting! After that take a causal stroll around the rest of the park, there are some amazing stories and the models are pretty impressive to. The place does have more than just Chinese folk tales, you’ve also got the memorials of the family that lived there who were the people that bought tiger balm to Singapore (don’t forget to get a pic of the tiger car!), the memorials are pretty impressive and tell you a little about the family.

Yes the place is a fairly run down, but I felt it added to the character of the place, the only let down in my opinion was some of the boards were so faded they could no longer be read. The food area wasn’t open when I went (I have no idea if it ever is), but there are vending machines to get a nice cold drink! There is little shade, and it is a fair bit of walking around, up and down steps (or a slightly inclining hill depending on which way you walk). Saying that the park is not massive, and can easily be done in an hour or two."
,,"A bit run down, but lots of fun",3.0,,"We came here with our youngish kids (7/4/4) and they enjoyed recreating the statue poses! it is quite a big area, and it was really hot with little or no shade or breeze so be warned! overall it is a bit run down, but we went quite late in the day and almost had the place to ourselves.

Enjoyable."
,,Only if you're into Chinese folk tales,3.0,,"If you're really into Chinese legend and folk tales, then you should come. However, don't allocate the entire day for this. The location is pretty much out of the way and there is nothing interesting around the park. Take the Circle Line from Harborfront if you're coming from the city. Think twice about taking your children. Some displays may scare your child.

The authorities should not waste such an important tourist asset. Much work is needed to revitalise this place. It was my third visit and it saddened me more each time."
,,Lots of Potential,3.0,,"We went to Haw Par Villa on 18 July 2013. AKA the Tiger Balm Gardens, this place tells the story of the founders of the famous cure-all Tiger Balm and also is part religious history, Chinese folk lore and mythology. The whole park is free to the public to walk around and see everything. Bathroom facilities are in several places in the park. Lots of walking so come prepared. I recommend some drinking water also as Singapore is very hot and sometimes very humid as well. The 10 Courts of Hell will scare the Hell out of you (no pun intended). It describes in graphic detail the crimes and punishments of anyone who disobeys the words of the court (for Christians, it is reminiscent to the 10 commandments). I brought along my 11 year old daughter and my 9 year old nephew and they were both scared to death. You also get to read the stories of the 2 brothers who invented Tiger Balm and see one of their classic cars with the tiger on the hood. Some really neat looking Chinese sculptures and art work also. You also have a chance to read about one of the famous monks that traveled the world in search of Buddha and the things that he saw in his journey west. This place could be a top draw if they advertised it more than they do and also, the whole parks needs a complete face lift with fresh paint and some work on the grounds. It is very old looking and most of the park is in bad shape. A few cans of paint and some power washing should be bringing bus loads of tourists to this gem of a spot. There are also some vending machines selling cold drinks. We saw some areas where maybe at one time, they sold gifts or goods on-site. A small investment by the Singapore Tourism Board for upkeep and facelift could reap very large rewards. The MRT (subway) stop is Haw Par - Turn right at the outside exit from the train station and you are there."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"A little run down however a great place to visit, about $12 taxi trip from the city. Bring a camera and comfy shoes. Make sure to look for the turtles in the pond"
,,Formally Tiger Balm Gardens,5.0,,I lived in Singapore in the late 60s. I loved this place then and have visited many times. It is incredible the workmanship that has gone into creating this attraction. It depicts ancient Chinese folk and mythology tales. I love just wondering round gazing at all the beautiful statues. It is easier to get to now the MRT runs nearly to the entrance. It is a lovely day out for couples and families. Highly Recommended !
,,A blast from the past,3.0,,Visited here as a child in the 70's and was curious to return with my family. It's hard to describe this place -quirky definately. Statues and tableau tell stories from the Asian culture. The paths of hell not great for young children but my teenager found it entertaining. A free way to spend an hour. I would take your own drinks.
,,BEST PARK EVERRRRR!!!!!,5.0,,"Wasn't sure what to expect but I'm into out of the ordinary experiences so this was right up my ally! It's basically an old park full of colourful statues and scenery depicting myths it's a little run down but I think it adds to the charm, especially in Singapore! Some statues depict gory scenes so if you have kids it's up to you, I would have loved it even as a kid but if your super conservative about gory/scary things maybe give this one a miss. Everyone else though should definitely do it! Did I mention its free?"
,,Nostalgia trip,3.0,,"I have been meaning to visit this place for years, having lived in Singapore as a kid just after the war, and worked there several times this century. I have revisited most of my memories of the 50s and managed to get this one in on a one night stay. It didn't seem to be the place I remembered, though I was only 5 at the time. It's a fascinating place but a few items were closed at 6pm so they may have included the memory I was looking for. I very much enjoyed the stories and the statuary is very mobile and well carried out. It's a memorial to the Tiger Balm family, but needs a bit of a clean up and repair to some of the models.
Entry is free apart from 5SGD for the carpark."
,,Theme park with bizarre concept,4.0,,"It is very hard to imagine that this used to be one of the top tourist attraction of Singapore in the early 80s. I can still remember vividly the crowd jostling into position to take photographs with the statues and figurines. But today it is so deserted the figurines can almost whisper to me. One thing hasn't changed though: children are frightened by what they see at the ""Ten Courts of Hell"".

If you have the time, you should spend about 1 hour here. I have never seen another theme park like this. See my youtube video for an idea of what this place offers. Don't worry, I didn't included photos of ""Ten Courts of Hell"" so you can see it for yourself.

,,Worth a visit for its quirkyness,3.0,,"An eclectic collection of statues depicting the ten stages of hell as well as buddhist mythology. Quite awkward, but strange enough to be entertaining. Easily reached by metro and free to enter, visiting Haw Par Villa is an afternoon well spent."
,,FADED GLORY,1.0,,"it has been allowed to fail, likely to sell the highly valuable land. once a mythical themed garden of statues, it is now old, tired and free. dont waste your time or money on a taxi."
,,Returning after 40 years,4.0,,"I first saw this park 40 years ago and although I have been back to Singapore many times since, I didn't know that this villa was the Tiger Balm Gardens if visited then

It is not advertised in the tourist books but worth a visit. It is gaudy and violent and absolutely fantastic. There is no entrance fee at this time and I spent well over 2 hours looking at all the figures and enjoying reading about old Chinese legends. It is easy to get to and not crowded at all."
,,"Wacky, weird, wonderful",5.0,,This is the weirdest park I've ever been to - and I loved it. The statues depicting all sorts of interesting myths and legends really are worth visiting. The 12 courts of hell was particularly fun - in a macabre sort of way. Worth a look - and it's right next to a train station.
,,"1000+ Statues to see, beautiful work",4.0,,"Great work and very old time created statues are there, I am wondering why there is no entrance fee, it deserves care and maintenance so there should be entrance fee.

Plus points
1) But from tourists point of view its good thing that there is no fees for this attraction.
2) Attached to the MRT
2) use to open every day and timing are 9am to 7pm (please note hell garden gets closed at 6pm)

Negative points
1) No food court but chips vending machines are there
2) It seem earlier food court was there but now a days its not working.

Imp Points
1) Very nice place to have good time whether you are going with friends, girl friend or kids.
2) It takes 2-3 hours time to cover all statues in detail (with photo takings and all)"
,,Old time's sake!,4.0,,"I remember my parents taking me here about 50 years ago and I was keen to see if it was how I remembered. It was! I can see its not to everyone's taste but its worth a visit if you have the time. The history is interesting, about how it was built by the Tiger Balm' brothers - no entrance fee is charged and the gardens are lovely anyway regardless of the quirkiness of the statuary. I think you've got to see it in the on text of the times of when it was built- there was no Disney type stuff and few other attractions existed then - yes on a superficial level you could call it tacky but this is part of Singapore's history and worth a look."
,,oldies but it's nice place to know and come,4.0,,"this outdoor place is very famous last time, but it seems lose their popularity with other new attraction in Singapore. the impression of this place when you firstly came in is, this place is not maintain with good threat. it's too bad of that.

because i like about something with accent chinnese, i would say that i love this place. since we can found many diorama about chineese folklore, and also many statue of chineese folklore figure. and i've plan to bring my daughter to there to know about chineese folklore story.

the most important thing is i like the environment at there, the chinesse accent of the building, the garden, the statue.

even it outdoor, you didn't feel hot because of the sun, since there are many trees at there, so you can feel very comfort when you walking around.

hope this place can improve their facility more, so it can attract tourist to came in."
,,One of the most unique and eccentric places ever,4.0,,"Title is exactly what this place is! A very unique and eccentric museum which shows the historical and cultural beliefs of Chinese folklore and history. A friend recommended the place after seeing it over 20 years (as a kid) which shows the impact it has!
The place is in need of major maintenance, but this does not take from the place and the detail that has gone into the way they have told these stories
Word of warning, the Ten Courts of Hell is very graphic, but a must visit!"
,,Where is the fun?,1.0,,"Just not my cup of tea, others might like it. Also, it is not well maintained, hardly any people there during the week."
,,One of Singapore's More Eccentric Attractions,4.0,,"I have traveled extensively in Southeast Asia and beyond but have never seen anything like Haw Par Villa. Parts of it are a morality play from a Chinese perspective. There are some graphic scenes, however, that would not be to everyone's taste. Other parts are garden-like settings rather attractively laid out, while a few of the statues are a bit kitschy. There are signs explaining much of what you are seeing, but not everything. Admission was free in February 2013, when I was there, and it was virtually deserted--an attractive combination. There is a subway stop of the same name just steps from the entrance to Haw Par Villa, so it could hardly be more convenient to get to."
,,Haw Par Villa,5.0,,"An amazing work of Chinese art in Singapore. Well preserved and maintained its a wonderful place to visit, walk around and read the details associated with the statues. The Ten Courts of Hell is a must visit."
,,Weird but interesting insight,3.0,,"My mum remembered Haw Par Villa from her childhood as an expat living in Singapore. Think I know understand where her special brand of crazy weirdness comes from. Having said that, it was a very interesting view into Chinese mythology. A bit battered but is in great shape seeing as it is free. A lot of locals seemed to be visiting with picnics. Would recommend coming if you want to see another side to the city. Bring sun screen though so it is very exposed."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"The guide books will have you beleive this place is in a state of decay, well they are wrong, yes it has seen better days, but resoration appears to be underway and all I can say is that Haw Par Villa is well, interesting!
The MRT now stops directly outside the Villa so it is easy to find, the figures are at times disturbing but should be viewed in the context of Chinese methology, you will get some great photographs of something totally at odds with Singapore's modern and vibrant reputation."
,,Nice figurines there......long time ago....,5.0,,the special part of the way you get treated after death and what the punishments are...huh...killing maan
,,"Quirky, tatty, intriguing, and right by MRT",4.0,,"I rate this very good only because it is such a unique attraction that speaks volumes for the family that built it. It should rank a poor for the lack of maintenance, areas closed off, and general tackiness but I dont have the heart to punish the orignators. I only to question why, with the wealth generated by the Tiger Balm business and the wealth in the Government coffers why this attraction is not maintained in top condition.

No, this is not like the glitsy Univesal Studios that one can see from the hill atop the Haw Par estate, nor is it swanky Sentosa, but this is Singapore and a heavy dose of Chinese culture. The tour of the Hell's Dungeon is enough to put you off your lunch if you don't smile at the way animation was done fifty years ago.

This place is right next to a MRT station named after it and therefore it is a very easy location to travel to and find.

Go to the top of the hill and stand in the what is left of Haw Par Villa and imaging how it looked and sounded all those years ago

Worth a trip .... allow two hours and bring shade and sunscreen!"
,,Easy day out - Easy Facts and,3.0,,"Is a little worn however as an easy day out in Singapore and in particular if you have little kids (however the Ten Courts of Hell might freak some of them out a little) is worth the trip. Lots of infromation to read about and displays to view which is not too taxing on the brain and body.

Is very easy access from the MRT station as well (on Circle Line - Haw Par Villa),

I remember coming here as a kid myself and the colourful displays still stick in my memory."
,,Chinese Mythology place,3.0,,"Interesting place to visit to see old works of chinese artists & learn about chinese mythology. Good place to take photos & should not be missed especially if you are tourist. Be prepared to not have any food / drinks available there, which is quite difficult if you have young children or elderly."
,,Interesting insights,3.0,,"I visited this many years ago and then again recently. My husband and I nicknamed it 'land of the super-tacky'. It is a little run down, and has random statues around of things like emus and kangaroos. But it also has a lot of information on Chinese mythology and I found it interesting, despite some of the tackiness. I hope they continue to restore it, as now has its own MRT station and couple be a more significant attraction."
,,"Part Alice in Wonderland, part something else",3.0,,"An interesting place to visit if you like to see displays illustrating myth and legend. Yes, as many have mentioned, it is a little run-down, but it is in the process of being restored - how they can possibly stay abreast it all, I don't know as the place is absolutely huge with LOTS of detail. Worth a visit, but some of the displays are rather graphic (although kids nowadays are swamped with violence on tv and games, so this should be child-play, no pun intended). Just outside the Haw Par Villa MRT station."
,,Fascinating trip Through the looking glass!,4.0,,"Being at the Haw Par Villa is like being Alice in wonderland through the looking glass! For as long as I can remember I have always found articles on singapore's haw par villa to be immensely fascinating. Owned by the famous tiger balm brothers (we all life tiger balm in south east Asia), this park is a tribute to Taoist and Confucian mythology and stories..

The ten courts of hell are the focal attractions, located in a dark cave with plenty of carefully carved and painted figurines depicting punishments in the after life. Then the rest of the grounds are filled with stone exhibits and figurines painted in bright colourful paint and depicted with wonderful imagination.. All tribute to Chinese folklore from china!

The grounds of the villa are vast so be prepared to do a fair bit of walking and the ambience there is so peaceful and calm.. This place has been cited as one of the most bizarre theme parks of the world, but we really enjoyed our trip here.. Transport is easy as the MRT stops directly at the Haw Par villa. It's quite old and some exhibits look tired but we preferred our time here over universal studios.

Our only hope is that the grounds will be maintained properly and remain open as it is a beautiful legacy for the future generations."
,,Pretty good!,5.0,,"I found that even though it seemed pretty run down, i really enjoyed it! The displays were interesting, and it was a nice walk; definitely a nice change to the city. Another reason i really enjoyed it is because it kind of reminded me of Miyazaki's movie ""Spirited Away"". Overall, i thought the trip was worth it."
,,Eyes opener,4.0,,"Free entrance, located nearby MRT station (circle line- Haw Par Villa station). Lots of statue regarding chinese legends."
,,Holiday Family Outing,3.0,,"Been decade since I visited Haw Par Villa and it still fascinate me though the present condition is pretty run down unlike the 70' days where they have admission fee and many kiosk and refreshment,bites then but not anymore.

Mainly about Chinese mythology and MUST see is the ""10 Gates Of Hell"" whereby in short ""what we do in this life is what we heap in the next""........

Not much crowd during the recent holiday and but this place still bring back fond memory of my childhood even now it had been surround by new buildings.

Public transport & train(MRT) is just a stone throw away from the Main Entrance.Bring more loose change as there drinks machine at the side for the weather is usually humid and warm.

Hope they can revive this iconic site and bring back tourists most visited site in Singapore........again and let know history of Chinese mythology live on for more generations to come"
,,Amazed,5.0,,"This place is fascinating right from the front gates. You have to think about in the context that it exists in now in the 21st century, and not expect it to be a fully-functioning modern amusement park. While it is run-down now it's obvious that there was a lot of love and effort poured into Haw Par Villa during its prime. I absolutely loved the place. It was amazing to think that while for us it was run-down, free and had only one other couple visiting, not that long ago it was full of people every day."
,,Strange but fascinating,3.0,,"the history and idea behind Haw Par Villa was fascinating, but unfortunatly it was very run down, it is hard to see how they can maintain the grounds and displays as there is no entrance fee which is a shame, as there was a certain fascination with the place."
,,Great park to spend a few hours,4.0,,"Spent about 2 hours walking through Haw Par Villa. I loved the opportunity to read the displays and learn a little about Chinese mythology. There is an MRT (subway) station at the entrance, the park is free, and there weren't many visitors to the location on a warm and humid Sunday."
,,going down to memory lane,3.0,,"I was visiting this site for the memory of our late father who just passed away 3 months ago. This place was very popular in the 70s. And my first trip to singapore with my father and mom was visiting this place. Its stay the same as I remembered it. It was a nice memory for my mom. I wish they could do something to it though, make it more entertaining. As I actually enjoy the mythology story they are trying to portray"
,,Kitsch exuberance,5.0,,"Set in a beautiful park, this place is overflowing with concrete painted statues of zoo animals, Buddhist stories and other oddities such as the Statue of Liberty. Fantastic!"
,,A treasure that will be missed when it's gone..,5.0,,"Most the other reviews cover it adequately - an absolutely fascinating place that's frozen in time. Run down, neglected and fading it is nevertheless enthralling and one yearns to have seen it in its heyday before today's high tech visitor centres. It's set back off the road and you don't realise until you get in just how big it is. There are acres of grounds all filled to the brim with fantastical scenes from Chinese myths and literature.

I visited on a rainy day and our group were the only people in the place. It was eerily quiet and it's sad to think that it will no doubt sometime soon close and be knocked down to make way for apartment buildings just like all the rest around it.

My advice is to visit while you've got the chance. If you've got kids they'll either love it (coz they sure won't have seen anything like it before) or hate it (because it's a million years away from the nano-second pleasures they expect nowadays). But either way you'll be glad you saw this piece of history before it vanishes for ever."
,,What they say is true,4.0,,"The description of this place it says ""It's like no other villa in the world"" and that is so so true. It's hard to put into words as you look from display to display reminded of those plaster figure heads you saw at seaside fairs in the 70s. It is so weird it actually becomes good and some of the descriptions in the 10 courts of hell left you stunned in a weird sort of way. For example the crimes of Ungratefulness, disrespect to elders & escaping from prison all carried the same penalty of having Heart cut out which seems a little harsh. On the plus side however, the next time I want a seat on the bus I will have a little secret smile if the 'youngsters' don't leap to their feet in a respectful sort of way as I know what is coming to them. I think this place will forever stand as a monument why hallucinogenic substances and architectural design should never be mixed!"
,,Gift to City,4.0,,It was interesting for what a couple of businessmen had done to give back to the city. The Ten Courts of Hell were unusual.
,,Very bizarre - but I kind of liked it,4.0,,"Take the kids through the 10 Courts of Hell cave so they know what awaits them in the afterlife if they are naughty!

You learn a lot about Chinese culture and values from this weird place. It's completely rundown and has a fascinating history - infamous Tiger Balm, WWII, grand houses, mystery and intrigue. I couldn't tear myself away from all the strange characters and fables.

Definitely off the tourist route, but that's why we loved it. It had a bit of a spooky vibe, especially since virtually no one was there apart from us and the caretaker.

Friends tell me that Singaporeans used to meet their boyfriends and girlfriends there in the 50's - 80's, safe from the prying eyes of parents. I wouldn't want to snog in this place. I've seen what happens to lustful people in the 10 Courts of Hell. Not a good outcome!"
,,Not just an ordinary Villa,4.0,,"It gives very unique experience to a tourist. Lots of works and efforts were made to produce so many different characters in the Villa.The experience to Hell was impressive,not possible to erase from our mind after the visit."
,,A walk down memory lane,4.0,,"Those born in the sixties most likely will remember this place, glad that it's still around today. Visited it recently with some relatives from Malaysia and they liked it, though some of the exhibits are in need of repair. Some directional and exhibit signage are no longer legible but overall the park is still very much 'alive', having stood the test of time. Don't know the future plan for this park or when I'll visit this place again but it sure does revived some good old memories. (There is a $5 per entry parking fee if you park near the entrance or inside the park)."
,,A place to learn more about chinese folklore.,2.0,,This place was built many years ago. You will get to learn more about chinese folklore in this place. The good thing about this place is that it is free of charge.
,,Past its prime perhaps but worth a visit,4.0,,"The park, originally called ""Tiger Balm Gardens"", was built in 1937 by brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, the developers of Tiger Balm (Safe, Fast and Effective. Pain relief without the Pills), as a venue for teaching traditional Chinese values. The park contains over 1,000 statues and 150 giant dioramas depicting scenes from Chinese folklore, legends, history and illustrations of various aspects of Confucianism. It is a somewhat sad place to visit because it obviously has seen better days. The dioramas are well cared for and tell an interesting history. There are quite a few unusual items that seem a little out of place such as kangaroos and koala bears. The most well-known attraction is the Ten Courts of Hell, with gruesome depictions of hell in Chinese mythology, all set in a 60 meter-long trail of a Dragon. That was weird indeed. Easy to get to now the new Circle Line is in operation."
,,Where is the balm?,2.0,,"This place, years ago, was THE place to visit in Singapore. Now, it languishes in neglect overshadowed by technological wonders . It is a pity, as it could be re-vitalised using the very advances that have overshadowed it, to provide a fascinating insight into Chinese beliefs, myths and cultural practices. Nonetheless, it is an interesting place to wander through and wonder!"
,,Interesting but not a must,3.0,,Certainly not a theme park but worth a visit iif you are interested in chinese legends and folkores.
,,This Place Brings Back Childhood Memories,4.0,,"We were laughed at by local friends when we told them we visited this place. They were under the impression that it is run down and not worth visiting. It is unfortunate that local Singaporeans do not make good use of this place.

We had a Fu Pao Villa in Hong Kong (in the 1950s and 1960s) owned by the same family which is known for Tiger Balm ointment. It was a fun place for families to go and take pictures. Kind of a Disney World of the time with Chinese folk lore and superstitions encapsulated in sculptures, and scenes which are extremely colorful (gaudy is a better word). But such superstitions about torture after death were the stuff that scared children into good behaviour. It was part of the Chinese culture.

This place in Singapore is well maintained and there are trees to give shade from the scorching sun. You can buy cold drinks from a machine next to the old car adorned with a Tiger head.

We enjoyed the visit, and the place was quiet and peaceful."
,,Learnt a lot history here,3.0,,"A place where you get to learn a lot of chinese cultural stuff. A little too hot to handle on a sunny day but overall, it was a good experience. Please bring your own drinks."
,,Abandoned by most but not forgotten by me!,4.0,,"It tells us about our culture and beliefs. It'sold-fashioned authenticity from the past. I enjoy bringing my foreign guests here, telling them anecdotes linked to my childhood and the statues and artifacts on site."
,,Such a bizarre place,4.0,,"I visited this place when it was called the Tiger Balm Gardens in the mid sixties. I have vivid memories of my visit when I was about 5 or 6 years old so I have always wanted to re-visit as an adult.

Sadly the place is in a bit of disarray and seems neglected. I enjoyed being there as it brought back so many memories, but to my wife visiting for the first time, her opinion is that it is so odd and bizarre. Great for some photos of very strange characters and some that most of us have heard of such as Confucious, Monkey and Trippitaka etc. Won't be going back again though. Someone told me that it will be bulldozed shortly a no-one seems to visit anymore, they don't even charge an entrance fee anymore."
,,Chinese Mythology & Folklore,3.0,,"I think some of the most recent reviews are fairly relevant. In my opinion, this village is more suitable for children, or for those somewhat interested in Chinese fables. The good news is that the village is adjacent to the MTR, and there is no cost for admission. Additionally, due to the lack of crowds, it is quiet. Very quiet, like you have entered into the park unofficially type of quiet....each of the fables are written in English also, and my Chinese expert has indicated the authenticity!!!!

There are vending machines with snacks and cold beverages....."
,,Off the beaten track in Singapore,4.0,,"After you have seen (or, like us after living here for 3 years, if you're a bit tired of) the Zoo, Gardens by the Bay, Bird park, Science Center and so on, Haw Par Villa is definitely place worth visiting. It consists of many, many statues depicting Chinese mythological stories, so anyone interested in Chinese culture should come here.

For kids this is a fun place as well, my kids loved to run around in this maze of statues, look at all these Chinese ""fairytales"", hear the story, compare to Western fairytales etc, even though some of the statues are actually quite scary/gory.

The parc is old and somewhat run down. Dont expect fancy rides, restaurants, shops, this is just about the statues and the stories. And about Singapore history.

The parc is free and generally very quiet. Truly off the beaten track, most expats and tourists we know have never been here.

Bring umbrella, food, drinks (though there is a snacks and drinks vending machine) and insect repellant."
,,Cultural Tour,4.0,,"Very cultural tour, many statues and it has all their stories. Especially good is the 18th level of Hell walk. It's creepy and it really scare the children off. It provide a good lesson to teach children not to do bad things."
,,Nice to see it being looked after so well,5.0,,"I last visited 18 years ago, there was an admission charge, there was hardly anybody there, and it was all rather depressing.
Great changes this time. Entry is free, it was still quiet, but rather busier, and signs of repainting going on everywhere.
If you've only got a couple of days in Singapore, I'd give it a miss, but if you have the time, it's well worth seeing. Splendid painted sculptures depict Chinese legends. It does help visitors remember the stories, and get a better understanding of the Chinese view on life. It's colourful, fun, and shows what Singapore was capable of achieving back in the 1930s.
You won't have time or energy to see it all in 1 visit, but don't miss the Halls of Hell, they're great (some scenes may upset children though).
Note when we visited mid-week the cafe wasn't open, there were drink vending machines, but that's it. When we finished, we took the MRT to Sentosa, and ate there (that was a nice relaxing change after the park). There may be a food court across the road from the park, but we didn't cross to check it out."
,,Fascinating and enchanting,5.0,,"We were told about this attraction by our hotel and after spending 8 days in Singapore we found this to be the 'hidden gem' of our trip!

Yes it's unusual - like Disneyland with tumbleweeds! There is a truly peaceful feel there as you wander through display after display of Chinese mythology figures. The ponds are full of small turtles that have been breeding rapidly for years and are layered on top of each other 3 and 4 high.

The dedicated groundsman are raking up the large brown leaves with cane rakes and lighting incense sticks at every God/Goddess display - they all had a smile and were welcoming.

As you walk through vibrant colored displays with amazing statues you also feel the presence of the love of a family who created a dynasty - Tiger Balm. The story of the grand house that once stood there is quite moving - it was torn down after the death of one of the brothers and ravaged by the war.

The ten stages of hell may be a bit much for young children or the squeamish but it is only one small portion of the park.

Free entry and a small trip on the MRT (turn right as you come out of the station and its in front of you) makes this a great way to spend a couple of hours.

Well worth a look!"
,,It's a great must-go-place during our parents' era! Now too!,3.0,,"Have been knowing about this famous since I was small. During old time, whoever who visits Singapore must visit Haw Par Villa as well! Anyway, there is now a MRT station call Haw Par Villa(circle line). You may reach directly at the door step of it. Everyone can enter for free. Feel free to go there to snap as much as photos you wish for. Of course going there to reminisce how Boon Haw and Boon Par brothers built their business and of course the villa. Worth a visit!"
,,Haw Par Villa,3.0,,Its not on the radar of Tourist. Quite left out. Maybe something should be done to give it a boost. Hardly I see anyone visiting this place.
,,Very Strange- If you have spare time it is free.,3.0,,"I am not sure what to make of this, I have been here years ago when I young and remember liking it. But it is very strange and I am not sure what to say really other than it is free and bizarre. Its also easy to get to on the MRT and is just a short walk from the MRT station (Haw Par Villa) The 'horror chambers' or Ten Courts of Hell would be OK for older kids but a bit gruesome for some. I have posted some photo's so you can see for yourself. There are many scenes/statues from Chinese mythology. The food area did not seem to be open when we were there and although there were vending machines for drinks it may be better to take your own on a hot day."
,,Sad to see a iconic attraction go to waste,3.0,,"Was going back to Haw Par Villa after almost 20years. Was quite sad to see that it has been badly neglected. But at the same time, glad that effort being made to bring the attraction up to date. STB needs to do more to create positive awareness for this prized location."
,,Interesting,4.0,,An old forgotten place by most people but it is an excellent off beat place to visit. Interesting chinese folklore based sculpture.
,,Weird and Wonderful,4.0,,"Before visiting Singapore we looked through a lot of travel guides and websites, none of which suggested Haw Par Villa - this surprised me, as it was one of the funniest parts of our trip to Singapore.
Everything is quite bizarre and completely out of character for modern day Singapore, as well as being very quiet. As with every part of the city, Haw Par Villa is kept impeccably tidy, anywhere else in the world and it would have been vandalised and slipped into disrepair years ago.
Although it is now essentially just a well maintained park (which is free to enter), it was once a theme park (the rides have since been removed). Part of the park takes you through the 10 Courts of Hell, where you can see many rather gruesome murder and torture scenes. Because of these and other strange statues and sights, I wouldn't recommend this for young children but for any other visitors it is definitely a weird and wonderful experience!"
,,"So random, so unexpected, so cool!",5.0,,"Withouth any prior knowledge of Haw Par Villa, my girlfriend and I stumbled in. We were very surprised. Really cool place."
,,if you wanna experience hell,2.0,,the place is really run down and i guess maintenance ended many years back. It shows gross exhibites of hell which is not really suited for children.
,,"Interesting, worth a visit",4.0,,"We visited Haw Par Villa on a round island tour, unfortunately due to time constraints we didn't see the whole place but enjoyed what we saw and look forward to going back and spending more time exploring. It's an interesting concept; some amazing dioramas that are very colourful if not a little gaudy! Just a hint if travelling with young children we would recommend you bypass the 10 courts of hell, it is quite graphic and depicts violent 'punishments' for various crimes."
,,A unique tourist attraction - if a little dated,3.0,,"I first visited Tiger Balm Gardens/Haw Par Villa in the mid 1960s when a small boy and was fascinated by it all - particularly the 10 Courts of Hell. Having visited recently it was great to see it was still in in good condition; although very very quiet. In the '60s it was one of only a few attractions on Singapore and was consequently extremely busy. Nowadays though, with all the development and technological changes that distract people from such rudimentary venues, it sadly seems Haw Par Villa may have seen its better days. There is a reasonably decent cafe on the site where you can also purchase fish food to feed the carp and there is a small charge to see the macabre Courts of Hell. We took our young sons and hope that in a few decades time they might still want, and be able to return with their children."
,,Like the theme park in 'Spirited Away'!,5.0,,We brought our two young children to this on our latest visit and we had an excellent day. It is s bit creepy and beaten up but not in a scary or intimidating way. The statues and the turtle pond amused the children and the staff were uniformly charming and helpful. We took the bus and enjoyed our trip through Singapore then got a taxi back to our hotel. I like Singapore very much and this is one of my favourite things to see when I'm there.
,,The best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Do not leave Singapore without visiting this place! It's wierd, wacky and a bit macabre. A hundred miles from your air-conditioned expensive shopping malls that the guides tell you to visit. I visited five years ago and once again in July and nothing had changed. It is free to get in and there is hardly anyone else walking around. It is full of odd, funny, grotesque statues and grottos of scenes from Chinese mythology and must have taken a lot of time and money to make. It is a work of art. The Ten Courts of Hell are quite gruesome and not for kids or the squeamish but more like a scene out of a Hammer horror film. You can come out at the end having taken hundreds of pictures - thank goodness for digital photography. It's a little way out of town but the MRT station is right outside the entrance so easy to find. Take something to eat and drink as the cafe was shut and there is nowhere else nearby. A must see."
,,Unexpectedly Creepy,2.0,,"Well, first I must say that, from an American perspective, you have to go into this exhibit with an open mind. Not being well-versed in Chinese religion or lore puts us at a great disadvantage. It was an odd, creepy display of folklore, and Chinese mythology. I am told by my local Asian friends that these are the tales they are told growing up to coax them into behaving... Um, wow!

Beware if you are bring small children, you should be prepared to answer some awkward questions, and explain the gore they will see. Also, the park is a state of disrepair. It looks as if it was abandoned, and they are just going through the motions until it is torn down. The fountains don't have water in them, and the museum is closed and roped off.

Admission is free, but it still isn't worth going, unless you are just in the mood for a truly ODD experience. Atleast it would give you something talk about at dinner parties..."
,,"Interesting, but needs maintenance",2.0,,"This was an interesting look into the old Chinese gods and their stories. The whole place could use some spiffing up and a coat of paint. Was worth 30 min. just to see what it is, but not a major tourist attraction."
,,Incredible but gruesome folk art experience,5.0,,"So many people warned me off Haw Par Villa saying it was creepy and gave them nightmares. I will not deny that it is creepy - but the best kind of creepy!

This is an incredible and gruesome park of folk art wonder. I could not get enough of the creativity, the overt gore, the colours and the cool narratives.

Of course the Ten Courts of Hell are shocking and I would not take small children to that section. Bloody cruelty is everywhere. But I really liked seeing the Journey to the West (aka MONKEY MAGIC) ... where people will recognize Monkey, Sandy, Pigsy and co.

I liked this place a lot. And would recommend it to anyone with an interest in alternative art, folk art, heavy metal, tattoos or Confucianism."
,,Not abandoned at all!,5.0,,"Took us about three hours to see and understand everything (well, almost everything) at this unique place which gives you such an insight to the Chinese culture and religion in such an easy way. We went there on Singa national day (August 9) and it was not abandoned at all. There were families visiting, having picnics, local visitors of all religions and all ages plus a few Europeans (like ourselves).

The exhibit is very interesting - unfortunately we couldn't find anywhere the name of the artist(s) who created those 1,000 statues, the dioramas, ponds and ""gardens"". We were overwhelmed by them and we were very happy to learn about the wonderful world of Chinese mythology. We were only familiar with the ""Journey to the West"" story and left the villa with a lot of references, determined to learn more (actually, a little specialized bookshop at the premises would have been a great addition I think).

Overall, a great morning stroll from Monkey king to Chinese Hell which made us appreciate Chinese mythology and popular art. If you can prepare your visit by reading a little about Journey to the West, Madam White Snake, the Sagas, the nine dragons and the mythical birds, it will be much more fun, I suppose (we, for once, will definitely visit again after doing our homework...)"
,,Interesting,4.0,,It is colourful and interesting. It gives us an insight into some aspects of the Chinese culture. I found the depiction of hell graphic.
,,Interesting Experience,5.0,,"Haw Par Villa is an interesting experience, as an Australian it is interesting to visit the place where Australian soldiers went for off duty relaxation before the fall of Singapore and took rolls of interesting photos. Definitely a unique experience."
,,Abandoned theme park with lots of sculptures.,3.0,,"This free outdoor park is full of sculptures that depict traditional chinese tales such as Journey to the West. There is not much shelter and no food vendor except for few drinks vending machines. This park is rather small and you should be able to complete within 2 hours. The Haw Par Villa Station CC25 is just beside the park and you can reach Harbourfront Station within minutes for meal.

The 10 Courts of Hell is definitely not for children as it shows how the sinned people are punished after they are dead and proceed to Hell. Very gory exhibits, not for the faint-hearted."
,,Very interesting!,4.0,,"Old abondened theme park about chinese legends and mythes. Especially interesting are the ""10 gates of hell"" about the consequences of your sins. Most of the children from Singapore went here as an educational experience, and had nightmares for weeks after.

Bring your own drinks and food because there aren's any shops or stalls."
,,"Art it Ain't, But Kitsch on a Grand Scale, Yeah",4.0,,"Never seen anything remotely like it. If you're looking for quality sculpture, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for an extravaganza of kitsch and a sort of introduction to Chinese mythology, this is the place for you. The 10 Courts of Hell, with some stunningly gory and graphic dioramas is proably the most eye-catching exhibit, but there's much, much more. They've even got the Statue of Liberty, standing guard over a turtle pond that also features a pagoda-style gazebo and a big Buddha statue. I, personally, especially loved the Tigermobile. Aw Boon Haw, the marketing genius behind Tiger Balm, used to drive around 1930s Singapore in a car painted in orange and black tiger stripes and with the front grill replaced by a big tiger head."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"It was a nice way to spend a relaxing day. I'd suggest going on an overcast day, as it's hot being out in the sun and it's mostly out doors. It's old, but the history is interesting."
,,Ancient chinese History Garden,5.0,,The mystery of Ancient Chinese believes that still lives today in many chinese hearts. One of a kind. You need to be there for the visual experience.
,,Quirky and fun!,4.0,,"This attraction was set up by the brothers who founded Tiger Balm. It's a free and very quirky landscape of different brightly painted statues depicting different chinese legends. Some are very strange and some are quite disturbing.

If you're a tourist with a few days to spend, unless you have a love of kitch, go elsewhere.

If you're looking for somewhere different to go and see, it is quite fun to stroll around.

One other tip - bring your own food and drinks as the hawker stalls were closed (and appeared abandoned) when we visited."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"That was my 3 time in Singapore and I wanted to see something new and without crowds of tourists. Har Par Villa impressed me very much, dioramas are so visual. But not for small kids I think. Also HPV was very cognitive for me as I don't know a lot about Chinese legends. It is free and don't take much time to see it. Though it is not in the city center but near MTR about 3 min. I recommend HPV."
,,Alternative free sight,3.0,,"I will pass by this place every week as I currently reside next to this attraction (not sure whether you can call it an attraction).

This is a rather strange place to visit. It has been around for a long time and is open to the public, free of charge. Despite it being free, it was not that popular previously, when the subway was not ready. Now, with the new subway station just next to the sight, I start to see more people visiting the sight. If there is really nothing else you wanna do/visit, you can take the train down to Haw Par Villa station, on the Circle line and pop in for a quick visit.

Culturally, this place is interesting as it showcases certain aspects of Taoism that Western civilizations may not be aware of. Some may find these exhibits disturbing (my wife especially!). May not be suitable for young children.

The sight is built on a slope, so elderly or disabled may require a moderate amount of assistance.

This place is infested with mosquitoes, so please apply adequate repellent. There is this strange eerie aura about this place that makes you feel that it is shared by other beings, apart from the mozzies.

While you are there, you can take a short walk along the road, west-ward, for about 300-400 meters. There, at a traffic junction, we will also get to see a strange old military bunker, that looks really out-of-place. This is a war-relic of sorts. Or you can head east-ward to Kent Ridge Park, where there is a look-out station for a nice photo. The Kent Ridge Park is also connected to Reflections at Bukit Chandu (at the end of Pepys Road), via a tree-top walk. Again, lots of insect repellent and sun-screen if you are doing this."
,,Like nothing else I have seen in Singapore,4.0,,"This is a garden with numerous dioramas of Chinese legends. The atmosphere is odd and a little tacky. As others have written, it feels like a deserted theme park. The most interesting exhibit for me was the Ten Courts of Hell, but I think it would be too gruesome for most young children. This is a free attraction that is not crowded and easily accessible by MRT, although it can take a long time to get out there depending on where you are starting from. I recommend visiting if you have already seen many of the more popular attractions in Singapore. I visited on my 9th or 10th trip to Singapore and I'm glad I did."
,,Unique experience,4.0,,"This is a park with a lot of painted figurines that's supposedly trying to convey certain theme / value e.g. filial piety, good beget good and evil beget evil etc.

Some might walk away scoffing it as an over-rated place, but is a unique experience that you might not see anywhere else. The MRT line has been extended to Haw Par Villa via the Circle Line, so is pretty convenient to get there and entrance is free.

PLUS
- Some interesting and cheesy figurines depicting Hades, deities & demons among others.
- A unique and endearing experience esp for S'poreans
- accessible via Circle Line MRT

MINUS
- Not well maintained. Esp the water features
- No other interesting sights nearby"

,,with historical value,3.0,,pity the place being left in near ruins. could have been a better place for an educative tour with the kids if someone could restore it to its former glory.
,,A hidden gem,4.0,,"Not known to many, including myself as a traveller, I found out about this after being told by a local. A scary yet fascinating theme park with dioramas based on the Chinese myth, legends and teachings. Worth a visit."
,,haw par,1.0,,Not Maintained at all.. just a place with lots of statues nothing more.. back in the day it might have been great.. but.. its just boring.
,,Not worth the visit,2.0,,Location is not convenient and premise is poorly maintained
,,The Place is run down!,2.0,,It used to be the place we go to in the past. it was neglected by the Government for years and the whole place is pretty run down. Not recommended.
,,Most Singaporeans think it's closed!,5.0,,"This place suffers from a serious lack of publicity! Most Singaporeans I know either think it's long closed or it's not worth bothering with. It's totally free now (even the 10 courts of hell) like previous reviews said take some shade, there's a lot of uphill climbing, it gets HOT and don't forget your camera!"
,,A great place to spend 2 hours,5.0,,"Unique place of interest featuring the best of chinese folklore (Example: 10 Courts of Hell). A walk through there will remind you the punishment that one is supposed to be getting for the various sins that you commit throughout your lifetime. Good for scaring your children to behave (If you can keep their eyes open, that is!)

It's amazing that entry to this place has been kept free of charge throughout the decades and I would urge some donations be made by visitors at the various donation boxes throughout the place. This is a place you really want to keep alive for the next generation to visit.

Only one thing to note.... as this is an outdoor area, bring shades, umbrellas etc..."
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,Admission is free and it is just next to the Haw Par Villa. What are you waiting for - visit the place now be awed by the statues which tell many stories..
,,Chinese Style Theme Park,4.0,,"Calling it a theme park may be a bit exaggerating, but it was really fun to watch all those ancient Chinese myths/stories sculptures. The 10 courts of Hell were both scary and hilarious at the same time. I visited the Hong Kong Haw Par Villa long long time ago as a kid and now that the Hong Kong one is demolished/partly shut down, it is great to see the one in Singapore being preserved so well. Beside, it's FREE of Charge!"
,,Great heritage,4.0,,"I was here when in 1993' couldnt remember what it was like back then. But now its free for the entrance fee. And not so crowded like the universal studio, no food seller, i think because lack of customer.

In front lies mrt station, which was very great if you had never been to this park. You should try. Especially if you like chinese folklore."
,,Not as good as it was,3.0,,"I first visited Tiger balm gardens in 1967-1969.
It was clean & well looked after. Now it is looking very shabby, witj lumps of conrete falling off.
The entrance has faired better,& is just as I remembered it - bright & maintained properly. However further in you can see the decay, but they do seem to be coming to grips with it.
When we went there were only about 15/20 others present, & the cafe was shut.
Obviously Catch22....No customers: No cafe / No cafe : No customers
The pay-point for the courts of hell was also closed,so everyone just wandered in.
It was hosed outdoors in 67/69 but is now under a ""mound"" to protect it no doubt. Not really for the sqeamish, but worth a visit.
The swimming pool scene complete with drowning sailors etc. also seems to have disappeared over the years.
The large chinese masks have made an excellent addition to the top area.
All in all well worth a visit,if you have not seen it before, but personally I was a wee bit disappointed as my digital photos are not as good as the original 35mm slides.
Big plus point....it is FREE"
,,Very nice place,4.0,,The tiger balm garden was really very nice. It gave me an exceptionally good peace of mind.
,,"weird, weird weird- but you just have to go!",4.0,,"This might be the weirdest/ most freaky ""amusement park"" you have ever been to.... We were visiting Singapore for a couple of days and a friend of mine that has been living there for 2-3 years said that after we had done all the tourist things we had to do something really different... and, boy, was it different...! Its this huge park, which was empty when we went (which made it even crepier!), full of chinese statues and figures.... but weird-looking ones.... At some point you reach a place called ""Hell"" (!) and you enter a dark cave (!) which shows you, with human-like figurines, the 10 steps of the chinese hell which includes punishements and tortures!! All the time you are left wondering ""why would anyone do this"" and ""why am I here"" but the truth is you just have to go because its one of the weirdest things you`ll ever see in your- tourist- life !"
,,A fascinating and unique place to explore Singapore history of a past time with no gimmicks,5.0,,"Compared to all the other attractions in Singapore this place of history highlights a uniqueness and character of a past time when Singapore was a mere quaint little nation. Its beauty lies in its charm that is basically unchanged since it was first set up in the late 1930's by the two brothers that made 'Tiger Balm'. If you are a history buff, willing to forgive a bit of faded paint, like to explore Chinese culture, old myths, and are someone who likes to see something you will never see anywhere else... then Haw Par Villa is for you. I adore the place and visit frequently. I am Australian expatriate who has lived in Singapore for over 7 years. I have watched a lot of Singapore update to new buildings and meca tourist facilities. I ask why would you want to go to a themepark like Universal studios (that you do just about anywhere in the world), when you can visit a place of charm, transqulity, character and represents 'real' Singapore like Haw Par Villa? I must add that the 'Ten Courts of Hell' exhibit is not be missed... take your kids - trust me - they'll never be naughty again! Give Haw Par Villa a chance... there is something for everyone; and it's free too!"
,,"Unusual, bizarre, colourful, interesting, FREE and totally absorbing!",4.0,,"i saw the pictures in a guide book and was compelled to visit but have to admit that it was a complete surprise. The whole attraction is obviously in need of a cash injection and a marketing revamp, such a shame that it has been left to stagnate as it could be so much more than it is at the moment. The statues are fascinating, the folklore riveting, loads of space, vibrant colours, fabulous photo opportunities.....but the atmosphere is of an old run-down theme park with very little going on. I wouldn't have missed it for the world but felt that it could be revived in a dignified cultural way without turning it into a disney-style burger kingdom - definitely worth a visit but Singapore is missing a golden opportunity here!"
,,disneyland on acid! worst trip ever!,1.0,,What were they thinking when they designed this place for their children? The 12 paths to hell! It was like a puppet show but gory. It was tacky and not worth the entry fee! Don't bother taking a camera if you do the bus tour that stops there. There is a statue of liberty with an asian face! Weird!!!! My husband and I were not impressed. It was made by the brothers who created tiger balm.... I think they sniffed some before they built it! Don't bother people! Go to the zoo instead!
,,"Fascinating, gruesome, bizarre but interesting",4.0,,"We visited Haw Par Villa in Aug 2009. This is the second time we have visited here - first time was in 1982 when last in Singapore. Still it was fascinating, gruesome, bizarre and at the same time very interesting. Built in 1937, Haw Par Villa describes Chinese folklore.
There are hundreds of statues and figurines that replicate Chinese mythology characters like the Laughing Buddha and the Fu Lu Shou (Taoist deities). The Ten Courts of Hell is rather gruesome though. It features the ten steps of judgement before reincarnation and it certainly leaves nothing to the imagination. The statues and sets depict moral values and the punishments for wrong-doing but I would not recommend taking young children to see The Ten Courts of Hell for fear of them having nightmares afterwards.
You can easily spend a couple of hours in the park. Cost is free for entry to the Park but its SGD1 pax to enter the Ten Courts of Hell.
The whole place is clean but aging. Although refurbishments and repainting are going on, i think it could do with a little more money spent of it to help get it back to its original state as some displays are cracked and very brittle due to age. Even if they charged an entrance fee of SGD2 or SGD5 pax l think people would be willing to pay it to see such a magnificent array of statues and folklore and Chinese history and it could not be described as ""run down"". We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Villa and got heaps of interesting photos."
,,Chinese Immigrants Museum,5.0,,"We only went to Haw Paw Villa as my husband had business to attend to nearby. The villa itself is rather dated but has an interesting story and history.

What was exceptionally good though is the new Chinese Immigration Museum located within the gardens.

We had a guided tour (S$8.60) by a lovely gentleman called Richard who explained that this museum has been set up to tell the story of the movement of chinese people away from China and their settlement in other parts of the world.

He gave us a great deal of insight into the history of Chinese immigration, including to our home country of Australia during the gold rush era.

Once his guided tour finished he returned us to the start of the museum and we were free to wander through again at our leisure.

There is a lovely restaurant within the museum and it appears that they also do corporate functions. The whole area (Haw Paw Villa) is owned now by the Singapore government I believe and the museum is run by the Singapore Tourism Board.

Well worth a visit to the museum and it might make Haw Paw an ok addition to that."
,,Rather disappointing,2.0,,"The concierge at our hotel and our taxi driver both tried to dissuade us, to not waste our time with Haw Par Villa but we had heard it was quite interesting and were determined to see for ourselves. Of all the sights and places of interest that we visited ,I think this was the least interesting and as we were the only people there I can only assume that other tourists heeded thier taxi driver/concierge."
,,Interesting little park!,4.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Haw Par Villa and the only thing I knew was that it was old amusement park built in the 1930's that was now a free attraction. We took a taxi that cost about $5 from our hotel. Haw Par Villa is a bizarre and vivid mix of statues that show or explain Chinese folklore. The park is mostly statues though there was a small restaurant that was open, a gift shop, and vendors just outside the gate that sold water and sodas. We did have to pay $1 to view the Ten Courts of Hell but it was well worth the $1. Haw Par Villa was built by the founder of Tiger Balm for his brother. In the Jade Museum - they have books about the history (and AC) so if you go- take the time to visit the Jade Musuem to learn about this amazing and odd place! And we didn't have to wait but a few minutes before a taxi appeared to take us back to our hotel."
