,,"Great food, fun streets",4.0,,Nice place for some original Indian food and bring home some Indian spices and snacks. Also the architecture nearby is very beautiful.
,,Everything Indian in one street,4.0,,"one stop venue to get anything and everything Indian. A must visit for everyone craving for real indian delicacies, jewellery and provisions"
,,Dirty and scary,1.0,,"Came here around 9 PM, because we lived nearby (Bugis), and had to do some laundry.

While rest of Singapore seems both clean and safe, Little India is the exact opposite. We had numerous encounters with groups of men just sitting or standing in the streets, while staring at people passing by. At times it felt really intimidating, especially since a few of these men seemed either drunk or mentally ill.

Despite the general reputation of Singapore being the cleanest country in the world, Little India failed to live up to this. Trash was everywhere, and this was the first place we saw both rats and cockroaches.

There's really nothing to see or experience here."
,,Truly Indian,5.0,,"Its truly south Indian, especially Tamilnadu. u can find exactly all the major brands in south india there, from food to jewellery, textiles etc., Everything costly"
,,Exquisite!,5.0,,"Love wandering the streets around Little India. So rich with sights, sounds and great food. Loads os Instagramable shots on offer."
,,"Great food, great prices",5.0,,A place that felt like home away from home. Little India reminded me of so many places back in SA. The food was delicious with several halal options available
,,A must visit,4.0,,"We did a self walk tour around little India, Arab st and China town.

I think these areas are a must visit when coming to Singapore.

I would recommend visiting a restaurant I. Each area and trying their specialty. It can be as small as a coffee and pastry but take the time to take the area in rather then quickly walking through it.

Little India had beautiful landmarks, beautiful murals and some delicious food!

Loved our morning in little India!"
,,Dirty,1.0,,Stayed at little india in Singapore for a 1 night stay. I thought singapore is the cleanest city in the world to I came upon this grass area full of litter here is a picture.
,,Old Singapore,3.0,,Only covers a couple of city blocks but an authentically Indian market area with some well-preserved houses. You can pick up your spice supplies cheaply here too as well as eating good Indian food at one of the many restaurants Don't miss the colourful Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple.
,,Couldn‚Äôt handle this place...,2.0,,"After spending a few days in the rest of Singapore, I really struggled in Little India. Singapore in general is spotlessly clean and just beautiful, Little India is quite the opposite. I could not get away quickly enough."
,,Don't Expect Too Much,2.0,,"This is not a smart area of Singapore by any means in fact its quite scruffy in comparison.

Men lounge about outside their shops on chairs waiting for someone to buy their vegetables. There are empty boxes lying around in the street.

Go ..... Just to say you have been the walk right on through it to Arab Street for a special treat.

I'm saying no more......"
,,A taste of south India,3.0,,"This section of Singapore is home to many immigrants from south India. You see the signs in Tamil throughout, although many are in English as well. Not as many tea houses as you might expect, but plenty of restaurants serving biryani. Parking available on the street so that you can walk through the district. There is a Hindu flavor to most of the places. Shopkeepers are eager to help and point you to where you want to go or find what you want to find. There are banks that advertise being about to ship money back to India. Seemed like a poorer version of Chinatown."
,,LITTLE (SOUTH) INDIA,3.0,,"You will never miss India when are in Little India, Singapore. You will find all familiar Indian Names on Signboards, find Indian People manning the Shops, and all Indian stuff particularly Masala available in the Shops.

We went there a number of times, last being on 12th July 2019

Needless to say that Indian here primarily mean 'South Indian'"
,,So many choices,5.0,,"We love indian food, there are so many choices here! Little India is a lot cleaner and tidier than is used to be, recommended while visiting Singapore."
,,Really ....,2.0,,"Ordinary streets , nothing much yo see except a bunch of shops and a temple . Way over rated as a place to visit. U don‚Äôt travel half way across the world to see this ."
,,Very lived in,4.0,,"This was part of our city tour and I have to say it was easily the most authentic. This is a living breathing neighborhood, with real food, real temples, and real people. It wasn't the most scenic by far, but if you want to see the hub of Indian life in Singapore this is it. Worth a visit; not for the two hours we spent but definitely an hour."
,,Totally different than other areas,5.0,,"Little India takes you into a totally different culture in Singapore. The structures, religion and food is all representative of India, unique and beautiful."
,,Good for a change,3.0,,"Little India is a quaint part of Singapore where we spent some time. If you want to do some shopping in this area there are many small shops around with good deals, if you don‚Äôt want to barter you can go to Mustafa shopping centre. The food is great in all the restaurants, don‚Äôt be put of with the decor or street frontage, we tried several restaurants while we where there and had no problem with the food. Money changers are good at Mustafa shopping centre and across the road."
,,Sherin Nafie,4.0,,"Worth a visit. U can visit the temples or walk through the streets of Little India to buy souvenirs, gold, cloth, Indian clothes & items or enjoy an Indian meal at a reasonable price. Mustafa Centre, located in Little India is a department store that sells almost everything from toys, souvenirs, confectionery, household items, beauty & cosmetic products, perfumes, clothes, groceries, spices, .... at fair prices."
,,India street in Singapore,5.0,,"Come & Experience a unique walk along Serangoon Road.. lots of hustle n bustle of an Indian community. Food, trading, Sarees, spices, provisions of Indian delights & delicacies. Enjoy üåªüôèüíù"
,,Why Not,4.0,,"With the MRT making little India an easy get to I would suggest that you pay a visit once you get of the train the aroma is a real sense to the nose, just wonder around and enjoy every thing it has to offer the food,culture and every thing else that go's with Little India"
,,a liitle bit of india in Singapore,4.0,,A great place to shop or window shop and just wade about. It has some great resturant as well. Wonderful place. mustafa center is one heck of a place to buy stuffs at great deal
,,A piece of India,5.0,,"Little India is an amazingly spiritual and cultural experience!.. Lots of temples...food outlets...gift shops and beautiful people! Well worth a few hours at least, to stroll around and enjoy the sights, smells, and smiles!"
,,Lively Little India,4.0,,"Little India - vibrantly colorful buzzing with bazaars, temples, restaurants and shophouses selling all sorts of India produce.
While wandering through the narrow streets there is plenty of good street art to be seen. Artists are granted permits to do this graffiti artwork. It is a colorful spectacle not to be missed.
Along with this spreading art work there are also plenty of temples with just as spectacular statues of various mythical creatures and saints.
As a single women walking around I didn't feel intimidated or uncomfortable (As others have reviewed) or maybe I didn't notice as I was enjoying walking around and soaking up this culture/environment.
Unlike the rest of Singapore Little Indian is not very clean
Worth a visit all the same"
,,Decent options,3.0,,Lots of Indian/Asian shops. Plenty of south Indian cuisines also available. Nothing great. Connected by metro.
,,A feast for the senses,5.0,,"I participated in a walking tour to Little India with Indie Singapore and would highly recommend this. We went down lots of back allies that most people wouldn't know about, and I learnt so much that I wouldn't have known if I hadn't been on the tour. If you want clean, sterile, air-conditioned Singapore, then go to Orchard. If you also want to treat your senses and take in the full Indian experience - beautiful sights, street art, noise, colours and smells of incense and spices, then give Little India a try. The Tekka Centre does have some strong smells of fish and mutton in parts, but it's still well worth taking a look - a feast for the eyes."
,,I feel like i visit India in a short time,5.0,,"Last time i visit Singapore i choose to spend the night in front of Mustafa Center. So i can explore Little India more. When i strolling around i can smell strong scent from yellow flower sorry i didnt know the name. And i always see the beautiful India women in their India sari. Thats cool! And i also visit Sri Mariaman temple but i just look from outside, and suddenly i feel like i was at India"
,,Allways buzzing with activity,5.0,,"This isn't India, but its probably as close as you are likely to get without visiting the sub continent. Just about everything can be found here, some of the goods are obvious cheap imports from China and are probably best left where they are!
Little India is on the MRT line so getting there is not a problem. The atmosphere has to be experienced to believed and the noise, the crowds, the dust and the constant traffic are always there and add to your experience.
With very few exceptions you can buy everything you could need here and some items are a real bargain, others not!
If you have the chance give Little India a few hours of your time and as India itself you will either like it or loathe it."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,Lovely place to feel like you are in India.Street is filled with Indian markets.A sweet home away from India.
,,India History,3.0,,"Little India. Nothing special, very crowded and hard to walk around. Not very clean better places to see in Singapore. Give it a go, I did it during the day not sure about night."
,,Modern yet authentically developed,5.0,,"Colourful
Vibrant
Creativity
Modern yet a touch of authenticity
Little India also known as Tekka was hell of a place. Yes almost every items could be bought our back home but like I always mention in my previous posts cleanliness and being well maintained is the most important aspects I look into. A place for all ages of life."
,,Mr. Kay,5.0,,"Little India is a nice spot located centrally. A small area truly brings out the home feeling. The staff is ready to wait on you and makes you feel welcomed. The menu is lengthy, and food is even better:"
,,Not the cleanest place in Singapore,3.0,,Its a strange feeling when your in the area you don't feel like you're in Singapore anymore. We wanted to go to the famous Tekka Centre which in itself was a let down. It seems all the low income population has been housed in this area its not clean even though there are many colourful shop houses and Hindu Temples. There is a large Muslim Community too mostly South Indian there were places that really smelled. It's not much of a place for sight seeing but if you wanna try Indian food or buy cheap souvenirs this is the place.
,,Colourful part of Singapore,4.0,,"This is one of my favourite parts of Singapore. It is colourful, busy, and there are lots and lots of Indian restaurants everywhere. There are also lots of Hindu temples and stores selling Indian products as well as Singapore's famous Mustafa Centre which is a big 24 hours department store that sells just about everything.

When wandering around the area you can see so many walls on the sides or fronts of buildings completely covered by colourful graffiti. I also came across a small park with elephant statues that was quite interesting. So really, just try wandering around the area, stop for lunch, do some shopping and explore some of the lovely temples.

Some of the best restaurants can actually be found along Race Course Road where we found many larger and better quality places."
,,Scary,1.0,,"Do not visit if you are a young white couple. Streets full of intimidating men who hiss and stare at you. I‚Äôve never felt so uncomfortable in my life. I was dressed in top and trousers, yet men were hissing and glaring at you. Even my boyfriend felt uncomfortable so we left immediately. AVOID AVOID"
,,Great place to buy souvenir n indian food.,4.0,,You can shop lots n lots of souvenir from here at very reasonable prices. But don't got to Mustafa mall it was not worth it.. very cheat quality products and High price. Shop from outside shops.
,,Colorful,5.0,,Nice and different thing you can see !! Many restaurants and shop!! Weekend is very busy place for India people here to hang out too !! Very safe place and fun for shopping too ( but not for me ) !! I don‚Äôt eat India food
,,Slums of Singapore,1.0,,"I was super excited to visit Little India. Whilst in Singapore, my accommodation was near to Chinatown (which is amazing) so I was expecting a similar vibe from Little India. Instead, it was very unwelcoming and all of our party (a mix of ages and genders) were in agreement that we couldn't wait to leave - we all felt a bad vibe.

Little India is dirty. It is basically a slum. The majority of Singapore is very clean and environmentally conscious, yet, Little India seems to be the complete opposite. There is dirt, rotting food and rubbish everywhere. The smell was overwhelmingly vile - in particular in the Tekkah Centre where you could see the birds feasting on the ""fresh"" meat that was for sale. The shops were full of cheap and tacky souvenirs, frequently without prices on.The other shops seemed to be aimed towards local individuals, rather than tourists, as they sold electronics, phones, clothing and gold. Not sure why people care for the Mustafa centre - it is just a huge shopping centre selling all types of rubbish. It is essentially a crap version of TX Maxx or Costco that also sells a few watches. It is absolutely rammed with anything and everything you could think of and not in a good way. It is definitely not anything you need to prioritise visiting.

Lots of unfriendly men, hanging around idly on the street corners who enjoyed staring at any young woman who passed and frequently shouted at us and made inappropriate comments - despite none of our party dressing inappropriately or deliberately attempting to attract attention. As a female, I felt unsafe and I dread to think what would have happened if we were not accompanied by the men in our party. It was also the only area in Singapore where I was approached by beggars for money and there were numerous of these female beggars dotted around who constituted the only women that seemed to be in the area.

Yes - some of the colours and the architecture is amazing but is few and far between. It is not packed with colourful streets like you see on google images - there are a handful of these at most. I walked around for ages expecting to find hidden gems but alas, there were none. The temples are pretty but these alone do not negate the bad aspects of Little India. I would avoid visiting and enjoy other areas of Singapore."
,,Authentic Singapore,5.0,,"I first visited little India in 1979 and it hasn't changed one bit up to today.
There is something for everyone there from food to shopping.
A very short walk from Farrer Park MRT stop to Mustafa shopping mall, but be adventurous and walk the area as hidden gems are every where."
,,Local Colour Galore!,5.0,,"Travelers are always looking for ""local colour."" Singapore's Little India has enough for an entire holiday!

First, there's food! Curries.......my favourite is the curry fish head which is sold almost on every street!

Second, the festive decorations in the bright colours of India.

Third, Mustafa department store which has literally everything!"
,,Check temples time of opening ahead of your visit,4.0,,"Little India has more India than Chinatown has China in Singapore (just in case you have time for only one place). Exiting the metro, there is the food court with delicious choices, sometimes very spicy.
The temples are often closed 12-4pm so you need to time your visit accordingly."
,,Unique neighborhood,4.0,,"Colorful, lively area. Lots of shops and food markets to explore. If it wasn‚Äôt so hot, we would have explored more. Lower building s do not offer much shade. Would probably be best to visit earlier in the day."
,,The streets were so colorful!,4.0,,This part of Singapore is fantastic! there was so much colour and energy at this place. do recommend coming here for lunch to try the local singapore indian food. Great place for photographers and worth it for someone seeking to experience a totally different part of the country!
,,Different to rest of Singapore,4.0,,"Reviews seem to criticise Little India because it‚Äôs out of kilter with the polished clean facade of Singapore, but that‚Äôs part of its charm, India is busy, noisy and dirty and so is this part of Singapore. Go and experience something different. Expect to see old buildings not just clean high rise ones and some cheaper and less polished places to eat. The walk around the area needn‚Äôt take long and the temples and Mustafa‚Äôs are all part of the reason we travel, to see something different otherwise what is the point of going anywhere other than your own town."
,,One Big Bazaar,3.0,,"Lot of opportunities to buy clothing, metal castings, souvenirs, and food stuffs. Not as colorful as China Town."
,,A good place to see Indian culture and south India breakfast,3.0,,I will advice to try south Indian breakfast (Dosa and Idli) in little India. You can walk around to see and buy Indian spices.
,,Great atmosphere and smells of colourful shop displays,5.0,,"We did a self guided walking tour of Little India from a leaflet obtained some years ago during a previous visit to Singapore although our lonely planet guide book also has details of a walk around the area. Little India is a colouful thriving hub of activity that is fascinating. There are so many sights and smells with a riot of colour from the garlands prepared for sale for worshippers to take to the Temple to the smell of the spices that overload your senses. There is a huge variety of shops and the streets are fasciinating to wander around but it takes time. There is also a huge food court selling lots of deliciously smelling food at bargain prices. There are so many interesting landmarks in little India from the Temples and Mosques to the Arcades and heritage Buildings. This is a shoppers paradise if you have time to browse. It is best to visit Little India on a weekday as it gets very crowded at weekends. There are so many colourful traditions of little India that you can get a sense of by visits to Tekka Market, Ellison Building, a walk down Buffalo Road (formerly housing buffalo pens , snake charmers, fortune tellers etc). The House of Tan Teng Niam is one of Little India's last surviving Chinese villas with intricate carving on the door . There are lors of traditional shophouses that have been preserved where the ground floor is the shop and the family live on the two floors above. The Masjid Abdul Gafoor mosque has a wonderful sundial at the entrance decorated with calligraphy. The impressive and colourful Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple was first built in 1855 but was extended in 1908 and is dedicated to Kali. You must go barefoot to visit inside the Temple and it is closed from 12.30 to 4pm daily."
,,Real India,4.0,,"There are some areas which are quite Indian. For example, Southall in the UK. But this felt like it could actually be India. The shops, the temples, street food etc. It is worth coming here to check out some of the architecture. The food here is also very good. We visited this area twice, once in the day and then in the evening. It was busier in the evening. We were told that Sundays are the busiest as everyone is off work."
,,Must visit shopping destination for Indians,4.0,,It is a downtown kind a street with malls eating joints and shopping destinations. You can find lots of variety of Indian food here from south Indian to Punjabi. Mustafa mall is great destination for shopping needs should you need anything in Singapore. Also small shopping shops provide cost effective and good quality souvenirs
,,Little India,5.0,,"Great place for indians.one should take hotel nearby as many good hotels like Hilton garden , park Ferrer road are there.advantage is in taking breakfast lunch and dinner in South Indian food corners as they are tasty and pocket friendly.shops are attractive."
,,"Must see, very nice athmosphere",5.0,,Little India is perfect to stroll around and discover the local culture. This part os the city is for sure a recommendation to visit and explore!
,,"Best Place to visit, stay, food, shopping etc",5.0,,"Little India is best for everything.
Stay: A lot of good hotels are here, economical, expensive etc.
Food: Whole lot of street food, fine restaurants, all types of cuisines like north, south, vegans, non-vegans etc.
Shopping: A lot of shopping centers, malls are available on walking distance."
,,Fun to shop and fabulous Indian food,5.0,,We did some shopping at Mustafa and we also shopped at some of the local markets - before stopping at an awesome local restaurant ! Lively bright coloured shops but a little grimier than the rest of Singapore
,,time to kill,3.0,,"don't know if we missed the right place here but for me little india is fine if your looking for authentic food or want some bright clothing for yourself or the kids , it was hussing with rain when I was there so I may of missed the right spot"
,,Average!,3.0,,"We were all quite disappointed with Little India.

Lots of shops and the large Mustafa centre were okay. Nothing special.
We had some early lunch which was fine.

The mandir is lovely to see but nothing like the ones you see in South India anyway

I wouldn‚Äôt bother visiting here unless you know someone who knows where to eat."
,,Average at best,3.0,,"Visited Little India and to be honest had the same expectation as Chinatown. It was a little disappointing, not that much there and the streets were pretty dirty. It kind of felt you were in India a little bit. Wouldn't go back again!"
,,Like India with clean streets,4.0,,"Al though this is not as impressive as Chinatown, it is not as tourist dominated. You still see the clear ethical Indian presence. If you travel with kids, where is a small playground next to the subway station."
,,great Indian food,5.0,,if you want Indian food this is the place to eat...lots of shops offering bargains. lots of different things
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Have a look around this area and also enjoy some of the many food halls/places to eat at. This is a fascinating area of Singapore with little shops and Indian sites to see. There is also a very large multi story department store open 24 hours 7 days a week. the people are friendly and the food is great. Take your time and stroll around so you can experience it first hand. There is the option of a busy ride through here but you don't really get the same feeling or experience.
,,A refined view of India,4.0,,Depends on what you are looking for here but it is mix or markets and shops with food stalls and jewelry stores and more. The food market presents the opportunity to sample some authentic Indian food or pick up the traditional Indian style clothing at a good price. In a world where culture and tradition are fast disappearing this is a good way to sample India in comfort.
,,India here I go!,4.0,,"A must go for those who want to explore a little bit more a different kind of town.

I made it here by train and I walked around as I enjoyed the many foods, flowers, and all types of vendors you can find in here, from vegetables to fruits, flowers, accessories, clothes, and so much more.

The color and smells were the highlights of the afternoon as I expected.

They also have a huge food court inside a place next to the train station with soooo many places to choose from. It was a shame that I had breakfast before I went because I was full and I couldn't try anything, but the smell of the food was so good that I end up taking some sweets back to the Hotel with me."
,,Don‚Äôt act like a tourist and get a better experience,4.0,,"Little India is thriving and bustling and expectations should not be a tailored tourist attraction. Avoid the flash-looking restaurants with downtown prices, there is a reason they are empty or serving only a couple of westerners. Look for the busy restaurants that are busy and popular with Indians, they are awesome and friendly and very cheap. This is authentic Indian food and is great. The temples are worth a visit and the street vendors are fun. Half a day with lunch is about right unless you find it too good to leave"
,,Great food but dirty and a bit unwecoming,3.0,,"After visiting chinatown, I found little india to be rather dirty and a bit unwelcoming. Many shops did not display prices openly. There is great food and beyond Farrer Park MRT a couple of lovely temples, well away from the main shopping and food area. Just not my favourite part of Singapore"
,,Spices,4.0,,The smell of spices in this part of Singapore is worth the visit alone not to mention piles of yellow gold shops. Fantastic food and a very colorful part of a cool city. Cool in the trains that is!
,,Food!!!,5.0,,"we went here to have lunch.. as we expected, the place called Little India where so many Indian people live there. there will be plenty good Indian options of food. I forgot the name, but we ate the one with rice and chickens with strong spices. it was so good and super big portion. we can't even finish it. only s$ 3. worth to try!!"
,,Not much there,3.0,,"There is not a lot to see here. Some colourful elephants, wall art & 2 temples. Lots of junky shopping. We did not eat here as we didn't know where to go. Unlike the rest of Singapore this area is not overly clean. Easily done in an hour walk."
,,"Colourful, quirky and smells of all kinds.",3.0,,It was an interesting walk around little India. lots of little shops to get lost in and haggle with a wide variety of unique gifts to bring home for your loved ones. it really is a place to stimulate the senses with people and colours everywhere and a wide variety of smells! ranging from incense to curry and sometimes some not very pleasant odors that do seem to linger. it is a huge contrast from the other areas of Singapore where everything is so clean. its close to the city centre and easy to get to and is worth a trip if you have a hour or 2 up your sleeve.
,,Steeped Cultural Heritage,4.0,,"If you visit Singapore, do take sometime to enjoy a walk around the Little India area, along Serangoon Road.
Take the MRT and alight at Little India station, and look for the direction towards Buffalo Road and Serangoon Road.

There are interesting preserved heritage houses which are now mainly used as all kinds of shops, selling fruits, textiles, electronic gadgets, Jewellery and etc. Cross the road to Campbell Road, and walk the pedestrian path to the Indian Cultural Building. Currently, an exhibition related to Indian Peranakan communities is being held there until May 2019.

If you are keen to buy some stuff, continue back to Serangoon Road, and look out for Ayed Salwi Road, which is on your right. There is the famous Mustafa Centre, where you will find a Mustafa Cafe on the ground floor, with a big Supermarket on the second floor , with all sorts of household products, food, watches, electronic items, clothing and anything you can think of buying.

When you are hungry, go to Khansama Tandoori Restaurant for a meal. If you like to experience our eating at the Hawker centre, go straight to Tekka Market when you find Buffalo Road, at the beginning of your walk.

When you head back to Serangoon Road, continue walking further and you will find the Farrer Park MRT, which will take you to your next destination.

Enjoy in Singapore."
,,A small step back in time,4.0,,"I spent a pleasant few hours wandering around this well known district. Unlike nearby Chinatown, Little India boasts several streets of period buildings as well as latter more bland developments.
The area consists of a good balance of small business as well as a vast range of eateries. I felt the area had retained its old world charm whilst embracing the future with its ultra modern Community building.
The area starts the moment you exit the MTR and is well worth a visit."
,,Interesting sights,5.0,,"We visited on short tour after leaving our cruise ship. Very ethnic and interesting area. Shops, housing and colors stand out."
,,best place for vegetarian indians,3.0,,"Being a Indian and that too pure vegetarian is a problem outside India. You wont find any problem if you stay in little India.
Nothing touristy about this place.
otherwise prefer Orchard street or Robertson Quay or Qlarke Quay or Marina Bay Sands area for stay"
,,Little India,3.0,,"Little India is an ethnic district in Singapore. It is located east of the Singapore River,across from Chinatown, located west of the river,and north of Kampong Glam. Both areas are part of the urban planning area of Rochor. Little India is commonly known as Tekka in the Indian Singaporean community.Little India[1] is distinct from the Chulia Kampong area.This area good to see other culture , see the old temple and buy Souviners.the shopping was dissapointing because some products not high quality.
Furthermore,not look clean .This area not from top spot for tourist. I came in 12-3-2019."
,,It‚Äôs Well Named,4.0,,"We took the MRT to Little India which is a good way to get there.
It‚Äôs a great place to visit with so many interesting shops and stalls selling a large selection of produce and merchandise.
The aroma from the fresh flowers and spices were amazing.
If you‚Äôre looking for a bargain then you should get one here.
There is a large food court where it was mostly locals eating there, there are numerous Indian restaurants to choose from."
,,Dissapointing,3.0,,"We didn't enjoy Little India. It was very hot when we went and was a trek to get there. I think it was mainly our fault as well as we didn't locate the main places we were after. I researched prior to our arrival and was expecting a lot of colour and saris. We asked a local directions to the Mustafa centre, he told us down the road. A building had that name, but it was equivalent to the older style Dimmeys ( but so, so much worse); obviously the wrong Mustafa. The local arcade was enclosed and very hot. I did have a copy of the free walking tour, so as to find the better places of interest. We were looking forward to Little India, but to us it was a waste of time."
,,Awesome Little India ‚úå,5.0,,Wondering around Little India in Singapore is easy just off the metro. The street art is so well done. The people friendly and the food at the market food court/side is delicious. Check out one of the free walking tours to help you out if your around the days they do it.
,,"""Overall ok""",3.0,,Place is good for indian restaurant with available veg food option also but price was too high as i expect little bit cheaper food available at this place. Mustafa Centre was good for purchasing some cheap grocery and other things. place was too crowdy. Overall ok and just for once to visit.
,,One of my favorite places in Singapore,5.0,,"I would say the best thing here to do is explore by walking around the different streets checking out the different shops and maybe settle down somewhere to have some delicious Indian food. My kids had henna done on their hands and wrists which looked pretty cool at the Little India Arcade 48 Serangoon road about 2 doors down from a 7-11, a jewelry store and a money changer that had the best rates I've seen in Singapore. For the henna it's cash only, your wife or daughters will probably love it and think it's cool. Check out some of the temples but don't take pictures of people inside unless they say it's okay to do so. Go to the Indian heritage center if you want some detailed information on the history of the Indian population in Singapore. Enjoy this vibrant neighborhood."
,,Crowded just like India,3.0,,"Little India is a near mirror replica of India - too much hustle bustle, too many people and sounds and a little clutter of shops everywhere. For a non-Indian, it might be fascinating, but for me, I felt that Indians in Singapore could have done a better job."
,,Authentic but not for me.,2.0,,"Had a look around whilst on holiday, can‚Äôt say I rated the place. Seemed like it needed a dam good wash and tidy up in places - very out of keeping with much of Singapore elsewhere.

Never seen so many tacky gold jewellery shops in my life either.

The temple in the middle is lovely however."
,,A very authentic quarter,5.0,,"This area of Singapore is probably as close as you could get to India. Everything looks and smells probably like it did more than 60 years ago. You'll see various foods, spices, etc. that the local Indian community shops. Very interesting visit."
,,Got to see if you have time,4.0,,Spend 2/3 hours here if you have time. There are numerous temples to visit as well as Tekka market. You really could be in India! Don't miss the very good Indian Heritage Centre as well. Lots of proper places to sample real I Dian for.
,,Amazing Heritage Trail,4.0,,Love the vibrancy and colourful sights of Little India even on a weekday. Take a walk around Little India and u will discover many interesting and colourful local food culture & traditions. It is a learning journey even for the locals to find out more about Singapore‚Äôs multi-cultural society. Be prepared to take many pics here.
,,Diversity of Singapore,5.0,,The Singapore has incredible mix of nationalities. Little India is a colourful ethnic corner. Definitely worth visiting
,,A large slice of india,5.0,,Great area with cheap and reasonable /good quality clothes and gold jewellery. Anything you want can be bought cheaply (Mostly at Mustafi's!). Vast choice of restaurants from all regions.
,,Amazing shopping & Food,5.0,,"If you have time make sure you walk around Little India and experience the shopping and the food. Make sure you visit the Mustafa shopping mall. It is several stories and about 2 city blocks in length. Continuous shops , floor to ceiling. You can find almost anything in this mall. Not your typical shopping mall.
If you want a local meal and some cold beer visit the Nandinis Bar and Restaurant 2 blocks in front the currency exchange at Mustafa mall. Very inexpensive and is where the locals eat. Also the food courts in Little India are good."
,,A true slice of India everything!,4.0,,This is a major MRT subway stop so it is easy to reach.Get off the MRT and then head down racehorse Street. There are thousands of Indian restaurants and Indian markets and colorful architecture.
,,idian,5.0,,"a country with a lot of immigrants, they live in unity, without discrimination, i like I like vegetables and fruits here"
,,Kaleidoscope of Indian Life,4.0,,"Little India is located in downtown Singapore and has a large Indian community. It is one of the most charismatic and colorful places to visit in Singapore. Here there are many jewelry stores, tailor shops, traditional Indian restaurants and a few busy temples like the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple that is embellished with colorful statues of Hindu deities. The main street in Little India is Serangoon Road which dates from 1822 making it one of Singapore‚Äôs oldest roadways. Little India is 12 min walk from Arab Street."
,,Visit for cheap goods and good Indian food,4.0,,"Went for a walk through. Good shops to buy affordable gift items. Lots of Indian restaurants offering a variety of indian food at quite reasonable price.
However, part of the pedestrian walkways are almost completely taken over by some food joints forcing walkers to take the road."
,,"Culture, liquor control and food in little India Singapore",4.0,,"Little Indian was originally designated as an enclave for the Indian population during the colonial era. However, the Chinese and Malay populations have coexisted in an ‚Äúimagined community‚Äù often assumed to be mainly Indians only. The uniqueness of Indian culture, heritage and community stands out and adds to the richness of other ethnic communities and cultures in the little Indian district. Since the 2013 little India riot incident, the 2015 Liquor Control Act has banned the sale of alcohol from 1030 pm to 0700 am. This has successfully put excessive drinking and public disorder under control. For food lovers, you will not be disappointed with the choice available for a wide price range (low, medium, high) and rich assortment of extremely value for money and yet really nice, authentic and exotic Indian cuisine, in which you will have to pay only at a relatively high price for a limited assortment or standard Indian cuisine in other countries."
,,Singapore is very clean except in Little India,3.0,,Little India did not have much to offer for the tourist. Not a lot of markets or shopping. I cannot remember the name of the restaurant but the butter chicken and the naan bread was amazing. Just not a clean place but the food was great. It was located on a busy corner in the restaurant area.
,,Culture Enclave With Loads of Intereting Nooks and Crannies,4.0,,"(Disclaimer: I am resident in Singapore and this review should therefore be read bearing that in mind)

Little India at Serangoon Road is a microcosm of cultural, retail and religious spaces synonymous with what you will see in different parts of India. You will be able to see various Temples, viz:
-Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. Hindu Temple
-Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple. Hindu Temple.
-Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple. Buddhist Temple

There are a multitude of retail spaces along the whole stretch selling fabric, Indian gold (which has deeper gold hue compared to the usual gold pieces you see in some of the mainstream malls), spices etc. Many gravitate towards Mustaffa Centre which practically sells everything from electronic goods to eggs.

You will be spoilt for choice when it comes to dining options since there are food establishments practically on each corner. The notable ones that most tend to gravitate to are:

a. Tekka Centre (665 Buffalo Road) - loads of food stalls in the hawker centre here, and there tends to be a Long queue for Alauddins Biryani located at stall number #01-232

b. Banana Leaf Apollo (48 Serangoon Road) to sample the infamous fish head curry and Masala chicken. Having said that, there are many restaurants along the same stretch like Muthu‚Äôs Curry, Gayathri and Delhi Restaurant for you to choose from

c, The French Stall (544 Serangoon Road)....just because it‚Äôs relatively inexpensive French cuisine located in of all places, Little India

d. Ananda Bhavan restaurant (58 Serangoon Road) - ideal for vegetarians

I have not been paid by any of these establishments to promote them."
,,Nothing special but worth a visit,3.0,,"Spent an hour walking along the Little India neighborhood. It's extremely touristy, and the streets are full of markets selling low priced goods and souvenirs. Not much in the way of Cultures, Temples etc. However, there were some very good, authentic restaurants, so if you enjoy Indian food it's worth a visit just for the food.
It's a 10 minute walk from the subway station so definitely worth a short visit."
,,Glimpse of India,4.0,,"I'm not sure if I can go to India, but this is the nearest and most affordable thing next to my India bucket list. Near the MRT, just use google maps and you're good to go. The very colorful buildings and instagrammable too."
,,Short visit,3.0,,When we arrived it was jam packed. It was end of the prayer time. The streets and area were dirty. I reminded me of our time in India. Not what we expected.
,,Just awesome,5.0,,"Everything resembles India. Temples, restaurants,shops. There are old houses with unique type of windows which is interesting. I have uploaded awesome photos of it üòÄ"
,,Little india,5.0,,"We explored & this was the next best thing to India. The gold malls, the shops, the stalls, this is the place for colour, culture, food & bargains.
Local food, north indian & punjabi food.
All your magnets & souveniers. Shopping galore from toys/ stationary & gifts in general. Most shops had offers 3 for 10 or 4 for 10 dollars..
You can have tea stops or visit local temple.
There is a hawker centre too, shop after shop after shop. Most shops have fixed prices.

Great buys to have without spending too much money."
,,You have to experience this place.,5.0,,"On the way back from viewing Singapore on the 47th floor of a hotel with a infinity pool and paying 53 Singaporean dollars for a small glass of wine and a small bottle of beer, we decided to check out little Indian, two meals with sides and large beers 25 Singaporeian dollars. Wouldn't have missed either.
Different ends of the spectrum, but I know in the future I know which one I will remember easiest, the one that reached the most sences Little India
to really appreciate Singapore see it all."
,,Noce to see.,3.0,,"Didn't enjoy Little India much, thought it was dirty, interesting to see though and visited the temple there, would give it another visit though."
,,Not Singapore - and not India,3.0,,"A visit to Singapore would not be complete without having a look at 'Little India'.The area is not very big , so you can easily visit this neighbourhood within 2-3 hours !
You'll find some rrestaurants , a lot of shops ( with absolutely nothing I might be interested in), many tailors , some jewellers ..."
,,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!,5.0,,"Little India Great shopping. Colours Excellent food Henna tattoos for the ladies. Complete with the same smells of India. Make shift beer gardens to get your drinking on, too."
,,Good expereince of little India in Singapore,4.0,,"It provides visitor a bit of India expereince. R=There are shops, food places/restaurants and temple which provides good expereince of India. It is best if you can walk in the area."
,,So much to see and do!,5.0,,"We stayed in Little India for a few days and loved walking around. Its close to so many things, easy walks to restaurants and sites."
,,"As a name suggest, a lit bit of India in Singapore",3.0,,"Not a must visit place, as it represents other than Singaporian culture, but still worth of visot if you want cheap food and to see e.g. Indian temple. For about 2 hours max, requires a lot of walking"
,,Just like india,4.0,,With mainly south indian people and all indian shops and food joints. Food here is still not as good as pure indian taste. Some restaurant do serve authentic taste food which end up charging much high and the one which fits in budget gives non sense food with no taste.
,,Don‚Äôt bother,1.0,,A friend and I (both under 25) took a trip over here after seeing amazing pictures and hearing good things. However after 5 minutes of walking we felt incredibly uncomfortable and intimidated receiving horrible looks from both both men and women. Although we were dressed very moderately we did not feel welcome at all. Singapore also prides itself on cleanliness and little India was a far cry from clean and also the only place in the city that we encountered wasps. We spent 5 days in Singapore and both loved it! This was the only downside of the whole city. Would not recommend for young women.
,,Colourful indian culture,4.0,,"Little India is name given to Serangoon Road area in Singapore. Most shops, temples and restaurants belong to Indian Community and the goods of Indian choice are available. It is the best place to know about Indian culture, food and traditions."
,,Visited Little India,4.0,,"We go to Singapore on regular holidays and on our first actually stayed in Little India but always got the bus up to Orchard Road and the other main attractions. So on this our 6th visit to Singapore we decided to go back to Little India and see what it was like.

Similar to visiting China Town really, i.e. lots of shops offering souvenirs and cheap goods. We also visited a temple (missed the big one) but the one we did go to was very interesting and had lots of people in various stages of prayer. Don't forget to take your shoes off!!!!

Also visited a huge people's food hall where there was so much food on offer it was hard to choose, this was at close to the MRT station so not hard to find.

Also wandered into a large kinda department store (I guess) with several floors. This place had everything so I guess it's where the locals do all their shopping. My husband bought two shirts for $10.00 each and I thought they will probably wash like rags because they were so cheap, but after being home and getting washed several times they are still as good as new and look great. Next trip he will definitely be going back there for more.

If you are after gold, then Little India is definitely the place to go. Indian's love their gold and they have shop after shop of nothing but gold, not my style but I'm sure you can find something if you are into gold.

Well worth a visit, next time I will be looking out for the main temple."
,,Nostalgic Feeling,5.0,,"It was amazing to see the Indian type building architectural buildings in the middle of Singapore. You almost get A to Z items at an affordable cost. Being a Tamil speaking Indian, I loved roamed in the streets of Little India area as I could witness the practice of Tamil culture in each and every aspect. Be it food, clothing, dressing, buildings, celebration of festival and soon. As I visited in the 3rd week of January,the Pongal festival was celebrated for a month here with lot of events and fanfare which is truly amazing. One can find lot of Indian restaurants that is serving all kind of Indian foods at an affordable prices. Each the streetside food outlet also serves tasty food. Cheap shopping and getting an glimpse of the Indian culture are the highlights of Little India."
,,Took a visit to Little India,5.0,,"This is worth a visit, particularly if like me you have lived in India. I like to walk around and if you go down Dickesen Chai tea like you get in Chennai / Madras. The theatre is worth the trip and the roti's and curries are wonderful."
,,I thought i was really in India,5.0,,"This place was amazing. My wife really loved it. The shops were good, food was amazing and people were friendly. It was right next to out hotel so we spent a lot of time there. My wife and her shopping lol. It is much better during the nights after dark as all the lights are on."
,,Lively place,4.0,,"Visited little India on our last day of visit in Singapore. It was a fun and lively place full of Indian people, their food and their culture.

The Indian food and deserts are yummy. ESP a very tiny restaurant called Komala serves authentic Indian veg food.

They have lots of jewelry stores if you are interested in gold jewelry.

Overall the place is worth a small visit but the Indian food is a must!"
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Great place to see, the smells and sounds are fantastic, Lots of markets and bazars for you gifts at great prices if you bargain, went to theheritage centre which was very interesting and was free and included a sample of different cooked rice and curry."

All the shops are typical selling Indian products, restaurants are mostly Indian and a lot of Indian locals as well as tourists all around. Its always busy and hustling with activity. All Indian festivals are especially celebrated here with a lot of enthusiasm and vigor. Most of the stuff here is fairly cheap and good in quality.

,,Streets overwhelming filled with men only,2.0,,"As a woman what I saw of Little India on a late Saturday afternoon I felt quite uncomfortable about the lack of women in the streets and shops, we only saw men, men playing, men chatting, men eating, men shopping for groceries, fruit and vegetables, where were the women and children? Prior to this experience we arrived in the area via MRT at the Little India station, we visited the Tekka Centre and had a beer, walked along Serangoon Road, stopped by Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple and watched from outside a religious event, all good up to this stage. The later part of the afternoon we were searching for a evening meal, I had been told that Little India had heaps of restaurants, just choose one, we saw very few restaurants and ended up not eating in this neighbourhood. I am no hurry to return."
,,Overcrowded place,3.0,,"Probably the only place in Singapore which doesn't feel like Singapore. Mainly because of the crowd & the chaos. Good thing is, if you're looking for authentic Indian stuffs e.g. food, spices, dresses, jewellery etc., you can definitely find here. Nice decorations during Indian festivals"
,,Fascinating Place to see,3.0,,"Fascinating place to see, to those who wanted to buy local goods exotic fruits and vegetables this is the place to be.Well, for me. There‚Äôs so much to see that you get this overwhelming feeling about everything."

,,Colorful Little India,5.0,,"I love to see the fresh veggies, fruits and flowers selling at the shops. I am attracted by a shop named Pasar Baru, this shop sells lots of wooden and bamboo cutlery. I bought a pair of spoon and fork for salad. The price is reasonable.

And this is a place good for taking pictures. I spent half a day walking around here."
,,Full of life and so colourful,4.0,,"Lots of little shops and treasures here, lots of rubbish too i guess it depends on what your looking for, also lots of people so be ready for it. We trained it here did the sidewalk shops and then went to Mustafa Center, everything is so close not a lot of room to move. We walked through the food hall, food smelt great but we didn't eat in here."
,,SPICY TASTE.,5.0,,"In this little India, lots of indian restaurants go to. We also went to the market and was 5 min walk from hotel Hilton. The best part was coconuts to drink the juice and then eat the amazing milky from the inside. Sugarcane was fantastic with ginger and honestly it was a great refresher. Above the market there are indian stalls of clothing and pretty cheap. I enjoyed shopping there. If you go to the market, go on an empty stomach. They have Faludas, to all kinds of fresh juices and foods from madras to Pakistani dishes. We had biriyani twice over there and rava dossas too. Thoroughly enjoyed it and don‚Äôt miss this place"

,,Infact Little India,5.0,,"This place Little India in Singapore is similar to an Urban Indian city. Maximum people speak Tamil, you can buy Jasmine & other flowers like in any market in India. One hears loud Tamil music across shops. You feel it is a short cut route to India

You ask anyone where can I buy this ( perfume, shoe, mobile, handbags, rice, dhal, etc), any Asian guy would say go to Mustafa. Heard their goods are genuine but I can't certify.

Anyone visiting Singapore and going for shopping, please carry your passport as most shops give a GST endorsed receipt for which we can claim rebate on GST around 7% at the Airport. A decent savings on shopping.

Truth is shopping in Singapore is generally expensive than the respective countries."
,,Colourful and Vibrant,3.0,,"Colour everywhere and wonderful smells. Two or three streets and that was us. Not anything out of the ordinary or spectacular here except the Tekka Centre.

,,More of a little Tamil Nadu,3.0,,"After having spent 5 years in chennai, I could connect more to Tamil Nadu as most of it is South Indian cuisine and every second person speaks Tamil. Super crowded, certainly not an attraction but convenient if you want to cherish sarvana bhavan for dosa or buy household stuff at Mustafa"
,,"Not welcoming, Uncomfortable",2.0,,"Passed by Little India at night on a double-decker bus. The lights made it look vibrant and interesting so we decided to visit the next day. Unfortunately, during the day it was unpleasant. Run-down buildings, with unfriendly people walking around. Down side streets while looking at stalls was uncomfortable and dirty. We couldn't wait to get back on the bus out of there."
,,Wonderful and vibrant,4.0,,"We enjoyed our morning round here so much we are heading back. We are planning to purchase cotton trousers and tops. It‚Äôs a great place to visit.

,,Vibrant,5.0,,"There are so many markets here to buy garments, electronics, toys and lots of gifts at unbelievably low prices.
The museums and temples are stunning.
The environment in this district is a complete contrast with old buildings, slightly run down, but obviously passed down through the family.
This is worth‚Äôs half day to take in the cultural contrast."
,,Great photo opportunities in an ethnic neighborhood,4.0,,"If you like garish colors in your photos, do not miss Little India. Next to the Little India metro station are Tekka Centre, House of Tan Teng Niah and Campbell Lane where bright intense colors appear throughout in abandon. I went during the Deepavali Festival, and even the Serangoon Road was adorned with colorful arches that hung over the road and erected at regular intervals all the way down the road as far as the eyes can see. If you are looking for photo opportunities, do not miss Little India."
,,Best Guide Ever,5.0,,"We had a great time on the Little India walk with our guide, Carol. She was our guide for several tours and did a great job every time. By the time we left Singapore we felt we had made a new friend. Her tours are fun, informative and detailed. We saw places and things we would never have found on our own and sampled some fabulous food. The Sari demonstration was great fun. Would highly recommend Original Singapore Walks."
,,Another ghetto,5.0,,"The area started as a ghetto ethnic Indian immigrants would reside under the British policy of ethnic in this section and away from other groups to help keep trouble controlled.
As the community has grown temples, markets and small back street industries. Some creating statues, model, clothing and food.
The markets touch all your sences with spices, fruits, vegetables, meat and fish.
Small dining areas with a single specialist food. Others offering full menus.
I notice comments say the area is a waste of time but I do agree it's worth seeing how immigration effected Singapore."
,,Overrated,2.0,,My opinion not worth it. Plenty of gold shops . Some restaurants and open air markets for food fresh vegetables seafood... dollar store quality of gift stores
,,Vibrant Color Everywhere!,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to visit Little India in late October. Perfect timing for an Hindu festival. Flowers everywhere!!

,,Excellent!,5.0,,"Mark Steven's is the tour operator and I was the only one signed up. Originally from the East Coast but he's been in Singapore for 9 years and is very knowledgeable. Gave excellent advice on photography and pointed out some great shots. Lots of walking but included taxi fare, metro and a short river cruise. Highly recommend.

,,Great place to enjoy Indian food,5.0,,"Great place to enjoy Indian food as there are many Indian restaurants around, so it is also located in the city centre"
,,Hyper stimulus!,5.0,,"A fantastic place to lose one's bearings. So much colour, noise, bustle, textures and smells. My son thoroughly enjoyed his time here. I expected quite the opposite, yet he surprised me.

From the ubiquitous Mustafa Centre to the well loved Komala Villas, Little India has it all. Halal, vegan, meat fest. Gumboots to hair cuts and sugary treats to floral leis.

Just be warned that streets are narrow, not wheel chair friendly and some shops are just enough to walk into, let alone walk around in."

,,Deepavali,4.0,,"Wonderful time in Little India! The streets are highly and colorfully decorated, the women in the most beautiful saris. The flower garlands are everywhere! We went to Mustafa after to pick up tea and spices. The rooftop restaurant was absolutely wonderful! Best curry üçõ ever!"
,,Colour and more colour,5.0,,"When you arrive at the opening of little India all you see is colour hanging from the rafters. Walk through the arch and you won‚Äôt know were to look. Everybody is friendly and you will find the more you speak with the retailers the more you will find that they have lived in Australia or have a relation living in Australia.
You feel safe and they love to bargain, so don‚Äôt hesitate, never pay what they ask, they love the fun of it. Walk through all the streets and see all the fresh produce, have a curry puff, or a curry from one of the vendors, it‚Äôs great."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"It‚Äôs just like another India in Singapore. U get everything in this place . Language ... Hindi , Tamil is welcomed."

,,Weekend Busy,4.0,,"Not to miss in Singapore with different, special buildings and traditions to the western world. Plenty of gold stores, food outlets and street furniture designs."

Such a dreamy street where you see incredible decorations every year. This year they had this amazing Peacock thing. Whether in the morning or at night, and you can always catch a good shot.
never bothered to check the shops though I was told you may find some cool cheap items and good bargains."
,,One of my highlights,5.0,,I would pick Little India over Chinatown everytime. Exudes Indian culture at every step. And one place you must visit is Mustafa shopping superstore. Any thing and everything on offer at reasonable prices. The jewelry in Little India has to be seen to be believed.
,,Lots of Shopping Indian Style,4.0,,This place is must visit for daily shoppers and Indian Food. This place hosts lot of shops especially the big one Mustafa Market with that various Indian Restaurant to get the fine taste of Indian Cuisine.
,,"Exciting, Colourful and Vibrant",5.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Little India. There are many similarities to Chinatown with the myriad of small shops, the restaurants, markets, decorated streets and the vibrant colours of festival decorations on Serangoon Road. Visit a temple, or the two major stores in the area, see the colourful shops and the Indian community as they go about their daily life. There is an exuberance here, there are heady aromas of foods and, of course, the welcoming smiles. Plenty of bargains and a wide variety of merchandise to tempt or sit at a local restaurant and enjoy a drink and the view."
,,Terrible experience!,1.0,,"I love Hindu culture so I was so excited to visit the Indian neighborhood but the truth was that there was nothing cultural to see, just a lot of Indian people everywhere (well, Indian men, there was just 1 woman out of 100 men), everything was totally caothic, dirty and nothing interesting to see. Entering the shops was totally impossible due to the crazy crowd that was inside of each of them. In general I felt overwhelmed and I don't recommend it (especially if you are a woman... you will not feel very comfortable there)."
,,"Vibrant, Colourful and Friendly",5.0,,"The sights and smells are amazing, not to mention the colours all around. This is a taste of India not to be missed. The markets stock an array of beautiful Saris and other clothing, as well as the daily fare of the locals, fish, fresh vegetables, fresh herbs etc. It‚Äôs a really interesting place that is not manufactured for tourists but a snap shot of life. Sample the food in the markets sold by the hawkers, fresh, tasty and cheap."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"You feel you are in India, lots of people, very nice temples with people worshipping their gods and really nice foor. A must to visit..."
,,Vist India without leaving Singapore,5.0,,"For something different to the high end retail, a walk along Serangoon Rd from
little India MRT station gives an experience not to be missed. Hundreds of small retail shops with goods inside , outside and all around, as well as a multitude of Indian eateries makes this area a must see"
,,India not in India.,4.0,,"What a gem this bustling area of the city is and well worth a visit.
Loads of different size shops and markets including the Mustafa's department store open 24/7 every day of the year.
Will always remember the sights and wonderful smells
The temple is fantastic. Well worth a visit."
,,Buzzing with activities..,4.0,,"The famous Mustafa centre is in this area.
Scores of Indian restaurants offering all kinds of Indian food are situated in this area.
Three big temples, Srinivasa Perumal, Vadapathrakali and Madhurakali are situated here. Serangoon road‚Äô main areas can be accessed from Little India as well Farer Road metro stations.
All categories of Hotels are available for stay.
The whole Serangoon road was beautifully lit up for the forthcoming Deepavali festival.
A must visit place in Singapore.

,,Little piece of India,4.0,,"Little India is an area in Singapore that has many shops, restaurants and cafes that make you feel as if you are in India. It is a small representation of India.

There are some colourful buildings too. The area has a buzz of vibrancy. It is worth a visit to see the sights, sounds and smells of Indian culture.

You can spend a couple of hours just seeing the way of life here. I saw a few jewelry shops selling many types of Indian jewelry. Boutique shops sell the latest Indian garments and fabrics. There is also a wonderful aroma of Indian cooking as there are many Indian cafes and restaurants.

i would recommend a visit for the experience."
,,Bustling with flavours of India,4.0,,"Little India ‚Äì a delicious mix of ethnic colors, tastes, smells and a curious cacophony of Indian music, temple bells and varied accents. It‚Äôs a delightful rush, especially if you‚Äôre not accustomed to eastern cultures."
,,Lots to See,5.0,,This area is vibrant with trendy cafes and so many shops and cafes. The shops are interesting from trendy boutiques with totally different goods for sale to the Indian fabric shops which had an amazing selection and good prices for quality fabric. Owners of the fabric stores were friendly but not too pushy and we enjoyed the whole time we were there.
,,Vibrant neighbourhood,4.0,,"The neighbourhood has a vibrant atmosphere. Some of the smaller streets are more run down than other neighbourhoods and are not geared to tourists, which makes them all the more interesting. Indian culture is pervasive, in the eateries and restaurants, and in the many shops which are run by and patronised by the Indian population. The huge Mustafa Centre sells a vast of array of goods (including clothing, fresh and processed food, electronic goods, jewellry and much more), and is worth a visit if only for the experience."
,,Authentic and lively,4.0,,Little India has atmosphere and colour. The streets have some lovely old houses and are full of bustle. It is a more satisfying experience than China Town.
,,Almost India,5.0,,"Anytime in Singapore you miss home food, please run to Little India and you will be home sick no more. All things Indian are clustered in a few streets blocks here and what's more there is the legendary 24 hours shopping experience called Mustafa here too. So enjoy!"
,,Felt like another country - amazing,4.0,,"Wow this place was so unexpected - little India is actually a long street with lots of little alleys teaming with Indian shopping, eating and colour. I am not sure if it is always this vibrant but it is the build up to Deepavali when we visited so it felt busy. The decorations were amazing, the ladies in beautiful sari‚Äôs, the jewellery stores and restaurants - all we were missing was the constant sound of horns tooting and we could have been in India. Worth a visit for a hour or two, have lunch and enjoy watching the people passing by."
,,Not for Everyone,1.0,,This was included in our City tour and we weren't a fan but if thats what you want to see for 15 mins go for it but we stayed near the busü§î
,,A great area for wandering . . .,4.0,,". . . and sampling tasty food. So many interesting eating places to choose from plus Mustafa, a shopping centre selling just about everything from jewellery to hardware and a fascinating market."
,,For a bit of Indian shopping and a taste of India,4.0,,Just the place for taste of India. Was craving for a bit of the spicy curry after a week in Beijing. Good restaurants and in case you need something Indian or sub continental. This is your place!
,,Interesting cultural experience,4.0,,Never would I have thought that I would find a place like this in Singapore with open stories selling vegetable and fruits etc. I have been to India but coming here was a very unique experience.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I love how in Singapore you can immerse yourself in each of the cultures and feel like you've stepped into another country. We loved Little India - such a contrast to modern singapore - we visited on a weekend, it was super hot, dirty, crowded, noisy, temples, temples, temples. so much colour, the aroma of the food, markets, lights (if you time your visit right) and cheap cheap shopping................... just go!"
,,A place dedicated to the Indian community in Singapore,5.0,,"Little India is the home to the ethnic Indian community in Singapore that is popular for their temples, great eateries, traditional Indian clothing shops, flower shops, provision shops and for all your shopping needs. There is a wide variety of souvenir shops as well if you are a tourist and would like to get some gifts to take back with you.

If your are in the area, you must visit the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, dine at Apollo Banana Leaf (Race Course Road), visit Tekka market (2nd level) to buy some traditional Indian clothes and ultimately head down to Mustafa Centre which is a 24 hour shopping centre that sells almost anything you can think of! Mustafa Centre is one of the more prominent shopping centres for tourists!"
,,A taste of Indian culture and heritage in Singapore,4.0,,"A good segment of the Singapore population is of Indian descent. So it is not surprising that there is an area replete with everything Indian (culture, clothes, food, artworks, etc). It is very accessible, just look for the Little India station."
,,Really disappointed,1.0,,"Was expecting an area as good as Chinatown or the Arab Street area and was really disappointed. We visited here 1 night, the area is dirty and quite intimidating. Not as relaxed and welcoming as the other 2 areas just dirty streets, shops selling cheap tat and streets full of the local men hanging around where the other areas appear far more family friendly."
,,It was ok,3.0,,"Like another reviewer we may have gone at the wrong time, but we found it to be grimy, dirty and poorer cousin to other areas in Singapore. We also found that teh male population out numbered the ladies 3:1 and to be honest we felt the locals were just staring at us constantly. Didnt make us feel safe at all. Wouldnt hurry back there to be honest."
,,good,4.0,,a very good area to find in singapore everything from india very good india food all around worh the visit
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Maybe we went at the wrong time as we found it to be just a busy grimy poorer part of town full of shops selling cheap junk with hardly any cultural significance at all. Compared to chinatown and kampong glam, little India is not worth the time."
,,"The best, cheapest biryani!!",5.0,,"We loved seeing the hawkers markets for fruit and veg, curries, desserts and drinks! Over whelming choice of foods, cheap, loud vibrant atmosphere, completely safe, everyone is friendly and happy. Traditional, markets for clothes upstairs. The streets are active and great to wander around."
,,Authentic Flavour of India,4.0,,"Little India is the real thing, definitely not a contrived tourist ‚ÄúDisney‚Äù version.

Avoid the weekends unless you like throngs of people. Lots of small inexpensive restaurants with tasty food everywhere. There is a Hindu temple that is large and colourful. Shopping is also good, with very competitive and probably the best prices in Singapore. The Mustafa Centre is a giant shop stretching 3 city blocks where you can find EVERYTHING at arguably the best prices in town. Great place to change money as well.

Very good access to and from Little India with the mrt. Both the yellow and purple lines are a relatively short walk from Mustafa‚Äôs which is at the heart of Little India.

Have fun!"
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"Nice time walking around this neighbourhood. A riot of colour and aromas wherever you look, along with colonial Indian architecture which is really pushed up against the ultra-modern city."
,,Wander around to take in the sights and sounds.,4.0,,"One of the variety of ethnic neighborhoods in Singapore, Little India offers the visitor a splendid array of sights and sounds including Hindu temples, markets, jewelry shops and colorful decorations. You'll be amazed by the shops that sell floral arrangements and garlands that are used to decorate homes and provide offerings at the temples. I was there near the time that the Indians celebrate Diwali, so the neighborhood was decorated in style."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Wow, your senses are immediately aroused but the wonderful smell of all the spices and exotic fruits. It certainly is a feast for the eyes and nose. There are streets of produce and stalls selling all sorts. The whole place is a buzz with life. You can get there very easily by using the underground. There is plenty of tasty cheap food available. There is a department store which I have never seen the like of, its over 4 floors and sells absolutely everything and it is unbelievably huge. A good day out."
,,Was ok,3.0,,We visited China Town then Little India and we enjoyed China Town better maybe because it was streets with no traffic with stalls either side of the street whereas Little India wasn't lije that and the street was quite busy with traffic....maybe we didn't look in the right places .. was ok but preferred China Town.
,,Brilliant place,5.0,,"Great to visit, take in the shops, sounds and smells of the area at leisure, with plenty of bars etc available"
,,Experience the Taste of India in the City,5.0,,"You can visit this place for Food , shopping and many other attractive things in Surroundings, one of the best Traditional Area to visit , easy accessible"
,,Culture! A must do. Great vibe. Really feels like your in India.,4.0,,"Culture! A must do. Great vibe. Really feels like your in India.
If you want to learn more about Indian culture then you must visit this traditional area. There is the temple which is very pretty and Tan Teng Niah residence, shopping and lot's of Indian food, clothes and jewellery. You can also have henna done ladies! Felt like we were in India. Busy area with great vibe! Big and lot's to see."
,,The most economical place to live in Singapore,4.0,,I have decided to visit my good friend Mr. Felix during my stay in Hong Kong. He warmly welcomed me and helped to find a good place to have a living room which was Little India. Little India is very economical and has plenty of restaurants with Pakistani and India Food(might be due to the reason that this area has plenty of central asian people). It was really a great experience to live there. Would love to visit again Singapore/Little India :)
,,Save the Fare to Mumbai!,4.0,,"If you want a taste of India without the hustle bustle or Delhi Belly then this might be for you! Similar sights n sounds and food but without the honking of horns or cows wandering the streets. Bargains to be had with similar haggling but most of all - colour! Colour everywhere! That is something that sets India apart and here it is in Singapore. You could treat it as kind of a holiday within a holiday... like ‚Äòkilling two birds with one stone‚Äô only there is no killing involved or birds or stones for that matter ...just fun, joy and colour... without an extra air fare!"
,,Don't bother,1.0,,"A stark contrast to the rest of the Singapore Streets. It was dirty and full of shops selling either Indian Gold or cheap, poor quality souvenirs and other crap.
Found a street with a few lithe restaurants and tried out some Tikka Marsala and Naan. The staff were nice but we've had better Indian food back in Australia.
Singapore has much more to offer, don't waste your time on this."
,,Place for food,4.0,,We came here to visit Aroma restaurant for a good curry then had a short walk around the area after eating. It is very colourful at night. Lots of flower garlands on sale and vegetable stalls. It was bustling.
,,Dirty,1.0,,Out side a cafe was a dying pigeon being stalked by a scabby cat. Piles of rotting vegetgables in the the street and cigarette ends every where. Run down and smelly ..... Avoid.
,,Go for the food in Little India,4.0,,"A couple of streets where you can see traditional shops, colorful houses and temples, and you can enjoy Indian food, and Indian sweets. You must try them. Spicy is a characteristic of the food. And do not forget to taste the Indian beer."
,,Underwhelming,2.0,,"Underwhelmed at the experience, felt there wasn't much to do, very crowded, didnt feel authentic, wouldn't rush back and wouldn't say it was a 'must-see' if visiting Singapore."
,,Not a must-see,2.0,,"I don't think that Little India is authentic - I experienced Indian cities to be very different! It's not like in real India, so if you've ever been there, not need to visit Little India."
,,Bustling place..,4.0,,Very crowded shopping strip..Mustafa is a must but be prepared to navigate the sections as you get easily lost!!. Indian shopping paradise...! U get almost everything..
,,"loved visitng this area, was bustling with life and food choices were great",5.0,,"This is a version of India... everything Indian that you want you will find here, there are great vegetarian restaurants and lots of fresh fruit and veges on offer... I loved walking around the local market too, lots of cotton goods and trinkets, I would definitely visit here again on a trip to Singapore..."
,,"Filthy, horrible, a waste of time.",1.0,,"A complete waste of time. Skip it. Expect to feel sick from the horrid stench, be constantly heckled, walking through rubbish and filth all over the streets. The only interesting thing was the buildings and architecture, however this is not unique to little India. After all that, the shops offer nothing unique, and the prices are not very reasonable. We walked through 7 or 8 streets, then we were luck enough to find a taxi to get us out of there. A complete waste of time, I wish we had of spent doing something else."
,,Very reminiscent of actual India,2.0,,"I know it's called little India, but you'd think that since it's in Singapore, that they'd keep it clean."
,,Don't go out of your way,3.0,,"Little India was quite dirty in comparison to the rest of Singapore. Ok to wander around if you have time but I wouldn't go out of my way. The Mustafa Centre is an older style shopping centre crammed with just about everything you can think of. We ate at the Tekka markets which had many food options. Just not the cleanest place. In saying that it was delicious and we didn't get sick, so all good"
,,"Waste of time , not a lot there",2.0,,"We went on the tube but wasn‚Äôt as good as photos , not a lot there a few shops we stayed a few mins and left , don‚Äôt bother"
,,Very cool experience,5.0,,"I brought my family here after living in Singapore before for high school, and honestly they had the best time! We bought Knick nacks and fabric, ate yummy food and really enjoyed our selves"
,,Glorious Spicy food,4.0,,"We visited the Tekka market, upstairs were beautiful garments and downstairs is the food Hawker market. Authentic Indian spicy curries both Veg and non vegetarians. Biryanis were tasty and Very cheap. Try fresh coconuts to cool the spice and chilli. Few nice Indian restaurants on the Main Street Banana leaf, and Komla villas have excellent choice of meals."
,,Did we miss something.,2.0,,"After hearing so many people talk up Little India we were left very underwhelmed by our visit. Maybe we turned left when we should have turned right, but there wasn‚Äôt all that much to see other than a few cheap shops, some Indian restaurants, a bunch of constructions sites and a whole lot of delivery trucks."
,,Remnants of old Singapore,4.0,,"Original buildings and temples are of interest combined with gold shops, spice shops and shops of a general nature."
,,Excellent location for Indian visitors,5.0,,visited this place again in July this year and quite amazed at the choices they have for indian food and shopping.
,,Mustaffas,5.0,,"We visited Little India in January, we had a lovely day wandering about and had a good old shop through Mustaffas Shopping centre. Wow it is a street long. Has everything you could possibly want or need to buy. Hubby bought lots of clothes. There is such a fantastic selection of everything. It's on our list again when we go back next Jan. Can highly recommend a trip there for a day. Lots of places to eat."
,,Little India Singapore,4.0,,"As the name says.. it is a ""Little India"". Singapore has 4 main races - Chinese / Malay / Indian / Caucasian. So this is one place worth a visit... Besides the all the restaurants, food court and cafes there are lots of shopping. Mustafa Center opens 24 hours and one can get anything from this place.. However, try not to go to this area on a Sunday...cos the place will even smells like India..."
,,Eclectic and Diverse Neighborhood worth a visit,5.0,,"Little India is totally worth a visit. So much to see, do, experience and eat. Mustafa Center is fascinating - it's like Indian Was-Mart. The streets of Little India have beautiful architecture, colorful buildings, tons of interesting shops with spices, gold, textiles and so much more. There are restaurants everywhere with delicious Indian food from various regions. And there is a gorgeous street art on the sides of many buildings. I highly recommend finding some of the murals as they make for great Instagram photos. They're usually in side streets and alley ways. This is great area to just wander and be surprised by the diversity and variety. There is so much more to Singapore than MBS and downtown."
,,Not top of places to visit,3.0,,"It's in old part of Singapore. The temples are interesting, colorful and authentic. Many restaurants with southern and north Indian cuisine. Health standards might be a little suspect."
,,Multi cultural singapore,5.0,,"If u never been to india and wanna see what India is like (in a safer mode) do come to little India right here in Singapore. Easily accessible via MRT (little India station). Authentic north n south Indian food, herbs and spices, gold and all things Indian. U will definitely feel like u in India. Also, Mustafa is 24hrs offering everything u may need at a cheap price (But do question the authenticity). The indian part of a Multicultural Singapore. Arab street for Malay. Chinatown for Chineses."
,,Interesting if you have never been to India,3.0,,"If you have never been to India this is what is it like. I did not feel that I experienced anything of historical significance except noticing this is one section of Singapore with restrictions on the consumption of alcohol. The story behind that fact is interesting but not really all that important.

As another reviewer stated and I agree ‚ÄúThis area is nothing special for most tourists ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶....OK place for Indian food‚Äù"
,,A different world,4.0,,"You take the metro and you find yourself in a world miles and miles away. It's Indian territory inside the little Singapore. You can enjoy the atmosphere, the temples, the mosques and if you are lucky you may attend the indian new year celebrations with flowers, decorations and dancing."
,,Almost like India,4.0,,"I love the smells, atmosphere and feel of this place, just like being in India. Good shopping good food, spent a few hours just wandering around. Awesome place"
,,Buzzing,4.0,,"Loved the vibe of Little India, real life on the streets, a hub of activity with powerful sensory perceptions. Diversity is everything isn't it?"
,,Authentic enclave,5.0,,"An authentic enclave from the early days of Singapore. Store holders extend their wares onto the pavements, local ethnic inhabitants make their purchases and dine in this area, a great tourist destination to actually view how the local inhabitants go on with their daily lives. No visible signs of guides waving folders, buntings and papers to an obedient group of tourists following closely behind. Loads of authentic Singaporean Indian restaurants and, an Aladdin's cave of sarees of different colours, shapes and sizes."
,,Indian in Singapore,5.0,,"Take the time and have a walk around and absorb all the colours and smells of Little India.
We ate in one of the little hawkers markets and had the best indian we have ever had.

,,A good experience,5.0,,"I enjoyed walking arounfw here taking in the sights, smells and Indian music. The restaurants are great and there is so much to take in. Well worth a bisitw, I think."
,,Group,4.0,,Tour group. Worth the walk through to see the colour and products. Need to begin to get a better price.
,,India in Singapore,4.0,,"The most chattery streets of the country, Little India in all true sense is. Smell of curry, Bollywood songs, bright colors and temples. Little India is a perfect place to be to get a taste of the culture and some enviable South Indian food."

,,Nothing to see,2.0,,"This area is nothing special for tourists. Walked a little around, but nothing special to visit. Ok place for Indian food."
,,"Loud, vivid, impressive",5.0,,"It's an impressive way of getting a first sight on how it must be in India. It's colourful, loud, vivid and there's the yummy smell of food everywhere. Absolutely worth to visit."
,,Below Par...Kindly avoid,2.0,,"There's nothing for tourist except for Indian Tourist craving for Desi food. If interested on Home Related Grossary Shopping, its the place for you"

,,Cheap Hotels? This Is The Place To Go To,5.0,,"Singapore hotel rates are really on the high side. If there is one place in Singapore that you can head to for cheaper alternatives, Little India is the place to go to. It is a unique place with very interesting cultures and shops and also religious worship places. Lots of nice Indian groceries and food too. Make sure you take a little time and visit this place."
,,Communal Area for Indians Living in Singapore,4.0,,"During our trip to Singapore we visited little India to explore and try food. Little India is full of shops selling Indian groceries, fresh vegetables and fruits, spices, souvenirs, electronics and what not. There are some temples and lots of good Indian restaurants. Then there is Tekka Center with food stalls, fish mongers, butchers and groceries stores. Just walking around the area, you will feel like you are in some part of India.

Little India is more like a communal area for Indian people living in Singapore. Here is where Indian people come to get their vegetables, spices, clothes etc. On a given day nothing much is happening (except usual bustling and crowding) but during festival you will a chance to see decorations, processions and try special food.

We had generally positive experiences with food and shopping in Little India."
,,Great value and tasty treats,5.0,,Good place to shop and sample the delicious food on display. Spent a whole day there recently and it wasn‚Äôt enough. A definite when visiting Singapore.
,,Cheap hotels and food,4.0,,Singapore is itself the expensive country to visit but if you are looking for the cheap stay and food . Than go for little india as you will find grocery or food items for cheap prices . In malls the price of small water bottle is 4 dollars but in Little india its 1 dollars. You can find some great food courts for 5 dollar/person in tekka center near little india
,,Can be avoided,3.0,,"I heard a lot of Little India but on reaching there, i didn't find it that good coz the few areas were stinking and apart from Vegetable shops where one can find almost all kinds of vegetables and that too quality vegetables, the place couldn't attacract me much."

,,Disappointed,3.0,,Got a taxi to little India as we had heard it was a place of interest and to go in the evening but I was disappointed as there was nothing really there apart from a few shops
,,A great place to visit!,5.0,,"Little India is another must-visit itinerary whether you're a Singaporean or a tourist. It's a place where most people of South Indian origin congregates. The place is lively and you can find whatever Indian spices you need at reasonable prices. When you're there, it's as though you've soaked in the atmosphere of being in Chennai with all things Indian. Worth a visit. Great shopping spot too."
,,"Little India, new experience",3.0,,"It was our first time visiting Little India, while strolling around House of Tan Teng Niah. It was very hot when we were there. If you are looking for any stuff that is related with India and its culture, then you should visit this place."
,,Complete disappointment,1.0,,"Honestly walked about 1 1/2 hours trying to find the ""happening"" areas, but nothing...Lots of colorful clothing for sale, but nothing, nothing else to see or do. Very disappointing."
,,Another part of Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore is a multicultural city and as such visiting Little India should be on the itinerary for the tourist coming to visit the city. Little India is vibrant, full of eateries, shops and a few temples. Spend a few hours and enjoy some good shopping and some great food."
,,Horrible,1.0,,"If this is little India I would hate to go to the the real India . Smelly , dirty and unclean . Singapore is a lovely clean vibrant place little India isn‚Äôt. Go to china town instead ."

,,Colourful and vibrant!,5.0,,"Do we really want to walk about when the temperature is over 30 degrees?
Of course, do not miss it when you visit Singapore.
Busy pavements and alleys lead you to wonderful little stalls.
Take time to buy some clothes. I got a suit made up. Great material, stylish and a decent price.
Have some food.
Take time to stick around and come back for the place to come alive at night."
,,Little India,3.0,,"I wasn‚Äôt very impressed with my visit to little India. The smells were very overwhelming and the area was under quite a bit of construction and was kind of dirty. The second time I went back was much better hen the first as we had a local show us around to the best parts. The buildings are all fun colors and there are decorations hanging from all of the telephone wires all the time.

I enjoyed visiting during deepavali as there was a long week festival with lots of vendors and fun shows and different events going on every day. Other then this time there was never really much to do other then a couple of fun temples and some street art.

When in little India I would advise finding a little bakery and trying the kaju barfi, it‚Äôs just a small little dessert made from cashews with a layer of silver on it, hands down my favorite part of going to little India. Sooo good and cheap"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Lacked any kind of atmosphere to make up for the run down buildings, maybe your supposed to go on a night, we like the old bits of the city but after a 20min walk around desperately trying to find a hidden jem or something to make this place worth the visit we left."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"I really loved little India, was one of my favourite neighbourhoods in Singapore. So colourful and vibrant!"
,,Another interesting part of Singapore,4.0,,"This area is easy to walk around and provides lots of things to look at such as fabrics, rugs and tailors. Lots of incense burning."
,,The greatest unspoiled unsaniteed jewel of singapore,5.0,,"Little india stands out in its raw, rough , in tthe core sense, and real authenticity. It's alive and kicking and .......real , it is still human, not spoiled by so called modern ideas. Compare the life of this area to a totally spoiled , sanitesed chinatown. We them knew both and loved them both in the raw originals, but now only little india remain as the last jewel, stronghold and bastion Go on little india and make us feel human among human less crouching technology of the type l1984 and brave new world.... ull of orinal buildings, plenty ofiversified wares and thefau Mutafa. Center, ttaou ime to savourvthis unique atmosphere.."
,,Pure Filth,1.0,,"What astounded me was how filthy dirty this part of Singapore is. The country prides itself on clean and green......then there is Little India. I don't know how it is allowed. Rubbish litters the streets, the smell is vile and the walkways are un even and cluttered. Not very welcoming at all, go to little China instead!!"
,,An India Away from India,4.0,,"Little India is where the tourists from (big) India flock when in Singapore :-). You will feel instantly at home at this place. Never for a moment, will you realize that you are in Singapore when visiting Little India.

Indian tourists mainly (should) visit this place for two BIG reasons

1) A variety of Indian Restaurants around this place (including vegetarians only restaurants )
2) Mustafa Centre : (a Super Market On Steroids!! :-)). There is nothing that you will not find at Mustafa Center!! This is truth and not an exaggeration. Even the best supermarkets in India are not so well stocked and Versatile as the Mustafa Center in Singapore.
For Indian tourists , a suggestion would be to visit Little India and Mustafa Centre as the First thing when you visit Singapore. Since it's going to be a short visit, you can buy all the provisions you need (included Bottled Water/Snacks...etc...whatever) at Mustafa center for the rest of your stay at an extremely reasonable price.

I should also make a mention of a small (non-descript) Restaurant called Handi (close to Mustafa centre, towards Kitchener road), where we had one of our best dinner/lunches. It serves both Vegetarian and Non vegetarian dishes and the guys there are super friendly and extremely helpfu. We even got the dinner parceled to have it back at Hotel Room where we were staying for the Singapore Trip.

In short, Little India is one place you WILL visit when in Singapore."
,,Old and New,3.0,,After 18 hours a travel I walked from my Guest House to Little India. I was tired when I arrived but Little India has a wonderful assault on the senses. Visually it is a wonderful part of the city and one shouldn't miss seeing the temples or shops. Lots of small places to get something to eat. A walk of discovery. Don't miss seeing this part of Old Town with new elements.
,,Smell of Spices,4.0,,"LITTLE INDIA

Sir Raffles while setting up Singapore City in early 1800 AD planned for separate enclaves for Indian, Chinese & Malay origin people. Indians were located at Little India.
Indian population is dominated by those from Southern India, mainly TN. Other sections live at inter mixed areas of the Enclave.
By now a large compact part of LI houses migrants from BD, about One Million of them. They are mainly engaged in unskilled odd jobs, shop keeping and of course running Eateries.
Sometimes back unprecedented rioting took place here over accidental death of a construction labour. Buses were torched, shops looted in LI. 23 people were wounded. Government came down heavily on law breakers by arresting, prosecuting, deporting many immigrants. Afterwards several restrictions were imposed on gathering of people in open areas, sale & consumption of liquor etc. Though the rioting was largely spearheaded by BDs, image of Indian communities were tarnished.
LI is a popular destination of Tourists from Kolkata, mainly for hopping at Mustafa Super Mart, cheap Gift items at roadside stalls and finally for Dal, Bhat aar Eleesh Mach (Hilsa Fish)."
,,Morning Visit,4.0,,We enjoyed our time in Little India. The shops and food stands reminded us of our trips to India proper.
,,Men only zone - do no recommend,1.0,,"We went because we heard the area would be great for food. We started going there just before dusk and it was just me and my boyfriend. We have never felt so uncomfortable going somewhere, there were no women for an entire road and there were just very large groups of men everywhere. The streets were really dirty and wasn‚Äôt like the rest of Singapore. We were stared at by almost everyone and I kept getting stared at but we tried to ignore it. The restaurants all did smell amazing and that‚Äôs why we wanted to go, to try the food but because of all the looks and staring (especially at my body - this was the worst as they didn‚Äôt care that we saw them looking at my body they just carried on staring) we instantly took the train into Chinatown where we felt a lot more relaxed and not being looked at.

Very disappointing experience, definantly would not go again and just a shame as the restaurants did smell really good. Would only recommended for large groups of people and not women going on their own or couples."
,,Cultural goodness!,5.0,,"Food, clothing, flowers, herbs! So delish! A senses overload! we got curry above the wet market ... and lots of drinks! Does get a little smelly from the butchery, but it‚Äôs local and very cool. Stroller around for a while looking at shops and made our way down to the mosque and temples."
,,An amazing place I hope endures!,5.0,,A unique place that my hotel happened to be right next to! The food is amazing and there is tons of shopping to do. Modest dress is a must in general but especially if visiting temples. People are nice and will help with directions!
,,Mini India in Singapore,4.0,,Little India is full of wonderful alleys shops and restaurants. You really think you are in India. Lots to wander and find interesting surprises. Be prepared to bargain if you buy souvenirs. During Deepawali the street light display makes the street a magic wonderland. Go in the evenings as it is too hot in the day. Worth wandering around
,,Where are all the women??!!,2.0,,"Visited Little India today (15 June 2018) in the early evening. I honestly didn't think that much of it. Yes, it's different to the rest of clean/sanitised Singapore, so certainly feels like you're in another part of the city. But is it really like India? No, not particularly. India is much busier, more chaotic and far dirtier (and full of cows pooing everywhere).
What bothered me the most about Little India was the lack of women. I went to see the Tan Teng Niah, and the whole surrounding square and eateries were filled with men. As a lone woman walking around at dusk I am very conscious of my surroundings, and I saw only one other woman the whole time I was in that particular area (also a tourist, but she was with a male companion). I wasn't hassled and didn't feel unsafe per se, but I can't say I was all that comfortable being the sole female surrounded by hundreds of men (this seemed to be a common theme across most of the streets of Little India I walked around... for every 1 women there were 100 men, apart from some women in jewellery and fashion stores).
The Mustafa Centre is interesting to walk through due to the sheer volume of items they have for sale, but the prices aren't cheap so don't go here expecting to find a bargain.
To be honest, the Arab quarter is much nicer and I recommend going to Bussorah Street and Haji Lane (Kampong Glam)."
,,It was ok......,3.0,,We went there and what really surprised us was the sudden change from ‚ÄúSingapore‚Äù to little India. Little India is simply more messy. Was it interesting to see the fruits and vegetables offered... yes but that was about it. We will not come back
,,Food is delicious!!,5.0,,Really delicious food- the best samosas I have ever tasted! So well organised and well run! Very impressed!!
,,Terrible smell,1.0,,"We visited here and couldn't stand the smell. Not sure if it's incense or something else, but we were only able to walk up and down the block once and had to leave. The smell was so strong it gave me a migraine. It just permeated everything, all the merchandise they had for sale. I can't imagine buying something from here like nothing only to carry that smell home. Not a place I want to return to."
,,Curried and colourful heaven,4.0,,"This town is one of the cultural variations that only Singapore has. Colour, old buildings from 19 centuries, and different people. There are lots of different aroma too, from their different meat in curry. Must have curry from one of the stalls.. there are taps to wash your hands too. There is a big department store called Mostafa, and you will see all types of food and goods that are popular in Singapore (other than food, stuff is not cheap though, most likely Australian price)"
,,Awesome place for shopping,4.0,,"Stayed near little india during our Singapore tour which was a good decision considering the market..mustafa shopping mall, indian food joints. Overall we did not face any challenge in getting indian food. Even the little india market is very cheap and affordable . Also the stuff like bags, artificial jewellery and chocolate are good."
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,Singapore is a mixing pot of a place with a range of cultures on view. Little India is a great place for a wander to soak in the atmosphere. Try a banana leaf fish head curry while you are there - you will not be disappointed
,,Colourful Little India,3.0,,"Little India is a place which is very colourful all the buildings were painted in different colours. Some corners of the entire area were pathetic, dirty and having bad smell down there. You can have the variety of Indian food spl South Indian food there at reasonable prices. The place is very similar to Indian places. You can shop for various Indian items there. 3-4 hours is sufficient to visit the place."
,,Feeling like in India,4.0,,"Many shops selling products for the Indian community: fruits and vegetables from India, Indian sarry, Indian foods, etc... This is a place to visit if you are in Singapore."
,,Good place to shop,4.0,,Stopped off here on a tour. Very colorful and the smells from the flowers and spices were amazing. I brought some spices and a curry mix to try when I get home. The shops had lots of interesting items to buy. The people were so friendly.
,,GREAT !!,5.0,,"Great neighbourhood, like it says ; Little India ; exactly what it is, nice atmosphere, nice people, nice food and nice prices !"
,,Great place for worship and shopping,5.0,,"Little India, Singapore gives a feeling of the Indianness, has good choice of Indian restaurants, temples and shopping, still the old world charm can be felt in this place, You can also see heritage buildings.This is a must visit place whilst you are at Singapore"
,,A clean India out of India,3.0,,"As the indian community comprises somethimg like 5% of the population they deserve to be represented in their own way. Really a taste of india, but in much cleaner and less compacted way."
,,Rich in historical values,5.0,,"It felt like been in India again. The little India has Just few streets but you can find stanning Indu temple, many spicy stores, costumes, arts, authentic food and delicious indian sweeties."
,,Interesting contrast,5.0,,"After visiting a modern and futuristic center of Singapore, Little India is an interesting contrast, poorer but picturesque. Good restaurants, interesting temples, not very expensive shopping."
,,A contrast to the rest of Singapore.,3.0,,"It was interesting I guess. The rest of SIngapore is so clean and organised; yet not far from ‚Äôcity centre‚Äô is Little India which by comparison to the rest of Singapore, is chaotic, dirty and really not that pleasant.
But then again it does live up to its name and does present a sense of what a visit to India (proper) is like.
Would I recommend it for a visit? I am not sure - but we did, kept an open mind and took it in as part of our overall multi-cultural experience called ‚ÄòSingapore‚Äô."
,,A feel of India and its arts,4.0,,"Its like a small city in a city, this place is wonderful. We rode a MRT going to this place and as we got out, I felt the India feeling in this place. The people, arts, living, food and shrines are indeed a unique setting. Traffic here however is good compared to the real India place. Beautiful architecture and tasty food are some of its greatest features here. In a mini market here, indian music is playing. Small stores often offers discounts on their dry goods. A must visit place in Singapore to stroll and take pictures."
,,"why did i go here, its not good enough for singapore",2.0,,"yes, well we went, wish we didnt. we went from style and clean to grung and dirty. this was not what we expected in singapore. if i wanted this i would have gone to india. its singapore, enjoy singapore and cross this off the trip, if you want india, go there"
,,You will get India feeling,3.0,,"Little India is true to its name. You can feel that you are in Chennai or Madurai with south style temples, veg food, street vendors etc. dont miss to visit Mustafa center and MTR hotel for authentic Mangalore style food."
,,Food looks good,4.0,,We were too early to eat - hadn‚Äôt long had breakfast but the restaurants looked great. And cheap. Some element are a bit kitsch but I‚Äôd recommend it for a visit.
,,A 'must visit' place,4.0,,If you are from India and can't live without Indian Food - find out hotel in this location or nearby. You will get all types of different Indian Cuisine and of course Mustafa shopping arcade.
,,Good shopping market,4.0,,About 5000 shops are there everything is available at reasonable prices very good place for shopping
,,Very interestng taste of India without the hustle and bustle of India,4.0,,"Went to little India on a stop over to India in 2016 ,but it was very crowded due to the festival of Dwallii . But the last time I went it was an actual vist to Singapore in 2018. There wasn't the crowds and it was interesting. Loved the market and the food hall,we had beautuful pancake like food for breakfast with chia tea .Visited the temple,got henna tatoos and bought a couple of things .Easy to get to on the train ,but we stayed nearby just off Serangoon Rd."
,,Experience a taste of India and shopping!,4.0,,"This place is great if you're looking to go for some cheap but rare finds, or looking for souvenirs."
,,Little india,4.0,,Amazing experience! If you are a indian food lover will get it their in very reasonable price. Must visit and enjoyed
,,Good Indian Food and Cheap,5.0,,"This is a great place for eating and eating, Good Indian Food and Cheap price compare to outside little India. a Must go!"
,,Can be skipped,3.0,,We went to little India on a Sunday. very crowded and we didn't spend much time in there. Probably should have visited on a weekday is the feedback we got from other travelers. There is some good architecture that you can have a look at and some nice areas for photographs but I think maybe an hour or two is more than enough to spend in little India.
,,Shopping and dinner,4.0,,"A quaint part of Singapore where Indians first settled in Singapore after a long boat trip from India. Lots of Indians stalls selling typical wares like flowers, groceries and spices and lots more. Restaurants with spicy curries served on banana leaves are a feature.
It's worth a visit to experience the smells, sights and mood."
,,Anand Bhavan. Singapore,4.0,,"We visited Anand Bhavan on the start of the Little India Area.
This is good veg south indian restaurant serve most of the South Indian dishes at reasonable prices in Singapore.
Moreover the Jain dishes also available with Jain Sambhar.
Only minus point is the place is non AC."
,,Many worker from India,4.0,,"I see many Indian community in here. There are many cheap hotels, food and instagramable locations for photo"
,,Waste of Time,2.0,,"Spend time seeing wonders of Singapore. If you're from India, eating and shopping at Little India is a waste of time, energy and money. Plus it's the dirtiest part of squeaky clean Singapore. The food is ok, clothes and stuff to buy are available everywhere in India. Enjoy the Chinese and other parts of Singapore."
,,Little India Big Experience,5.0,,"Little India is like stepping back in time. Wander through the back streets to marvel at the old temple and antiques. Then snatch a bargain at the market,drinking from a real coconut whilst bargaining at rock bottom prices.This is a place to be tempted and to indulge in the culinary delights of both Indian and Asian cultures.
Try on a Sari just for fun and make a swirl as the light bounces off and sparkles upon the real gold and gems placed neatly on your head and neck. It's all for sale! It's just for you to make the deal. Don't miss out on this truly magical place"
,,Great Hawker Stalls in Little India,5.0,,"I love visiting People's Park Complex and Chinatown Food Complex for fabulous hawker stalls.

But on this trip, we took a diversion to Little India. We enjoyed delicious Masala Dosai for SG1.50 and Barley Water for SG1.20. If you are going to Singapore just for the food (like we do), its incredibly cheap, especially if you frequent the hawker stalls. We now skip the hotel breakfasts and stock up on local fruit for a 10th of the price."
,,24 hours place,5.0,,"I'm amaze with this place, if you get some insomnia in Singapore, this is definitively the place that you have to visit, 24 hours mall, food court and activity"
,,Mustafa is a must-go!,5.0,,"Mustafa is a must-go for everyone, regardless where you are from. It is open 24/7 and it sells all kinds of things that you can imagine. I always enjoyed my shopping there!"
,,Easily avoided,1.0,,"Not sure why folks even categorize this as a tourist spot. This place sucks, sticks and is dirty. The famed Mutafa Center is a below grade shopping destination where folks folk to buy cheap and spurious items."
,,Very colourful and crowded place,3.0,,"Stayed in little India for 4 nights, plenty of restaurants around, mainly Asian food. But always very very busy, Stayed"
,,not for everyone,4.0,,very unusual place it doesn t seem to be in singapure. on the edge of the skyline you fund a small india. traditional clothes indian people everywhere with their traditions and uses. spices busy walk and traditions. very coloured houses . that s incredible
,,Wow!,4.0,,Fantastic local foods and market stalls. An interesting look at the large Indian population in Singapore. Absolutely beautiful culture and friendly people. Worth spending a few hours looking around!
,,The ‚Äòother side‚Äôof Singapore,3.0,,"We went to Little India and went into the Mustafa Centre, which was jam packed with people and goods. It was stifling! However, if you couldn‚Äôt find what you were looking for in there, it can‚Äôt be found. Tonnes of stuff. We were amazed, we could only see men in the streets in Little India, large groups of men congregated. Apparently this is the underbelly of Singapore where Indian men come to work and send money back to their families and have a very low level of income and living facilities. We looked at a few streets but we didn‚Äôt want to hang around too long, lots of Indian restaurants and merchants. We walked to the Bugis Centre (Mall) about 15 mins which is a ‚Äòwestern type‚Äô mall with many western shops and more. It was an experience, but one i won‚Äôt repeat. PS If you want to use the toilets in this area, take your own toilet paper with you, its not provided."
,,LOVELY HINDU TEMPLES,4.0,,The only reason we went to Little India was to see the Hindu Temples along Serangon Road and the colourful House of Tan Teng Niah.
,,Must see,4.0,,You can get a small feel of India here. Its very busy. The stalls are worth browsing. The stall and shop owners are very helpful and polite and speak good English. Everything is cheap and fair price.
,,Amazing,4.0,,Little india in singapore is a very nice place to go if you have a taste of indian culture.Someyimes ive even forgot that i was in singapour i thougt that i was in india.There is restaurants temples and even a mall
,,Ok to see,4.0,,"Went on a public holiday, so not sure if this is the norm or additionally busy. It was interesting visit and some good shops and buildings to visit and look at. Very crowded along the pathways in front of the shops. Wasn't bothered tooo much by hawkers and shop vendors . It is an area to se but I wouldn't get caught up and stressed if you missed it."
,,Another experience,4.0,,"Smaller buildings than elsewhere, colourful and dynamic. Another tropical storm curtailed our trip to the temple but we went into the culture centre off Campbell st."
,,Chaotic and Indian,4.0,,"This place is chaotic compared to other places of Singapore. It is a heaven for people wanting vegetarian food in Singapore, but the taste is quite okay type. Also the same packaged drink which costs 50 cents in India and it was also printed, I was charged 3 dollars. The place is not super clean compared to other parts of Singapore."
,,Notning special,3.0,,Nothing special to see. Just bazar with cheep clotes and many jewelery. We see one hinduistic temple but outside bechause was closed in noon time...working morning and evening. Many cheep indian and chinese cheap food.
,,You are in India in Singapore,4.0,,"You feel India when you walk the streets and can do lots of shopping in interesting shops. Anything from small things to gold. Temple and ""Elephant park""."
,,Unimpressed Dirty,2.0,,"It is right across from Sentral Station. Wasn‚Äôt impressed at all. No new fashions, expensive and the streets very dirty. Don‚Äôt waste your time. If you are heading to Singapore Little India there is quite impressive & reasonably priced."
,,For a moment we forget that wr r in Singapore,1.0,,Extremely crowded and dirty.we visited on a rainy day and it was a total disaster. Unless u r a fan of indian culture dont visit this area.however there are lot of indian food stalls where u can buy food at a cheeper price.
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"Shop like a local here. If you need something that you don‚Äôt want to spend a ton of money on at a regular mall store, than try here. Authentic food is available here which is what led us to explore this area"
,,Vibrant part city,4.0,,"Really a little india..garlands shops,south Indian and vegetarian foods,vegetables stalls and indian fashion on sale"
,,Street food and shopping!,5.0,,"If you are an Indian ,you must visit this place for food and street shopping .it has restaurants for both south and north Indian people. you can walk around and can have glimpse of Indian style, you can get there by metro .The Tekka Centre is famous in Little India and across the rest of Singapore for its large selection of hawker stall and variety of cheap clothes stalls."
,,Authentic,5.0,,"This area of Singapore is a must see area. You could be walking though Delhi! The stalls are worth browsing. The streets are filled with interesting aromas and festooned with flower and vegetable stalls. Some of the varieties of fruit and vegetables, I have never seen. The stall and shop owners are very helpful and polite and speak good English. One block specialised in gold jewellery"
,,Little India- Home feeling in foriegn land,3.0,,"Little India gives you the glimpse of all the local shops, restaurants, and hotels where one can have Indian food and feel at home. We can only see Indians over there and for some time we forgot that we are not in India. There is one huge mall called Mustafa centre which is a must visit for shopping, exchanging currencies and purchasing tourist SIM cards as it offers reasonable rates compared to others."
,,"Great place, would have liked to spent much more time here",4.0,,"Great place to walk around in, either during the day or night time. There is also a huge shopping mall here called Mustafa Centre which is open 24h (!) which I only saw a fraction of. We regretfully did not have enough time to explore it all but I did get to have one of my favourite dishes here, dosa, which brought my taste buds right back to Goa. Don't miss a visit here."
,,Full of Colour,4.0,,I find that one of the attractions of Singapore is the very many different cultural experiences you can have essentially within 10 minutes of so with each other. Our group stayed in Little India for one night during our Singapore visit before moving to Marina Square. Two different worlds. Little India is full of colour and spices and gold and has many fine restaurants. Worth visiting in Singapore
,,Special Ethnic tour,4.0,,"Do you Love people?
Are you qurious to learn about their colors, smells and tastes?
Visit 'Little India' region.
I recommand to start at afternoon. The time you can see tge workers come back home. The market becomes live again.
Religious seremony might start at the Temple.
(As ChainaTown - dont miss it)"
,,Beautiful houses,5.0,,"This area is other part of Singapore, we stayed one night at China town and two other nights moved to LIttle India, many shops and places to visit there, met local people and tasted their food. Many colourful houses, from our hotel we walked to Arab area - it was not quite far. Highly recommend to visit this place when you visit Singapore"
,,Shopping & experiencing little India,4.0,,"Brought a couple to experience the various places in Cosmopolitan Singapore.
We decided on Little India as you can get to see the rows of old double storeys shophouses and some of the conservation heritage.
You can also stopover at Mustapha Shopping Centre as it is the biggest shopping mall of few floors selling everything you name it, they have it. Provided you have time to browse through every nick and corner of this crowded Shopping Centre. At the same time gives you the feeling that you are like in an Indian city especially on Weekends.
Of course, you don‚Äôt get to see flies and mosquitos like in India. Here you will feel safer and it‚Äôs a totally different experience.
Prices of most products here are reasonable.
On the 2nd floor you can get branded toiletries and fragrances, medicines, health products etc etc.
Souvenir hunters can go to the 3rd floor for a large selection of choices. You can also shop for toys in the basement and also clothes for all ages including some brands items like Sportswear, imported Polo t-shirts, shirts etc etc.
On the 5th floor are also A very big supermarket where all kinds of imported as well as local products, are available.
Only thing is too many things and too narrow and cramp if it‚Äôs too overly crowded. But you get lots of bargain items.
Check the expiry dates on foodstuffs that you are buying including toiletries."
,,Little India stroll and eating,5.0,,"Great area to explore to experience the Indian side of Singapore: temples, shopping for saris, jewelry galore, produce, flowers and garlands galore. Huge number of vegetarian and other incredible dining options."
,,Little India,3.0,,"On the second day of my stay in Singapore, I went to see Little India. It is a very vibrant and colourful place. On one street I found amazing fruit and veggie stalls and I purchased some fresh Turkish Mangoes and red bananas. One can find many shops with Indian merchandise ranging from clothes, scarves, saris, jewelry, incense burners or tiny Budhha or Hindu deity statues. Price would be negotiable in some shops, people are friendly and most can converse in English, so communication wasn't an issue at all. You can have Indian food or drinks, I chose fresh coconut water for $2.50. Overall, it was a great joy to see such cultutal variation in Singapore's Little India."
,,Different experience within Singapore,4.0,,"For Indian or Bangladeshi people, you must go there if you want deshi foods. This part is different than the most part of Singapore, you you will realize when you go to the washroom there. But overall you will get an different experience."
,,A must see!,5.0,,"What a wonderful neighbourhood full of culture, vibrant colours and amazing food! I was lucky, my colleague is from India and he lived in Singapore so I had a real sneak peak and expert advice.
Best part of the day was to get a fresh coconut and sit under the colourful umbrella park and reflect. Makes me miss it now that I write about it!"
,,A touch of India,3.0,,"A beautiful day spent seeing,touching and tasting the different shades of India. I enjoyed shopping and eating there the most.Very busy but I loved the buzz! And Mustafa is open 24/7 which saved my life one morning at 3am.lol. You can't not go to Little India!"
,,Nothing special,3.0,,Easy access via MRT. Interesting Tekka Market with many stalls and eating options. Otherwise nothing special and there are more interesting activities in Singapore.
,,Its ok,3.0,,"This district is full with restaurants and many shops.They sell different items from clothes,souvenirs,jewelry, shoes and bags.Its cowded but you will discover a new area in singapore.Also its colored."
,,one time visit but don't spend long,3.0,,"Being an Indian I was fascinated with the name of the place so I visited this at the end of the day after walking for 6-8 miles in Gardens by the bay.
It was indeed a sight as the place looks like mini Chennai.
But not much to see otherwise.
If you want to have food there, you're welcome to try. Aroma is tempting.
Only concern - they don't accept cards only cash"
,,An interesting morning out.,3.0,,Little India is a great place to stroll through either early in the day time or later afternoon. It‚Äôs quite hot so we decided to venture here via the hop on and hop off bus you can get and enjoy what the place had to offer. Lots of wonderful jewellery shops and great places to eat. We did find however a lot of junk shops were saturating the streets here as well which was of no interest to us. Take advantage of the amazing fabrics and fashion designs on offer. We bought lots of colourful and beautiful pieces and very good prices. We did see there was a walking tour on offer too but we liked to stop and stroll at our own leisure and take in the temples and cultural delights. I do recommend to go earlier or later and stop for a bite to eat somewhere along the way in Little India if you like Indian spices and food. We enjoyed our morning here but wouldn‚Äôt go back unless specifically shopping for another beautiful Indian outfit or fabric.
,,Culture & Food,5.0,,"It's what it's nam3d after. Places full of indian food, people and of course their culture. I like this place because of the authentic indian food. No matter which shop you go. It's most definitely going to be nice. If unsure, head to a restaurant with a lot of people or long queue."
,,Little India Little haven,4.0,,"Great Hawker centres for authentic Indian food, locals are very friendly and it has a lovely safe and beautiful vibe about it."
,,Indian aspect of Singapore!,4.0,,Visited little India few months back. Tonnes of outlets serving Indian food. Worth visiting to get hold of Indian culture of Singapore!
,,Interesting goods to be found!,4.0,,Whilst in this area we visited the Sri Veeramakaliamman temple and this is well worth a visit. We had a look round the side streets the amount of goods for sale is just stunning - I think you could buy anything you want in this area! Be prepared to barter and know how much you will pay up to.
,,MINI INDIA !!!!!,5.0,,"This place got his name due to local Indian shops and restaurant available, you will find many similarities with Indian places and can try for shop souvenirs and enjoy the local Indian foods.

The most important place over here in MUSTAFA CENTER, it is like Walmart, you will find all what you required under one roof. Best tourist hot spot for all the tourist shopping.

Must place for all travellers to get flavor of INDIA."
,,Nice place if you like Indian stuff. Do not go on the weekends. It is way too crowded.,3.0,,"There are many places to eat in Little Indian. i would recommend eating in the food centre where prices are cheaper and there are a greater variety of food. However, please do not go on Sat and Sun. Sun is especially crowded with all the thousands of foreign workers milling around as it is their rest day. The traffic and pedestrian footfall is really overwhelming. Look after your personal belongings and wallet. Singapore is a very safe place but does not mean that there are no petty theft and pickpockets. Overall it is an opportunity to experience something different in Singapore."
,,A unique place,5.0,,"We went to visit the Mosque and got the addition of looking around Little India. Wonderful little shops and an artisan bakery that had wonderful lattes and scrumptious cakes. The mosque was very interesting, no charge, but had to cover up and shut to visitors from 12 -2 pm. Worth visiting this area"
,,India away from India!,5.0,,"this is a pretty cool ethnic neighborhood in Singapore. If you have never been to India, it is a great place to sample India without the negatives of overcrowding and chaos. There are plenty of excellent Indian restaurants that are relatively inexpensive. You can also find souvenirs if interested. More shopping that is specific to India can also be done quite easily.There is also a beautiful Hindu temple that is worth a visit. Overall, we spent about 3 to 4 hours in this neighborhood and it was a lot of fun."
,,Beautiful !!!,5.0,,Nice area of Singapore having indian surroundings... u will find hotels serving indian dishes here easily.....u can find south indian temples here....a lot of retail shops r there for shopping....overall a nice area which gives u a feel of India in Singapore...
,,Great Spot for Indians,5.0,,"An Indian will feel like he is in his own country but more cleaned and managed.One can get almost everything here at a cheapest price. Do visit the Tekka center for the great deals on food & shopping. Towards the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, there are few shops selling souvenir at really cheap price."
,,A must see,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore for a couple of days, take the MRT and go to Little India. A guaranteed exotism awaits you.
Busy and colorful area with mouthwatering food outlets, souvenirs shops, and don‚Äôt miss while you are there, the Tekka market. An attraction on its own, and a cheap place to find meat, fish and vegetables."
,,colorful houses,4.0,,"Popular for their colorful houses, buildings and stalls, Little India is not just your another attraction story. This attraction is also the face of India's Community that is found in Singapore showing off the colorful culture of India through painted houses of different colors, Indian cuisine that have this deliciously mixed spices, souvenir's stalls of Indian's Hand crafted Items and so much more that enriched Indian community here in Singapore. I really felt like I'm in one of the street of India"
,,Cultural experience,4.0,,"I‚Äôve been to Chinatowns and Little Italy‚Äôs in various locations, but never experienced a Little India. I‚Äôve not traveled to India, but I imagined it felt like being transported there. Although a few areas seemed a little sketchy and a lot of trash around compared to other areas in Singapore, I liked seeing the colors and architecture. It had a very different feel than other areas, but after going to the Asian Civilisations Museum, seeing Little India helped me understand the cultural and artistic influences in Singapore. My colleague and I didn‚Äôt have long, but at least we got to see it. We took mass transit from there to Chinatown. We were happy with the efficiency."
,,Nearest To Asian Culture in Singapore,4.0,,"In a city / country that has made its success out of being as clean, well organised and safe as Switzerland, Little India is the one area where you might find the grubby, chaotic, make-do-and-mend culture of Asia still alive. There is a buzz here that is somewhat absent from the rest of Singapore city, however great and impressive and beneficial all of that squeaky-clean modernity all is. I hope Little India survives."
,,An attraction?,2.0,,"Little India is advertised as an attraction but unless I'm missing something it was a lot of small shops (most of which a tourist probably wouldn't enter), some restaurants and some temples.
I'm sure there must be other parts of Singapore more worthy of a visitors time."
,,The only dirty part of Singapore,1.0,,"We didn't stay long in Little India - it was such a poor contrast to the rest of Singapore that it wasn't appealing at all.
Not much to see in the way of shopping either - gold jewellery, money exchange shops, and dirty food stalls seemed to be about all it had to offer and these were of no interest to us."
,,Little India,5.0,,"Here is the Indian diaspora, the neighborhood looks very real full of small shops and restaurants. There are also several Hindu temples, all concentrated around Serangoon Road."
,,Exploring Little India,3.0,,"The area is quite different from other parts of Singapore. You feel more like India in this area.Lots of Indian cuisine options and local Indian spices , Clothing shops."
,,as the name says !!,5.0,,"the place where u can hear honks, ppl crossing roads just like that, speakers on, spitting, etc .. LITTLE INDIA
you can find all kind of indian goods and needs here. weekends it will be buzzing with activities.
many eat out joints are here to enjoy the local food."
,,Little India,4.0,,"Feels like you've arrived to India when you come to the area. A lot of amazing Indian restaurants selling delicious food, tiny shops and markets. Colorful, vibrant and tasty."
,,True India,4.0,,You feel like you are in India. Many good Indian Restaurants and food tastes just same as you find in India.
,,Always nice to go back,5.0,,"Been in Singapore about 10 times, love the city/country and love Little India, lots of good, nice restaurants, shops and atmosphere."
,,Can not say I am impressed. It was pretty and we liked it but...,3.0,,"When you think about anything related to India, you might think about colours, spices and interesting flavours... and you will find that here without a miss, however, Chinatown has so many things to see and do that, even if you don't like the food you will have a great experience.

Little India, as we were told by one of the locals, represents the culture of a specific region of India and they have some really good food there and the markets are appealing to the tourist... but there was an aspect that wasn't as interesting as Chinatown and I honestly can't put my finger on what was. We came here late afternoon and this area started to have more colours as the contrast, between dusk and the street lights, makes it beautiful to watch. At this time, the aroma of spices comes to full power. We stopped at a restaurant that was recommended to us, is a restaurant following the free economy model (you pay what you think your food was worth) and the food was pretty good but after walking for 30 minutes, we found ourselves reading the guide, checking if there was anything else to visit around.

Sure, it has some temples to visit, one of them has a gigantic Buddha, but honestly, you might be able to cover this area in 45 minutes, go to eat and that is all."
,,Anything and Everything of South India,4.0,,"It's not little India..it's little South India!!All sweets,all colourful clothing , temple,food items, alterations tailoring shops with all Kerala language and whole lot of South Indian speaking people around..if missing South..if you are from South..
if wanna have south Indian food....and wanna watch Bollywood movies..visit city square..then visit a must"
,,various kind of thing,4.0,,"This is a tourist spot where you can experience the Indian culture. Traditional cloth, Indian food, music, souvenirs you can find it all here. There are lots of budget room here too"
,,"Interesting, colourful area",4.0,,"This area is worth an hour or two's visit-just walk around and take in the sights, smells and colours. There are many small streets to walk around with colourful shops as well as a local market. There is an MRT stop for Little India and there are plenty of places to eat."
,,A La India,4.0,,"A place for cheap stay , cheap food and cheap shopping ... we stayed around here so had a lot of places to visit there ... well connected to the other part of the city with the MRT"
,,"Do come here during Diwali season, but ALWAYS avoid Sundays!",4.0,,"Little India has always been a favourite place I go to for cheap and good Indian food. I love the Chicken Dum Biryani rice from Yakader Muslim Food at Tekka Market and the vegetarian feast at Komala Vilas. Mustafa Centre is also the place I head to for low priced exotic tea leaves.

However, I will advise you to AVOID SUNDAYS - especially if you are female! The situation is so bad that even my local ethnic Indian girlfriends would not go to Little India on Sundays, unless for very, VERY good reasons.

See, Sunday is the only day-off for our community of foreign Indian/Bangladeshi/Sri Lankan workers, hence Little India is extremely crowded as they head there to meet friends from their respective hometowns. And yes, they DO STARE at everybody - even if you are not female and blondie-blue-eyed... Maybe it's not rude in their culture to stare but yes, we can feel violated by just being stared at...

I will never understand those people who deliberately visit Little India on Sundays then complain its crowded, dirty or unsafe. C'mon, where there is a crowd, there is a chance for trash and security issues - applies to ANYWHERE in the world. Given today's availability of internet, one has to be a seriously hapless tourist do zero research before heading there (or anywhere).

So I would suggest that we be nice, and let the workers enjoy their precious Sunday off. We can go there any day, but they cannot, due to work commitment. So avoid Sundays and weekend evenings and it'll be fine.

Tip: Go earlier. It gets crowded after hours."
,,Hated it,2.0,,"First thing to hit you as you arrive is just how unkept and dirty so different compare to other districts of Singapore. DIRTY
The Mustafa cent is worth a look but be prepared for kaos , people everywhere, staff rude .
We visited but we won't be back.
As for food hygiene no chance!"

,,Home away from Home,4.0,,"Best place for Vegetarian and Jain food. Mustafa -the 24 hour shopping complex is in the vicinity. There is a wide choice of food with some nice Indian restaurants, cafes and takeaways."
,,Another side to Singapore,4.0,,"This is worth a walk through just to see where modern day Singapore came from. The houses and shops are in sharp contrast to the modern gleaming skyscrapers surrounding them. It's good to find a walking trail that takes you through the main streets and to a couple of the more interesting temples (we used Lonely Planet).
Walking down the street of flower sellers making garlands for the temples was a lovely insight into a different culture."
,,Fantastic Place,4.0,,"This is the place to be if you're in for a local indian cuisine as well as to get to know and familiarize the indian culture.Here, you can find all types of saris, spices and indian delicacies. The best time to visit is between the month of october to november they celebarate the diwali festival. Each year they have different themes that makes it more exciting to watch and celebrate.For year 2018 i think they will be celebrating diwali on november 7 as this featival is depending on their indian calendar."

,,Hot and far from centre,1.0,,"Don‚Äôt bother if you live in a large UK city- nothing different.
Also, a trek to get there from where you are probably staying. See Arab street and Sultan mosque area off Beach Road instead and wander over briefly into Dunlop St to see big mosque and a pretty street."
,,Fun Area Worth Visiting,4.0,,"Wanting to do something different, we decided to taxi to Little India for lunch. The hawker stands had plenty of options and there are numerous shops lining the streets to stop in. For fun we each ended up getting Henna and did buy a few small items. It was a fun 2 hour stop during our day!"

Lots of electrical stuff..."

,,Messy but interesting place to see.,4.0,,I've been many times come to Singapore but this is my first time come to Little India because my hotel that I stayed close to this place. The area is a little bit messy but there are plenty things to see. The money changer in this area offered quite a good rate also compare to the one in the airport. I think is quite a good place to see.

,,the vibrant little india,3.0,,"we went there to snap photo with colourful villa known as tan teng niah. just a little walk from little india MRT station, you get to see this colourful building surrounded by local eateries and shops. the vibe is more or less similar to little india in KL. Full of colors and cultural mode with cute elephant statues everywhere."

If you go off the beaten track do not worry as that's when your adventure will begin. I came here and ended up eating with a lovely Indian gentlemen who told me so much about little India and is history and all about the cuisine, which by the way is absolutely to die for. If you're a fan of food then please visit here you can also pick up so many ingredients for such a little price and you can see how fresh and authentic they are.

It's also great to understand the city and it's history/hardships/triumphs more. So much to learn. You could absolutely spend more than one day visiting here as there is just so much to see."
,,A slice of India inn Singapore,5.0,,"the beauty of Little India is its genuineness -- authentic India with the stalls selling food and veg and clothing. the most interesting place though was the food court which serves meals on banana leaves, and you will find all sorts of genuine indian meals at a fraction of the cost .."
,,Flower...Fruits...Fish...Flee Market,3.0,,"A typical Indian style market area full of activities that you usually found in any regular day in India.
Now that's astonishing and in the mean time feels proud of our diversity.
One should visit little India for street shopping in Indian style. Many top rated hotels are situated there as well as eating joints. The area is well connected with MRT and bus services.
It took me around three hours to get a feel of the area..."
,,Feels like home,3.0,,I wasnt too fond of the place even though I'm an Indian. Not very well maintained and not very clean. Feels like home as you see so many fellow Indians
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Streets were full of stern faced men, just sitting on the street looking dour. Fruit and flower vendors were rude. I went to buy but I think that if you'd like my money the least you can do is be polite. Decided to spend in Chinatown instead."
,,First time,3.0,,"Been to Singapore many times, first visit yesterday. Temples, shops and food hall everywhere. Nice to walk around the area, Food was excellent and cheap."
,,India within reach,5.0,,If you love everything about india especially food and home decor. This is the place. Food are mouthwatering and authentic. You can buy everything and anything at the market. Don't shy away from bargaining with the vendor.
,,Bustling and happening,5.0,,I love little India part of Singapore. It has many options for mouth watering indian food and hundreads of shops to satisfy your shopping wishes. It has never happened that I need something of indian market origin and I didn‚Äôt get it in little India. A must visit for the beautiful hindu temples also.
,,Little India (south) indeed,4.0,,Best indian resturants with authentic food and service....also good for vegetarian options. Gokul vegetarian is the best place
,,Loved visiting Little India,5.0,,"Little India was amazing, with beautiful street art, delicious food and clothing stalls, as well as fabrics and tailor shops."
,,Lots of colour,3.0,,"This was included as part of our City Tour. There are lots of little souvenirs you can buy in the many shops. Part of it was fenced off as they were setting up for a festival so it made it a little more difficult to get around. It was great to see all the different colours in the area, including the beautifully decorated elephants just as you approached Little India. Worth having a look around."
,,Come here for the complete charm,4.0,,"Little India is a no little place and it has to offer all things you expect from the Indian flavour. Its boutiques, its food, its dresses, its street side culinary - this place is worthy to be mentioned by all travel guides as a must go"
,,Safe place to see Indian culture,4.0,,"Parts of this area tend to be a bit ""touristy"" but get away from the Little India MRT station and it becomes a lot better. There are heaps of things to see in the back streets off Serangoon Rd, but the traffic tends to be a bit more haphazard than in the rest of Singapore, and the locals seem to occasionally think the traffic lights are for decoration. Just take care crossing the road. Heaps of fresh food in street market stalls, and a lot of colourful clothing. The food is excellent and quite safe to eat Avoid the temples unless you like huge crowds of people and haven't seen similar before."
,,Tekka Market...THE PLACE TO GO,4.0,,"If you truly truly want to try good local Singaporean food (Indian, Chinese, Malay), then THIS IS THE PLACE to be! Tekka Market has possibly the largest array of choices that you will salivate just looking at range offered. Avoid weekends which can be of course, MORE crowded, and if you come in a big group, be prepared to sit separately, for seats would be limited.

Easily accessibly by MRT. Take the Downtown Line (Blue Line) or the NorthEast Line (Purple Line) to Little India. Then take the exit that says Tekka (which meals Pigs Trotters, in Hokkien, a dialect).

Enjoy!"
,,How can this be in Singapore???,1.0,,"i lovethe clean, safe feel of Singapore until i got to Little India. My trip took a massive fail. It was as stated Little India, so leave it in India, This is Singapore. I wanted a clean safe Indian experience, culture and spice not expensive poverty in a mask of cultural experience. Tidy the place up, make it Indian culture not third world feel at a Singapore price. Get balance. DONT GO THERE UNTIL ITS AS YOU EXPECT FROM SINGAPORE....Clean, Safe, Cultural......."
,,"Busy, Hot, and Questionable Safety",1.0,,"I did not feel comfortable walking in Little India. The streets were very crowded and the traffic was dangerous. There seemed to be an inordinate number of men roaming the streets with nothing to do. Having said that, I recommend seeing the roof of the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple on Serangoon Road. You may also want to eat at Banana Leaf Apollo. It has excellent food and a great local atmosphere."
,,As on the tin,4.0,,A little India in Singapore. You can get local food and enjoy the spices of India. The food market is pretty impressive - lots of fresh food.
,,Part of India in Singapore,5.0,,"Well worth the visit. Interesting temples, good restaurants and the vibe of India in Singapore. Easy to reach with subway."
,,Just don't think this is what India actually looks like,3.0,,"It's a walking street with shops, restaurants and temples, but it has nothing to do with the real India. Most of the shops sell souvenirs and gadgets I have never seen in India and there are no cows walking the streets. ;)
It is still nice to get an impression about the Indian population of Singapore and you get lots of vegetarian food which can be more difficult to find in other parts of Singapore. However, if you have actually been to India before you might something more interesting in Singapore than Little India."
,,Really little india in Singapore,5.0,,"Little India -a lot of indian restaurant available in Singapore. Lot of Indian food available like paratha,samosa,biryani, chapati and all type of saag,sabji. Lot Indians owner shops and mobile , electronics , clothing , sports items shop available in this area."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,Came here just to check it out. I didn‚Äôt find it similar to India but it def has a different vibe to other areas. Didn‚Äôt eat here as we had just finished breakfast but the food did look and smell delicious. Bought some cushion covers and were able to bargain but they are much more expensive than in Thailand. Lots of beautiful saris and other traditional clothing and many gold jewelers stores as well. Close to the MRT (take the Seragoon Rd exit) there is a multi story building with lots of very inexpensive traditional clothes.
,,Loved Little India!,5.0,,"Wonderful place, very hectic, with music and beautiful indian garment shops. Delicious food, beautiful temples. Felt like being in India. Colourful, animated- a must in Singapore!"
,,Not to bad,4.0,,"We booked in at the Hilton in Little India as we had stayed everywhere else in Singapore.
Yes it was a bit daunting especially arriving on New Year‚Äôs Day as there were people everywhere.
To much people actually, but we needed to exchange some money so we walked around and everyone was friendly.
People said go to Mustafa Department store which is open 24 hours as they have there own Money changer.
They wanted to see our passports before they would exchange money so we went across the road and found a better one with a better rate and didn‚Äôt require ID.
Food in the area is quite cheap we ate out 3 adults with non alcoholic drinks for $38 in a corner restaurant, the restaurants don‚Äôt look that inviting, but the food is very good."
,,Nothing was Indian,2.0,,I went there for the sake of seeing some Indian product but all I saw was some thai pants and lots of gold shops. The temple there was kind of ok to see. All over It was not worth my time.
,,Little India indeed..,5.0,,A beautiful part of Singapore with a rich history and well preserved colourful Colonial buildings to beautiful temples that will leave your jaws dropped. Gold shops and small stores scattered here and there. Where you can smell the Incense Sticks as you pass few shops. There is a hawker centre too called Tekka Centre where you can take a break and enjoy some cheap eats and even do some shopping.
,,I don‚Äôt know what to say.,1.0,,"My partner and I had Little India on the ‚Äòto do list‚Äô for our time in Singapore from an early stage and it didn‚Äôt live up to anything at all.
Singapore is known for being clean and tidy. Little India is filthy. There is rubbish everywhere and the streets are dank and dirty. As for the people, my partner felt that uncomfortable we couldn‚Äôt get out of there quick enough.
It has to be extremely bad for me to leave a review so low and this was."
,,Strong Indian culture,3.0,,"This is a tourist spot where you can experience the Indian culture. You able to see everything link up with Indian.

Traditional cloth, assesories, food, music, souvenirs you can find it all here. Price for groceries here is cheap.

If you look for cheap electronic devices, you can go Sim lim square.

If you look for 24hours shopping mall, you can go to mustafa shopping mall.

There are lots of budget room here too, best place for budget travellers."
,,Cheap indian food,4.0,,The place is thronged by Indians living in Singapore and for good reason. One step here and you will feel you are back in India. There are shops selling indian food at super low prices. There are also shops for Indian spices and other groceries. There are good restaurants like the Banana leaf too.
,,Waste of time,2.0,,"If you don‚Äôt have a special interest on Indian culture, no need to go.

Most of the people whom I met here were not nice as the Indians in India. I think they developed another culture in Singapore. It was a big disappointment for me as a fan of Indian people and culture."
,,Great to visit,4.0,,"I passed through Little India while on a tour. The area seems vibrant with local fruits and vegetables, some I've never seen before. The handicraft markets are lively and full of unique goods. The restaurants and eateries smelled delicious and enticing and I regret not trying anything. Little India is worth a visit to see the diversity in Singapore's demographics. I'd recommend going on a tour so someone can explain the history and architecture, which I found most interesting."
,,Interesting area to visit,4.0,,We did some shopping here and got some snacks. They were just finishing up the Deepavali festival so decorations were still up. Good selection of shopping options. We really liked the area just east of this called Haji Lane - very cool shopping and restaurant section around that street. Lots of clothing and jewelry stores.
,,AVOID - what a dump,1.0,,"Went there with family - hundreds of rude staring men, filthy streets, men urinating in public. Don‚Äôt bother.

Low grade products
Rude sales people
Piles of garbage
Foul smells

The travel gurus will extol it‚Äôs amazing virtues and culture because that‚Äôs what they do, however reality is different. Do yourself a favour and avoid this nasty dirty area. It‚Äôs stark contrast to the rest of Singapore which is amazing, clean and full of nice people.

I had to give you a star to post this - it deserves none!"
,,Touring,3.0,,It's a quaint little place with lots of jewellery shops. There's many Indian restaurants & a good place to walk around & experience the Indian culture.
,,The name summarizes the place,4.0,,"If you want to see the other side of Singapore, you have to go to this place,. The moment you step in, you feel you are back in India, with little regard to rules, whether traffic or usage of public space for business. But, it is a must see place and you get to experience India in a different country. Everything from garlands to pooja items are available. Some of the business places are many decades old and carry their own history with them"
,,Deepavali,5.0,,"The best time to get there around this month until depavali day.. Love all the things that they sell... fruits, clothes etc. Especially mustafa centre."
,,Perhaps the most colourful district in Singapore,4.0,,"Perhaps the most colourful district in Singapore.You can explore Little India using the Heritage Trail set aside, allowing you to explore a Walk of Faiths exploring temples, mosques and churches in the area. The other trail is the Serangoon in the 1900s trail which explores the life of early settlers in the region highlighting some interesting murals in the area. And for the collectors, you can walk the Shop Til You Drop! trail where you can immerse in the most colourful display of shopping you can ever do."
,,Wow,1.0,,"We were told to go to look and c it was an eye opener to say the least, we were shocked at the dirty shops that had no aircons it was hot enough with out trying to walk around the little shops on a tour. No food was eaten as most on the tour couldn't wait to get back on the bus and no money was spent. I wouldn't waste my time going here again there are many other places to see in Singapore
Overall don't bother going there"
,,Worthwhile a visit,5.0,,"Little India is a vibrant and colour part of the city. Whether you want to just to some sightseeing, sniff a bit of culture, shop artiste some delicious food."
,,"Home far away ,, truly Indian",5.0,,"authentic Tamilnadu experience while you walk through the shops.. Great options for Indian food, groceries, fruits and flowers. Not to forget Indian shopping is an amzing exeperience to get a affordable gift for all your far relatives too"
,,Exploring little india,2.0,,"Not much to do there, only one iconic place which make it worth to go is mustafa centre. I went to a little dessert shop to tried faluda and the price was crazy expensive for one beverage around $16, but i don't think the taste was worth with that much money."
,,Singapore trip,3.0,,"Little India is a very good place for Indian tourist.one can feel like india.regading food all types of Indian foods are available north indian food south Indian food , idly dosa ,Chinese food chat items and many more.kailash parbat,Anand bhavan ,Saravana bhavan ,komalas are good food joint.komalas ,Saravana bhavan and Anand bhavan are less expensive ranging from 6 to 22 Singapore dollars .Test wise Kailash Parbat is best but little expensive because of vat and services tax.food quantity are pretty good.overall view we can get every thing about India food.jain food also available.so regarding vegetrain food absolutely no worries.one can enjoy shopping at Mustafa shopping centre which is in little India."
,,India in Singapore,5.0,,"Even in India you cannot see many Indian restaurants like one can see in Race Course Road... one after another ... all different cuisines of India. The Serangoon road takes to olden times of south India with temple, flower and vegetable shops etc"
,,Not much going on,2.0,,I was expecting a little bit more going on to be honest. The Indian Heritage Centre is worth a visit but other than that it's a pretty boring place.
,,if,5.0,,"you habe been to India, i have not, that is good place to get a liitle feeling of this exotic coyntry."
,,This place is amazing!,5.0,,"Walking around the vast streets of central Singapore and came across little India. Please visit as many temples as you can, if your note sure where they all are then view the map of temples fixed at every entrance of each temple."
,,Little India in all its Glory,5.0,,"Visited here with a few friends and it was Diwali [ Hindu festival of Lights]when we were there. The roads were beautifully decorated and the whole place was alive with tourists and locals. it has a lovely and bustling atmosphere and the road is lined with lots of gold jewellery shops, vegetarian Indian cafes, shops selling Chinese foodstuffs .A must place to visit and soak in the wonderful atmosphere. Very easy travelling on the MRT and another place worth mentioning is the famous Mustafa centre selling everything you require. Highly recommended place and not to be missed."
,,Suburb dedicated to everything Indian in the heart of Singapore.,4.0,,"The MRT takes you right to the neighbourhood, the station is called Little India so you know exactly where to get off. From the very start of Serangoon Road you are left in no doubt where you are going with two huge, brightly festooned elephants guarding the entrance. The street is similarly decorated above the road celebrating Indian culture and love of colour. The first thing that struck us was the number of jewellery shops lining the road filled with dazzling Indian gold jewellery of all different shapes and designs. some of the designs are so beautifully intricate and the workmanship is exquisite. Despite the number of shops selling these wonderful pieces there are very few items the same design.

The smell of spices fills the air and as you walk past the restaurants and eating houses the sensation is even stronger. The food is exceptional Indian street food, lots of flavour and all the choices you would want.

Plenty of shops, market and Indian cultural places to fill at least half a day."
,,Really different,4.0,,"Easy to get to on MRT. Lots of eating places if you like Indian food. Streets can get busy but lots of shops to get a bargain.Especially costume jewelry and hair decorations.
More interesting than China town with a better atmosphere..
Get a map of the town to see the temples. About 10 Hindu temples in the area but I am sure there are more"
,,Little India,4.0,,Fun area to visit for Indian food and Gold! Mustafa Centre for shopaholics! Wet markets for produce and Hawker food. Shan-E-Punjab had best Naan and curries!
,,GOOD FOOD AWAY FROM CITY CENTRE,5.0,,"This place is about 20 minutes away from Orchard Road. You will be amazed just how much gold you will see along the main strip. All the shops selling gold jewelry will certainly make you wonder how many people are buying gold every day? There are quite a few places you can find really tasty vegetarian Indian food and non vegetarian Indian food. There is also a fast food style Indian food place. Doesn't matter which place you pick, they are all very affordable, very clean, great people who did not hesitate to educate me on the items in the menu and ever so willing to cater to my very spicy taste. Traffic wasn't bad at all even though it was raining one evening. This area is very safe. Mustafa's, a store selling anything and everything you can possible want is about 20 minutes walk from the Hilton Serangoon. There is also a pharmacy inside where you can get almost any over the counter medication. Or the staff there will point out an alternative."
,,Not that good,3.0,,Not that clean as others places in Singapore People can cheat tourist The market is worth visiting for eye pleasure
,,Aromatic,5.0,,"Markets, spices, restaurants, fabrics. Great to walk through. Easy access of MRT. Recommend stop at main temple."
,,Little 'dirty' India,3.0,,We visited little India while touring with hippo tours bus and we were surprised how the place looked. The infrastructure was in much worse condition than rest of the places in Singapore we have visited and we got much 'dirtier' feeling from the place. As we walked around we had no interest in visiting the local restaurants. Somehow we had a different image in our heads from the place.
,,Little india in Singapur,4.0,,"It is nice to walk around and try some food (all spicy everywhere). Nice colors, people, houses.. good quarter"
,,Nice long street full of culture,4.0,,"Very long street full of stalls selling cheap touristy goods. Some items of poor quality but thats in whichever little india or China town you go to so nothing new there. Nice atmosphere, i believe would be better at night with the lights"

,,"Colourful, Amazing",5.0,,"A must visit while in Singapore, so many restaurants, souvenir shoppes, Temples, and clothing, electronic and gold shoppes. Haggling is welcome so feel free to do so, you can get some great deals in any of the above shoppes, a very busy place and a very different contrast to the rest of Singapore, so lively and so many different cultures here. A great place to check out for a day or more, Our favorite place to visit is Little India."
,,Colourful,3.0,,This place is colourful and does have some Indian trinkets but it was not for me. I found it a bit dirty and almost like you had stepped into a different realm. It does have a very large shopping market. I think people should visit it and make up there own mind.
,,Average market place,3.0,,Nicely decorated due to Diwali An average market for daily routine amenities. Wonderful vegetarian options available like Komala's and Kailash Parbat. Only Mustafa centre is worth to visit.
,,Colourful and bursting with life,5.0,,"We visited on a Sunday and also on Saturday evening to eat. In the evening the lights across Serangoon Road and in the shops and restaurants created a wonderful atmosphere, very different to the rest of the city. Saturday and Sunday the streets were filled with people, restaurants and shops selling gold jewelry, food, trinkets and clothing."
,,Surprising,4.0,,Went here a few times. Make sure you shop around to find the bargains. Feel free to bargain. Great experience and great for souvenir shopping.

,,Diwali visit,4.0,,"Shud be called Little Chennai & not Little India, as 80% of the population are Tamils. But Bongs can have great non veg food like fish & rice in the various Bangladeshi restaurants around. Overall a nice place, but overcrowded during festivals."

,,Buzzing and full of colour and life,5.0,,Little India is a great find and we loved wondering about and looking at all the different site. The little tunnel market is amazing and felt like being in Santa's grotto. Do go it's lovely.
,,"Hot, Sweaty and Unsanitary",2.0,,"While the title of this review states my opinion, I recommend that you visit and draw your own conclusions.

Maybe I was influenced by the heat, or the humidity or the fact that I went on a Sunday instead of a weekday ...... Crowds of mass humanity blocked sidewalks and shopping centers galore making for uncomfortable passage.

I spent 1 HR there and was ready to leave after 6.5 minutes however; I emersed my wife into a somewhat longer time frame.

Afterwards she told me she was ready to leave after 5 minutes ... So I slightly misjudged her reactions to the place.

Visit and make your own opinion ......"
,,Certainly it is India in Singapore,4.0,,"This place is simply amazing. You will just fall in love. There are hundreds of store to buy literally anything at considerable cost. The people are also very helpful. The restaurants are also known for their gastronomy. But since it is the reflection of India, it is almost always crowded and a little dirty."

,,A wander through the cultures,4.0,,"Having visited Chinatown the previous day, we ventured into Little India. We jumped on the MRT to get there, which was a quick trip from the Seacare Hotel near Chinatown. Little India is a bustling community, strewn with Asian vegetable shops, sari shops, and more interestingly, perhaps, for some, plenty of shops selling gold jewelery, some pieces exquisitely crafted. There is an interesting Indian temple on the main road. Streets were also hung with decorations to celebrate Diwali. Recommended if you want to get a flavour of Singapore."

Little India was a swirl of people, beautiful light displays on windows, doors, around temples and in parks and with all kinds of rituals and festival preparations. Don't miss Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, one of Singapore's oldest Hindu temples and dedicated to the goddess and destroyer of evil. It also has some of the most elaborate architecture and colorful statues (hundreds!!) of any temple I have ever seen.

,,Beautifully lit up for diwali,3.0,,"Little India was beautifully lit up for diwali. However the crowds ona sunday were crazy. Traffic was very bad. Its as if all Indians had descended at one place. Badly kept place and badly parked cars all around.

The endless shops and restaurants and mustafa centre was a complete experience of shopping that's looked cheap for things I didn't really want to buy.
,,Many Indians - Tourists must visit,5.0,,"Review by Dr Sim. Little India is a hang-out for the many foreign Indian workers in Singapore. Most crowded in the evenings on weekends. It is wonderful place with interesting smells, sights and character. Not very clean but that is part of the charm of the place. Many Indian shops and restaurants. If you cannot go to India, this is the nearest thing to it. Regards DrSim001."
,,Day trip while staying in Singapore,4.0,,"Was a very different experience indeed, were told by a couple of Indian visitors that don‚Äôt think that the area is anything like India itself, and as my husband and myself haven‚Äôt yet experienced India, we cannot say if it was or not. The stalls and markets, and the spice smells were amazing. An experience and if in Singapore do it, and make your own opinions. We were staying at the Pan Pacific at Marina Bay, is an easy walk or catch the MRT which is really easy to travel on."
,,Close to Everything,4.0,,"We stayed in Little India. Mustafa Shopping CTr is a 24 hour place, hectic can be crowded but has everything,and a couple of blocks away is City Square Mall which is the new more spacious shopping mall which also incorporates a MRT station. There are Indian Temples, market Stalls, lots of Indian takeaways and Restaurants. It has a produce Market there, the smell can be offensive in the Meat and Fish section. The people there go about there business and are not harassing you to buy things. We were there when Deepavali Festival was on, not that we had planned for it."
,,Visiting India from outside of India,4.0,,"As its name implies it's a small Indian town within the city. packed with shop selling Indian product and food. it's really carry a favor you won't find in other part of the city.

,,Interesting,4.0,,"At night there were pretty lights all along the main street for the Deepavali festival. During the day it feels very different to other parts of Singapore. We enjoyed looking at the shops, people watching and temples. You could allow enough time to check out the main street like us but I wish we allowed more time to explore the back streets and try the food. We travelled here easily by smrt."

They are also cheap. We walked the markets and just took it al in. We didn't barter at the markets, we just paid the price as we thought it was cheap. We walked the streets for a bit and brought some cheap watches and ear rings etc. Good for shopping for men and mostly Saris for the ladies. Great cheap shoe shop. We didn't try any food as it was hot and didnt feel like eating. It was good for my girls to see the shops and food choices etc."
,,Friendly Environment with feel of India,4.0,,"This area of Little India has a historical significance .

,,Indian Food,3.0,,"Singapore offers a vast variety of regional Asian cuisine's. Food is fresh,cheap and generally clean. Food in Little India represents the country's various regions. There is an abundance of South Indian style food both vegetarian and non vegetarian.For North Indian food, need to inquire or concoctions can be passed around. After dinner,hailing a cab back to the hotel is a nightmare. Request the restaurant to call you one, while you wait."
,,Spicy food,5.0,,Great indian spicy food. You'll feel as if you are in India. A half day is enough in little India during your trip to Singapore.
,,Friendly traders,5.0,,We stopped off at Little India on our bus tour and were immediately thrust into the colour and vibrancy of an Indian market!

Its a cultural rich area with great Indian food of your choice, Indian boutiques and beauty parlours, Ayurvedic massage, reliable cheap phone shops, Indian spices and groceries, places of various worship buildings (Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Christian, Buddha) and jewellery and souvineir shops.

Musaffa a well known 24 hours shopping mall under 1 roof next to Farrer Park train station (Purple Line) is must go place at any time.
Its easy to move around and easy travelling by buses and trains (Little India Station-Purple Line)

Most of the buildings are very old shophouses which are preserved and some converted to boutique hotels and restaurants. Visit the wet market and see the lifestyle of everyday Singaporeans.

A must see place to see especially in October when the streets are lighted up for the Indian Festival of Lights Celebration with more shops and bazaars.

Cheers"

But it is full of Peoples . The Prices are very fair . Taxis are enough there for your Trip back to the Hotel"
,,Holiday,3.0,,"We went late in the day. The people were friendly and welcoming. However, the bins were overflowing with rubbish and rats were scampering around. All of this was likely due to the time of day we went. I would not eat there but we enjoyed the different experience."
,,Colourful place,3.0,,"A must visit area in singapore which demonstrate multicultural society of Singapore. This is a very vibrant place with lots of shops, several places with quality indian food. Best time to visit here is in the evening."

Surprised to see that they have already started Diwali in September itself...beautiful place with familiar vibrations ... love this one"

,,Good for Bargain Shopping,5.0,,"This vibrant precinct is a slice of India in multi-cultural Singapore, with spice shops, jewellery store, flower vendors, sari sellers, trendy cafes and hip watering holes at every turn.

,,Saturday midday stroll through Little India,3.0,,"It has been some time since I last wandered around in Little India and so I decided to spend a couple of hours exploring some of the lesser known sites today. What is quite helpful though are the Little India Heritage Trail signs located at key places of interest. These signs give some background on the place, there are also maps of where to find the main sites. Of course all very busy on a Saturday at midday."
,,Don't Spend Too Much Time,2.0,,"Our hotel was located in this part of town. It gives you a little of the feel of being in India. The temple is worth taking a few minutes to visit and the street decorations are demonstrative, but if you're not of Indian descent, the shop owners universally ignore you, perhaps with even a tinge of disdain."
,,Right at its own MTR station,5.0,,Many shops. One can get tailored clothing. Materials and thread seemed to be of high quality. There is actually a Dollar Store!! Know your Jade before you go or just look. They will hold a lighter to it to show it doesn't melt. That doesn't mean it IS jade. Become knowledgeable BEFORE you arrive!

,,A Little of India outside India,3.0,,"Singapore basically a very neat and clean city has a mixture of Chinese, South Indians ( mostly Tamils ) and Malaysians. One can see the cultural influence of various places where they predominantly exist.Personally Singapore has fascinated me for about thirty five years now and right from the Changi Airport you can find tourist friendly people who are basically very soft spoken by nature and ever willing to help.Little India is an area in Singapore that has a lot of shops and a metro railway station plus taxis that makes it very easy to commute.I have visited this place a couple of times when I was in Singapore and wandering in this place makes to mix and mingle with a lot of South Indians who have their shops and can speak in Tamil.
Dr. Javed Rasheed"
,,Place you should not miss when visiting Singapore.,5.0,,"Little India - Singapore.

If you are coming to Singapore from now till end of October do stay in Little India where there are many hotels to suit your budget and this place has all the amenities that is within walking distance. All the Indian cuisine, garment and textile shops, electrical equipment, gold smiths, temples are ever present. Everywhere you turn in the side streets are restaurants, groceries, and little flower garland shops. This time of the year the streets are dressed in neon best to greet the Indian Festival of Deepavali.

Situated in Serangoon Road from the Rochor Canal onwards Little India started as a Kampong (Village) that was originally a division of ethnic Indian immigrants to Singapore. Serangoon Road today, is a very busy one way thoroughfare and both sides are crowded with pedestrians, more than 70% whom are Indians, both local and tourists. Sounds of Indian music give the place a sense of Indian culture.

Beside the Rochor Canal is Tekka Market which is a multi-cultural center with goods that catered for ethnic groups although the there are more stalls that sell Indians produce or food. At the other end of the road about 1 km away is the famous Indian Department Store and Supermarket, Mustaffa.

There used to be shops that had the machinery to grind spices into powder but modernization had stop the practice and ready mix spices can be easily available in the shops. Tours to the area should include the two Hindu Temples, Sri Veeramakalimman Temple and Sri Srinivasa Prerumal Temple, a Chinese temple Leong San Temple, the Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple and a Muslim Mosque. There are no entrance charges at these places of worship however you are expected to take off your footwear before entering the Indian temples.

One has to note that Indians of today are scattered like other races to stay in housing estates under the Government Plan for racial harmony though many still reside in Little India. The Indian commercial businesses are still concentrated at Little India just like that of the Chinese businesses in Chinatown.

Many bus routes past through Serangoon Road. The MRT ran two lines in Little India Station and another in Farrer Park Station and there is a taxi stand behind Tekka Market. There are many hotels ranging from Lodges and Backpackers Hostels to four star Wanderlust, and Zen Premium Little India. I counted 20 but there could be more.

You may book up a walking tour which is very popular however one can easily go on a self walking tour and take one‚Äôs time at various destinations.

I have to add two unique historical features of Little India. An accident in which an Indian was killed caused a riot (of two hours) when 27 people were injured and scores arrested. This prompted the police to issue a ban of selling and consumption of liquor (in public shops) from 10 pm onwards. A prominently displayed sign still stands today. The ban was spread widely across the island, but through my observation, somewhat loosely applied. However the most significant history of Little India was the collapse of the Hotel New World, a six-storey building situated at the junction of Serangoon Road and Owen Road. Overloading of the building and inferior building materials used caused the rapid collapsed in March 15th 1986, trapping 50 people and 33 people including 10 foreigners were killed. This part of history is always etched in my mind as I was there traveling along Serangoon Road when the accident happened. I heard a very loud boom and saw smoke raising from one kilometer away. It was not smoke but dust from the collapse which was sudden and over within few minutes."
,,Busy vibrant,4.0,,"A very busy very vibrant part of town
The sights the sounds the smells
You have to experience it
The markets and temples
The hustle and bustle
The tailors offering to make you a suite. Some outrageous designs too
Well worth a visit
Explore the small streets and amazing stores"
,,Lots of Shopping and Lots of Restaurants,4.0,,"Interesting place to spend some time. As you would expect, there is every kind of Indian cuisine you could imagine. Shop after shop of clothing and gifts. Gold shops everywhere and lots of people making their way through the place. Mustafa Centre is worth having a look around with plenty of variety although with narrow aisles it does get pretty crowded. We were there at the start of the Deepavali Festival and Serangoon Rd was decorated from one end to the other which was spectacular at night."
,,Indian culinary experience and shopping adventure,4.0,,"Tucked away not far frm the high end shopping orchard rd lies this serangoon rd packed with many shops for souvenirs. Mustafa center is in this area. It has literally everything and anything u want from this planet earth. Cheap accomodations for backpackers. Cheap meals of mixed malay, western, chinese but mostly indian foods to try."
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"I loved my stay in Little India, found the location was very handy, and the streets were lined with dosa and indian snack stands. Must check out the hawker center in Little India for a very authentic but cheap meal, got myself a chai, curry, naan, samosa here and were all super tasty and probably only spend about $5AUD!"
,,Indian Culture and atmosphere,3.0,,"The place you can experience the Indian culture and atmosphere. I always think of the place if i crave for Indian food. there are some temples around the area where you can visit them,"
,,Same same,2.0,,"I went for the temples and atmosphere. The temples were closed! The atmosphere claustrophobic and cheap, a repetition of shops selling the same with forceful owners trying to get you in. All the time with loud music that wasn't to my taste. Colourful buildings are the only respite."
,,Smells of India,3.0,,"There is nothing quite like Little India along Serangoon Road, Singapore. Depending on whether or not you like all things Indian - you will either love it or hate it. I love Indian food, their spices and curries...so this place has a lot to offer. Before you actually arrive at a shop you will smell India in the air - quite literally Air India (in Singapore)."
,,Real India?:),4.0,,"Real Indian atmosphere, lots of tasty restaurants however most of them were more expensive than expected. Hostels very expensive. But worth visiting!"
,,India Town,3.0,,A glimpse of the Indian culture in Singapore. There are a lot of restaurants and shops where you can buy Indian goodies. Worth a few minutes to see the village.
,,Surprisingly seedy and dirty for Singapore. Something for our hardworking brothers.,3.0,,"There are some streets around Little India that are very seedy and only frequented by the construction workers and another group of immigrant workers. If you were a woman alone here at night, you would be so uncomfortable. Good to have a place for the poor sods to let off steam though - not much else for them to smile about.

And you have some Indian joints. You know what to expect."
,,An amazing place in SG,4.0,,"Very cultural as seen on the structures, temples, food and etc. Must try the local delicacies here like the chapatti , prata etc."
,,A different world that delights the senses,5.0,,"Little India is far enough removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown Singapore to give the perception of being in another world altogether! The MRT (Underground) is very efficient and cheap and Little India is easily accessible. Temples...food...restaurants, gree areas...it has the lot and at night it is most brilliant with colour and odours to feed the senses. Go off the main streets for beautiful restaurants. A must visit when in Singapore."
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"A vibrant and colorful area lined with shops and restaurants. I spent an afternoon taking in the sights, sounds and smells whilst walking from Little India through to Arab Street. I also preferred Little India to Chinatown - the area felt like it had a bit more character, whereas Chinatown has been turned into an area filled with shops all selling the same tourist merchandise (t-shirts, key rings, magnets)"
,,Sunday not best day for Little India,3.0,,Visited Little India last Sunday with a girl friend. We have since found out that Sunday is the traditional day off for a huge number of workers and hence we find a huge number of predominantly male groups enjoying Little India. Whilst we didn't experience any disrespect of any nature it was extremely crowded and as 2 females travelling alone it was lets say rather daunting. Monday we passed through Little India whilst on the hop on hop off bus and didn't recognise it - looked very calm and colourful.
,,you could easily forget that you are actually in Singapore,5.0,,it was Diwali when we were there and halloween at the same time so it was an absolute must for us to visit Little India. Unfortunately we didnt get any time to eat there because of our hectic schedule but the place was all decorated in elaborate designs with flowers and the markets were absolutely alive.
,,Dinner,2.0,,"Looking forward to a spicy meal after some richer French and more plain UK fare ( home stay) so wife suggested a place she had been to two years ago on a trip. I had been to area decades ago and it looked much the same......not impressive. Found out that 'her' place no longer existed so began looking at menus , as one does. Purely on an uninformed whim we decided on Banana Leaf Apolo as most places had much the same food and at similar prices.
Part of the problem was that we clearly had two different ideas on what we wanted but the trainee waiter confused us completely. We got another waiter who did his best but we just felt at sea. Then we noticed an iPad under papers.....would have made it easier. What turned up was tasty enough but one larger course never arrived but at least it was not on the bill.
Funny how you van spend seven weeks doing menus in Spain, Pottugal, France, most of Singapore but this one just flummoxed us. Two beers and a laugh and money in pocket.
An experience."
,,little india,4.0,,It is very colorful. I had a fun time visiting this place with friends. They also serve very good food at a reasonable price.
,,a bit dirty,2.0,,"A little dirty, not quite as much as most of India, though aesthetically a little worse off than other neighbourhoods of singapore. GO here for the temples, and cheap stuff at Mustafa etc.."
,,Tamilnadu in a bottle,3.0,,"Little India in singapore is what you get if one were to bottle up the bazaars, restaurants and temples in tamilnadu into a small package.
On the plus side it is fairly clean. Plenty of variety and color, take in the sights, sounds, smell and food.
Avoid visiting mustafa center if for any reason you were planning to go there."
,,Iconic Indian district in Singapore,4.0,,"Experience Singapore's version of India where you see Indian culture , food, flowers and spices sold in shops and the market. Avoid the weekends where hundreds of migrant workers congregate on their days off work"
,,Little india,4.0,,"Looked very colourful and inviting with colourful arches and lights.With Ganesh festival Har raya and Diwali approaching Little India presented a very inviting look! There are a variety restaurants serving mostly food of the Indian Sub continent. The stores sell a variety of goods and wares for members of the Indian Sub continent ,tourists and others resident in Singapore.Mustafa a huge mall open 24x7 has everything that one can
want"
,,Interesting,3.0,,"There are traditional market here selling products from India, very interesting to see. But compare to other places in Singapore this area is not maintained very well."
,,Definitely worth a brief visit..,4.0,,"I throughly enjoyed a brief visit to this area and found the inhabitants to be very friendly, gracious and helpful. There is a small museum and beautiful temple as well as a number of small shops selling a wide assortment of items from jewelry to clothing to flowers. There is also a heritage trail that includes the former house of Tan Teng Naiah. The house is the last surviving Chinese villa in Little India and is quite beautiful."
,,Just so - so,3.0,,"Basically, nothing much, just walk in and out. I usually like to take pictures etc but there is nothing appealing to me. I didn't even stop for food."
,,Worth the visit!,5.0,,"It gets very crowded ion the weekends. Lots of cheap good restaurants to dine. If you are interested in buying 22k jewelry, this is the place to visit."
,,Delightful India Under A Roof!,5.0,,"....we had all the time to wonder around in beautiful, very clean Singapore(their culture don;t even allow one to eat bubble gum! wow! wow!) We visited Chinatown on the other side of the city and just had to get to this side of the city so that we can testify that we have witnessed both cultures! We were very much impressed by all the small food stalls selling all types of goodii's but what attracted us most was the overwhelming smell of the Indian spices and the foods cooking all around us! We stopped at one stall and had lamb biryani Mmmmmmmmm, served here also just as in India on a big banana leaf! Wow! way too much food for one man to eat! But Insidious-lii delicious!.....a memorable occasion with a photo to look back at!!!....A must visit when in Singapore!................."
,,A cultural mishmash..,3.0,,"The place where you end up hearing pretty much every regional language that is spoken in India. This is the place for those who want to eat Indian food in Singapore, or just want to feel closer to home. The roadside food stalls serve everything from Indian snacks to local grub, and are popular for quick and inexpensive bites. Interesting architecture all around."
,,Quite interesting,4.0,,"An interesting location with multiple tastes. At the Tekka Centre, a wet market and food court where fresh food, vegetables, fruits and dry goods are sold. Walking along Serangoon Road can find colourful flower shops, bangles shops, groceries, restaurants, coffee shops, tailors and Mustafa Centre, a 24 hours shopping mall selling anything and everything. Quite a few temples & a mosque along the road."
,,"Gold, Gold, Gold",5.0,,"Great place to visit, think I prefer it to Chinatown. Safe to walk around at night. Glorious aromas from all of the restaurants. So many shops selling gold and jewellery, I didn't know there was that much gold in the World!"
,,A CULTURAL TRIP,4.0,,"I stayed four nights at Albert Court Hotel, ideally placed to explore Little India and the rest of Singapore with a MRT station a few minutes walk away. I enjoyed exploring the laneways, markets, restaurants and other sights in Little India. There's also a large shopping mall at tne other end of Serangoon Rd with shops and lots of eateries. I found the inhabitants friendly and a lot less pressure from stallholders to buy. Ate some fantastic curries also. Thoroughly enjoyed my time in Little India!"
,,A area where you have indian feelings,4.0,,A area where one can find indian restaurants and indian population. You find tamil spoken people indian goddess temples a unique spot
,,Very disappointing,1.0,,"Not sure what i expected but it was in the tour guides so I went. Dont. There really isnt anything worth seeing or doing. If you like Indian Food, go for dinner. In and out thats all you need.

As for the famous Mustafa Centre where you can buy anything 24/7. Ifs full of cheap rubbish. And so full its impossible to navigate around."
,,Crowded,4.0,,It's always crowded and colorful. Even it's busy in the evening and night. Many street food shops and eating places. Not for the ones who love peace and tranquility.
,,Law Budget Hotels you will get from this area,4.0,,If you land Singapore without having proper plan ? this area you will find law budget hotels for your first day stay. Specially if you are solo traveler you will most like to this place. Having lot of restaurants. Food is cheap. You can access near location by metro from airport it self. Very crowded place. this is a best place for Night life addict. Take extra care on your wallet while on this place and always carry your passport with you
,,Loved it!,5.0,,We visited the Laxminarayan Temple and the Buddhist Temple and both very beautiful and welcoming. It is not a biog area so easy to get around too!
,,Little India,4.0,,"Very different from the rest of Singapore but interesting. A lot of men stand stand on the street.
I like very much the flower shop and the air here is fragrant.
We eat here at a restaurant and we can pay also with cash and also with Visa card.

Is not a must in Singapore - there places in town more interesting !"
,,May be only for Indian Food!,4.0,,"This place is jam packed throughout! a lot people come for shopping in the malls surrounded by and also to experience the Indian cuisine. My purpose of visiting this place was to have dinner with family in one of the south Indian restaurant, visited a place called Sankranthi Restaurant - even this place was crowded like anything, despite of waiting for a table for a 30 minutes time, the food served is totally disappointing, lack of service, cleanliness, highly priced, and i dont want to talk more about wash rooms - they are just pathetic. Since we were hungry we hit another food joint close by and that was little better but not up to the mark."
,,Good for Indian Food,3.0,,"Little India is a small enclave in this ultra modern city where one can get a feel of Indian food and garments like sarees. The place is generally crowded and unless one is really keen on Indian food, you can give this place a miss."
,,Dirty and overcrowded,2.0,,"We went here just to see what it was like, after visiting Chinatown this place was awful, dirty crammed streets with hardly any room to walk on the pavements for stalls over spilling onto them. Chinatown is far better set out and cleaner. On contrast to the rest of Singapore it was disappointing"
,,Not as good as I had hoped,3.0,,"We went on a busy Sunday for food and was a bit too busy and manic, seemed to be a massive amount of men standing around in the streets, as a heavily tattoo'd couple we were just stared at every shop or place we went. Couldn't find a place to settle and eat. maybe just inexperience, if you are after indian gold there amazing shops that stock beautiful pieces. But just not for us, at the time we went the food market was closed for refurb, so I didn't get any amazing indian food I was after. i'm sure if I knew the place better I would find what i'm after."
,,Great authentic Indian vibe,4.0,,"Well you can't get more authentic Indian then in little India, full of tasty restaurants, tailors, jewellery,souvenirs,clothing and electronics. Vibrant atmosphere and the smell of India with the incense sticks and spices. Lots of bargains to be had and you can haggle. There is also the famous temple there on the main Serangoon Street."
,,Vibrant place for Food and Shopping in Singapore,4.0,,"Most vibrant place in Singapore, plenty of cheap and good food options, actually unlimited varieties, You will be spoilt with choices. Plenty of shops too for clothing to Jewellery and souvenir etc. Do visit the Temples there. Avoid on Sundays when it's Uncomfortably crowded. One...More"
,,"Crowded, noisy......everything I'd expected",4.0,,"Little India is a collection of street shops and stalls selling everything from jewellery to saris to foodstuffs. There is plenty of touristy vibe and seller pressure to come in and look/buy, but also lots of Indian traders and shoppers. Be very careful where you...More"
,,Fantastic Food,5.0,,I really enjoyed my visit here with a huge range of food on offer. Would totally recommend coming here for a visit if you get a chance. For me It gave me a taste of what to expect in India for which I then went.
,,A slice of India in Asia,4.0,,"Although much cleaner than being in India, the choice of restaurants is like being there except no worries of having any tummy issues!"
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"In parts this was a visual feast. But overall on a very hot day, this was too crowded and too dirty for my preferences."
,,Sunday hustle and bustle,4.0,,Great area with lots of great food and some colourful places of worship that are worth a visit. Depending on you love or not of crowds depends on if you should go on Sunday night. Sunday night is totally different to the rest of the...More
,,A little disappointing.,3.0,,Not quite what we were expecting. It was crowded and not very clean. A lot of the shops seemed to be quite dingy and not very inviting. We would not bother to go back again.
,,Great afternoon trip,4.0,,"Visited little India during Dewali, be careful of closings during holidays. The bakeries were lovely, I loved seeing the temples along with the Gandhi museum. Henna in the market was fun. It was generally nice just to stroll and stop in to shops and take...More"
,,Short visit,2.0,,I went to china town first and enjoyed that - so kept on going to then have a look at little india - and from what I can imagine it must be close to the real thing. It's pretty dirty and unpleasant area - and...More
,,Good prices but very dirty,3.0,,Items at good rates but very noisey and dirty so be prepared. Make surento haggle with the shop owners as they try their best to increase prices.
,,Do not go in the night,3.0,,A good place to go for shopping Be careful if you do in the night Not easy to get a taxi to your hotel Be carefull from bargainers
,,"Dirty,disgusting,noisy,expensive",1.0,,"I am lucky because visited little India and I will never consider to visit real India. Everything here was dirty, disgusting and rude people. All selling staff was expensive. Chinatown was better. Indians are very rude here."
,,Well worth the effort to get their,4.0,,"Little India is a district in Singapore that is pretty interesting. Their are shops, jewelry stores, rest., cafe's etc. The highlight however is the central market. You enter from several entrances an you are immediate struck by the smell of fish and poultry being sold. There must have been 20 fish vendors selling all types of fish, crabs, scrimp, etc They would sell the product then if you wanted clean it on the spot. the chicken vendors were chopping up chicken right their in the aisle. Do where fancy clothes for you might get chicken chopping on your shoes or pants. Up stairs and around the side are the clothes, ribbons and dress vendors. Their were several shops who sold Indian women's fancy dresses. The were lovely and colorful; we took a lot of pictures of the stores. Its very crowded and hot but worth the time to visit. Note its a MRT stop so its easy to get to from the cruise terminal."
,,"LITTLE INDIA, SINGAPORE",3.0,,"This is one of the iconic place in SINGAPORE for visitors, who like a feel of INDIA. The streets are full of Indian fares and eateries. The famous department store, MUSTAFA, is located near the end of Little India towards the City Square. Before the control of Alcohol sales, the place would be packed in the evenings/nights on weekend. It is more quieter now. There is a wet market near the other end of Serangoon Road towards Sim Lim towers. There are again many food stores selling all types of Indian food. Some Asian food are also available here. Do visit and have a taste of Little India !!!"
,,Little india,5.0,,Central Location. Lots of Indian food. Veg and non veg. Textiles.. Spices.. Proper little India culture. Taxi are difficult to get here. Very difficult.. Sundays avoid. Very very crowded.
,,"Not real India, but nice to visit",4.0,,Nice to visit and it is famous for excellent restaurants you can many cheap stuff for a dollar and it is impressive how Indian life takes place.
,,Great place if you've never visited Little India before,4.0,,"The rows and rows of shiny, brightly colored clothes and cloth will dazzle you. If you're planning to pick up some gold jewelry and don't mind the bling, this would be a good place to shop."
,,Very colourful and interestingVery colourful and interesting,4.0,,"We took the hop on hop off bus up to here but missed the walking tour so just spent a couple of hours wandering around ourselves.

There are quite a few plaques scattered around explaining the history of the area and buildings.

Also make a stop at the Sri Veeramakaliamman Hindu Temple and look at the many shrines to Kali.
You might get lucky like we did and witness a ceremony of two.

Afterwards continue up the street for some lunch and retail therapy."
,,Special,5.0,,"This is probably the noisiest, dirtiest, most crowded and most dangerous part of Singapore, but keep in mind that you are in Singapore so it's nothing (or at least very less) to worry about.
It was the only place we saw beggars in the city.
Certainty is a world apart compared to other neighborhoods.
Anyway, it truly deserves a visit."
,,Very crowded and feels exactly as India,3.0,,"The place is good but very crowded compared t the other parts of Singapore.
If you are craving for indian food then please go visit as they have very nice and cheap indian food outlets.
But other than that there is no good reason to visit little India, staying at Sentosa is a far better option."
,,Can be skipped !!,3.0,,"If you're from India, or have visited India, I suggest you avoid this place. Its pretty and organized. A bustling market with all sorts of stuff. But I'd suggest if you plan to visit Little India, definitely go to Mustafa Centre. You'll find everything there...literally everything !!"
,,"Vibrancy, Color and so much more",5.0,,"We had heard all about Little India so had to make the effort and go. We were certainly not disappointed as there was some much to see and do from the Temples and shops to the vibrant colors and amazing smells that tempted the senses.

There are so many little shops full of knick knacks, so be prepared to spend a bit of time."
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"We had heard great reviews of Little India and several people had recommended it to us so off we went. I don't really know what it was, but we were disappointed. It was certainly full of people and had a certain buzz about it, but all the shops seemed to offer the same, not much variety. When looking for material, there was plenty there but to make sari's and nothing much else. There were so many jewellery stores offering everything that sparkled and so much gold, but prices were a bit steep to us. We spent 1/2 an hour here and by then we had enough so we left and waked to Buggis Street which we enjoyed much more."
,,Vibrant,5.0,,"A must see when in Singapore from the moment you arrive your senses will be delighted with glorious colours, fragrance and sounds. Loads of amazing authentic affordable food. Ramadan is an especially good time to buy jewelry and very cheap well made clothing.
I will definitely return"
,,Nice place just another place to buy,5.0,,We enjoyed little india but it is just full of stuff to buy but there are more impressive places to visit in Singapore
,,Lots of Activity,4.0,,The whole area is constantly full of hustle and bustle. Tekka with its farmer's market vendors and clothing vendors is always a great place to stroll around. Lots of color everywhere!!!!!!
,,PLEASE AVOID,1.0,,"At all costs. Waste of time and money. Such a low grade area . Dont know why Singapore Govt allowed such a ghetto to develop. All shops have Chinese extremely low grade merchandise.

The restaurants (eateries to be exact) are horrible and only good for the labors camps under which they run their business.

Strictly no no for any self respecting family."
,,Vibrant Place!!,4.0,,Staying in a hotel in Little India Singapore was a nice experience. This place is a vibrant place with rich Indian culture. Can find wide variety of Indian restaurants and shops. Mustafa center shopping mall is another attaraction for those who love shopping in Little India.
,,A riot of colours,5.0,,"An early morning ride in the front seat on the upper deck of a double decker bus took me to Little India in Singapore.
Loitering on the streets of 'Little India' when the shops are yet to open - capturing the colourful facades & architecture of the old colonial buildings on camera. What a riot of colours ! Hundreds of restaurants slowly coming alive with the buzz of the people dropping in for their breakfast. You are spoilt for choice - MTR, Sarvanna Bhavan, Anand Bhavan, Komala Vilas, Murugan Idly Shop.
You get the feel of being transported to a a town in South India !"
,,Like a local,3.0,,"The colorful buildings and crowded Indians there, most are man. I just see a few woman there. Good to know a little lifestyle of India while ordering the food there. It was kind of hard for me to eat this food. I am not really like it though."
,,Hmmmm,2.0,,Cheap prices if you're shopping. Found some of the streets a little dirty also the strong food smell put me off a little bit. But if you enjoy Indian food you must come here.
,,Lots of colour and life,4.0,,Great area to wander and embrace the strong Indian community vibe. Traditional Chinese houses filled with Indian restaurants and shops. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
,,India housed in Singapore,4.0,,"Little India is miniature India in Singapore, and one can find everything and anything Indian, from temples to mosques to shops and eateries catering to Indian likes, in this rather crowded locality. The two not to be missed places are Mustafa, the 24 hour 7 days departmental store providing all Indian needs; and the second is Komal Vilas, South Indian restaurant with authentic dishes. The prices are modest."
,,Little India is Worth Seeing,4.0,,"I found this area to be more interesting than Chinatown. It has some interesting architecture and the shops and food stalls seem more interesting. There are some nice jewelry shops as well, nice Indian clothing stores, and the fruit and vegetable markets make it interesting. Small area but worth the visit. Interesting that there is a Chinese merchant villa in the middle of the area that is quite striking with its many different colors and at the entrance to Chinatown there is Indian temple. Demonstrates the multi culture and the nice relationship among the ethnic and religious groups in Singapore."
,,Nothing much here,2.0,,"Don't even think of going here on a Sunday when all the migrant workers (men) have their day off. Crowded is an understatement! They just stand around doing nothing and blocking the pavement. I'd much rather to the Farrer park area where you could find much of the same things (Indian shops, restaurants, fabric, etc.). I was impressed by the very fresh fruits and vegetables sold in the markets, but I suppose you don't have to go to Little India just for that!"
,,BIG Love for Little India,4.0,,Walking through Little India was very special for us. My son has an affinity for the culture and my daughter studied there. We ended up buying saris and Bollywood CDs.
,,A taste of India,4.0,,"A place wherein you will experience the India back home - from the grocery store to the fruit wala, from the local indian cuisine to the dialect and tone. Do go if you miss the food back home - has the famous Saravana Bhawan to the Copper chimney to Anand Parbat to what not."
,,India in Singapore,4.0,,If you want to taste Indian foods in Singapore Little India is the location to find such foods. also there are Sarees and number of items which you can find in India. 95% of the population are Indians. You can find hindu Kovils also in Little India in Singapore
,,Interesting Place,4.0,,I like the market in the Little India so fresh and cheap even I won't buy it as I do not have a kitchen. You can find cheap stuff there and do some tattoo for fun. They also sell gold there .. haha... not bad though.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,Do not waste your time visiting Little India. Fresh fruit and tacky gold shops are everywhere. Time could be spent at other areas like Arab Street
,,Little india in Singapore,5.0,,This is good shopping place for Indian .In Mustafa market you will find few unique items to buy.Lot of Indian restaurant are here and with Indian style of food.
,,Well worth a visit to this vibrant area,5.0,,"A taxi driver recommended that we visit Little India and we weren't disappointed when we took up his suggestion. The area is full of colour, wonderful smells and plenty of interesting little shops peddling everything from clothes to antiques to food. We stopped at a cafe for dinner, managed to communicate our needs to the wonderfully attentive non-English speaking staff and enjoyed a beautifully authentic Indian meal."
,,Markets,5.0,,Loved little India. Definitely put it in your list to explore and get lost around. Grab a dosia when you there. Plenty of shopping and food. Easy to get to on the underground train.
,,Mistake,1.0,,"Having seen everything else Singapore had to offer, we headed to Little India. It's easily accessible via the Metro. We arrived early morning, but nothing was open. The streets we littered with everything biological and otherwise from the night before. There were a few food stalls open, but it was uninviting."
,,The best place in Sg,5.0,,"I spent in Singapore 1 week. HAve to say that it was probably the best place there. You can feel almost like in India :) Great architecture, nice people, indian temples and stores. You can feel the real culture"
,,All Indian affair,4.0,,"What is a town without little india? Lots of stores, restaurants, shops, malls. Try their authentic banana leaf meal, walk around. It is accessible by mrt, bus, taxi or cars."
,,Experience India in Singapore,4.0,,"Little India provides everything wanted by Indians, be it food, clothing, traditional jewellery or home supplies. The not-to-be-missed Mustafa Departmental Shop, open 24 hours a day, provides every necessity for local Indians as well as visitors, at reasonable prices. The locality has a number of Indian restaurants catering specialities from different regions of India. It also has temple and mosque for prayers by Indians."
,,Riot of Colour,4.0,,"Go and wander, colour everywhere. Saris, tops, dresses, leggings something for everyone. The richness of the colours are incredible. You just want to soak up the atmosphere. Don't forget the smell of the spices."
,,Colorful Indian enclave in central Singapore,4.0,,Easiest access is by MRT to Little India Station - narrow streets with colorful double story houses and small shops selling just about everything - numerous restaurants and eating houses - curry aromas and incense compete with each other - you can follow a walking tour of a dozen or so wall murals and there is an informative Heritage Center - worthy of a short visit or to enjoy a good Indian meal - untidy (for Singapore) in places.
,,First place I found was dirty in Singapore,1.0,,"We went to Little India planning to eat there and possibly shop.....But when we came out of the MRT station our first impressions were not good. It is the first place in Singapore we felt was dirty/grubby; AND we were not comfortable walking around. We had a brief look but could not get over our first impressions.
We left and had dinner elsewhere."
,,Good location has character.,4.0,,Stayed in hotel 81 Dickson in little india. Good spot in relation to location in city. Lots of so called coffee shops around which sold beer relatively cheap to Singapore standards. Plenty of restaurants in the area all pretty much good standard some opened 24 hours. If you venture down Lane ways you would think you were in India. Many migrant workers around especially Sunday evenings but never had a problem. Used to have a drink in Indian bar beside hotel very busy . Just sit and watch the world go by. I would not hesitate to go back there to use as base in Singapore.
,,It is actually India!!,4.0,,"The whole place and roads looks like you are shopping in Colaba, Mumbai or Karol Bagh in Delhi.

The people are also similar and the activities that is going on is also Indian. If anyone wants to live in India, being in Singapore, this is the right place to be.

From Vegetarian food to temples to cheap products with huge negotiation, this place has everything."
,,Good for a morning visit,4.0,,"There are a few small bits of street art that are cool, lots of places to eat traditional indian food and lots of shops which i am pretty sure you could buy anything you wanted, ($2 sunglasses!)
Easy to get to via ""little India"" MRT station"
,,Nice place,4.0,,"I was surprised by this nice place, oriental shops and restaurant. i had also done henna on my hand and it was amazing. I recommend to visit this part of Singapore during your stay there."
,,"As Chinatown, not worth a special visit",2.0,,With so many other and modern places better ways to spend your time than little India. Did not find a nice restaurant and many places were dirty or at least looked far from clean...
,,Disappointed,1.0,,"Whilst the flower makers stalls are pretty they are also filled with bees.
We walked around the streets here and there was not much to see at all. We caught the cab here and I thought it was a waste of money. I was really looking forward to seeing this and went home feeling really disappointed"
,,really feels like India,4.0,,It is a different attraction in Singapore with kinds of Indian shops and restaurants.We had a great lunch at a vegetarian restaurant with really delicious food.
,,Shopping on the cheap,3.0,,I have been here many times. Cheap shopping available; Ok for Indian restaurants with Indian foods; it's always bit crowded.
,,Little india,4.0,,I spent an afternoon with walking through Little India. It was a truly enjoyable walk with many interesting things to see on the streets. It is a program you can do in 2-3 hours.
,,"A different experience, the lunch was excellent",4.0,,"Got off the Bus to have a look, but was fascinated with the food, and decided to have lunch in an eatery crowded with locals The meal was served on a tray lined with palm leaf,was huge,had several courses and was delicious I loved the ""pulled tea"" No upset tummy either!"
,,Comfort,4.0,,The best part of being in Singapore is the effective transport service. As a result I was able to live in Little India and commute myself by train to other areas of the mega city. Simply an affordable area to live in with loads of shops (as expected) and variety of traditional eateries to choose from for an optimal Indian experience outside India.
,,Nice but touristy,3.0,,"If you have no experience with the india culture before, you'll find this place attractive. Colors, smell of jasmine flowers, food. Hit the back lanes for less touristy stuff. You won't get lost. So just enjoy and roam. A lot of shops has been replaced by shops that sells only touristy stuff now. Avoid sundays because it'll be very crowded, a day off for the community in general."
,,Alright for a 20 minute stop whilst on the Hop on Hop off Bus üöå,3.0,,"It's on the Hop on Hop off Bus route.

Alright for a 20 minute explore. One street was really colourful and the markets seemed interesting, but did get hassled to buy things. Drank from a coconut with a straw.

One of those 'things' to tick off the list whilst in Singapore."
,,Nice Indian Place,5.0,,You will not believe that you are in some foreign country. It gives you feeling that you are in South India.
,,A great place to roam,5.0,,"This is a wonderful assault ion your senses, make sure you eat in one of the restaurants down the side streets - amazing"
,,Gorgeous colors!,4.0,,"Walking around Little India is a must do while in Singapore. The colors and aromas are amazing! There are many shops to buy souvenirs, clothing, flowers and food. Stop in to Tekka Center to see all the colorful saris and bangles. Be sure to bargain! Bring your appetite for some fantastic Indian food."
,,"Culture, food, shopping and atmosphere.",5.0,,"Brilliant place to visit. Full of atmosphere and energy. Great shops selling clothes,jewellery, saris, food, toys, etc. Great restaurants.Mustafa Centre is a visit in its self as its huge and has almost everything you could ever want. Beautiful temple is worth visiting as well. Tekka centre has food court, clothes and a wet market."
,,Mixed experience,2.0,,"We visited Little India a few years ago and enjoyed the sights, smells and sounds of India - the spices on sale, the bollywood music, the colourful buildings - and of course the food, which is delicious and authentic. However when we returned a few weeks ago we had a very different experience. The streets were crowded but 99% of the people were men - virtually no women or children anywhere - and the constant stares at my wife made us feel uncomfortable. Perhaps this was because it was a Sunday and it would be more pleasant another day of the week. Everywhere else in Singapore the people are friendly, polite and respectful so I would give Little India a miss."
,,Interesting place to spent a Sunday morning,4.0,,"I brought a friend's daughter from USA to visit Little India on a Sunday morning. We started at Mustafa Shopping Centre, which is a huge department store cum supermarket. You can find practically everything there and it is opened 24 hours. A bit crowded inside the store, but has a good range of products with good prices. We then proceeded to Serangoon road towards the Tekka market. There are a mosque Indian temples and churches in the area. Bought some Indian sweets from Komala Vilas . There were manay shops selling fruits and we bought some Alfonso mangoes. After all the walking, we decided to stop for lunch at the Banana Leaf Apollo at Race Course Road. It's a good place to bring foreign visitors for a visit."
,,"Delicious Indian food, takeaway available!",5.0,,"Really lovely food. My boyfriend and I stayed in a hotel in Durban for 3 nights and ended up getting takeaway from Little India twice - we are both really into our food and like trying different places, but it was just that tasty!
Tried the tandoori prawns and chicken, lamb kadai, madras chicken, little India lamb curry and lamb biryani, all excellent, and garlic naan was one of the best we've ever had. They brought us free basmati rice and sambals, which was nice. Takeaway took about 40 to 50 minutes. Great meals, very reasonably priced!"
,,Combine Indian Heritage Center with Food and Shopping to Maximize Your Visit!,5.0,,"Little India is a favorite neighborhood of mine as I spent six plus years in Singapore, Mustapha and local eateries are great for shopping and food. We always enjoy eating dosia and idli at various places. Walk around the streets and paths near the Indian Heritage Center and explore it all! There are capable docents at the center to delight you with stories of Shiva, Ganesha, and Visnu. Museum artefacts abound. There are countless places to eat and we treid doxens over the years, all tasty and filling. Visits during harvest festivals and other holidays are wonderful. Thaipusam is a thrilling but very long procession once a year that should not be missed!"
,,Little India is India itself outside India,5.0,,"During my week long Singapore trip, there is no day that I didn't visit Little India. Right from flowers, temples, gold, Indian restaurants, agarbatti, water, fresh vegetable market and many more small house hold things are available here. It is easily accessible by MRT as well. Lots of south indians reside here and they have their own shops too. Felt very happy to see a seperate locality for Indians in Singapore."
,,Average place to go,3.0,,It a bit congested area. To much people running from here and there. Good for shopping and quick food. Overall average
,,Amazing shopping and eating in Littel India,4.0,,"You have to visit Little India when you visit Singapore, The streets are a bustle with shops, eating houses (they call them restaurants) but the informal and unconventional way of dinning is a great experience, eating of banana leaves, the aromas and color of the food will make you go back for more. for shopping you have to visit Mustafars,
visit the Temples, and experience the people.
but be careful , smoking is strictly controlled, littering and spitting can land you in hot water, that's why Singapore is so clean. If you like to shop , eat and just meet people Little India is a must to visit"
,,it is indeed Little India in Singapore,5.0,,"You will sometimes forget you're in Singapore everything looks, feels and smell India.
From the shops lining the streets, with Indian music playing on the background, the flowers and colorful sari's will make you feel that you are really in India.

Don't forget to eat in one of the many Indian restaurant in the area."
,,Exotic felt in the middle of Singapore,4.0,,"We easily got here on MRT. Walking around the town with everything Indian from the small groceries store to the cinema. The people here reserve their culture pretty well and all the religious elements are worshiped sacredly. Yet, the people might be slightly conservative when it comes to socializing while most of Singaporean are extremely friendly and open-minded."
,,The name explains it all,4.0,,"You literally feel like you're in India as soon as you step into Serangoon. It feels like home in every way. The lights, people, decorations, shops, warm smiles and food. It is a popular spot for tourists too. Loved it and it's really nice to spend an evening, walk on the streets and step into a few souvenir stores. The food is amazing too."
,,Cut this one from your itinerary,3.0,,"I think 'Little India' gets lumped in with its adjacent 'Chinatown' as a standard stop for tourists visiting Singapore. My partner and I followed this formula recently. On the positive side we enjoyed a lunch in one of the restaurants. `On the negative side I found the suburb to really just be a continuous line of gold jewellery stores, without much character or any particular one tourist attraction (ie a temple or something similar) to add much weight to the visit. The only unique feature of this suburb was it's dirtiness which was a stark contrast to the cleanliness of singapore."
,,A glimpse of the past,5.0,,"Wandering down Sarangoon Road is a thrill any time of day. The footpaths are generally packed as shoppers peruse the many small shops spilling onto the street.

Stores selling a variety of consumer goods: clothes, bags, footwear and electronics line this thoroughfare interspersed with eateries that fill the air with enticing aromas. If you enjoy watching people, this is an excellent location to just drift.

Little India fills the senses, and gives a glimpse into the commercial lives of Singapore's Indian population. Although it has changed over the years, it seems to have avoided the disease of franchises currently sweeping the city."
,,An India out site India,4.0,,If you set your step in evening at this place believe me you need to to come to India to see. I feel realy like home. I never felt like i am in Singapore. A lot of eating options are available but food is not that good.
,,Very tipical suburb,4.0,,"A good place to spend a few Hours,you can Enter in The heart of indu culture.colourfull and happy environment."
,,Ignore the naysayers!,5.0,,"In a city which seems devoid of any soul, little India was a joy. If you're tired of wandering around a generic western, expensive city and are looking for some kind of excitement, then make the effort to stop by.

I lived in India for a while and nothing beats the buzz of spending time within an Indian community.

Finally, after a couple of days of tourist tedium I felt like I was somewhere real, and it was a pleasure to be among such hospitable people and places selling such fantastic food.

As for those who warn against visiting on the proviso that the area is flooded by men who gawp at western women, yes, Indian culture is male dominant, but they stare out of curiosity just as we all do at the different. This is their home and we are visitors. Sometimes tourists have such an air of superiority and prissiness.

Perhaps my experience was made by being invited to join an engagement celebration, or just that this was the first time in Singapore when people actually took the time to greet and talk to me.

Go."
,,Walk through,3.0,,"The sights, sounds,colours, and smells. If you shut your eyes you could imagine being in a city on the sub continent. A bit scruffy overall but worth a walk through without staying unless you are desperate to seek out Indian food."
,,Crappy,2.0,,"Was so looking forward to going here even left our tour to go it on our own. Full of cheap crappy markets, full on madness, dirty, (pretty much like India) just disappointed with such a must visit thing to do in Singapore."
,,Bring your walking shoes and your appetite,5.0,,"We used the SMRT to travel to Little India and came out on the edge of it. Walking into the centre and Mustafa (the HUGE shopping center) provided us an opportunity to see some smaller shops and temples. The sights, sounds, and smells change at each turn and are all wonderful. The colors of the silk and flash of gold are almost overwhelming and should not be missed."
,,India in Singapore,5.0,,"Little India is an ethnic district in Singapore where you may find lots of India in general and Tamilian in particular roaming around in their traditional clothes. It is very close to the MRT Dhouby Ghaut, i.e, next station towards Punggol on North East Line. Next station from Little India is Farrer Park where famous store Mustafa Centre is located from there you can have all sorts of shopping. In Little India you will find lots of Indian shops and Indian restaurants as well. This is the only area in Singapore where you may cross from the mid of the road without the traffic light signal."
,,Quaint,4.0,,"This is a small essence of India.
As soon as you enter, you get the feeling of being in india....the bustle & the noise send a wave of happibess through you.
There are scattered indian food places which offer a variety of indian delicacies to try.
The small shops provide a wealth of choice to shop for souvenirs that we might want to take home as gifts.
Its also a place which provides a good deal for electronics or gadgets."
,,India away from India,3.0,,"As the name suggests, this place is exactly a replica of India. Crowded, it boasts of tons of Indian restaurants and hotels. The famous Mustafa Shopping Center is located here."
,,Best place!,5.0,,"My partner and I love to just sit and watch people go past. We had the best time in Singapore - there's so much to see and do, but the highlight was sitting in a busy local market in Little India watching food being cooked and consumed, with all the locals buzzing and hurrying around us in the heat.

We joined in on the consumption and had a cheese roti and a mango lassi - scrumptious and surrounded by all this free entertainment and chaos! Just the best.

Wandered about looking at the shops and architecture in Little India for a while. Does tend to become a bit same same (we've seen a lot of Asia) but that stay in the market was a stand-out. I wish you the same joy."
,,So many Indian restaurants and Mustafa located!,5.0,,Little India is at a walking distance from ParkRoyal hotel. There is Mustafa shopping center which is 24*7. So many India restaurants are there and a Mall city Walk is also there just in front of the hotel.
,,Not my type of place !!,1.0,,"We were looking forward to visiting this area and chose the right hop on / hop off bus to get us there.

Once we were off the bus we pretty much immediately regretted our decision.

It is not so for wandering around and looking. If you want to buy something - and know what (like gold or jewellery) then I'm sure it's fine. If you are simply having a look it's quite hard work.

The Main Street is impressive, but it can be seen in five minutes. Any longer is physically draining.

If you have lots on your list to do, I'd Dave time and skip this one."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,After seeing Chinatown and Arab street we were left disappointed by Little India. The place is dirty which is is all wrong for Singapore. The shopping was disappointing and over priced. We were glad we visited but wont be back.
,,AVOID!!!!,1.0,,Dirty. Smelly. Scary. And don't bother if you're white. Such a shame there's a dump like this associated with Singapore. 'Nuff said.
,,Complete waste of time,1.0,,"This place is dirty, smells bad, and your nonexistent if your white. My girlfriend wanted to buy some beautiful material and they didn't give her the time of day. Skip this place and head to Chinatown where you can enjoy yourself."
,,nice place,5.0,,"stayed in little india when i went to singapore , this place also have mustafa for shopping and restaurants indian food very yummy ..love it"
,,Little India Arts Belt,4.0,,Beautiful Arts Belt in Little India. Explore yourself to enjoy the arts on walls. You may take pictures with it to form part of the art.
,,Little India,3.0,,Little India felt like home. Lot of Indian restaurants to choose. Avoid going on Sundays as the place gets very crowded.
,,A taste of India in Singapore,5.0,,"Allow at least 3hours to wander through this area. Check out the fish markets, the fruit and veg. I even found mangosteens.... delicious. Have lunch inside the markets and experience great Indian food at very low prices. Finish with a visit to Mustafa's store ... if you can't get what you want here you probably can't get it anywhere. Great fun."
,,Muat visit place,4.0,,"It's a must visit place for all Indian food lovers. The place offers almost all varieties of Indian restaurants. The taste is almost same as in India. Also, you can find shopping space here."
,,Decent Locality with Sizeable Indian Diaspora,3.0,,"My first experience of being in Little India was being feeling like home, as I'm Indian, Little India apart from Indians has Bangladeshi, Srilankans too. The place at times gets too congested, parking even for a Taxi can be cumbersome. I rated it 3 as I didn't find this place , clean like , I would say. I found trash on the footpath etc. People are good there, lot of Indian restaurants to choose from but at a premium price."
,,Little India,3.0,,Good to go during the Deepavali period when the festive street lights are up. Avoid going on Sundays where it gets very crowded
,,Not much to see,3.0,,"If you like Indian food then i guess this is the place to go, but other than the odd temple there is not much to see here."
,,Enchanting!,4.0,,"To truly experience Singapore, Little India is one of those enchanting places you must visit ‚Äì best done on foot. There are several colourful and interesting temples as well as vibrant and fascinating shopping precincts etc. We marked out a route on a map, to be sure to cover the main sites. Then, appropriately dressed for temple visits, and with some bottled water to stay hydrated, we took a cab to the newly renovated Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple at 555 Serangoon Road. From there we walked via Beatty Rd to Racecourse Rd to see the Leong Sar Temple and Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple then along to the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, across to the Mustafa Centre off Serangoon Rd (in Syed Alwi Rd) then further along Serangoon Rd (with interesting shops along the way) to the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. Next, we walked beside that temple along Belilios Rd and via Chandler Rd to see the Shree Laksfminarayan Temple and then the nearby colourful Tan House at Kerbau Rd. From there we walked and browsed the interesting shopping precincts of Buffalo Rd and the Little India Arcade at the corner of Serangoon Rd and Campbell Lane. After that we visited the distinctly different Arab sector, via the Abdul Gafoor Mosque at Dunlop St, then across to and via Arab St to see sites in Kampong Glam, before catching a cab back to our hotel. Be sure to have easily removed footwear, and wear respectful clothing to enter the temples. Visitors are welcome and non-flash photography is generally allowed. However, where worship was in progress at some places, we observed in silence at the entrance so as not to disturb or be disrespectful. Just a handful of shrines within the temples are off limits, but you still get to see plenty."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Whatever you want Induan, this is the place. It is a riot of colour both in the market and the mall. At the entrance to the area there are two huge man made peacocks with the feathers made from flowers. Very impressive. Lots of Induan restaurants from which to choose. One of our highlights fir sure."
,,Out of this world,5.0,,"I went out of my way to visit Little India every day as the food, people, displays and shops were incredible."
,,Real spirit of India in a Singapore,5.0,,"It a perfect place in Singapore, weather yo want to shop for something, of just wanna go there and experience Indian culture. And much, much safer than in India. :)"
,,Waste of time,2.0,,Visited LI this morning was not impressed dirty streets not very friendly could not see why it is a tourist spot. To me it was a waste of time. Know good shopping area.
,,Cultural Evening Visit,4.0,,"Visited 'Little India' in Singapore during the Deepavali Festival.
Our visit was in the evening - the area was extremely busy.
There were numerous stalls selling Indian costumes, food etc.
The only drawback to the visit was that it was difficult to obtain a taxi ride from the area back to our hotel."
,,Glimpse of india,4.0,,"Haven't been to India? And u r in Singapore.. this place will give a glimpse of average Indian city. Though the name is little India there are restaurants run by Pakistanis, afganis and Bangladeshi in name of indians. So one need to carefully choose place to eat if they want to taste real Indian food. There are shops which sells Indian sweets . One can explore this place for shopping and eating."
,,Return trip Little India,3.0,,Not been to Little India for many years so went back to see what had changed. Much the same though slightly run down and during the day nothing much open except on Main Street. Not so vibrant - sad. However Indian lunch in Banana Leaf restaurant was good.
,,Enjoyable couple of hours,4.0,,"Our little group love Indian food but didn't know where to start. Decided to do a walking food tour.
Great morning...
We walked through the markets fresh vegetables and fruit.. smells were amazing.
Walked down streets full of gold jewellery shops and amazing stalls with fresh flowers that are made into religious offerings. I couldn't believe the amount of work that went into them.
Visited a shopping mall a fish market and a temple.

Sampled the food in a couple of places that had we been on our own we probably wouldn't have stopped as we wouldn't have understood the menu. Food was divine.
Loved our little interlude ... we visited mid morning on a Sunday so things were reasonably quiet as we were advised by afternoon and evening it is extremely busy."
,,Truely little India,5.0,,"A place where u find all the Indian vendors. vegetable/fruits stalls on street, lots of jewelry shops, Indian restaurants n most imp Indian ppl around. There are many Indian restaurants like kailash parbat, komalas, MTR. You won't miss Indian taste here.."
,,Nice Day out,5.0,,Lovely place the buildings are very colourful very neat and clean lovely small parks. Easy to get to by MRT Mustafa Centre is close by. We visited the temple which was nice food was lovely great Place to visit.
,,Not worth it,2.0,,We came here to see the temples but it just didn't have a nice feel to the place. It's crowded and smells. Not worth going to see.
,,Free Walking Tour,5.0,,"Great insight to this area by local guide Roger, gave insight into culture and religion relevant to the area, great historical information and saw so much in the two hours, would recommend to anyone."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"I didn't enjoy little India at all. I was expecting something like Chinatown, where you feel like you are in a different cultural section of a city. I felt like there was just some Indian restaurants, some gold shops, and lots malls."
,,Thank God for this Place,4.0,,Nice place...desi food... Comparative cheaper hotels and thank god for MUSTAFFA...we could shop a bit.
,,Great Cultural Experience,5.0,,"Awesome culture-rich experience. The peace and calm of both the Hindu & Buddhist temples was amazing and exactly what my heart, soul and mind needed in the midst of all of the touristy activities in Singapore. Would definitely recommend a visit. If, like me, you prefer less hustle and bustle, visit earlier. It gets hectic in the evenings. Waited for over an hour for a taxi upon leaving. The food and service at the Banana Leaf restaurant was average, but a welcome respite from the outdoor heat. I found Komala's sweetmeats to be over-rated."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"A wonderful place to visit, very safe, and very authentic. You really do get the feel that you are in Mumbai or New Delhi. A tour would have been a good idea, because you are not sure where to buy, and what everything is."
,,a little piece of india,5.0,,I went to this place right after pongal I should see a cleaner piece of India decorated for pongal. The roads were full of banners and lights were lit during the night on these roads...
,,A Little bit of India,3.0,,"For the love of Indian food and shopping, it is a must to visit Little India. Our most preferred place to eat is Apollo Banana Leaf and the Jungle Restaurant. Best place to see Litttle India is during Diwali festival time. Only downside is that some lanes are not very clean and stink. Its not the cleanest place in Singapore."
,,The Dark Side,2.0,,"We were very disappointed with our return visit to Little India, the area seems to have become very run down, dark and gloomy. There were huge numbers around, but people appeared listless and bored. A large police presence was noted, some armed. We visited Mustaphas,but it also appears to have become completely rundown, and it is in a building with fire exits that I doubt follow stringent Singapore code."
,,Little India,4.0,,"Little India is just simply a lovely experience of how India is like.It's has so many things to visit in Little India like the fish market.People live their and they shop in little shops on the side.It doesn't have much wifi in certain places but if you visit Little India, you won't even need wifi because their is always no time to waste in Little India!If you need a taxi for any reason don't worry, because they're always close in sight.However their products are a bit pricey, but you can get whatever you want."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"We took an hour out to travel on the metro and explore little India. Unfortunately we did not see any of the buzz that we expected, more just a run down part of Singapore. A few nice and colourful buildings but the temple was closed and the streets rather quiet.

Wasn't worth the trip out of the downtown area for us."
,,Good Location,3.0,,Good location and could reach the bus station only by walking. There is no breakfast here but it is very easy to find food around the hotel especially Chinese & Indian food. You could go to visit SIM LIM Tower also SIM LIM Square by walking.
,,lots of shopping and great food.,4.0,,There are several shops along the streets and alleys. In Racecourse road there are many restaurants to choose from. I highly recommend the banana leaf restaurant to have the fish head curry. It truly is amazing.
,,You would feel as if you are in India,4.0,,"Its replica of city like chennai. Lots of Indian restaurants and shops (gold, dresses), mustafa mall. There are couple of good hotels walkable distance like Village Albert. Definitely the place is clean but feels short of rest of places in Singapore."
,,Little India,2.0,,We were not too impressed by Little India and saw more of Indian culture in a Hindu temple in Chinatown. Don't go here with expectations and don't choose here over Chinatown if you are short of time.
,,Nice Area,4.0,,A sizable section catering to the many Indians who live in Singapore. A rather old area that have preserved. Naturally lots of Indian restaurants and stores.
,,Little India,4.0,,I have been here many times before. Mostly crowded never to go during festive times ir weekends. There is a restriction on alcohol consumption after the riots which happened here few years ago. You get all Indian food items here. Prefer to buy vegetables here as mostly are imported from India and very fresh.
,,Take a self-guided tour,4.0,,"Well, not entirely self-guided. Go to the National Heritage Board and pick up any number of their excellent free guides such as the Little India Heritage Trail booklet (70 information packed pages) and the fold out map with three suggested walks. Do one , do all, or create your own. In any case, you will have all the information that you need. The Mustafa Centre is a fascinating place to see contemporary Indian shopping in Singapore. Where bars and restaurants are concerned, check out where the locals are and join them. Race Course Road has more up-market restaurants such as the popular Banana Leaf Apollo, but you will probably have as good an experience with the locals one road over on Chander Road."
,,Feeling of India,5.0,,Little India is a well known place in Singapore. You will have a feeling of India when you move around this place. Majority of the shops and hotels are owned by Indian and so are all the people who are working in this establishment.
,,Getting swallowed up by China,3.0,,"This is a must-see area of Singapore but there seem to be more and more Chinese signs and businesses, even on the main streets. I recommend walking here rather than taking a taxi. We first spent a couple of hours walking around the Arab street area and the Masjid Sultan mosque, then walked past the Muslim and Old Malay cemeteries, which are magical, to Little India, which is just a few blocks. I recommend walking straight to the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, and then up Serangoon Road, where there are many things to see and little streets in each direction with interesting shops and people. Like I say, there is a proliferation of Chinese signs and businesses, in ""Little India"", but it's a great place to visit while in Singapore. Not everything in this town is brand spanking new, which is refreshing."
,,Interesting and worth a visit,3.0,,"Easy stroll around this part of the city taking in all the sights, colors and smells. Nothing in particular to see other than a few temples and shophouses. In any event a worthwhile few hours strolling around."
,,Loved Little India.,5.0,,Perhaps because I love Indian food I really loved it in Little India. Nice shops and friendly people and had a great meal at a very cheap price. Would visit here on any subsequent visit to Singapore.
,,Vibrant,3.0,,"The journey on the MRT made Little India very easy to visit. Exit the station, and your senses go into overload. There is so much to see, smell and touch. The colours of the shops and produce made it enjoyable. The fresh flowers being made into offerings was beautiful. The flowers were so fresh, they were covered in bees. The area itself was a bit run down, which added to it authentic feel. If you want to buy gold or fresh vegetables, here is the spot. Barging when purchasing, is expected. You can find a bargain if you haggle well."
,,A clean and tidy version of India?,4.0,,"Little India is a small neighborhood that manages to mix the traditional life of an Indian city (hundreds of little shops, great cheap food, plenty of colors and smells, traffic) with traditional Singapore (organized, clean, lively, unthreatening).
A stroll around the little streets (Buffalo Road, Dickson Road, Campbell Lane) is a great way of experiencing a bit of Indian without enduring the challenges of real India.
And walk around until you find the colorful holy cows!"
,,Plenty of shops & amazing food!,4.0,,"If you're a lover of Indian food, you'll certainly be happy here. There are also shops selling everything from electronics to clothes. The old colonial buildings are wonderful."
,,Visit here...even if only for the food,4.0,,"Imagine stepping out of a bustling metropolis into another world...that is Little India, Singapore. The food is heaven - so much to choose from, the market shops come in a variety of every type you could imagine from telco & electronics, clothing, shoes, gold, souvenirs and too many more to mention. Then in the side streets you have the old colonial housing, some run down to almost demolishing point, others just amazingly restored. Little India is always busy, especially on Sundays. Put on you comfortable shoes because it,s worth spending a day there."
,,Great Food and Interesting Shopping to be had,4.0,,"Little India is well worth a visit. Not a lot to see other than inexpensive shops selling mainly Indian attire and there are plenty of florists too Also there are is a wide selection of very inexpensive and rather tasty eating establishments, or hawker stalls. We dined for SG$12 for two people The locals are very welcoming"
,,Truly India,4.0,,"This place is truly a Little India with small contribution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also. You will not miss India once you are in this area. Famous Mustafa Centre is also located in this neighborhood. The food, the people and the cleanliness around :P all give you the feel of India. There are multiple Indian eating joints here. People are very friendly and helpful."
,,Like being in India,4.0,,"Interestin place to visit. It's like being in India with all the shops, people, restaurants and stalls in the area. The odour of spices i the air too reminds you of that. You can even do henna there. However some diffrence is that it's clean. You can even get a variety of things to buy either from the street stalls or shopping mall and eat delicious, hot newly cook meal for very reasonable price by the food stalls.
There's also an interesting tempel and wet market nearby.
Don't go there on a Sunday!!"
,,Puts China Town to shame,5.0,,"This appears to be an authentic Indian neighborhood with grocery stores and florists dedicated to the Singapore Indian expats.The jewelry stores are legion and the Hindu Temple is a remarkable place to visit (take off your shoes). I was struck by the piousness of those worshiping in this colorful enclave/building. I also found the rituals to be very interesting, but I don't know much about the Hindu religion."
,,Great Shopping Place,5.0,,"This one of famous shopping bazaar in Singapore with great bargain rate. You will get foods, dress shoe fantasy items and some good massage parlors also."
,,Colorful,3.0,,Went to Little India during my stay in Singapore. I was quite surprise how dirty the area was. But not a big deal. The Whole area is so colorful and crowded.
,,Exciting area,4.0,,Loved this area of Singapore. Colorful flower shops full of beautiful garlands of sweet smelling flowers and Indian music drifts out of shops as you pass by. Should have done more research on prices comparable of sari's and jewelry. Didn't know what a good rang would be and since they were will to bargain.
,,Named little but big adventurous !,5.0,,"Very first time in Singapore, Universal or Merlion was not the place I thought about. 'Little India', a little community where you guys should visit once when staying in Singapore. This place was so amazing decorated and painted colorfully. not only the place but the people is also nice, they were so natural, truly honest to help you and greet you for coming their town. Moreover, their food is very interesting! and also cheap too. The sell man recommended A ' chicken Briyani', you guys have to try this meal. Highly recommend!"
,,Colorful Glimpse of India!,4.0,,"I have been to India several times & surprisingly rediscovered Indian lifestyle in this place.
Loved beautiful wall paintings around different lanes & aroma of authentic Indian foods here & there. One can experience Indian lifestyle here at Singapore without visiting India!!!
Don't miss the chance of visiting this area & enthusiastic travellers could take 'Little India Walk Tours' from tour operators."
,,Tour,5.0,,"On the tour we left the bus in little India and walked through the streets to stamp,e the atmosphere and smells and hear the history of how they came to singaporelvery interesting and not to be missed"
,,A Place For Everything,5.0,,"While visiting Singapore, Little India was one of the places that I visited many times during my stay. The shops are endless and offer a shopping experience that you will never forget."
,,Colourful and interesting shopping..,5.0,,"Wonderfully colourful, shopping here is an experience, Mustafas store sells just about everything you could possibly imagine.... Tasty food, and spice shops to visit, very inexpensive....."
,,Not for us,3.0,,"Didn't really enjoy our visit to this area, scruffy packed with tourists and over hyped, if you only have a few days in Singapore give it a miss."
,,Three night stay in Singapore,4.0,,Great place to walk around and take in the sights and sounds of India. Plenty of restaurants to chose from and market stalls to ponder. Gold stores everywhere.
,,Not the best Singapore can offer,2.0,,"I had planned on spending a whole morning here but after about an hour I had had enough.

I didn't have weeks in Singapore and so didn't want to waste my time here when there is so much more to do in Singapore.

Firstly I thought Little India itself was pretty grotty. It was dirty compared to the rest of Singapore and there was only one street of shops and sights to see. The shops were full of tat and the few temples they had were all closed, though I could see most of what they had to offer from the outside and in all honesty they aren't worth travelling on the MRT to see.

I went to the Tekka Centre and I was really, really disappointed. It absolutely stunk from all the fish and I wouldn't have dared to eat anything - the hygiene in that place was disgusting and the whole place was extremely dirty. To be fair, this may just be because everywhere else I had been in Singapore was so clean but even by my normal standards it wasn't nice. Also the clothes were all the same, and not particularly cheap at all. Additionally - it was very very hot and there is no air con in there. Due to the amount of stalls there was barely any fresh air getting around which made it feel like an oven and made the stench even worse.

I really wouldn't recommend spending time here, especially if you only have limited time in Singapore (a week or less). I wished I had spent the time in the Museum instead, where I went after.

Make sure you go to Orchard Road, China Town, the Business District or the Zoo if you can. Much better!!"
,,Diverse,4.0,,"Our hotel was here so after the whole day sightseeing we would come back get fresh and go out again to enjoy the multitude of sights, sounds and smells. Good place to exchange money. Cheap but delicious aromatic food and you'll be spoilt for choice. Easy connection to the whole city state. So many places of interest. Called little india but very diverse and can be enjoyed by all. Malls close by."
,,Very convenient location Singapore.,5.0,,"If you're a south Asian you will love this area in Singapore. Little India station is an interconnecting station in all railways. Mustafa center is one attraction and this place has quite a good Indian restaurants. Food prices are fairly reasonable. Surrounding is clear and few shopping malls including city mall is located in the area.
The bus service which travels to Malaysia (called lapan lapan) is starting near park royal hotel"
,,Had a great time spending here,3.0,,Had been here with friends. one of the cleanest city. We roamed here walking to feel the city. The one great thing to see here is Indian restaurants with Indian foods. Almost Indians settled here.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"I was really disappointed in Little India. We went here at the end of our trip so we'd seen a lot of other places and this was the worst, it was very dirty compared to everywhere else we'd been (and Singapore in general) and smelly and no one was friendly. The buildings are very colourful and having a wander round was interesting enough but I wouldn't go back.
I would also not recommend walking through the hawker hall which connects to the train station, I have never smelt anything so bad in my life, it put me off wanting to eat anything at all.
I would much rather spend my time exploring other parts of Singapore."
,,Did not feel welcome,3.0,,"Sad to say, I hopped off the subway here and did not feel welcome. A very strange vibe. I saw some neat shops, but vendors did not appear to want to sell anything. I seemed to be off the beaten path a bit, which might be why, but I was disappointed."
,,ETHNICITY IN A LARGE CITY,4.0,,"Little India is a neighborhood in Singapore populated by people of Indian ethnicity. It is a large area with one of the main streets being Serangoon Rd. Walk down the street to get a flavor of the neighborhood, the Hindu temples and walk some of the side streets crammed with all variety of businesses. Recommend, Hope this helps."
,,Colourful district of Singapore,4.0,,"We walked to Little India from our hotel in Clarke Quay by talking a roundabout route via Orchard Road, so we were pretty exhausted by the time we arrived. Little India covers quite a large area and at the time of our visit was adorned with colourful Christmas street decorations, especially along traffic-snarled Serangoon Road. As previous reviewers have noted, it's a very Singapore version of real India, though still has a more edgy feel than the more touristy Chinatown. If you have time take a wander through the Mustafa Centre."
,,Birthday trip,4.0,,Nice to wander through here and imagine you're in Delhi! Nice shops and restaurants but can be a bit smelly in parts and at one point I stood on a dead rat!!!! The Mustapha Centre is excellent for souvenirs and cheap clothing. We visited twice but pays to shop around for food. The 2 places we ate at were excellent but big difference in the bills!!!!
,,Interesting,4.0,,"An Indian enclave in Singapore
Nice place to visit and enjoy some Indian food and spices
There is a""wet market"" at the entrance of Serangon road
Worthed a visit to take nice pictures of the verity of meat ,fish fruits and veg.
Don't expect India , you are in Singapore it's clean , no beggers in the streets but still an interesting place to visit"
,,Immerse yourself in culture,4.0,,"Just like Chinatown and Arab Street, Little India is another section of the city where you get a lot of culture. From the sights and sounds, to the temples and food, you get a lot with this heritage walk. Good for an afternoon of walking around."
,,Bit crowded,3.0,,"Hi,

I have visited little India several times and it's always bit crowded.

You will find every stuff here especially in mustafah and if you are looking for indian food then this is the place.

Traffic rules are not followed here so he careful while crossing the road.

Regards,
Prakash Matuwani"
,,Not certain about this,2.0,,Frankly there are parts of Birmingham that are more authentically Indian and with more cultural heritage. I was disappointed!
,,The Best Way to See India,5.0,,"Normally going to India is difficult and can sometimes be dangerous. Well, the Little India is Singapore provides a safe and interesting experience of India.

Walking through the streets of Little India is quite astounding as there is always a sense of fast paced work with many different shops.

Walking through the markets of Little India is the best part, as you may find many different different items that would be very hard to find anywhere else.

I highly recommend visiting Little India in Singapore for its great markets and safety it provides."
,,Cheap Shopping,4.0,,"Our hotel was here so we walked through most days. Lots of vibrant little shops with well priced items. Good selection of restuarants, again very reasonable. We were here during a festival so part of the road was closed off while people walked a circuit to show their faith - it attracted lots of wellwishers - mostly locals. We have travelled extensively through real India so in comparison quiet and clean."
,,Little and Clean India,5.0,,"Discover new aromas, spices, colors! It is a nice place to walk and discover. Go to Mustafa and take a lunch in one of the many restrants around. Very good Indian Food! Many Jeweries, little gift shops, fabric stores... Don't miss the temples there!"
,,Nice clean india experience,4.0,,"At little india there are a lot of shops and cheap shopping all over,
Good indian restaurants and nice india ambience.
For people who have been in india, this place is strange because it's cleaner and quieter.
We strolld there for a few hours including going to mustafa center which is a great and cheap convenient store.
It's nice for a nice sunny but not so warm day."
,,Temples,5.0,,We have short trip to Little India. We visited temples and walk upto Little India station. Areas are clean and temples are interesting
,,fun but a bit more pushy,5.0,,a little bit more crowded in the markets here and a bit of pushiness. Really excellent food at the food courts. Lots of window shopping of fairly unique items. Interesting architecture and mostly walkable area. Easily accessible by subway
,,Great place to shop,5.0,,"Stroll down Buffalo Road to Serangoon Road. Plenty of vegetables and flower shops to browse thru. If your in the market for saris and material you can't go past Nalli Chinnasami Chetty, 32 Buffalo Road or for beautiful Pashminas go to GM Gifts of Serenity, 48 Serangoon Road. Best way to get there is via the MRT."
,,A small but fun time,5.0,,Again MRT gets you here. Some amazing stalls and shops the gold dealers have some spectacular pieces (gold is 24 carat and price is by the grams in each piece) spices flowers and curios aboind
,,Tour through little India,4.0,,"Compared to Chinatown, little India isn't as much fun. It is really pretty with some colorful buildings, but also quite dirty."
,,Little India free walking tour,4.0,,"This was a fabulous way of seeing the sights around this place . Our tour guy was fun but extremely knowledgeable. I'd recommend this tour , gave one a new perspective of the area"
,,Fun to explore,4.0,,This area is good for affordable eats and shopping. A couple hours here is sufficient to see the sites as a visitor. Shop around for clothing bargains as prices can vary greatly from shop to shop.
,,Excellent place for street shopping.,4.0,,loaadsa shops..alot with the same stuff. take your time and look around..donot accept the first bargains you come accross. some real cool gadgets or accessories may be found here..the not so standard stuff.. in my books highly recommended..ps toilets hard to find some inside restuarants. some great food places here.
,,Somewhat disappointing,3.0,,We'd been here many years ago but were disappointed on our second visit. Nobody seemed particularly friendly or welcoming unlike other parts of Singapore eg. Chinatown. The old buildings are quite interesting as are some of the shops.
,,Little disappointing,3.0,,"Little India seemed a bit spread out without a central hub but perhaps we couldn't find it.
We arrived at the MRT Little India station and then felt a bit lost.
We wandered around a bit aimlessly and found an Indian restaurant we selected to dine in but the whole area whilst full of Indian people, felt a bit cheap and dirty.
Compared to Chinatown, if you only have time to visit one, then stick with Chinatown."
,,24/7 Shopping Mall is perfect for shopaholics!,4.0,,"We walked from Ibis Bencoolen Hotel to Little India. It took us over 30 minutes to reach the great Mustafa Shopping Mall. It's a 24/7 mall. They have almost everything from grocery, watches, jewelry, accessory, health and beauty needs, toys and more. One day is not enough. We got there around 10am so there's not much people yet but come lunch time the mall gets really crowded. If you want cheap finds this is the place to be."
,,Fascinating couple of hours,5.0,,"Visited 3 temples around the Serangoon Road, a fascinating road full of individual stores tumbling on to the street, cafes, souvenir shops and people wandering. Plenty of places to buy drinks as very hot. Take a detour on to Horse Race Road and visit the Buddhist temples, at least 3 of them, so quiet and calm."
,,Wasn't worth it,2.0,,I was not impressed with Little India. I preferred Chinatown instead. If you are interested in jewelry (lots of gold) then maybe you should go but I am always hesitant to buy from these places as you are not sure they are reputable. I don't like Indian food either so I cant judge but Ive been to India and I guess its kinda similar but I didn't think it was worth it to go . If you have lots of time then I can see going but there are so many other unique places to see in Singapore this would be on the bottom of my list
,,The Smell,3.0,,"They sell a lot of flowers and fruits on the street, so the smell is kinda weird, you cant distinguish if the smell is good or bad. As expected there are a lot of Indian around. Most of them are drunk on Sunday nights, dirty place at night, but very clean in the morning. Still a nice place to visit."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Having been around India ,I felt I had been taken back ,had a real Indian feel to it ,we had a fantastic lunch of tikka chicken and cauliflower gobhi ,also Dahl and nann .there is a fantastic department store called mustafas ,you have to go ,it sells everything and I mean everything"
,,Worthwhile visit,3.0,,"Take an hour or two to visit Little India. It is easy to get to by the Metro. The neighborhood is filled with shops selling vegetables, clothing, jewelry and lots of authentic India items. You'll hear music and see beautiful temples."
,,Very interesting place,4.0,,"We took ourselves to Little India on Seragoon Road by local train from our accommodation. Easy to find.
The place is filled with Indians (as expected) and tourists. Wall to wall people, especially as it was a weekend.
We noticed signs up telling us that there was to be a parade that afternoon so we left before more people arrived!
It is a the place to immerse yourself in the life and food of the Indians - so much to see that it is hard to take in!
Loved the little umbrella park that we found!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,It's really worth a visit to little India to appreciate how diverse the cultures are in Singapore. Great food and a different vibe to China town. We ate at a restaurant and couldn't believe how much food was brought out. Great place.
,,"Perfect for indian food, shopping, groceries",4.0,,The place is heaven for indians. Can find many indian restaurants and shops here. Good for shopping too.
,,Lively little india,5.0,,"Cultural immersion here is fab. The tikka centre is a great food hall with so much atmosphere and with hundreds of food stalls selling fantastic food. So cheap and clean but you have to eat with the locals on long tables with bench seating. Everything is freshly cooked when ordered. Beautiful stalls selling the most beautifully coloured saris, temples etc. Just soak up the atmosphere. Travelling by mrt puts you right there as does the hop on hop off bus."
,,too dirty,1.0,,too dirty for my me. i didn't like it at all. for me it was just an hour walk without having to offer something unique.
,,Colourful and easy to access,4.0,,"Little India is a stop on the metro so you'll have no problems getting there. Despite my brief stay due to rain, the highlight for me was the street art/murals. Lots of indian food and souvenirs, but China Town is definitely bigger and more interesting if you only have time to see one."
,,Indians mob at singapore .. indian market,5.0,,"Little India .. what I found out is an basically Indian market where you can find Indian items and Indian restaurant .. everything related to Indians
Most famous there it Mustafa mall where you can find anything ..And it is open 24hrs .. at the cheap price .. basically it is an custom free shop .. you can refund GST at airport ..."
,,Felt like I'd been to India,4.0,,"We walked from our hotel in Orchard Rd and it took about 30 minutes but by doing so we entered Little India from the top of the Main Street and it was very colourful with banners across the street. There were many shops lining the street, gold jewellery stores, clothes, restaurants etc. About half way along there was a temple to look at which was very crowded. I'm happy to have seen it and felt safe there like all of Singapore."
,,Not that great,3.0,,Its only for people who want to have good veg food.We had it at Komala vilas and food was awesome .Mustafa was a big disappointment.
,,One of the most exciting places in Singapore,5.0,,"Little India is a really interesting place. Other reviews describe it well. I'll just point out one thing in my review. It is vastly different during the week than the weekend, especially Sunday. During the week it is exciting, vibrant, and a fun place to visit. On the Sunday I went it was really crowded. (I would say unpleasantly crowded.) A huge percentage of workers have Sunday off, and Little India is one of the places to go. There used to be a lot of drinking, but I think Singapore cracked down on that after the riots a while back. In general, Singapore is very safe and pleasant for women. Sunday in Little India is one of the few exceptions. I'm a guy, so I haven't experienced it myself, but many women recommend that women avoid Little India on Sundays. When I went there I only saw a few women. Don't get me wrong - it is still far safer than US cities, so keep things in their proper perspective. Bottom line: A great place for food, culture, people watching, and shopping. I absolutely love the traditional clothing people wear here. It's very colorful and makes for great pictures. Go Monday-Saturday. Enjoy somewhere else Sunday."
,,Be careful if you have teen daughter/s,1.0,,"We planned on looking around this area, having read glowing reviews. We found it to be very different to that described. Walking down the main road my blonde teen daughter was upset by the frequent stares/comments/looking up & down by the men hanging around the shopfronts. She was dressed conservatively. We left after 20 mins. Didn't see any of the things described in guide books - only dingy, rundown shops and a lot of people hanging around staring. I am so glad our hotel isn't in this area. We live in a very multicultural city, have walked the streets of Kuta in Bali and have never experienced the level of discomfort that we felt here."
,,Great food - friendly service,5.0,,"I travel a lot ... and always try to eat at an Indian restaurant where ever I go. In comparison to other Indian restaurants I've been to ... the food here is delicious!!!

Authentically Indian? Is there such a thing ... even in India ... where most restaurants cater to the tastes of tourists?

I and my partner are vegetarian ... there are plenty of non-meat options ... we chose a Masala Dosa, dahl and vegetable curry in tomato sauce ... and cheese naan ...

Whilst we were waiting we were served complementary vegetable samosas.

The food and accompanying sauces were really tasty - full of flavour - the dahl was rich and thick - the vegetable curry full fresh vegetables ... both were spicy and mildly hot!

The masala dosa was fresh ... large ... and very tasty!!! And the naan ... hot and cheesy ... how I like them.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ...

PS: don't be put off by the ordinary looking interior ... or some of the negative reviews ... this place is well worth the visit!"
,,Great experience,4.0,,We loved walking around the quaint streets and exploring all that little India had to offer. We ate at some of the local spots and found the food inexpensive. No problem walking around late at night. Be sure to visit the wet market as well.
,,The Desi Side of Singapore.,5.0,,Little India is virtually a small bit of authentic India is a global metropolis like Singapore. It has several authentic Indian restaurants that offer you a variety of cuisines. Several shops sell traditional Indian wares and the Indian community in the area makes you feel that this is one part of Singapore that decided to go desi.
,,"Colourful Little India, and those Indian restaurants are so real!",4.0,,"Little India is one place I have found interesting to visit here in Singapore. Because I like Indian food!

So in Little India, I'd buy some curry powder, Indian cooking ingredients, ready to mix indian cuisine, flavoured snacks, all to bring home.

During my visit this time, I had the opportunity to do a walk tour during the Singapore Art Week. I had a glimpse and enjoyed the mural/street paintings show-cased along the streets in Little India for public to enjoy.

I spotted a few, and the ones I find them interesting, colourful and which are decorative adding vibrancy to the area."
,,India in Singapore,5.0,,You feel like you are in India but much cleaner. Authentic retaurants with typical Southern Indian food. The spice shops and Bollywood dvd shops add to the feeling. Two or Three hours including meal time will suffice.
,,"Great, affordable food.",3.0,,"Little India has great, and affordable food. Especially compared to the high prices in Singapore. If you love the South-Indian cuisine, you'll have plenty choice. Mustafa Centre is also located in Little India if you are looking for cheap groceries."
,,Afternoon Walk,2.0,,the place is cool and crowded if you are into chaotic atmospheres then this is the place to be. coming from Dubai this is a normal daily scene nothing impressing
,,Not very impressive,3.0,,"My missus and I entered via the Little India metro station, walked around for half an hour, through a quirky little alley and then realised it wasn't our thing and went back the same way we came.

Dirty, full of flies and other insects, most stuff for sale not worthwhile.

This was by far our least favourite place in Singapore."
,,A touch exotic,3.0,,"A trip to Little India should be on your list when you visit Singapore. Be aware The Indian National Museum is closed on Mondays. There are a plethora of interesting shops, cafes and everything Indian in a easily walkable area. Hop on the MRT and get off at either Rochor or Little India Stations. Henna tattoos are a fun thing to get and there are lots to choose from.

Unfortunately Little India isn't the litter free area that Singapore is famous for. Why I don't know but it's disappointing to see trash, cigarette butts and empty drink containers in many places.

Enjoy the sights and smells. Enjoy the food."
,,Hawker Centre near the MRT,4.0,,"Great food options, even non Indian food. Try the biryani, ensure you get the sauce on the side.! The local markets are a must walk through, as there are lots on sights & smells to take you to India. Enjoy the environment."
,,Once is Enough,3.0,,"If you're someone into culture, it might be a place for you to have a short scene of Indian people's life. If not, or if curry's smell is something you never expect, simply find another list on your itinerary."
,,fun,4.0,,"It's fun. I never been to india. But when in Little india, I really felt like I was there. Very nice to walk and shop around."
,,A taste of India!,5.0,,An experience for foreigners to know what India is all about. A sense of home for Indians living there!
,,Singapore's dirty little secret.,1.0,,"A vile tract of knock off items, cheap clothes, jewellery, pawn shops and food vendors. Utterly charmless and without merit. Avoid."
,,My teenagers did not enjoy the visit here,2.0,,We visited on a public holiday and extremely warm day. We walked through a popular food venue which was crowded and stifling hot and then walked around the streets. My teenagers did not enjoy visiting Little India at all. They found it to be smelly and dirty and didn't like feeling like tourists. They preferred ChinaTown and Haji Lane.
,,Serendepitous Slice of India,4.0,,"This Bazaar had me awestruck! I felt like I was walking through a part of south India, Bengal and north India at times. There was such a display of all regions it was outstanding. I wasn't surprised seeing no Pakistani restaurants and was also intrigued by the temples and the Hindu way of worship. It was easily reachable and felt very homely., please don't miss this place if you go to Singapore."
,,Not Singapore,3.0,,"When u have seen Singapore and come to little India you almost start to think can this be part of Singapore? like its name this part of singapore is bit different,lot of stores, chaotic, bergain purchases, temples and lot of gold stores, it can be a experience."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Spent a few hours here looking around the stores, temples and eating in Tekka market.

The stores are as you would expect a lot of gold and odds and sods.

The temples are wonderful, just remember to cover up and be respectful. Some provide appropriate clothing free of charge.

Tekka market provides excellent Indian cuisine at cheap prices, make sure you get some hot milky chai tea it's superb. Expect to eat with your hands as it's the done thing and in my opinion brilliant. Don't worry there are places to wash them before and after."
,,Not Exactly India,3.0,,"I thought i would feel at home after visiting this place, But i must say i was quite disappointed. The place doesn't look that tidy. It feels that it is some place outside of Singapore. I dont know but this is my opinion."
,,Not what I expected...,2.0,,"My girlfriend and I asked our cab driver to drop us off here at around 9pm as it was near our hotel and we wanted to have a stroll through to see if it was interesting. As soon as I left the cab I was shocked - and not in a good way.

Having already explored most of Singapore, I expected Little India to have the same charm and sophistication as the rest of Singapore. However, I was left very disappointed. I was shocked at how dirty and unappealing this district looked. Even Chinatown, whilst not cleanest place I've ever seen either, had a unique charm and appeal about it. While walking through Little India, I felt no charm whatsoever. The shops looked dull and I felt like every man there was seedily looking at my girlfriend.

Perhaps one could argue that I could've visited during the daytime and tried some of the local food, but even so, I feel as though I would have found it very hard to do so due to the lack of appeal this district had and my fear of getting sick from unsanitary cooking conditions.

I would only recommend this place to those with brave stomachs who can look past the rugged look of the suburb because perhaps, there is more to this suburb than I believe I experienced myself."
,,Quite disappointed,3.0,,"There were a couple of colourful buildings, some nice Indian restaurants but apart from that there isn't much to see. I didn't get a great feel of the culture which was a shame."
,,India away from India,3.0,,"As the name states it it actually little India. You will get to see many temples and shops run by Indians. If you want to buy some souvenir and chocolates go to Mustafa shopping complex which is 24/7 operational and has currency exchange center also.

This place is well connected with train and buses. If you are staying in Singapore for more than 15 days and missing home food , visit here to have a tasty Indian Bite !!

Cheers,"
,,A Little Piece of India,3.0,,"Had we not just spent time visiting 4 Indian cities, it would have been far more interesting.... but... gives you a taste of what India has to offer...... but SO much cleaner and less crowded!"
,,My Favorite Place in Singapore,5.0,,"Little india was my favorite place in singapore. The shops, the smells, the food and the people all to die for! Visit little india to get away from the busy industrial and commercialized city."
,,Another must visit but rather limited,4.0,,"This is another of the Singapore must visits and the market lanes and stalls seem to cater for the local Indian population more than, or as well as, tourists. There are basically 3 blocks of interest and an hour is more than enough to see what there is to see. We particularly like the food/hawker centre on the way from Little India MRT station to Little India itself."
,,Visit if ur missing India !!,4.0,,A place to be if ur missing indian streets and the indian food .....you just get what you want ....not so clean tho ......miss it as it wont show you anything new !!!
,,Best place for Indian food,5.0,,"If you need Indian food in Singapore then little India is the right place for you.

Full of Indian hotels offering you variety of food and dinning.

Mustafa shopping centre is good for some cheap shopping ,the shopping centre has everything you need and it works 24/7"
,,Can be skipped,2.0,,It surprises me how can one part of Singapore of be so good and this little India part be so bad. Its filthy. Lot of Indian eateries.. that's the only plus point..
,,India,2.0,,Coming here you feel like as you have actually come to India and.its dirty at some places and look like a part of Singapore at all . Though Many options for all types of Indian Food
,,Nothing great,2.0,,Being from india i found the place not so exciting. In fact in some places it is very much in contrast to the rest of singapore which is so clean and disciplined. The only thing which is positive are the multiple indian food restaurants. Even then very few serve good food sitara to name one. Avoid the south indian ones as the food and hygiene is horrible. Shopping is also much better at bugis just a short distance away.
,,"""Must Do"" for Singapore",5.0,,"Time to visit this place is Sunday late afternoon or early evening.
But be prepared for quite an experience. Either take a cab to the mustafa center or take MRT to Little India stop.
Warning: If you are claustrophobic, stay away. Lol. Visit during the weekday and stop by the Little India arcade."
,,A great place to visit,5.0,,"Been to India, well here your chance to experience it again with a twist. The building show how the British lived in this area. They are colourful to look at and the streets are clean."
,,So colourful!,4.0,,I visited Little India at Deepavali and I was impressed by all the colourful displays and stalls there. Not for the faint hearted though because there was sooooo many people! Lots of traditional foods to try and the stalks were filled with bright decorations. Wonderful atmosphere!
,,Worst Place,1.0,,"I have visited countries worldwide which have an area where there is a community for Indians.This place is the worst especially Singapore being so clean.It was filthy and overcrowded.We stopped on our route from hop on hop off bus hoping to find some nice food.It was awful and the Mustafa Shopping centre was even worse.It was overcrowded and so noisy
This is one place in all my travels that I would tell travellers to avoid"
,,Different to Singapore,4.0,,Was really like stepping into India for a few blocks and then back into Singapore again. Worth a visit for the food.
,,As nice as crowded...,4.0,,Little india is one of the Must Stops of the Hop On Hop Off bus. You will find a lot of people everywhere and lots of different options and cheap stuff. Be ready to walk a really crowded area...
,,Fun but crowded,4.0,,"Little India is certainly worth a visit. The streets are terribly busy during peak shopping hours but walking down sidestreets and in the different shopping areas, you get a pretty good taste of what this place is all about. I would certainly recommend you go here. The Mustafa shopping center nearby was simply way too hectic and crazy crowded for me to enjoy during peak shopping hours."
,,I Love Little India - but beware if you don't like crowds,5.0,,"I adore Little India in Singapore, I love the atmosphere and the colours and food! Mustafa is a must for shopping, down at Tekka Market is definitely a place to see. But note of warning don't go too early... head down after 11am so most store are open but if you don't like crowds don't go in at night. ps mustafa is opened 24/7!!"
,,Little India in Singapore,4.0,,Stayed in Little India and truly enjoyed it. Lots of places to eat especially if you enjoy Indian food. Mustafa centre a must to visit - great for shopping. Really enjoyed staying there and the locals were very helpful.
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"I've head a read of some of the reviews on here where people are saying they were stared at lots, and felt unsafe. I stayed in Little India by myself for over a week, and didn't once feel unsafe. I did notice people staring a little, but if youre a tourist in Singapore you do tend to stand out anyway. My advice for ladies visiting the area or even Singapore in general; dress conservatively if you want to avoid too much attention. I stuck to maxi dresses and keeping at minimum, my shoulders covered, as I felt it was being respectful to the locals cultural beliefs. I was also trying to avoid attention, and it definitely helped a lot.
As for Little India, I really loved this area. The Mustafa centre is a lot of fun to explore, and bring open 24/7 was a dream. Theres also the many many resturants in the area which had the best Indian food I've ever had (most open quite late too!). If you're a vegetarian, there's a lot of vegetarian resturants in the area! There's also some interesting shops to browse through if you like looking for a bargain. Dont be afraid to explore (but best keep out of the lanes and back alleys at night), and do be prepared to have people direct you to their shop or say hello when walking past though.
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, and I'm looking forward to going back and exploring even more."
,,Vibrant and colourful,4.0,,"Little India is one of Singapore's most vibrant districts. Crowded but incredibly clean it is filled with shops selling colourful saris, cloths, jewellery, flower garlands and incense. We had a very nice meal of banana leaf rice at one of the restaurants here."
,,Mustapha magic...,5.0,,First had a sumptuous Indian meal at the Banana leaf Appolo. Wow. Then walked to Mustapha and went bargain hunting. Was not at all disappointed.
,,Disappointing.,1.0,,"Do not understand what all the hype is over this alleged 'must see' destination for shopping, food and culture!! I would choose China Town over Little India any day. The temples and Mosques are worth a visit."
,,Always Enjoy a Visit,4.0,,"Every time I visit Singapore a visit to Little India is a must for me. This time I decided to walk from Little India MRT to Farrer Road MRT along Serangoon Road. I have also done it the other way around.

After leaving Little India station I visited Tekka Centre. I wasn't hungry so I just had a refreshing watermelon juice in the food centre. I then walked up the stairs to the 1st Floor where all the clothing is for sale.

This is a colourful sight and I always find a few items of clothing to buy. I found the assistants to be very helpful as I was looking for something specific and, fortunately, I was in luck and left happy with my purchases.

I then crossed Serangoon Road and entered Little India Arcade. I tell myself each time that I'm going to avoid going in here because the stall owners are quite aggressive in their touting for business, however, I was again lured in. I ended up succumbing to the persuasiveness of one of the sellers and bought a few nice cotton tops. We settled on a price which worked out to S$25 each which, in retrospect, may have been too much, however I like them and they seem to be of good quality.

I slowly wandered up Serangoon Road, carefully watching where I was walking because I have found that there are many uneven surfaces on the side walk. Sometimes I will be walking along on the narrow pathway between the produce for sale on either side and all of a sudden there will be a step down. Then, after walking for a short time there will be a step up. It can be very dangerous so please be careful.

Along the way I found a couple of remote controlled toys for my little grandsons and some cheap costume jewellery for myself (3 for S$10). I also ducked into Mustafas and bought a pair of cheap sandals, but I didn't have the stamina to tackle any more of the store.

I would normally be hungry by this time and would look for some Indian food, however as I had been suffering from a virus, and still didn't feel 100%, I decided to get a cold drink from City Square Mall which is almost attached to Farrer Park MRT, and then get the train back to my hotel.

I love the vibrancy of Little India and have always found the people there to be polite and helpful."
,,Well worth a look,4.0,,"This was my first time visiting Little India and I made an effort to see it both by day and by night. The hustle and bustle of people may not be to everyones liking, but the food, the stalls and the sights make this an interesting spot to visit if you have a few hours to spare in Singapore."
,,Worth exploring,4.0,,"The MRT (train) goes right to the doorstep of Little India at a market place. There's a food market - great lunch stop if your timing is right, and upstairs to some amazing clothes shops and much more. But don't stop there. Its worth exploring the little streets at back of the market. Its unlike the rest of Singapore altogether, and definitely worth exploring. I's allow a half for this one if you can."
,,Walk and enjoy the ambience!,4.0,,"I walked from my hotel to this attraction. Visited two Hindu temples, ate some fried Indian foods, browsed inside some local shops and art stores, took pictures, etc.

After my visit was over, I took the train at the Little India MRT Station to visit other attractions of Singapore."
,,Food Joints,3.0,,Its a great place to have Indian Cuisine ( If you like) You will be able to experience Indian Culture & Religion. Great place...!!
,,Very clean and quite unauthentic :) but nice,3.0,,Very clean and quite unauthentic :) but nice. The food is really cool. Its good to stay couple of hours and eat something good.
,,Special,4.0,,When we went there it was very crouded just like india. Many little shops and colorful clothes food and smells...we spent there 2 hours walking around but you can spend there much more if you want shopping or just enjoy the atmosphere. Many bus stops so its no problem. Plan your walk ahead so you wont miss anything because its easy to wonder in the littel busy streets....
,,Where am I,4.0,,"We thought we were back in India. What a great little area. Clean and vibrant but so so Indian. Did some local shopping and had a great look around but the best thing was the truly traditional local Indian food. North and South cuisine, it was great value and such a traditional taste."
,,The Indian connection..,4.0,,"9% Singapore population is that of Indian origin. And little India happens to be the place where that culture actually can be experienced . Little India will remind of a typical South Indian City, but at a much cleaner level.

Your visit to Singapore has to have little india as a part of the itinerary. Immerse yourself in the sounds, smells and culture that is 1000s of years old. The temples as well as Mustafa centre should be on the to do list."
,,The colours and smells of India in Singapore,4.0,,"Little India is an Aladins cave. There are endless small shops selling a myriad colourful items of clothing, costume jewellry and of course beautiful gold jewellry studded with many other precious jewels. The choice is endless and ladies with flowing saris select their jewellry st their leisure.
Shops making saris abound with the most beautiful fabrics and the finished garments are displayed in their windows, some of them richly embroidered with gold thread.
This is a very busy bustling area full of atmosphere which adds to make this a wonderful place to visit.
Half way down the street is a beautiful temple, richly adorned inside and out, this is well worth a visit.
There are many stalls along the walkway where men and women make the colourful and beautifully smelling garlands. The smell from these flower heads adds to the interest of this area.
We went down this street several times and each time could see something that we missed the first time if our visit.
I would highly recommend a visit to this area which has so much colour and vibrancy to offer"
,,True to its name,4.0,,"The sights, smells and sounds all reflect its name perfectly.
I have never seen so many gold shops, just one after another and all displaying such beautiful pieces.
There are smells of spices, incense, flowers and food.
Bells ringing, sewing machines on the edge of the footpath and locals speaking their own language.
Some great shopping opportunities with some real bargains to be had.
We loved the whole precinct."
,,Not as defined as Chinatown,3.0,,"We spent a bit of time combing the streets and checking maps to make we were actually in Little India. It isnt as defined or structured as Chinatown and there didnt seem to be market stall eating like there is with the Asian cuisine. There are plenty of restaurants, but we were looking for more choice and vibrancy at market prices.

We had a well priced and tasty meal all the same.

Reasonable selection of indian nic naks if you are in to that stuff."
,,"Worth a visit for an hour, no more",3.0,,"We visited a day or two after deepavali celebrations and the decorations were still up, but the area seemed deserted. It meant that we could take some nice photographs, but there was no atmosphere and we only spent 30 minutes walking around before moving on in our sightseeing."
,,Nice place,5.0,,Little India is a must visit place for any foreign visitor.The place is very lively and full of shopping stalls.You have a whole range of souvenir stalls for carry memories of singapore with you.Shopping experience is reasonable.However one has to visit this place to visit the energy it creates.
,,Shopping,3.0,,Nice place to shop for quality and cheap clothing and other household items especially at the famous Mustafa Shopping Centre.
,,"Exactly what it says - ""Little India""",4.0,,"Little India stands true to its name.. it is exactly ""little india"". You can find all sorts of Indian food around, streets are crowded and noisy and you will not miss not being in India :) We stayed at the Parkroyal hotel on the kitchener road; which is a km away from the Little India MRT. The area is very well connected by MRT/ buses and is very convenient for Indians looking for Indian food during their stay; especially for vegetarians. The area is also relatively less expensive than other parts of Singapore."
,,Look India,1.0,,"Hey Guys,
i write this because i want to warn you that this Place is very unsafe! especially with girls! There are so many many men i didn't expect that. All of them have looked on my girlfriend with a lasciviously view. I felt very nervous and couldn't expect to find the MRT again! Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. Singapore is actually a clean city but this place is the scum very dirty and smelly. Go to Chinatown the people are much more open and friendlier there."
,,Looked at like I was a piece of meat,2.0,,"Came here with my mum after a few taxi places recommend it. We wanted to get some Henna done.

The men to women ratio is about 80/20. So many disgusting men staring at me like I was a piece of meat, felt very un easy walking around with the pathetic men gawking at me

It's just like a little piece of Indian if that's your thing, we eventually found a Henna place got it done for $15 on our legs and left never to return!"
,,A great look at the cultural history of Singapore,4.0,,"A stroll along Serangoon Road is a wonderful experience. The smell of spices and wonderful food cooking is a delight. Beautiful old heritage buildings line the road, giving a sense of bygone eras."
,,Worth to explore,5.0,,This place gives you a great feeling of being in southern India. It has place to get many items which are famous in southern India
,,Good for buying souvenirs,4.0,,Feel at home while buying souvenirs for your loved ones. Little India is commonly known as Tekka in the local Indian community and is a must visit place.
,,Seems like clean Indian streets,4.0,,"As soon as you enter the are, you feel like you have entered an Indian market. The shopping malls, the food joints, the restaurants all make you feel that you have entered India."
,,Showcase of Indian culture,5.0,,"Singapore is a multi-racial Republic. We have Chinese, Indian, Malay and Eurasians living in harmony in this country.

Each ethnic community has, over the years taken an area and has developed it into a little world of its own. Little India is one of them. Helped by the Government to preserve the ancient ulture of India in Singapore, the local Indians have built temples, shops, restaurants, etc showcasing their culture.

Little India is the name given to the lower part of Serrangoon Road, Bukit Timah Road, Selegie Road, Rochor, etc. Shops overflowing with saris, kurtas, jewellery, handicrafts can be seen along these roads and side lanes as well. The Hindu temples are usually from the Southern part of India, colourful and decorated with idols from the Hindu pantheon of Gods. There are Churches and Mosques too, with Tamil sermons.

There are umpteen number of restaurants serving South and North Indian cuisines. Many serve vegetarian food as well as a large section of the community is vegetarian.

Recently, a beautiful, well designed state of the art, Indian Heritage Museum depicting the history and heritage of Indians who had come to settle here bringing with them their beautiful culture has been built by the Government. This is one of my favourite haunts when I take my guests around Little India.

There is so much to see, buy, eat and enjoy in this area. Set aside a day or two to explore and find treasures. During Indian Festivals such as Navarathri, Pongal and Deepavali the place is lit up and shops offer specially imported goods for that season. During Navarathri, for example, the temples arrange a doll festival, dances, classical music, etc. Deepavali is very special and the roads are decorated with colourful lights and artwork.

I,'d say a visit to to Little India when you visit Singapore is a must."
,,"Little India, nice but can be a little unsafe.",3.0,,"There is lots to see in Little India. Its like a mini taste of India itself.
However, when I was there I saw a little incident.

I traveled through with some other travels staying in a hostel/pub. I liked it there and the people were very friendly. The local area was nice and there are plenty of shops to see and things to do on a walk around.

One night while drinking with a few other travelers, there were some locals outside shouting and arguing. I went outside, with some others to see what was going on and a massive fight broken out. About 20 people in total.
One guy pulled out a knife and stabbed another guy. Then everyone ran.

The area is patrolled by Security and they turned up first. The injured man hobbled into a near by shop. The Police came and I was the only one to tell the Police where the injured man and the guy who stabbed him were. They did not want to know and said its best if I just stay out of it.. really weird and then they left.
The only thing I could think of was that this must have been gang related.

I would go there again and it might be that this was just a one off, I did feel safe until this happened. Moved to another Hostel the next day to be sure."
,,india in singapore,4.0,,"here you will find all Indian restaurants, shopping options, it has Indian population , market, one can fill line india"
,,Lots to see and experience.,4.0,,"A little smaller than China Town but still offers plenty for the visitor to experience and discover. An hour or two here is not wasted as there's lots of exploring to do. Lots of back packing hotels are situated here and obviously plenty of good Indian restaurants.
Worth a visit and definitely worth eating here too."
,,Diwali/Deepavali: a festival of lights - a gazetted holiday in India.,5.0,,"This was a great time to be in Little India, as it is a very festive time of year. The shops were bulging with their wares, plus the added flowers and displays for Deepavali made it especially enjoyable to see. It reminded me of my visit to Mumbai, India, with the shops and people, but without the beggars that are so prevalent in the actual country of India. Don't be afraid to bargain with the shop owners, and if they don't come down in price, walk away, they usually stop you and say OK before you go."
,,Not what India is,2.0,,"Dont get wrong impression about India after visiting this place. This is not what urban india is. Its completely opposite in all aspects - people, shops, walkways, goods. Its more like a small south indian town or maybe india 100 years back. Only good part is you can good authentic indian food and delicious dosas at kamalas."
,,Very clean place,5.0,,I was surprised with decorated along the little india road for deepavalli such honor for india in singapore.Very neat and clean well organized place.
,,"Don't go on ""men's Night"" if you have daughters",4.0,,"Little India is a pretty good resemblance to the real thing, it is bustling, has the vibe and aromas and is pretty cool.

At night they burn off the days rubbish, as per my photo. We went on Sunday night and it was a bit creepy. I have three attractive daughters who were wearing shorts and singlets due to the heat. The were ogled so badly and constantly that it was a real turnoff. Only after we got back to the hotel were we told that it was men's night at Little India. There are 2 nights that are men's night, Sunday and the other one I can't remember but I think it was Monday? It is seedy on men's nights, otherwise it's a cool place to visit"
,,easy to get to by MRT and a different view of Singapore,4.0,,The district was easy to get to by MRT from our hotel. It was an interesting to walk through the district and see the different cultures and customs. Ate lunch at a local restaurant and had the fish head curry. Delicious! Don't miss this experience into Singapore's diverse communities.
,,little India - mm different,3.0,,"Visited Little India whilst on hop on hop off bus tour, was a little disappointed with some of it's characteristics, namely the rubbish, people spitting and all round feeling of sadness in the people. Maybe we went at the wrong time.. don't allow me to deter you going, everyone finds experiences different."
,,On the bus,4.0,,"Board the public bus from Peace Centre and enter into little India after two bus stops. From the traffic junction at KK market, you see the beautiful decorations of the Deepavali even it is in afternoon. At the junction, there is a big beautiful peacock. Forget to take photo of the decorations.
It is long time to visit or pass through this place. There are many changes."
,,Not my favorite,3.0,,"This is a densely packed neighborhood perhaps reminiscent of the home these people have left. Getting off the MRT one can immediately see how different it is then other parts of Singapore. The ubiquitous spotless cleanliness is nowhere to be found. Instead there are tightly packed shops falling over each other with their goods and market pack with people, produce and packaging. There is a certain charm to all of this, but on a hot and humid day it was not a charm that I was drawn to. Perhaps others will find it more appealing."
,,Urban India without the noise and characteristic Indian chaos,4.0,,"As soon as you arrive you start smelling and tasting India but no noise, no chaos. Good shopping and eating."
,,An eye opener!,4.0,,"Whilst in Singapore we visited Little India. It was great to just wander and check out the array of shops , stalls and it was fun to barter and bargain with the shop owners.

The Teeka Centre was an experience will lots of food and produce stalls. It was interesting to observe the A,B,C grading system for food store cleanliness!

We had lunch at a great little restaurant ( cannot recall the name!!!) and the Indian food was superb. The Tiger beer was a great accompaniment! In fact we went back again a couple of days later

I would recommend to any visitor to Singapore to add ""Little India"" to their itinerary."
,,Place to be there for food,5.0,,"Most of the days I was in Singapore, I hopped of to this place for yummy food. You can shop, eat and celebrate here. Keep walking and discovering."
,,Vibrant must see place,5.0,,"Buy everything Indian in this area of Singapore. Bright bold colours and lots of bling.
Little India is a great shopping experience, great for the small souvineer to the new outfit, or beautiful material to make your own.
Whilst visiting the market in this area my husband and I decide to try out the food, this was an experience. We ate in the outside area of the market with all the locals, your meal comes on a tray, I do mean the tray, curry rice and bread, don't expect a knife and fork, we managed to get a spoon, the meal was very good and very cheap. Just part of the culture, Great"
,,little india,4.0,,"little india in singapore is small indian established place where you can spot a lot of indian food, indian goods,temples and indians.
a good place to experience in singapore if u r really missing india there. china town is adjacent so you get to visit that as well."
,,A Little taste of Old Singapore,4.0,,How wonderful that this remains amongst all the glass towers that dominate this amazing city. Full of Indian restaurants and shops. And charming staff everywhere. Don't miss this. Recommended
,,European couples please read,1.0,,"You may have seen many reviews by this point but I just wanted to reiterate a few things.

If you are a young white couple this area is definitely not for you, 95% of the population down in the streets are men. Not a problem in most places across the continent, but here they are vile ... all staring at my partner like they've never seen a white woman before, she was that distressed and concerned by the way me were pushing past we left the area without a second thought.

Hygiene is also a very big one, people going to the toilet in drains in the street and behind cooking outlets was absolutely shocking.

There's literally nothing to browse through other than phone shops and a few knock off shops that are a load of garbage."
,,Full of food and life,5.0,,"Little India is just that! I ended up there the two times I visited Singapore on a trip to Oz from the UK. The main reason I visited was for the food, there's sooo many eateries to choose from, I picked a Vegetarian restaurant and the food was great and very cheap. It was also Diwali while I was there so everywhere was lit up, bustling and full of life."
,,Take a walk,3.0,,"Many varieties of indian clothing shops, indian gold shops, phone cards shops, mustafa, indian veg resturants, indisn curry along race course roads etc all along here."
,,"Little India, a heady mix for the senses.",4.0,,"Just as Chinatown and Kampong Glam each reflects the ethnic diversity of Singapore but with a predominantly Chinese and Malay character respectively, Little India is distinctively Indian. This is the historical and cultural hub of the Indian community and the colours, sounds and scents of India greet the visitor at every turn. From colourful saris to fragrant perfumes and spices, from the strains of sitar to the cacophony of traffic, Little India is a heady mix of shopping, sightseeing and feasting for tourists and locals alike.

And like elsewhere on the island, the Chinese and Malays do a roaring trade side by side with their Indian compatriots, transcending language and cultural barriers.

What to see and do in Little India:

1. Rows of old shophouses jostling for custom against the backdrop of modern malls such as The Verge and Mustafa Centre, the latter known for its wide range of electronics and home appliances at competitive prices. There are bargains galore at many clothing stores with all manner of street wear like jeans, shoes and t-shirts spilling onto the sidewalks. Not forgetting the numerous souvenir shops and jewellers selling gold and precious stones. And the treasure trove of art, handicraft, antiques, and sacred objects awaiting your discovery on the main street and the side lanes.

2. Indian Heritage Centre which showcases the rich culture of the ethnic Indians with displays and shows.

3. The Temple of a Thousand Lights, a Buddhist temple famous for its 15m high seated Buddha statue on the ground floor and a reclining Buddha in the basement.

4. The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple set in lush grounds with public housing in the background. Colourful statues of Hindu deities adorn the top of the perimeter walls and main building.

5. Explore the many facets of Indian cuisine at eateries big and small in Little India. From fiery curries originating in the Tamil south of the Indian subcontinent to delicately spiced cuisine from the northern regions. Northern Indian specialties like briyani and tandoori chicken fit for a maharajah are readily available. Vegetarians will not miss out on their dosai, vadai and apom, and those needing a quick fix can head for the eateries modelled on western fast food joints.

6. A popular Indian dish is fish head curry, which has been the inspiration for several versions sold in Chinese food outlets.

7. Mainstays like prata and murtabak have their following in restaurants and cooked food centres, where popular snacks such as curry puffs and goreng pisang (fried banana fritters) are also to be found. Favourite drinks include lime juice and ‚Äúteh tarik‚Äù (pulled tea), a frothy milk tea repeatedly ‚Äúpulled‚Äù between two large metal mugs.

8. Come sundown small plazas tucked between tall residential blocks spring to live with diners chilling out under swaying palms and romantic lights."
,,Hectic and authentic !,5.0,,"Of all the cultural areas in Singap ore (eg Chinatown, Arab) this is the one that is probably the most authentic. It is hectic as you'd expect ""India"" to be. Lots of local people and lots of tourists looking for bargains. So many places to shop and eat. Come at festival time and whole area will be decorated with ornaments etc."
,,Destination of Indian shops and restaurants in Singapore,4.0,,Little India as the name suggests is an area in Singapore which has shops and restaurants where you can find India items. Mustafa Centre is most well known landmark here which remains open even in night. Its a big mall where you can get all Indian and non-Indian items.
,,Is it Singapore or India?,3.0,,"This neighborhood has arisen because under British rule emigrants from India were allowed to settle there alone (Similarly 'Chinatown' originated in Singapore). It consists of several streets and between the blocks there are covered markets in the budget segment.

Walking there on the narrow paths between the stalls with their colorful items such as clothing, food, jewelry, things for the home, leather, etc. you get the feeling that you‚Äôre in India. In the streets you can find low-rise buildings with small shops such as jewelers, electronics affairs, eateries , who are all focused on their Indian clients. But tourists are equally welcome . The area is not unsafe, but the buildings are poorly maintained and the streets themselves are dirty, lacking sidewalks, or these are filled with junk. And then the clean Singapore feels suddenly a long way away.

It gave me a little cultural shock but it was also intriguing: not because of the shabby streets; that's just a little piece of India. But that such an area exists in the most clean and regulated nation, 100 meters away from each other !? Of course you can visit Little India just to buy a cheap piece of clothing. But with me questions arose like: ‚ÄòDoes other rules for pollution apply here, or why are they not observed? Is there sufficient public money available and who decides how it is spend? Mix the two populations or are there social tensions?‚Äô
Those questions remain. But they make a visit to this part of Singapore (or is it India?) all the more intriguing.

Tip: in october/november Hindus celebrate 'Deepavali', the festival of lights and then you should pay a visit in the evening. Not because you see less of the dirt, but because the festive lighting above the streets and the many oil lamps that are extra interred in the shops and homes, create an fabulous atmosphere."
,,Little india,4.0,,It is Diwali time . So Little India has been lighted up for the yearly festival . We can find all Indian stuff to wear and use on this occasion .the PM of Singapore also visited this place and wished the Indian happy Diwali .the tourists roam around in rickshaws and enjoyed
,,Best neighborhood of Singapore,5.0,,"We much prefer the authentic cultural neighborhoods of Chinatown, Arab Quarter and Little India above the hyper-modern skyscraper neighborhoods. Of these places, Little India was definitely the best one we visited. It's delightful to walk around in the busy, non-squeeky-clean streets here and visit the market, food court and temples."
,,Colorful place,4.0,,"We stayed in Singapore for 3 days and 2 nights..and since our hotel is in Selegie road I searched in google maps the near places from our hotel. Its a good place where you can buy beautiful handmade bags, wallets etc.inspired by their beautiful culture."
,,Interesting Place,5.0,,"Lots of food and shopping can be done here, it's super busy in the evenings and on weekends but it's really worth visiting. The food here is cheap and tasty. We usually spend around SGD20 for a big meal for 2. (can spend less)."
,,Crowded during a festival of lights,3.0,,I was with a tour group which was great. As an individual woman I would not stray off the main street. There are very few women and many large groups of men and men walking up and down the streets. I would go to the start of little India to see the flower covered peacocks with the lights in the tails and the street decorations light up.
,,Very busy,4.0,,"We went here on a week night and the district was very busy. Unfortunately didn't really get to explore as much as I would have liked as my kids were a bit freaked out with the crowds.
Managed to find a small hawker center with very authentic food, I had a curry from an indian store and my kids had fried rice from a chinese store that had pig trotters, tails and intestines etc on the menu.
You could almost believe you were in India."
,,"Colorful Vendors, Plentiful Sights",4.0,,"Little India is, indeed, an eye-opener.

Expect the usual suspects - Indian eateries, Hindu temples, Indian Goldsmiths, Indian vendors.

However, in multi-racial Singapore, don't be surprised to see Chinese temples, Churches, Chinese Goldsmith in Little India.

Delight in the area's diversity, Enjoy its colonial structures and mixed -development buildings.

Little India have much to offer. A trek there is convenient. Buses, taxis, MRT stations services are readily available.

Worth a visit.

See the Chinese temple/monastery founded by a Thai monk, funded by the Burmese Aw brothers (of Tiger Balm fame) who were American citizens. Known also as the Temple of 1,000 Lights, the Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple at Race Course Road features a 15 metre high statue of a seated buddha."
,,"Singapore's Indian community hub, visit for Indian food and shopping.",4.0,,"Little India is a buzzing historic district that shows off the best of Singapore's Indian community, from vibrant culture to ethnic-inspired shopping. Good place to have Indian food especially vegetarian friendly at reasonable price."
,,A feast of the senses,5.0,,"Perfect timing coincided our November visit to Singapore during the Deepavali festival in Little India.

This commemoration celebrates the triumph of good over evil, and light over darkness.

Acclaimed by Hindus across the world, this festival truly shows how multi-cultural this vibrant neighbourhood of Singapore really is.

The streets are full of people, bustling with atmosphere.

From visiting temples, wandering through the bazaars and stall holders selling festive souvenirs and knick knacks, to a fascinating array of food to tantalise your taste buds.

It's well worth a visit whenever you are travelling to this captivating and charming part of Singapore.

Easy access from many hotels via the subway and you can disembark either at Little India or Farrer park station."
,,Real Taste and Feel of India rather Tamil Nadu in Singapore,4.0,,The Place is full with Indians. It has a ethnic Tamil and Singaporean feel. The place is good for both Veg and Non Veg Indian Food. Gives a feel of Indian ways in Singapore. Quite a spectacle during the diwali festival. Shopping on budget is a great option in this place. Mustafa Centre is worth a visit for Toys...and many more..
,,A taste of the exotic,5.0,,"Wander round the streets and go to the hawker centre for a real taste of India, the Rotis Canni and Murtabck is some of the best I have tasted and is reasonably priced.
We were ther during Deepavali and it was an incredible experience. People are very friendly and it is a vibrant area. A must visit whilst in the small but worldly country."
,,UTTERLY FASCINATING PLACE TO VISIT AND EXPERIENCE.,5.0,,"We stayed in Kitchener Road for a week, so we were just around the corner from Little India. I spent hours there, just strolling the streets, and taking in the atmosphere. The whole road is lined with tiny shops, selling everything imaginable. You haven't see anything until you've seen someone putting a new tyre on a truck that's simply stopped in the main street and is sitting there, jacked up, right in the middle of the traffic!

There are tailors sitting at sewing machines on the footpath, buy a pair of $5 jeans or a $10 shirt and they'll alter them for you, right there.

I walked past a little food shop and an elderly chap behind the desk said 'hello' as I passed, so I decided to try their food. I love eating 'locally' when I travel, I can't stand the sight of a white tablecloth! Down the back of the shop was a row of benches with trestles to sit on, and lots of obviously local people enjoying a meal. I ordered from the counter, even though the cook couldn;t spe English, and I ended up with a delicious Indian meal, far more than I could eat, for $9.00...

The only 'downside' I noticed was the number of mobile phone shops that are now among the traditional shops, all chrome and glass, with hip hop music blasting, they're utterly out of place in this otherwise amazing market place."
,,Shooping,5.0,,Shopping is very interesting & cheap .BIg Lane of shopping with many options. Resruatrats & the famous Mustafabazar 24Hrs
,,There during Deepavali celebration,5.0,,"We were in Little India and got to enjoy the sights, lights, sounds and shopping associated with Deepavali. It was a highlight of our trip! What a fascinating area of Singapore. Walking through the market was almost overwhelming - the temple was filled with worshippers and tourists - all amazing to see."
,,Exploring little India,4.0,,"Yesterday we jumped on the MRT and headed to Little India. It's a must see if in Singapore. The place makes me feel like I'm somewhere else, the architecture is beautiful and also some cheap shopping in the area too. Beautiful decorations line the Main Street."
,,Don't miss this place !,5.0,,"If you are after Indian clothings , jewellery , trinkets, lamps, idols , home decors , music and of course Indian food/restaurants, then this is a heaven for you ! Busy and full of life, everything from Indian flowers, fruits, vegetables are sold here . There are beautiful temples to visit and the place is really colourful !!"
,,India Outside India,5.0,,"As it was my first international trip, I was very anxious. Visiting Little India in Singapore made me feel nostalgic. It is definitely a paradise for Indian food lovers and vegetarians. You can get regional souveniers at much cheaper rates here than anywhere else. Alos, language is no bar as most of the shopkeepers knew Hindi. You will see use of beautiful architecture in the buildings. Also, a South Indian temple in the middle of the market is worth a visit."
,,Folkore!,4.0,,"I thought I was in an open market in india!Different kinds of fruits, vegetables, music and many many other stuff.I love it!"
,,Full of life,5.0,,"A wonderful little place. So much to see, so much vegetarian yummies to eat. One could spend hours here."

,,Actually a little India..to get a familiar feeling to indian,5.0,,Actually it is a little india place..where you ll find all shops full of indian people and indian food..you can visit this place for pure vegetarian option also as in Singapore it is very difficult to get pure indian vegetarian restaurant
,,A Little Taste of India,4.0,,"We enjoyed a few hours strolling through Little India, exploring the markets and lanes. The colours, sights and smells are entertaining! Enjoyed the food, and the Heritage Centre is well worth a look."
,,A colourful display of culture,4.0,,"Little India is my favourite place in Singapore. In the midst of sky rise buildings and modern, clean Singapore, lose yourself in the animated streets of Little India. The market is incredible and you can find anything from typical Indian clothing to snacks and electronics. Prices are way more reasonable than in the rest of Singapore and overall safety is fine. I enjoyed bargaining for clothes and looking at the local decorations for Diwali. A must see!"
,,Culture,4.0,,Good to view and feel the indian section of Singapore. Enjoyed the food and worth a look. So many shops and things to buy if interested.
,,Lots to see and eat!,5.0,,"Little India in Singapore is lovely. Easy to access using the local transit system and small enough to walk around for a while if you are looking for something to do. There are little shops everywhere where you can bargain for souvenirs, and amazing food to be had on every street, especially where all the hawker stalls are!"
,,Underwhelmed,3.0,,"After visiting China Town, and being bowled over, we expected the same with Little India. Unfortunately this was not the case. Some superb temples for sure, and these were the high spots, especially the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple. The Mustafa shopping centre was also an experience. However, the rest was quite underwhelming. Lots of bustle, lots of smells, but really nothing too special. I certainly was not encouraged to eat there; this was by far the dirtiest part of Singapore (mind you Singapore is generally extremely clean). Worth a visit if you've time to spare, but don't make it a priority."
,,Interesting and an experience,5.0,,"Little India is a unique part of Singapore. Where as previously it was a challenge to walk down there due to the smell and general atmosphere, now its rather clean, few adverse odors but a very strong Indian atmosphere.

There are heaps of shops selling every type of what ever you want, where they are a reasonable price and/or quality it is there. It is an amazing experience just to walk through."
,,Shaby but Lots of Good Food Joints,4.0,,"The First Sight of Little India was a Bit Shaby, But as you get going, you try to soak in. The Place is famous not only for Mustafa Shopping Center, but also for some Authentic Indian Food Joints. Lots to Roam and Watch. Good Spot to pick up some Sovereigns to take back Home. Bars where in you could find some cheap drinks ( Expensive ones Also are available). Also famous for Mobiles and Gadgets at Cheaper prices
Out of the Lot One POint which I would try to Highlight is at any point if time you will not fel Insecure or intimidated. ( Off Course it is Singapore)!!!!!"
,,Don't get the hype,2.0,,"Got told by everyone to visit this area, and to be honest, I was a bit disappointed. There wasn't anything that really caught my eye and I thought wow, impressive. I didn't get my camera out once, that's how unimpressed I was. As a solo female backpacker, I felt very unsafe in this area, and I visited in the day. Walking down streets that was full of Indian men staring, no women or children in sight. Even when I did find an area with some women, even they were staring and making me feel very uncomfortable. Wouldn't return."
,,Vibrant culturally diverse area,5.0,,"Located on Beach Rd, this area retains much of the flavour of old Singapore. Though it is ringed by tall towers and busy roads you can still escape down narrow laneways to sample the many shops and restaurants"
,,Exellent and unique location for shopping and food,5.0,,"A fascinating part of Singapore, Little India is very different by day and night. We enjoyed a great meal here. Would love to see it in Diwali. Mustafa's is a must - a very different department store to the usual malls in Singapore. A great place to buy souvenirs!"
,,Don't miss the Deepavali market,3.0,,"We walked around this colorful area, the buildings are colored with bright colors, and the streets are decorated, I believe for Deepavali celebrations. The highlight was a color dazzling Deepavali market where they sell decorations for the celebrations. Together with the incense smell and the flower chains the whole atmosphere is of one big happy celebration.
The vegetable stores offer a wide selection of different vegetables and fruit not found anywhere else and the sweet stalls offer a huge variety of Indian sweets and pastries"
,,Fun way to spend time,4.0,,"Great area for a wander. Lots of things to look at and trinkets and clothes to buy.

It is Diwali so great decor and extra markets to visit.

Mustaphs is a must visit. Set your self a challenge to name something you don't think you could buy. Chances are you will find it."
,,Real little india,4.0,,Filled with indians. You can find A lot of indian shops and restaurants in this place. Cheap shopping options are available.
,,A big beautiful mess,4.0,,"Fun mesmerizing place. Packed. Chaotic.

When to go? all year round but especially before Deepavali (Diwali). So in October. Streets look like on Christmas eve... only it's hot and humid.

Why to go? It's just something else. Not the spotless Singapore but more of a mess. A beautiful mess.

How to get there? If you weren't informed already in Singapore public transport is great and simple. So go get it. MRT has a stop called Little India.

Want the full package? Go on a Sunday. All the Indians will be there and it's a great experience. After 30 minutes you might get really tired. Information overload.

Families - it might be fun but avoid Sundays. Better. You might lose each other in that traffic. It is safe though.

Couples - it's fun, there are many cool shops and some that just make no sense

Solo travelers - you know what to do; stroll around with no exact destination; also try the Hindu temple.

Group of friends - make extra friends there, people are chatty.

Bonus missions:
Try Mustafa Center. It's open 24/7.
Try Tekka Center for some Indian food. My North Indian work mate (Punjabi) took me here and told me it's the only place in Singapore where the food tastes likes ""home"". I wouldn't argue with him.

Enjoy!"
,,Market at little India,4.0,,A nice and multicoloured place to find small gifts or Indian clothes. Very cheap. People are friendly. You can use the touristic bus to reach this place with a stop at the beginning of the main street. Very convenient.
,,Enjoy India in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore then why don't visit little India, which will give you a real taste of real India. This place is quite vibrant and once can surely feel that he/she is right in the middle of India."
,,"In comparison to rest of Singapore, this place blows!",2.0,,"Went here to visit mustafa, I was taken aback as to how different and low quality this area was in comparison to the rest of Singapore. The roads are dirty and the streets were crowded as hell. U momentarily wonder if you had visited South India instead of SIN. Even the people don't seem to have that respective unintrusive manner but they stare at you with no restraint at all. Atleast the people were NICE and helpful when asked for directions which was the saving grace..."
,,Interesting Walk,4.0,,"I got off at the Little India MRT station and walked all along Serangoon road & back for about 2 hours
On your right is Ananda Bhawan, a great hole in the wall for a South Indian breakfast
On the opposite side is a narrow lane leading to the House of Ten Tang Niah, a very colourful piece of architecture
Father along Serangoon road is the famous Veeramakaliamman Temple, which is only open in the mornings & evenings (closed around noon) here I was pleasantly surprised when a delicious tomato rice was offered
My last stop was the Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple, a Buddhist Temple on a bylane off the main road
People are quite helpful to find places unless you're on Google maps"
,,Heaven for us,5.0,,Being a vegetarian indian family this place was heaven for us. It is spread out in a huge area and has a number of shops. There are so many vegetarian restaurants in this market. We had our dinner at sarvanna and came back with our tummy stuffed. Also the time we went to this place was pre Diwali. So the whole market was beautifully decorated. It was a site to see. Must visit.
,,Not nice at all,1.0,,"Me and my girfriend went here on a Saturday afternoon. We started from the Little India subway station and walked around. If you are walking on the busy streets you will find that close to 90% of the people are men. Nothing wrong with that, only the majority kept staring at my girlfriend in a scary way. And I am not exaggerating. We were so uncomfortable after 30 minutes that we had dinner and went away to never return."
,,A Chinatown alternative.,4.0,,"A bustling couple of streets and their surroundings comprise Little India. There are many gold and jewellery shops, like most Asian markets, but much else too. The little market stalls have the really characterful stuff.

Prices are keen for that souvenir, and the area felt very safe. It's on the bus route, and would be a shame to miss if you've a couple of hours to spare in Singapore."
,,Fascinating area to explore,4.0,,We visited when it was Deepavali which meant that the Main Street was decorated and at night was lovely. The temple which is part way down (called Sri veerakalimman temple) was busy with the local community paying homage to a variety of deities and was an interesting spectical - well worth a visit
,,A weird science to life,3.0,,A place to visit with friends. The smells were different but the atmosphere was unique but overall I like the shops and variety of jewelry being sold.
,,A Little busy,3.0,,Very busy and cramped. There wasn't a lot to see and we didn't feel very welcome there. Completely different to the rest of Singapore.
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,"Visited Singapore for a week in September and visited Little Indian on a Friday afternoon.
Was initially concerned that it would be too busy but it was fine.
Enjoyed leisurely walked down the streets and wandering into the different shops.
Had food in Komalas Villas before we heading back to the hotel, where we enjoyed the food and the service was very friendly.
I'd recommend going to Little Indian while visiting Singapore"
,,Drive through on a weekday,3.0,,"Very interesting ethnic Indian shops, culture, shops selling typical South Indian goods; eye opening experience and to soak up the atmosphere. Walking, looking into side alleys will bring unexpected sights; great Photographers outing too. Don't go on Sundays when crowds will be extensive."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"We spent a few good hours here wandering through all the little streets full of market stalls and shops and Taylor's
Super cheap for clothing bags spicers especially and he erase things and loads of cheaply priced good souvenirs
Full of lovely smells and good food and atmosphere"
,,"Not really Singapore, and a bit intimidating",3.0,,"Unlike most of Singapore Little India is dirty with rubbish lying around. For women, walking at night is a bit scary - the streets are full of men who sit and stare. Worth a day to look around, then go."
,,A Little India in Singapore!,3.0,,"This is a Little India literally in Singapore. Rolls of shops around the suburb buzzing with Indian business atmosphere.

The streets are decorated very colourfully. Parts of the street smelt of the Indian Spices and Incense.

A good place to savour the Indian culture in Singapore."
,,Shopping location,4.0,,"Little India had plenty of shoppings and restaurants, for the tourists this would be one of the attractions where they might spent more than 6 hours in this spot, so it is advised to choose this place to visit for half day tour. This is one of the old attraction where you see the indian culture in Singapore."
,,Name says everything,4.0,,Yes it's a little India in Singapore . Once you come to this place you feel like aa if you are in India . For Indian food lover this place is best to have food !!
,,Really little...,4.0,,"Little India in Singapore is really tiny and it's a quiet place, nice for a stroll. It's also good for shopping, if you're interested in that. We were there in the late afternoon, there weren't many people in the streets and we felt fine and safe. It's probably a good spot to try some authentic Indian food, unfortunatelly, we weren't hungry that time."

,,Lots of atmosphere,4.0,,"We got a taxi to drop us off here, and wandered round, soaking up the atmosphere. There are lots of fascinating streets, shops and markets, and wonderful aromas.

,,Singapore Odyssey,4.0,,Much more fun than Orchard Road.You get a real feel and taste of India.Food is great.Probably the best travel agents in Asia here.Can arrange very cheap flights here.
,,WOULD NOT VISIT AGAIN.,1.0,,Stopped at Little India uring travel on Hop on Hop Off Bus. Streets were extremely crowded with people. Place smelt gutters were full of rubbish. Place on the not to do list in Singapore.

,,Very Interesting Area to Visit,4.0,,"Good place to visit if one is on a stopover and want to explore the favour of Singapore. . The area has a lot of various shops if one is interested in shopping with reasonable prices or just for a look about. There are Indian food places to eat. Beautiful Vindaloo, Rojan Josh, Pilaf and the local Tiffin. There are Sari shops selling very beautiful saris of many lovely colours to take home. If one needs to use the amenities for a donation one can use these."
,,Nice place to hangout,5.0,,This place is full of Indian tradition and shops. Indian heritage center potrays Indian values. Many Indian restaurants are available.
,,It is Little India,3.0,,"Like the title, you'll see loads of Indian shops run by the Indian community, loads of Hindu or Sikh temples. Why the 3 stars? Cuz there's nothing special about it and dirty. Shame"
,,Ok for a stroll - easy to get lost!,3.0,,"A nice place to spend a bit of time, but it is quite disorienting with all the close streets. It is also the place where you are most likely to be hassled to buy stuff which put us off a bit, however the sights and smells are amazing and worth a short visit at least."
,,The rich Indian culture,5.0,,Little Indian is a never ending activities area.there is a 24 hours mall nearby. The famous indian temple. The night dim sum is just nearby if you are hungry in the middle of the night. Little Indian. Best time to visit is Saturday where not much human traffic. Sunday is a day where all the local and foreigner Indians will be there doing their Sunday marketing. Dont forget to visit the Indian arcade nearby the tekka market. Take a circle line train and alight at little indian.the start of the trail. Alight at Farrer park station will be end of little indian. Enjoy the trail.
,,Quaint place ...,3.0,,Went here primarily to eat some indian food. Really helps to eat home style food at one of the restaurants here.
,,Not the best of Singapore,2.0,,"Well it comprises of mostly Indian cheap fast food and businesses. If you want to buy cheap or if you want fast Indian cuisine, then it is the place to try. Nothing special though."
,,Over crowded on Sunday,3.0,,"We walking from little India station till Mustofa Center. A lot little souvenir shop, India cultural shop(hanging fresh flower) and the Indian restaurant. But when we reach Mustafa Center was to crowded ( we visit on Sunday ). If you wanna visit better avoid Sunday."
,,Curious,3.0,,Had seen a sign on the mrt so decided to see what little India was like. Well a really busy place loads of tailor shops and dress materials reasonable prices. called into a temple had a nosy round interesting to see other cultures
,,Not So Defined,3.0,,"The so-called Little India is a quarter to the north east of Singapore City that is a concentration of Indian businesses and enterprises.

Earlier I had visited Chinatown and Singapore's Malay Quarter and was impressed by how the old cultures and living styles were still evident, despite the commercializations of both areas.

At Little India I found it harder to identify the unique Indian influences, apart from the obvious proliferation of Indian restaurants.

My Singaporean host, who was acting as my knowledgable guide, agreed with me and said that part of the reason was that Little Indian is still very much a vibrant Indian community concerned with going about its own business and paying less attention to the trappings and needs of tourists. In the context that I was looking at, that made sense."
,,Had some good food,4.0,,Some wickedly tasty foodcout meals here and cheap as chips for Singapore prices. Very hustle and bustle so an interesting experience if you have never been to a little India type settlement
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"The coolest thing to see there is how they make those strands of tightly packed flowers.... the rest super humid and hot as singapore is.. smelly too many smells in little india found it hard to breathe, super old and worn down... i sorta expected more i guess..good news is...mrt station right there so you can leave as quickly as you arrived..."
,,Different,4.0,,"Nearly forgot to visit but saw that the Mrt had a station there. If you like gold or materials such as silk then this is the place. There's not as much choice for gimmicky items as there is in China town, but it's still worth a visit."
,,India light,4.0,,You find a lot of indian places but it is still very much Singapore influenced as it is proper and organized. Struggled to find a restaurant where you can have beer with your curry as it is mostly a dry part of town.
,,Such a fun little neighborhood,5.0,,"This was less hustle-bustle and ""big city"" which gave it great charm. The shops and restaurants catered to real people and so were well priced, comfortable and food wise fabulous! Lovely colors on the buildings and street art installations, too."
,,Nothing to see other than the temple,2.0,,"Little India is a waste of time. Compared to the rest of Singapore, it is dirty and unappealing. The only interesting area is the main temple on Serangoon road. You can go straight there and leave afterwards, walking a few block on Serangoon from the closest subway stations, Rochor or Little India. Even food was nothing special. I really like Indian food and was hoping to have a great lunch, but food was just ok. I don't remember the name of the restaurant, though."
,,Good shopping in little India,3.0,,"Be transported to India thru the smell of food cooking, and spices and the hustle and bustle of city life and bargain shopping."
,,"Atmosphere, Atmosphere, Atmosphere",4.0,,"We stayed in Singapore for 5 days and went to Little India to see the area.

There were lots of food places to eat so many types of Indian food to try you could spend days here trying them all."
,,Interesting place to discover,4.0,,"This was just a few minutes from our hotel (Park Royal, Kitchener) and we found it by accident while exploring. Great range of shops and places to eat and such a contrast to the modern shopping malls."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"A rtue corner of India in the busy and expensive Singapore. I loved every bit of it and decided my next trip will be to India!
You can get lost between those roads and narrow markets, you breath the scent of flowers outside the temples and feel the misticity of those prayer places. I spent 1 whole day without shoes inside a temple, feasting my eyes over the colorfulness of the statues."
,,Not much to do here,2.0,,"We went to little India to experience - might be a worthwhile experience if you want to experience Indian culture or you are from India. It was mostly three types of shops - gold, Indian clothing, souvenirs, and food. We went into mustafa centre but found the prices to just be okay compared to Canadian prices. It was kind of clean, but saw rat traps everywhere so was grossed out."
,,Temples shopping,4.0,,"One of the most busiest and crowded area of singapore. You will find so many Indian restaurants, so many Hindu temples and a lot of shopping at economic rate. So many cheap but decent hotels are also there."

,,Nice day out,5.0,,"Was a nice day out. Would recommend you hire a car so that you can see more quickly or else there is a lot of walking and it can be tiring in the hot weather. Best part is that you can find everything Indian here! One stop place for Indian goods. There is a very nice local eating place as you exit Little India MRT. Lots of locals eat here and i would highly recommend it for the atmosphere and the tasty food. Nice clean tables to eat at and place to wash hands available. Must visit it for the atmosphere. There is also lots of south indian food, north indian and another section of lots of chinese food stalls. Serangoon Road has many hair and beauty parlours and reasonably priced i stopped and got my hair done :). You can get henna tattoos and face threading done here as well."
,,Another example of colorful Singapore,3.0,,"Visit the temples, and be a respectful visitor. This is people's home, but the share it gladly. Eat at one of the small roadside restaurants for exceptionally tasty Indian food."
,,shopping time,5.0,,my nephew said if we need something to buy don't miss musta mall...wow they have really cheap grocery selective items like 4pcs of cadbury for 8.95$ it's really cheap even nescafe coffee in big jars. @ 5.95$ what more will I ask.
,,"Worth a look, not much else",2.0,,"Little India is a very authentic district in Rochor, Singapore. It has a vibrant colour scheme to its buildings and some interesting restaurants. The area could be said to have character and the temples are definitely a highlight. However, the district itself is a bit grimy and I wouldn't recommend spending too much time there."
,,Must See In Singapore,5.0,,"I visited Singapore on business in June 2016 and my wife, son and daughter joined me for the second week. Little India is a must see. There are many Chinatowns in the world but Little India is unique. Serangoon Road is very interesting to walk along. Shops and restaurants. Local Indian culture. Hustle and bustle. I have reviewed the sights of Little India separately."
,,Visit with kids,2.0,,There is not much to do here other than taste indian food and gaze at the shop stalls.. It could be very crowded with indians at night.

,,Vibrant,4.0,,Little India is a vibrant place to spend a couple of hours. The hakka needs a little cleaning. We found the food to be on the bland side. The shops were expensive $150 for a men's short sleeve dress shirt.
,,Quick look-find a nice sweets stall,4.0,,"It was good to come here and take a look but I wouldn't spend too much time here, fortunately I managed to find a shop that sold Indian sweets, they were very good and not too badly priced, delicious and took me back to when...More"

,,Really its Little India,5.0,,"Shopping in Little India is not exactly your run-of-the-mill retail experience. The Singapore shopping scene is usually associated more with futuristic mega-malls, with ultra-designer brands in gleaming air-conditioned open spaces. Little India, however, presents a very different story; one that‚Äôll probably leave you with a...More"

,,A taste of india in singapore,5.0,,nice experience to visit little india. You get a taste of india in singapore. Go to the food markets and prepare yourself to blend with the locals. Its not fancy at all so be ready to have to buy some napkins (not available at restaurants) or bring some from home.
,,Not the most interesting part of Singapore - cheap stalls etc,3.0,,So much of old Singapore has now been razed to the ground - an example is Little India. What remains is bland and geared mainly for tourists - unfortunately inevitable. Nothing to get too excited about - unless you need your cell/phone unblocked or a SIM card.
,,Worth a quick visit,3.0,,"I buzzed through Little India before I had to leave Singapore. I wasn't overly impressed. It seemed to be filled with gold jewelry shops and not much else. I did see the temple, which was interesting, but can't hold a candle next to the Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple in Chinatown."
,,Fascinating visit,5.0,,"Spent a lovely morning in the area [including the tourist centre], and a nice lunch afterwards nearby."
,,So disappointed,2.0,,"Everyone raved about Little India and we were so disappointed. We did find a good restaurant, but other than that, we must have missed other things to see. We ended up on a seedy red light side street. That was about our only highlight."
,,All indian Food and things,4.0,,"You can get all indian food and daily needs , all shop owners a re indian and you can get vegetarian indian food"
,,Mini India with a typical South India flavour,4.0,,"Once you are here it transports you back to India,you do not feel that you are in foreign country with a good mix of affordable stores.Tamil and Hindi can be heard as a go along this street.
Friendly shop owners will make your shopping experience great"
,,Little üáÆüá≥,4.0,,"This part of Singapore is truly a snapshot of India.

It has a vibe and hustle and bustle to it but not intimidating. Buffalo Road is interesting and being Caribbean I can appreciate the many stores selling a taste of home from the mutton and chicken sold in the hawker centre and market, to the numerous clothing stalls, remittance shops to send home money and SIM card top up sellers for M1, Singtel and Star Hub to call back home.

If you can walk down on the main strip pass buffalo road til you reach Amber restaurant and enjoy the passengers board the 65 and 67 buses what a sight and the buses run frequently.

Persons we interacted with were friendly and helpful and where English wasn't understood clearly international hand gestures worked"
,,Good food at affordable prices !,4.0,,One of the best things about this place is that one gets to taste Indian food at extremely affordable prices.
,,Good food,4.0,,"One of the fun things about Singapore is you can take a metro for a few stops and feel like you're in a different country. Little India really is that, it's as though you're suddenly in Delhi (albeit a slightly cleaner version), with bars full of men drinking beer and cheap restaurants at every turn. Enjoy."
,,Feel of India!,4.0,,Well!-food and temple!-you get a large Indian pallete of food-enjoy--also -local indian market-south of India rather--this is a peek in southern india!!-explore!!
,,Best Indian food in Singapore,5.0,,"One can found best Indian food in Singapore @ little India. Must try curry and kabab, for veg kailash parbat is just awesome.. Guys don't opt hotel with breakfast especially for Indians. Always book your hotel near little India..."
,,exciting mixed india singapore culture at a glance,4.0,,"I visit little india after I see a review on tripadvisor about cheap hawker stall, this is the nearest to where I stay, I go to the hawker stall and get disappointed with the food, tasteless mutton curry that is overrated by the tripadvisor review, maybe it just my taste bud.
anyway the one that I not get disappointed at is the nice colorful area which offer a lot of traditional India feelings, I really enjoy my short trip there"
,,the difference with my country,4.0,,"I went out to the Little India at night, the street was quiet crowed and I found the difference with my country. it's a amazing experience."
,,"Nothing against the Indian folk, but...",2.0,,It's a place that does not worth the time to visit it. It's dirty and messy. The restaurants are not attractive (whereas I do love Indian food!). The buildings are so deteriorated that they diverge from the rest of the Singaporean places.
,,Fun place to shop for spices or to snack some tasty street food,4.0,,"Spend an hour walking round the few blocks, shop for spices or silk, and taste some very nice street food."
,,Little bit of India...,4.0,,"Missing India in Singapore... Head on to Little India.. Its a place with lot of Vibrant colours and noise.. Loud Bollywood and Tollywood music ... little Knick knacks from India.. Cheap Jeans, T-shirts, 1$ -2$ items , Indian Food and Indian People everywhere...

Yes.. this place would remind you of a bus crowded street in India..
Craving for Indian food.. head to one of these joints...There are lot of food joints here serving Indian food...

Theres a mustafa centre here .. where you can stock your ""INDIAN"" groceries .. which you might not be able to find at most of the Fair price or 7/11 stores in singapore.

Theres a small corner nook near GATE 4 of mustafa cafe, you can try Teh Halia there.. to quench your Ginger tea thirst! and yes Samosa Chaat on the 7th Floor roof top cafe "" kebabs and curries"" at the Mustafa centre"
,,Run down,3.0,,I was kind of disappointed with Little India it's not as heavy as I thought. It's extremely quiet there isn't too much going on and it's just kind of run-down I wish they would put more effort into it not bad there are some really good restaurants nearby.
,,"A little bit of Chennai, a bit of Mumbai and some Singapore",5.0,,"a home away from home for Indians. You will not miss the food, the weather, the people and the religious places. amazing food joints : try Murugan Idly, Copper Chimney Shopping: 24hrs open Mustafa Center"
,,Nothing much,3.0,,"I was really excited to go to little india. Sadly it was raining when we arrived, and as we walked from little india mrt stop down to farrer park mrt, all we saw was mostly jewelry store, cheap clothing store, electronic store, and some indian restaurants tucked in between. Super crowded and nothing much to see. I was expecting more art/ craft store but even in tekka market, they mostly only sell saree on lv. 2"
,,Great Location,4.0,,"Even though NOT a fan of Indian Food, this area had a ton of restaurants for anyone's taste. Everything from Italian to Mexican. Excellent MRT stop as well."
,,Felt like I was in India,4.0,,Little India was a wonderful place where we ate a few times as the food was so good and very reasonably priced. The market areas were fun busy and I picked up a few souvenirs along the way. The people were friendly and accommodating. We had a hotel close by so we walked there in 5min.
,,A small gem in the city,4.0,,"I was very excited to visit Littl India and I was not dissapointed at all!

You can easily reach there by metro and walk for a couple of hours. Plenty of shops to buy any souvenirs, indian sweets or food. While walking the smells, the music and people..it realy feels like doing a travel to India.

If you are around don't miss the Indian heritage Centre. If you are interested in some history and more cultural information it's definitely worth it. The entrance is only around 4 $ and the tour downst last very long. In total, we spent a good 3h there and enjoyed it."
,,A taste of India,4.0,,Wander around the streets and you will miss india. Has the finest south indian food chain komlas here. Mustafa is a giant shopping place where you can shop for just any and everything.
,,Amazing how this place truly resembles some parts of India,5.0,,"Amazing how this place truly resembles some parts of India
- Hotels are aplenty and of all variety. authentic south Indian food, Gujarati thalis, north Indian dishes
- The Mustaffa mall is astonishingly big (mammoth) and doesnt give you any hint of its size from outside
- You will be spoilt by the choice in Mustaffa mall - be it Television set , or Gold, or Watches, or bag...name it and you have it"
,,South India pure in Singapore,5.0,,"Felt like at home with all the vegetables, jewellery, clothes shops and restaurants. We had food at Kailash Parbat which was good. Living in Germany for me it was the closest I got to South India."
,,A taste of India in Singapore,4.0,,"My husband and I spent the best part of a day wondering the streets of this area. It really felt like we were in India, the food the smells, the architecture. We wondered through Mustafa and couldn't believe the unusual things we picked up. I even bought a great saucepan at a fantastic price. You can pick up anything and everything here, from toiletries to gardening equipment. It is massive and usually packed with people grabbing their bargains. The food in little India is authentic and if you are hankering for a spicy delight, this is the place to be. The Indian sweets are also authentic and available throughout the place. We loved the market type stalls but we're disappointed with the prices and the stall holders weren't as flexible with haggling as they are in India. I guess they are used to tourists paying top dollar here."
,,It's a slice of Delhi!,5.0,,"Having been to Delhi a few years ago - my friend said she would take me to Little India and it would remind me of it! I wasn't holding my breath but it really did! It's smells just like it. We loved it! Spent a few hours shopping and even had time for a kingfisher beer! I recommend this, especially if you e never been to India... It's like a taster!"
,,Miniature india,4.0,,"Little India in Singapore is a must visit for travellers to experience the multi cultural ethos of the city. Since I'm from India it reminds me of the sights, smells and the culture back home. Good area where we would find vegetarian Indian restaurants like Komala Vilas, Kailas Parbat etc. Also shopping at Mohd Mustafa is a must as you get almost everything here plus it's the only shop open 24/7 in Singapore. Advisable to travel here either by cab or bus as the metro was quite time consuming and also not direct from our stop. Another tip please avoid visiting during Diwali festival as the streets are quite crowded and restaurants have long waiting queues."
,,My Review,5.0,,"Little India is very good place for shopping. If you want to shopping, you can go to Mustafa. In there, you can buy many foods and goods with cheap price."
,,Boring and not that cheap,3.0,,"Prices are normal and yes there is everything but it's loud, not easy to navigate and there are big queues and mess."
,,Better than Chinatown,4.0,,An interesting area of Singapore with a concentration of beautiful old temples and garland sellers. Easy to find and get to via MRT. We spent a couple of hours wandering the streets enjoying the atmosphere.
,,A must,5.0,,If you want to see other side of Singapore allow your self going to little India you won't regret it
,,India Inside Singapore,5.0,,"If you are an Indian, you will feel like home here...all sorts of Indian Shops, Indian shopping stores, Indian Food and Indian People!! Reachable by SMRT or by Bus..."
,,India is not that LITTLE for sure ;),5.0,,"Its said that ""Tradition Never Dies, let it be wherever you go""
These people have justified it.
Indians who have gradually moved from India to SIngapore for work or for stay have their first land in this neighborhood.
Its accompanied by many south indian restaurants and many indian themed selling store."
,,Avoid it,1.0,,"Little India is a not interesting place to visit .Unless you want to buy Indian spices , better to skip this place. Streets are not very clean and it was quite an unsafe area.AVOID it."
,,What is this?,1.0,,"It's one long, dirty street. The vendor shops are all the same and offer nothing unique or interesting. There's no sidewalks really and the,only worthwhile stop is a Hindu temple, which my girlfriend couldn't go in. If you want some culture go to Haji Lane or Chinatown and skip ""Little Sketchy Street"" unless you want a watch... There's tons of cruddy watches."
,,What an awful dump!,1.0,,"Dio yourself a favor and avoid this post of Singapore it really is a dump.

My daughter and I felt very unsafe, guys were leering and being extremely inappropriate to my 13yr old daughter. My husband was getting pretty angry so we decided to leave.

The shops were either hard sell or just not interested. We didn't buy anything.

Couldn't wait to leave, do yourself a favor and avoid this place!"
,,interesting cultural experience,5.0,,"fascinating cultural experience...the temples, food, markets, people. probably will never make it to india...feel like we got a good flavor :)"
,,Nothing but a dump...,1.0,,"We spent 5 days in Singapore, and were amazed by the structure, cleanliness, discipline, public facilities (walks, transports, roads, MTR) until on the last day we stepped in to Little India. What a dump. The place is dirty, unorganized, encroached, undisciplined. Please AVOID going to this place as its just not worth it. Its truly an embarrassment."
,,Fun,4.0,,"A fun walk through this district saw us getting henna tattoos for our teenage daughters. Had an interesting lunch in a local place, but was very nice. Lots of jewellery stores and fresh food. Little India is fun when going there with the right people."
,,"True to its name, India in Singapore",4.0,,"With a smile, it is a true reflection of the India, truly said, we can create a true Indian environment wherever we go... after a long day's site visits and roaming around in neat and clean Singapore, with all traffic rules being followed, people mannerly crossing across streets, rare eye contacts with strangers, serious busy looking faces... (hope you can make out where i am leading you too), welcome to a refreshing Little India, first thing i observed, cabs parked anywhere, cycles parked almost perpendicular to the streets, water flowing down the road... ;) vegetables being sold on temp stands outside the shops, people chatting, laughing loud, enjoying the moment, all the chaos that we are used to, you can get a snapshot in there... :) It is refreshing, couple of instances, parents scolding their kids to have more food and complete them off their plates, forget spoons and forks, people enjoying the food, finger licking, whatever i say will be less... whoever tells that Little India shuts down by 10:30 - 11, do not believe it, it's alive at that time, all tourists taking a stroll (do keep in mind the time difference between Singapore and India), Mustafa mall (24 hours open) is another factor which keeps the place alive through the night... we were there till 1:30 am, food joints were closed, but tea and light refreshments were available, all varieties of food from major parts of India were available... definitely a must visit place, though can be covered up during evening hours, after completing sight seeing..."
,,India in the Heart of Singapore,4.0,,Typical Sight of a City in South India. Lot of Tamils and influence of Indian Culture. You will find lot of cheap stuff around this place. It is also famous for Indian Delicacies as most of the restaurants are Indian.
,,Deja vu,5.0,,"Waves of memories hit me as tastes and fragrant smelly came my way reminding me of India. Large selection of food, things to see, to buy (clothes, spices, fresh food) or just to simply walk around. The food court at the Market by Little India Station is a must as i am prettysure it beats all the other restaurants around. Truly alittle taste of India in many ways."
,,Chaos!,2.0,,"This place is utter chaos. Traffic suddenly seems to be so not like Singapore the moment you enter the vicinity of little India. People callously walk paying absolutely no respect to signals. They are usually in a crowd and you can't even question them. Most of the stuff available there are sub standard and don't last long. Having said this, little India is definitely the place to have authentic Indian food. From a vegetarian Komalas to Muthus curry you have them all."
,,Not worth the visit,2.0,,"I'm glad that I saw Little India, because I'd know not to go there again. I didn't feel all that safe either. Streets are not very clean and there weren't too many things that were worth seeing. We didn't buy anything. Area itself is not that big. Hindu temple was interesting though."
,,Some Indian things!!!,4.0,,"This place is dedicated to wholesome Indian culture. One can find here Indian food, cloths, groceries, temples, and of course people. This place is conveniently located between Little India MRT and Farrer Park MRT station. It is also commonly known as Serangoon road. It gets very crowded during weekends.
What you can really enjoy of this place is some traditional Indian delicacies right from Biryani, Tandoori Chicken, Garlic Naan , to Dosai. Also this place has some moderately priced shops for cloths, electronics, mementos, toys, and groceries. I found this place most cheapest for shopping in Singapore, plus quality of cloths could be found great as well, better than Bugis sometimes.
There is a large south Indian community in this area and food has absolute influence of south Indian cuisine. One can find couple of budget hotels and hostels for bagpackers around this location.
If you judge India as a country after visiting this place, then you are probably wrong. India and its culture is way beautiful than this place, but a tour of Singapore is incomplete without visiting this historical venue."
,,Colorful and worth a visit,4.0,,We spent and evening getting dinner and walking the main street just to take in the atmosphere. A visit to one of the temples while services were going on was a highlight.
,,AVOID!! Constant staring at by hordes of Indian men made me feel very unsafe and uncomfortable,1.0,,"Our Airbnb apartment was located on the verge of Little India- however in hindsight will never visit Little India again. I grew up in Malaysia with Indians, Chinese and many other ethnicities without facing any issue or discomfort in the Little India in my own hometown. However, when I walked through Little India for the first time to get to the MRT with my partner, we both noticed immediately that the streets were full of Indian men who just stared constantly at me and there were barely any women in the vicinity. We tried staring back but hundreds of glares/stares just faced us, and I felt the most uncomfortable that I have ever been in my life. We were so disturbed by our experience that we elected to take the long way to the Little India MRT, in order to avoid walking through the main area. AVOID at all costs!"
,,Love this area,5.0,,"I like Little India, there is plenty of attractions to view during the day and in the evening it is busy and exciting. The locality of Little India isn't that large but that doesn't matter, there are some great old buildings in the district and the cheap restaurants are fantastic. I now stay at accommodation around Little India when I visit Singapore, the hotels are well priced and the location is excellent."
,,Everything you want to buy,4.0,,There is so much to see and so much to buy. Warning do not go to this area with anyone that likes craft.
,,Best Place to Stay for Indians,5.0,,"Little India is populated with several ethnic groups, Mostly are Tamil, Bangla. Area has many Hotel serving Indian Foods at walking distance.If you feeling trouble by Singaporean food ,visit little India and taste authentic India food at very reasonable price. Avg Dinner cost here 15SG$ per person. Also, You would like to visit Temples in this area of South Indian God & Goddesses. Little walk and you'll be at Mustufa Mall, Cheapest and most economic mall for budget shopping. Do ask for GST redemption at GST counter in mall. Overall I'd prefer to stay in Little India for my next trip"
,,A funky place to experience Singapore,4.0,,"Little India in Singapore is a great place to have a bit if fun walking around the bustling streets. Away from the normally very clean, manicured streets of the central city Little India has some great food and some cool colourful shops."
,,Singapore - The world of Peefection,5.0,,"What can i say its difficult to express . A place which has everything in the world, you think of it and you find it. Staying in Singapore is expensive however here are some of the tips for first timers especially lone travelers. Backpackers ar the best option to save your money in places like little India, jalan besar, china town with accommodation s 10 to 15 $ per night. Night life at Clark Quay, world cuisines at Holland V, Vivo city Mall, Orchard Road, Bugis and MRT experiences is breath taking. Sentosa Island, Universal Studios, Marina bay, Gardens by Bay are a few must visit"
,,Normality in a super clean city,4.0,,"Bizarre to step off the MRT a few stops from the clean Singapore city, to being in, well India!!1 All that was missing was the random goat walking the street.
Great place though, lots of strange but unique eateries and a general good buzz about the area."
,,Indian? Home sick in Singapore?,4.0,,This is really Little India as the name goes by. It has the famous Mustafa Shopping Arcade and numerous Indian restaurants to take care of your taste buds. I preferred Duck Rice during the day which is the local food and in the night had dinner at Indian food joints.
,,Had to go there,3.0,,"Am not a big fan of Little India for me it is to much of the crowds and the same food and the same jewellery this time I had no choice as the nearest mall for eating was around there and it was walking distance from lavender
For most Indians I guess who must have Indian food or shop at mustafa it is a must but for me just OK
To crowded and to same"
,,Shop til you drop,3.0,,"Little India is a shopping bazaar. There are many electronics, garments and jewelry stores along with many restaurants.
The Mustafa Centre has ALMOST EVERYTHING you could ever need from clothing to housewares to automotive to medical to electronics to cameras to toys to stationary to shoes etc etc."
,,Not my cup of tea,2.0,,"We visited little India on a day city tour. I'm very glad we did not make a special trip. It was very crowded and walking on the paths was very hard.
There were lots of fruit and vegetable stalls down the streets and at the very top we found aome jewelers which sold gold jewellery most of it loked like it was for weddings.
We spent about 10 minutes walking up across and down 2 streets before we returned to our coach.
Our tour guide kept telling us to buy a fresh coconut but we did not see any about."
,,Nice for a walkabout,3.0,,The area has changed quite a bit over the years but still provides excellent exposure to the Indian culture in Singapore. The market areas (sidewalk shops) are still fun as was City Park Mall. The Hindu temples are always a treat as well. We did not find the spice area thia time but it may still be around.
,,A blight on Singapore,1.0,,"Following a visit to Chinatown we caught the underground train to Little India and was extremely impressed with the ease of ticket purchase, the cheapness, the display of connections, the cleanliness of the platform and trains and the sense of space. A few stops later we alighted and using the escalators provided exited through the unmanned ticket barriers operated via the ticket, emerging into our selected location.
What greeted us was the appalling contrast between that of Chinatown and the rubbish strewn streets we were in and the plethora of goldsmiths and food places.
Whilst this was a contrast to other areas of Singapore, it was also very different from the real India and merely a commercial area for Indians and of little or no interest if you don't want to dine.
I would like to record my thanks to the church guardians of the Methodist church who when asked for a pamphlet, gave me a book and refused any payment, but reluctantly accepted a donation."
,,ADORABLE,5.0,,"Is like to go to India FOR REAL - the shops, the parfumes, the people, the food, everything is originally indian"
,,So exotic and a must do,5.0,,"A pleasant and exotic break from the more commercial modern parts of this city. Wandering through the bustling streets and looking at the goods under the covered sidewalks. Colour and noise and a feeling of adventure. Check out the Indian Heritage Centre, good value at four dollars and convenient conveniences for those in need."
,,Great cross cultural experience,5.0,,"My kids and I really enjoyed the Hop On Hop Off bus in Singapore. Our first stop, Little India. We had a look around and then parked ourselves at a corner restaurant and ate lunch. We also did some shopping and let the sites and sounds of India seep into us so we could take 'em home with us!"
,,A more unique experience than Chinatown . . .,4.0,,"Did some walking and shopping and had to try the local Indian food. We went on a Saturday night, so busier, but also a more unique experience as the Indian locals congregate then. Simply a more unique ethnic experience than most. Very handy to new subway line, so can easily use that system from downtown. Loved the dinner and Tiger brew."
,,Shop for jewellery,4.0,,I came across a few good jewellery shops and in fact purchased a couple of items . My favourite place was Artheesdam jewellers. courteous staff was the plus point here.
,,Early Morning Pujas and Tamil History,5.0,,"If you are looking for a quiet spiritual start to your day in Singapore nothing beats an early morning Puja at the VeeramaKali temple. Here you will listen to live temple orchestra and wake up the Gods with the priests. You can either join the sunrise Puja at 630am or get there a bit later for another morning Puja at 8am. The tenple is filled with quiet energy and the faces of the gods and celestial beings smiling down on you is deeply moving. The scent of the the fresh flowers, sandalwood and incense also transports you to another plane. I always buy a nice freshly made garland ($10) as an offering to Kali. She will answer your prayers if you come with gentle love offerings. These garlands are freshly made in a little stall opposite the temple or in Bellilos lane. For floral enthusiasts it is wonderful to watch how deftly the garland is strung together with fresh flowers by these humble stall owners. The temple itself is not one of the great granite temples with towering vimanas like the Chola temples in South India. But the sculptural and architectural details are pristine. The faces and postures of all the temple sculptures are the work of a master shilpi from Tamil Nadu. Bring your favourite spiritual text and sit and read it cross legged on the floor of the temple. I have read many passages of Gita and Ramayana here. After thus you should reward yourself with a nice filter coffee and masala dosai at Komala Villas. The shop vendors will slowly open up their shops and the entire street will be infused with sambrani - a very magical feeling. An acknowledgment that material prosperity is rooted in divine blessings. Little India has a very special place in Singapore's Tamil history. This is where many Tamils came from South India and Malaysia and built up business from scratch and preserved a Tamil way of live in the midst of a fast moving modern city filled with skyscrapers. Avoid the malls and walk the little streets filled with shophouses to get a real feel. Early morning there is also Tamil hymns (as opposed to pop music) that is played in the radios of all the little shops to honor the Gods.

The best time to visit little India is from 7am to 9am from Monday to Saturday. Never visit on Sunday - the day the area is impassable with construction workers."
,,Little sights and sound like in Mumbai,4.0,,"a visit on sunday afternoon n evening would be ideal to feel the crowds as it s a day off when indian workers have their day

You would see tbousands of worker bees here. Besides the cosmopolitan feel you get plenty of indian restaurant . Good bargains for indian souveniers

add colours to otherwise a boring Singapore"
,,Just like Big India - but smaller and without the smell.,4.0,,"Having travelled to India this area was just like it - without the smell! Millions of traders overspilling onto the pavement, pounding Bollywood music, cheap clothes, mobile phone repairs, trinkets, jewellery, food, eateries. It's all there. Easy to find from Little India MRT station or Rochor."
,,Colourful,5.0,,Lots of food and wonderful streets filled with much colour! A fun place to spend a few hours! Great activity for families! Very child friendly! Must see this ethnic neighbourhood! One of the other three: Arab and Chinatown!
,,Indians are everywhere,4.0,,"As its name tells, indians are everwhere in this place. Variety of indian foods are available. Very crowd place. Comparing to rest of the singapore this is the dirty place. Lot of stalls for shopping with cheap prices. Dont go sunday evening unless you like huge huge huge crowds."
,,Great Indian Experience in Singapore.,5.0,,"We loved wondering the streets in Little India enjoying all the wonderful colours of the buildings and some of the temples.
It had a completely different atmosphere to China Town which was interesting. We had a true Indian meal for lunch, and enjoyed being the centre of attention of a comedy sort for the other 'native' diners! We ate with our hands as everyone else did and it was great completing the Indian experience! Just make sure you have some hand sanitizer for before and after!"
,,Authentic and colorful,4.0,,"There are three main ethnic enclaves in Singapore--Chinatown, Little India, and Arab Quarter. Of these, I think that Little India offers the most authentic atmosphere. Chinatown and Arab Quarter are too touristy. Most businesses there don't cater to locals. However, Little Indian businesses seem to be frequented by everyday Singaporeans. I bought bags of spices and just cooked with them. Much cheaper and more fragrant than stuff sold here at home."
,,My favourite place in Singapore!,5.0,,"Me and my friend absolutely loved Little India. The temples were very interesting and colorful. Also, the food was absolutely delicious! A must visit if you are in Singapore!"
,,All Indian...!,5.0,,"This is where all Indians South Indians, North Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis all can see together. Most common North Indian and south Indian food very easily available. Never miss home when in Little India.. Love it."
,,busy busy busy,4.0,,"very busy area foot traffic is crazy at times path ways are small too nonexistent due to shop vendors putting there stalls out the front taking up the space.
If shopping for electric goods its great so much cheaper than home ( aussie ) got a great deal on power bank and wireless headphones. Huge range of Indian food places.
Although its a very dirty area compared to the rest of Singapore still enjoyed the sites and sounds."
,,Everything that reminds South India,5.0,,"For pure vegetarian tourists, little India offers almost all types of South Indian food so much so that one doesn't miss homely food. But I suggest people to taste local food Instead.."
,,Fascinating look at Old Singapore,5.0,,"Little India is one of the Heritage preserved areas of Singapore, with shop houses lining most of the roads. It is a fascinating look at how much of old Singapore would have been across most of city before the recent explosion of huge commercial buildings. There are many, many jewelers shops catering for prospective brides-to-be with intricate gold necklaces and rings, cheek by jowl with the pawn shop where you may need to lodge your wife‚Äôs gold for a few months to get some quick cash. Interestingly, not all shops seem to be run by people of apparent Indian descent. An indication of Singapore‚Äôs multicultural success, perhaps? Visit the food market in the centre of Little India for a quick look at how the government improved food hygiene by bringing street traders into a more regulated environment. Younger people tend to prefer the supermarkets that are familiar to most travellers. Definitely stop for lunch: A biryani and mango lassi will set you back about S$8 ‚Äì a real bargain"
,,Where you can get all varieties of Indian food,5.0,,"This place has got everything wrt Indian restaurants both south Indian and north Indian. Please check the review of each restaurant before visiting.

Super market/ Indian stores are easily accessible

Has access to mrt and mrt station name is Little India . few Hindu temples are there to visit"
,,Little India .... A merchant's Town,5.0,,"A place where perfumes, bags, clothes, and a lot more of merchandise is being sold at a very reasonable price...a must try!"
,,Authentic Indian area,4.0,,"Lots of food street sellers, and locals bustling buying food and goods. After visiting parts off real India this reminded us of there. Bought some lovely material, plenty of shops with 1000's of bolts of cloth."
,,Not as ethnic and culturally as I thought it would,3.0,,"I thought of dynamics, cultural buzz when visiting Little India, well there weren't any of that during my visits which happened several times hoping to catch glimpse of the ethnic atmosphere. I was mistaken.

Felt the place is just like any other old part of Singapore, even Arab Street and Chinatown are more alive. Shame really knowing that there are large Indian community in Singapore and Little India offers very little of the culture aesthetics and feel... Unless you want to shop... again lots of similarities elsewhere"
,,"Little South India, perhaps?",3.0,,"It is great to have a taste of another country within a city/country, and similar to China Towns in many places, I guess Little India in Singapore is great for the Tamils living here. I have been here twice on this visit, but although as a South Asian I like to stroll along Serangoon Road, and browse in the shops selling clothes, bangles, incense, music, some handicrafts and jewelry, and offer a variety of Indian food, it still feels short of much that could add value to its name.

Given that the majority of the Indian community in Singapore hails from the south of India, one wishes to come across glimpses of the huge diversity of that country, and a bit of representation from at least a few of its many states. This is sorely missing from Little India. There's gold jewelry galore, and many shops that sell heavy, bridal gold jewelry. One wants to see many more saree shops, many more handicrafts from India's different regions, music in various languages of that country, and more variety in the cuisines.

The large 'everything under one roof' kind of store called Mustafa is a complete clutter. Though it has every imaginable item - from fresh fruit, vegetables to cosmetics, from detergents to electronics, but the place offers no sense of design and it presents a picture that's more like a bazaar than a department store.

Some maintenance of the footpaths and fewer or no encroachment on them could also elevate the general ambience of Little India. However, it is nice for the South Asian as well as other communities to get a taste of India here, albeit a small taste."
,,budget shopping & Indian Food,3.0,,"Little India is place for budget shopping and Indian Food. Mustafa is open 24 hours and serves all your shopping , money exchange and also has a rooftop restaurant"
,,Like an orderly India,3.0,,"Many sights to see like temples, shops selling Indian fare with touristy souvenirs. A huge congregation of Indians gather on weekends to enjoys each other's company. Good northern and southern Indian eats line the streets with a number of bars too. No cows nor dung to avoid on the streets, but the people walk all over the streets like cars are non existent. Worth the trip to soak in the atmosphere."
,,True to It's Name,3.0,,"Last time i visited it in night . . .went there in the evening this time and probably if you are an Indian and on a Vacation . . .. there are only 2 reasons for you to visit this place.
1. Indian Food
2. Mustafa Shoppin Center
It felt as if i was in a street in Delhi or Bangalore. Definately a place if you are getting home sick . . ."
,,The museum is wonderful!!,3.0,,"Walking around the area, I found that it was very congested and very hot. I found the store keepers friendly. I don't especially enjoy crowds and frankly, it was just too crowded. But, the MUSEUM is new and very interesting. There is a fee, but we did not have to pay as it was a special holiday and free to the public. We went in early May 2016."
,,What to see & do in Little India......,4.0,,"Little India is quite a big place & there are so much to see & do here. Would recommend at least 3/4 hours for this visit, maybe more if include dining & shopping time.

Few suggestions:

1. Tekka Centre - food centre & wet market. Don't miss this place. It's just above the Little India MRT station exit. Probably best place in Singapore to get widest choices of good Indian food at cheap prices. Also available, are Chinese food here.
Try the Briyani rice & Teh Tarik (milk tea). There is a wet market next to food centre worth a visit.

2. The main road & many side streets shops - where you find many traditional shops & products. Get soaked in the cultural atmosphere here.

3. Indian temple - next to Belilios Street. Can't miss it as facing main road of Little India. Alot of tourists goes there.

4. City Square Mall- nice modern big mall with international dining & shops. Linked to Farrer Park MRT station ( NE Line).

5. The Verge mall- directly opposite Tekka Centre. Though this mall is not worth your time as pretty small & boring, if have time- still worth a visit to the big supermarket there ie Sheng Shiong. They sell live seafood in tanks- interesting. Good place to buy your cheap drinks, etc.

6. Mustafa Centre - one has not ""seen"" Little India if one hasn't been to this world famous store. It's huge, prices are reasonable & it carries many unique products not found anywhere else in Singapore.
Place is always crowded with locals, foreign residents & tourists alike. Can easily spend 1/2 hours here.

7. Rex Cinema - place to watch Indian movies. Just across the road from Tekka Centre."
,,Little India,5.0,,"I was blown away by this place. We caught the MRT, when we came out of the station, it was like we had flown to a completely different country. We had the best butter chicken and pumpudums for lunch, walked through the markets. Everyone were so friendly. Beautiful Indian clothing and gift ideas. We went to the wet markets, be prepared for the smell, but what an eye opener. The way they prepare and sell their products is different to say the least."
,,Little India,5.0,,"Visited Little India as Singapore was a stop on a cruise. This place was brilliant, full of stalls & shops and restaurants. The people were friendly & helpful, we ate at a few takeaways, and Raj Restaurant.
Visited shopping malls & Chinatown, highly recommend visiting Singapore it's stunning, and there are lots of bargains to be had in the shops!"
,,Excellent Food Options,5.0,,"It was really fun to stroll through this area, but it was fantastic when I finally sat down to eat. There are many, many wonderful options to eat authentic Indian food here (much better than in Hong Kong). Real Indian and great variety and good prices. I could return again and again!"
,,A Close-Counter With a Rich Culture,4.0,,"Little India is a nice place to spend an evening, and the only place in Singapore to have real authentic Indian food. Do look around for different restaurants for their menus before settling in one, or read the online reviews beforehand.

It's especially a great experience near Diwalli with all the ornaments and celebrations. Mustafa Shopping Center is also located in the area, making up for some bargain shopping (with a vast variety of goods) if you happen to be there."
,,a place to buy gold,3.0,,In Serangoon road we can find a famous goldsmith shop named Mustafa. Price not so cheap but they have many and various of gold. we can easy to find and select
,,Great Shopping!!,5.0,,"This is a charming area of Singapore with great shops. We didn't have enough time but still worth our visit,"
,,Its like mini india,4.0,,U wil find Chennai like environment in this area And food is good there and also u can buy dresses as well as fruits too
,,Business 2015,4.0,,"Had a good time exploring the area. Plenty of things to do, see and eat. The restaurants here are varied and generally good. The fish is fresh (still in the tank at some places)."
,,Busiest place in Singapore,4.0,,"This is one of the busiest place in Singapore.
Here, you can buy almost of all products.
Must place for Indians, can do shopping in Mustafa, temples are near and good number of Indian food restaurants.
During Sunday evening - rush will be heavy, think one more time if u want stuck in rush or do shopping comfortably."
,,Okay to visit if you like Indian food,3.0,,"We went here on a city tour. The buildings are very colourful and its okay to have a stroll through to check it out. There are food options but I wouldn't eat here myself. My doctor at home in Australia also specifically warned not to eat here, and this is linked to his culture."
,,Small But it is called Little India,4.0,,"There isn't much to it but it is called Little India. After taking our visitors there and having gone to the area a dozen times, I no longer consider this an important stop for visitors. I think the most interesting time to go is at night. Walk down the road with all the shops and then head towards Mustafa. The hawker at Little India has good food and there are lots of restaurants that are great and affordable I love Indian food. And anytime I'm in Little India, I'm always looking for a drink stall with Masala Tea. It's an interesting place so it might be worth walking through it. I'm just not suggesting that it's a must do."
,,Nice and different. Photogenic.,5.0,,"Nice place to walk around and chill. Eat at one of their restaurants. Walk around Mustafa Centre if you want some aircon. By the way,there is a North Indian restaurant at the rooftop of Mustafa Centre."
,,You feel like you are an Indian,4.0,,Its a colourful area with a lot of indian residents. Its easy to reach with metro. You can choose from a big variety of restaurants and typical indian shops.
,,Spice up your stomach!,3.0,,"I was almost lost. Many colorful buildings (looks like houses), crowded, smell spicy, people just walking and chilling everywhere. But I enjoyed visiting here. Trying India curry, looking beautiful golden jeweries, feeling myself comes from another country‚Ä¶
Anyway if you love curry and spicy food, you should keep your stomach empty!!! Spice smells invite you to real India restaurant!"
,,Interesting enclave,3.0,,"Area of Singapore with many ethnically Indian residents. The area is home to a great many restaurants, a sprawling market and countless jewelry shops.
Not a key destination, but a certainly one that should pique interest if you have time.
Honestly, the highlight is looking at the gold jewellry - amazing designs that cater for a MASSIVELY wide variety of tastes."
,,ITS place of indians,5.0,,If we VISIT THIS place we ll difinately confuse where we are .means in india or singapore . its just small town of chenni . we can watch here more indians only that to specially tamil people only. its make we are staying in india .it make feel us we are in india though in singapore .he we can enjoy tamil nadu all dishes also. and too hyderabad birayani for only 5$ .coke for 1$ . for food lovers and shopping lovers they can visit biggest super market mustafa .its in little india. its simply aswome .
,,Feels like india,5.0,,Feels like i am in india All are here for indian person Its like my hometown So less chance to miss our family It is the best for me
,,Nice photos can be taken here,3.0,,"I was curious as to what Little India held to offer so I caught the MRT to this place. What I found were quaint shops with their colorful detail and many street vendors offering everthing from fish to flowers. Many buildings are from the earlier days of Singapore with a business located on street level and (perhaps) living quarters overhead. I did a quick look around after snaping a few pics and headed back to the MRT, onward to another destination. Overall, it was an interesting stop."
,,Must visit for Indian food and shopping!,3.0,,"Most Indians end up coming at least a few times in a week's visit as it is one stop place for any Indian cuisine, be it north, south or vegetarian.
Also Mustafa's is located in the centre of little India so convenient to shop and eat.
Options like saravana bhavan, anand bhavan, komala vilas which has been around since 40's offer the usual Indian fare, for break fast lunch or dinner.
Place is crowded, ill kept, noisy and even dirty by singaporean standards, all attributes of a typical Indian urban place, unfortunately!, especially so on weekends , as all local Indians and subcontinent folks congregate, which seems to be their only week end destination in singapore to unwind, relax and shop and drink!"
,,"Bustling, chaotic expection of Singapore",4.0,,"This seems like a different country within Singapore. Where the rest of the country is quite clean, structured and well organized Little India is more of a chaos full of shops, restaurants and people walking the streets. Very much alive after dark with cheap tasty restaurants. I can imagine it could be somewhat intimidating for some."
,,khamsama restaurant,5.0,,"its a good place to order north indian food for home delivery, its fresh delicious food at very reasonable rates, service is very efficient"
,,Bustling area with small streets and lots of Indian shopping/food,4.0,,"Good place to get cheap good Indian food and a few bars around. Lots of small shops

Walking around here is very unlike the rest of Singapore and more like other parts of Asia. Small roads packed with vehicles. Get a taxi to nearby and walk in

Very large shopping centre called The Mustafa Centre that sells everything"
,,Good Street to Visit.,3.0,,"in lottle indian you can see and lear indian culture. you can see temple, market and ethnic indian food of course !"
,,A bit of India,3.0,,Transported to India in this area of Singapore. You can find beautiful Indian attire at reasonable prices. Authentic Indian foods available
,,Immediate transformation,4.0,,You are immediately transported to India with its colourful shops and many restaurants. The architecture and the colourful facades. It was a delight to wander round the streets and market.
,,A little piece of India in Singapore,4.0,,"A one stop place for all the things you need to see and know about our Little India. Not so little though, I have really tiny ones overseas. You can get almost anything and so many places to dine in. 24-hour Mustaffa Center - a must visit.

On the downside, things can get really really crowded especially weekends, festive Seasons. And some street looks a little dodgy and filthy.

Nonetheless, this is a MUST be one of your itineraries when visiting Singapore. Singapore is a multicultural nation where English is predominately spoken among our locals. We are friendly!!!"
,,Go here for authentic south indian food!,4.0,,"Buzzing place and full of small shops, eateries and the great Mustafa! Go here for authentic south indian food, shopping for some indian wares. but this is typical south indian stuff, not north Indian"
,,Interesting and Stimulating Area,5.0,,"We spent quite a lot of time walking around the area, good selection of shops and restaurants. with the Tekka food centre near the MRT very good for a snack or meal."
,,Like being in another country,4.0,,"Wow, as soon as we got off the MRT at this station we thought we had flown in to Mumbai, it was heaving. We went on a Saturday night and there were so many people we could hardly move. It was a fascinating insight in to another culture and we loved every minute. Everything was for sale on the pavement, fresh vegetables, pots and pans, dried chillies and spices, clothes and we even saw a couple of guys with their sewing machines doing some tailoring. We stopped outside the temple and watched for a bit before finding somewhere to have a meal. Again there was no space inside so we sat outside on tables and chairs on the pavement and enjoyed a curry and naan bread. If we ever get back to Singapore it would be nice to go in the day time to see the place in the daylight because night time was certainly an eye opener."
,,Another world within Singapore,5.0,,"A real culture change from main stream Singapore, when you step off the hop on hop off bus.
Did not venture from the main street Serangoon Rd. It's quite long to walk from one end to the other. Abundance of Indian style jewelery shops, clothes and Indian restaurants.It also seems this is where all the Indian people in Singapore live.
We took a risk, and had lunch (Indian curry of course) in one of the outdoor street cafes.
Very tasty clean and cheap, my wife liked it, and we did not get sick.
I overall enjoyed Little India,but my wife did not, but probably due to walking in the oppressive humidity.Recommend going to see it if you don't mind the change of cleanliness and different smells,but you would think you are in another country."
,,Not worth traveling to,1.0,,"I rarely write a bad review but in my opinion this just wasn't worth seeing. Not much there, kind of shady and not nice. We didn't take one picture. Do something else."
,,Good bargain/Sound Sight Smell,4.0,,"Dont miss the experience , staying at Fisher B n B its just a 5 -10 minutes walk to city square Mall, 24hrs Mustapha Mega shopping mall with all the Indian cruisine in coffee shops , restaurants , little shop houses full of bargains, temples, beautiful architectural old buildings .See ya"
,,Little india is a little india,4.0,,"It was nice , small certified sample of India , cheap shops , restaurant .. as well as traffic !!!!It was good experience"
,,interesting tour with friends,4.0,,"I think it makes a difference when you can tour with friends who can share local sites, restaurants, history. We had a great time, learned a lot about the local culture and neighborhoods. Glad I had the opportunity but I do think you host makes a difference."
,,Not great - don't bother and do something else with your time,2.0,,"Chaotic, no structure, little bit grotty - only place in Singapore where police were abundantly visible albeit I didn't feel unsafe. Didn't float my boat really but I guess you will think it's ok if you like smelly, dirty streets with a gutter feel. Really wanted it to be better but it just failed on every level."
,,It is a shame Diwali isn't all year round.,3.0,,"This is my second time to little India and it is very underwhelming when diwali isn't on, to me the whole charm of little India was all the flowers and the display at the entrance to little India. Still cool for a quick look round, but they should look at doing something for the whole year round to jazz the place up."
,,Little community,5.0,,Little India has a variety of food and things to experience. You can experience the local Indian food and drinks there and meet interesting settlers. The temples there are also magnificent to see!
,,Vibrant and Colourful,4.0,,"Step into Little India and you are greeted with stalls selling a wide range of fruit and vegetables, the perfume of flowers being expertly made into garlands and the aroma of exotic spices. Shops full of gold jewellery line the streets. The Indian Temple is a must to see. Visit Mustafas Department Store which is open twenty four hours to see a huge range of watches and gold jewellery guarded by security guards, rolls of sari material piled high on top of one another on the ground floor as well as a range of everyday products. An amazing place to visit. We have never felt unsafe when visiting Little India. We have eaten at a North Indian restaurant several times on our visits to Singapore and have always been made welcome. Visit Little India when Deepavali is celebrated to see the decorations."
,,Not much to see,2.0,,"Visited Nov 2014.

Not many tourists around so if you're looking for authentic Indian culture and their day to day life it's worth considering taking a trip here. It's quiet a small area and really is just where locals live so there's not much to see. We felt very out of place walking through it and uncomfortable at times but in saying we most likely looked like typical tourists so I'd imagine that's why!"
,,"""lotsa eateries,but not very safe and don't go on a weekend!!""",2.0,,"Me and hubby had a very bad experience here,we had stopped by for dinner at Komala vilas,and after that we waited for a taxi and no taxi wanted to stop.

Since it was Sunday the whole streets were full of foreigners and it was very dense ,crowded and suffocating.They were all over the place and we couldn't even walk.No taxi driver wanted to stop there for fear of a possible riot,and we stood there soo long.

When one taxi finally took us,the cabbie inquired how we ended up at tekka centre area and he said its not safe for us to be there,and told us never to go there again.He said a lot of plainclothes police were amongst the foreigners there to spy on them as well.It was a creepy experience for us."
,,A part of India in Singapore,5.0,,"It's not exactly like Delhi, but close. There are some great temples as well as some great restaurants."
,,Awesome little place to visit!,5.0,,One of the neighbourhoods we visited on our first day. Great little place with colourful buildings and loads of shops selling everything and anything! Definitely take a couple hours to walk around and explore. Some of the best Indian food I've eaten as well.
,,Original,4.0,,"Singapore is an ultra modern country. But stepping into Little India, one gets a feel of the Old Singapore. Lots of little shops, good (and cheap) authentic Indian food to be found everywhere, music drifting out of shops, the smells of flower garlands and incense and the vibrant colours you see everywhere is a definite must-do/see for every tourist and local alike."
,,Little india,4.0,,Very colourful area with lots of different shops & plenty to see. We loved the cheap indian food available at the fab hawker centre here.
,,A lot of fun,4.0,,"Small, friendly and easy to walk around. Has a market feel about it, with all of the stalls / shops. Frequented by locals - great for fruit and veg. Good choice of restaurants too. Some seedy areas 'girl shows / for hire', but easy enough to walk by (or walk in) as takes your fancy. Worth a stroll through."
,,Interesting & A Different View Of Singapore,4.0,,"You step out of the usual image of Singapore into what it names says, Little India. It has a definite Indian feel to it with somewhat untidy shops selling almost everything you might want. The architecture is old style Singapore and interesting. It is well worth a visit so take the Downtown Line (Blue) to Little India. Allow a good two hours to walk the streets."
,,What a delight,4.0,,If you love Indian food then you can't miss a visit to Little India while staying in Singapore. The main food centre just above Little India MRT station is such an experience. There is food of all types in the little stores that fill this centre and it's certainly a hive of activity and noise. Grab a meal and sit at a communal table to enjoy. A magnificent chicken biryani and naan bread cost $6 and it was so tasty. Wander the surrounding streets after you fill up on food to take in the stores and everyday life of Little India. A great asset to Singapore and an adventure you won't regret.
,,Indian Town,4.0,,We were not able to explore the area but we had some pictures in the intersection entering the streets with very colorful buildings. I think it is much better to walk and spend more time exploring the place rather than taking pictures in the streets We ate our lunch in a building near the mrt. We just ate noodles as most of the food stalls are selling Indian food.
,,Small India in Singapore,5.0,,"This is cheap.place to stay with people not much money. Many Indian people working here, in shops and market. U cam buy here technology stuffs like pc, phone, tablet wit good price. Food is amazing here also"
,,Little spice of India,4.0,,"Singapore offers multicultural environment and equality for almost all races. Singapore has everything from western style clarke quay to china town to little India.
Little India resembles many south Indian places such as temples, food, florist, vege shops, jwellers and many more to offer which is generally available in India.
Indian vegetarian food is must try.
Although place is too crowded like India."
,,Haggle properly...,4.0,,"Plenty of little shops in the arcade, many specialising in gold jewellery. There are quite a few shops selling various items of clothing, and then there are spice shops and the typical touristy souvenir shops.
The folk there are looking to make an honest living in a very expensive city, but they do enjoy the tourists haggling when attempting a purchase. Indeed, it's part of the deal and good fun.
We purchased certain small items as gifts, plus a fairly pricey, but excellent garment for my wife. The negotiation between the seller and ourselves was worth every cent.
We hopped off at Little India having travelled there on the Hop-On, Hop-Off bus, the best way to see the city, if you have time constraints."
,,A taste of India!,4.0,,"It is worth visiting little India to get a little taste of what India is like. If you walk down the main street of Little India (Serangoon Road) you will see a very colourful Indian temple, lots of places to eat yummy Indian food, plenty of jewellery stores selling the yellowest gold necklaces, earrings etc., plenty of other shops selling Indian goods and the Mastafa centre which sells almost anything and everything and is open 24/7. Little India is easy to get to via the MRT train system."
,,Great place for gold,4.0,,If you are looking for amazing jewellery at an amazing price then make this a definite port of call. I have never seen gold for sale like this place. The whole street is gold merchant after gold merchant. Feel free to haggle. There is a department store called Mustafa. It is great but it is all fixed price shopping and no bargaining on your gold purchase.
,,Lively interesting neigborhood,4.0,,The color full neighborhood of Little India is a lovely place with a lot of possibilities to eat and shop from all the small booths on the street. its a must visit when you are in Singapore
,,"Great area, central and very good food",4.0,,"We stayed at the Perak Hotel on Perak Rd Little India for 4 nights and walked the area extensively. It's got a good atmosphere, very central and there is a new Train Station ""Rocher"" just a stone throw from the Perak."
,,avoid visiting on a sunday,5.0,,"I heard people said this place does resemble certain part of any indian cities, the whole place is large enough for curious indian culture explorer."
,,interesting!,5.0,,"Visited June 2014. We were staying just outside of Little India so we visited this quite often. The shops and stalls were brilliant to look in and we found everyone to be really friendly! We had dinner in an indian resturant the first night and it was fantastic and then we had dinner the rest of the time at a canteen sort of place just inside the boundaries of little india, which we loved! Great food and great prices!"
,,Highly Crowded Place.,4.0,,Highly Crowded Place. The best place for shopping in Singapore. It looks like Chennai. Must visit place in Singapore.
,,Go for a walk and take in the sights and smells,4.0,,"This is a wonderful part of Singapore.
Not sure how historically authentic it now is but that is beside the point.
Wander off the main roads and immerse yourself in the overwhelming smells and sights.
Plenty of nice places to eat and lots of shops that are really interesting.
But beware: you will get sick of saying "" no thanks"" to tailors."
,,Great food,5.0,,"I live in Birmingham UK where we have so excellent Indian and Pakistani food, so I was keen to check out the Singaporean versions.

The taxi driver recommended a food hall which was like an indoor hawker street. It was a bit dirty looking but I think that adds to the experience.

The food was great!

We didn't walk around the area much so I can't really comment on the architecture."
,,I loved it,4.0,,"I didn't know what to expect in little India, but I thought it had a real raw energy with heaps of people on the street selling, suits, amazing food & tones of jewellery stores.

Go check it out, there's some really cool cheap food markets, especially in a place like Singapore which is SO expensive."
,,A Reflection of Indian culture and life in SG...,4.0,,"I stayed in Jalan Besar very close to Little India..I could feel as if I am in Indian environment. The place has much more to offer for Indians... It's surrounded by Indian Restaurants south Indian , North Indian cusines , numerous Shops owned by Indians, Mustafa Shopping Centre a centre for endless 24 hr shopping mall...Little India has Indian Heritage centre to showcase the Indian community pride in SG building it's rich deep rooted culture in the history of SG. The Hindu temple Mariamman and Subramaniam temple s situated nearby . The buildings were well preserved and restored to uphold the Indian traditional building architecture to preserve the heritage ..It's a must visit place to break free the evening leisure time and to enjoy the ambience of India in SG....."
,,Little india,5.0,,A good and budget place to stay for all travelers coming to Singapore. Good hotels and hostels for budgeted people. MRT and a big mustafa shopping mall is here in little india
,,Best place to eat Indian food and shopping at Mustafa,5.0,,"This place is rightly called Little India, with lots of Indian restaurants around you feel as if you are in India. Plus Mustafa Centre is the best place to shop anything and everything is Singapore is located here. Not to be missed at any cost"
,,Honeymoon escape,4.0,,"We stayed here for 2 nights while we were having a Honeymoon escape in Singapore. Very nice location, if you want to see a projection on India in the middle of the town, 5 min walk from metro."
,,Not much to see,3.0,,"Have been to several indian streets before. This wasn't actual a nice one, wouldn't go again. There are better spots to find in Singapore"
,,An India in Singapore,4.0,,"As most Indians do have a problem in eating other foods you can see all the good Indian dishes being served around here, with all types of Indian shops and surroundings only difference is that the India in Singapore is clean and neat."
,,Excellent place for eating and shopping in little india,5.0,,When ever I visit to Singapore I always visit to little india because of good food and good shopping slso very cheap if you compare to any other part of Singapore.
,,Very Cheap,4.0,,"We walked too little India which was about 5 miles and we really enjoyed it. It is very cheap market and it can get very busy at times.

You end up buying stuff you do not need as it is so cheap.
Again there are plenty of places to eat."
,,Great,4.0,,A great walking experience. In and out of shops . A true sign of the old Indian influence in Singapore.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Too bad it is indeed quite little, cause I love it and go there as much as possible.
Streetshops in little India are the best places for real bargains in Signapore!
The exact same sunglasses that were 25 dollars at Mustafa, outside in streetshops, were only 1 dollar 90 cents ! Jeans of good quality 10SGD only !!
Yes, I loved it. Singapore Indians are slightly less Indian, but still smile a lot"
,,Interesting and Spoless,5.0,,"This would be a great place to stay for a few nights. Local charm and character oozes and it is so clean (As is all Singapore).

Restaurant's abound as do small shops selling just about everything. Perfectly safe to walk about in and very friendly and welcoming people."
,,Little India is only good for Mustafa and for few food restaurant,3.0,,Little India is a large community of Indian. But there you won't get the real respect as a guest. I was disappoint when a restaurant owner treat with me so bad. He was shouting on me when I said that food is so spicy and it burns on my tongue. He said you stupid women how dare you to say like this about my food? Only for Mustafa I'll give them 3. Other than road was little bit dirty where in the other side of Singapore is so neat and clean.
,,Little India--Commercial area,4.0,,"Little India is the centre for the large Indian community in Singapore. where predominantly, Indian origin people live, more so the Tamilians. Its a big commercial street, full of Indian Restaurants. The famous Mustafa Centre is also located in Little India.

It is located in the eastern part of Singapore River. Little India is well connected by local transport and private taxis.

Two temples are located in this area, one Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple and the other Sri Veeramakaliamman temple.

its a pleasure to walk in Little India, particularly for Indian Tourists and to have a good food here as many restaurants serve good Indian food.

We were here at Little India on 11th February 2016 and we did enjoy our evenings here."
,,A Buzz and Feel of its own,4.0,,"It is indeed a town on its own within a city. A large part of the local population is made up of Indian Origin Singaporeans. They have maintained their identity, culture and much of their traditions."
,,Ê¥ªÊ∞ó„Åå„ÅÇ„Å£„Å¶Èù¢ÁôΩ„ÅÑ„ÄÄ„ÄÄLively and interesting place to visit,5.0,,"„Ç§„É≥„ÉâÁ≥ª„ÅÆ‰∫∫„Åü„Å°„ÅåÈõÜ„Åæ„ÇãÊ¥ªÊ∞óÁöÑ„Å™Áî∫„ÄÇ„É¨„Çπ„Éà„É©„É≥„ÄÅÂúüÁî£Â∫ó„ÄÅÁèæÂú∞„ÅÆ‰∫∫„Åü„Å°„ÅåÊ¨≤„Åó„ÅÑ„Ç§„É≥„Éâ„ÅÆÊó•Â∏∏ÂìÅ„Åå‰Ωï„Åß„ÅÇ„Çã„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÊÑü„Åò„ÄÇ A vibrant and interesting place to visit. This area is full of restaurants, souvenir shops and has everything from India local people want and worth a stroll for tourists."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Its really India within Singapore but relatively much cleaner than India but much less than by Singapore Standard. Its a nice place for budged travellers, probable the cheapest place in costly Singapore."
,,Culture,3.0,,Great place to be amongst the smells and sounds of Indian. Visited the Indian cultural museum and just walked around a bit. Great to see such multiculturalism in Singapore. Plenty of gold shops if you dress like Mr.T
,,As the name reflects a reflection of India in Singapore.,3.0,,If you are missing Indian food go to Little India where all types of Indian restaurants are available. It is crowded like Indian Bazars. Mustafa is so vast and huge and it operates 24 hours. If you want to do shopping on budget go there. It is easily accessible by SRMT.
,,Average experience,3.0,,After 2 two hours up and down the Streets of little india we were not that impressed It might be wrong but after 20 years the memory might have slipped you or it is not the same.
,,Love it,4.0,,"One of my favorite parts of Singapore, love strolling around this area and taking in the energy. Not as chaotic as India but that's not necessarily a bad thing! Not to mention the delicious food!"
,,A glimpse of India in Singapore,4.0,,"Little India in Singapore is quite organized. There is Sri Mariamman Temple where the Hindus worship the gods. There is also Mustafa Centre, a 7-storey shopping center where we can find anything ranging from clothing, jewelry, foods, beverages, DVDS, souvenirs, even unique things."
,,women need to stay away,1.0,,A riot has happened in recent years and it's highly dangerous. Women have to stay away from this place esp those who wear skimpy clothings.
,,"Great food, cute neighborhood, but bad services",4.0,,"I am a Indian-food lover, so this is a definitely great place to eat Indian food.... so original and affordable.

A lot of Indian around, so this is indeed a very Indian area by any means.... from the looks to even the ""content"".

The town is quite closed to the downtown, with MRT access.

My only negative thought is the service in general in the neighborhood. It's not in the par of other Singapore service in general. But I guess, the ""not-so-good"" service is one aspect of India too ... so if you are to explore Little India, this is expected."
,,Interesting place with good food and great shopping,4.0,,Near where I was staying. Can find a variety of Indian food in restaurants or at the market. There is a 24 hour mall called Mustafa where you find anything and everything!
,,Hotels,5.0,,"For the last 20 years I have stayed at the 'Village Hotel' in Albert Court, it is only a short walk to the hawker centre on Serangoon Road, with excellent selection of Indian foods."
,,Great hawkers market,4.0,,Every time I visit Singapore I always try and make a stop into Little India for its variety food and the price is really cheap.
,,Great and full of atmosphere,4.0,,Went there for three hours. There is a great food hall with fabulous Indian food where the sightseeing hippo bus drops you off. Upstairs there is also great clothing markets. Felt like being in India.....without being in India. Heaps of atmosphere in the streets. Just a great place to see.
,,It really is a little India,3.0,,"Having been to India a year ago to see this place with so many peoples everywhere and so crowded,yikes! We went to the Mustafa centre where you can get almost anything 24/7. It's small and squishy inside though and they put these tags on your bag so you can't put anything into them or you have to leave it with staff,that's something I'm not use too. I didn't feel unsafe but if you don't like crowds don't come here"
,,I belong here!,5.0,,Walking along and looking around seems to be a journey. We passed by a cinema showing Bollywood movie. There were numerous eateries and restaurants around the area ranging from budget to fine dining. We have seen also jewelry shops and clothing store displaying beautiful and elegant saree. There were also stores selling electronic products. Fruits and vegetables abound. Truly this place is worth a visit.
,,feeling india...,4.0,,India in Singapore. must visit to see typical Indian grocery n vegetables shops. when in little India one feels like in India. lots of gold n souvenir shops on serangoon road. dont forget to visit Mustafa Center. its a BIG superstore. everything under one roof. nearest MRT station - Little India and Farrer Park.
,,Always enjoy a visit to Little India,4.0,,"Every time I visit Singapore I have to make a visit to Little India. This time my daughter and I visited twice. The first time was at night because she wanted to spend quite a lot of time in Mustafa Shopping Centre, and the second time was during the day for a walk around.

For our night visit we took the MRT to Farrer Park MRT Station and walked the very short distance to Mustafa's. After what seemed like hours looking around there and buying a few things, we had dinner at Komala's on the corner of Serangoon Road and Kitchener Street (see separate review). As we were very tired after this, we returned to our hotel, again by MRT from Farrer Park.

On our daytime visit we caught the MRT again to Farrer Park and had a look around the excellent City Square Mall which is very close to the station. We then walked up Serangoon Road and after browsing in the stalls in Little India Arcade, we had lunch in Banana Leaf Apollo Restaurant, which is just off the Arcade (see separate review).

After our delicious lunch we walked to the Tekka Centre and made our way up the stairs to the first floor where all the clothing and fabrics are. I always find nice casual, summery dresses and kaftans here, and this time I bought 3 batik cotton dresses for $8 each. I also bought my sister dresses, two for $10, and my daughter bought a dress for $8.

The Tekka Centre is just around the corner from the Little India MRT station and from there we caught the train back to our hotel.

Everyone we met in Little India was pleasant and at no time did we feel uncomfortable - apart from the heat!"
,,"Not India, but a cool neighbourhood",4.0,,"I had just visited India a couple of months before coming here, and this was absolutely nothing like it, except for the large number of Indian people. It's a cool neighbourhood with bright colours and plenty of shops and restaurants, but the highlight for me was the food court. It was reasonably cheap for Singaporean standards, and the food is quite good. It's not the cleanest, but that's part of the experience, and how you know the food is good (because people don't go there for the cleanliness)."
,,A Full Shopping area for Indian Stuff,4.0,,Had good food at Indian restaurant near Mustaff Market and its nice area for all kind of shopping with family.
,,Good food,5.0,,"Little India is little, but there is a lot of shops. Food is very good and cheap. People si pleasant."
,,Reminds you of Indian surroundings,4.0,,"Ideal place for Indians, as it hosts of a variety of Indian restaurants which offer all types of Indian cuisines."
,,Food,4.0,,Stopped by here a number of times for the food and some walking around. It is interesting to see this part of Singapore as well.
,,Great ethnic neighborhood. Colors and smells. Nice shopping,4.0,,"Little India is one of the ethnic neighborhoods in Singapore. It's a nice area to walk around, lots of colors and nice smell.
There are some nice temples to visit and of course the famous 24h shopping place Mustafa Centre who is a must. It does get crowded, specially during weekends, but it is a nice area to walk around and shopping if you don't mind crowded areas.
The heritage center is a good place to learn about the history but you do have to pay to get in."
,,Little India,5.0,,Very easy to find on the MRT. Lots of stalls and little shops. Mecca for souveniers. Owners very helpful and you can communicate in English
,,South India,4.0,,This basically an area of Tamils here.Lots of Tamil shops and eating places.You must visit to see the difference.Lots of Vegetarian restaurants.
,,Unplanned Stop,3.0,,"Originally we did not plan on coming here but we just happened to bump into this area after we got lost looking for a particular restaurant. It was very busy, especially inside Mustafa Center but certainly lots to see. I'd say if you do not have a lot of time in Singapore, this maybe a skip. If you are spending more than a day in the city this could be a great stop."
,,Wonderful Part of the Country!,3.0,,"Anyone in Singapore should visit Little India. Lots of vibrant color and shops. However, beware of it being a little dirty and.... not so maintained. But wonderful place to walk around and enjoy! Wear some comfortable shoes!"
,,Worth and visit for site and smells,4.0,,"We walked through little India for approx an hour. Mix of clothes market, jewellery stores and food stalls. The area is relatively ""unclean"" by Singapore standards but definitely worth a visit that highlights the different quarters of Singapore. The main food market is a must. An attack on your smell senses- seafood, meat being freshly cut up, food to eat, fresh fruit etc. (perhaps keep walking fast in some spots if your sense of smell is a bit sensitive)."
,,gathering place for Indian-bangladeshi,4.0,,This area is kind of part of India-bangladesh land lots of people from these region. Shops are targeted to them. Avoid holidays you can't breath for rush here.
,,Great for Shopping and Something Different,4.0,,If you want to experience yet another side of Singapore - be sure to go to Little India. There is some amazing shopping with a very distinct Indian flavour!
,,Wonderful Indian Buffet!,4.0,,Was fun to walk through Little India. The best part of our visit was finding a fabulous Indian Restaurant just across from the main shopping building in Little India that had a wonderful buffet for lunch. It was yummy! We didn't find too much to buy in Little India. Only a few trinkets. I was wishing for more true items from India as I love the items I purchased on my visit to Mumbai a few years ago but didn't find anything like that in Little India but it was still fun to go browse and have India food which I love! It was excellent.
,,Not impressed,3.0,,"Visited as part of a half day city tour. It may be that my impressions were partly due to this attraction being the last place we visited for the morning, but I didn't like it. It was the only place in Singapore which I thought wasn't clean."
,,A place for backpackers,4.0,,"There are a lot of hostels for backpackers here, near the market and the train station. A lot of cheap eats, too."
,,Intersting experience,4.0,,Worth a look walking down main street like u are really in India little side shops selling everything and anything we had lunch at Banana leaf Apollo well worth it beautiful and authentic currys served on banana leaves and very reasonable prices
,,ALL YOU NEED IN ONE PLACE,3.0,,Little India is a place that you can find everything clothes Food all and all the time if on Sunday evening or any other time that all other shops are closed there is all open. Also if you want to change money that is no 1 . and of course if you want to eat India food its good and not expensive.
,,Interesting but dirty,3.0,,It was interesting to see India in Singapore ;). Still it was pretty dirty in general (not comparable to the rest of Singapore) and there was a lot of smog.
,,Dive into the Indian culture while staying in Singapore,4.0,,Nice opportunity to explore the vibrant Indian culture. If you want to get the full experience go there during the night or on the weekend.
,,Neat and Clean City!!!,3.0,,A Business hub and at the same time very nice place to enjoy with family trip!!! A city of brick but many things are there for enjoyment. I love visiting Sigapore
,,not clean and busy place,3.0,,"a small part of India inside SG, not clean and well laid. unlike SG. easy to find and locate. can eat some indian foods here"
,,"The sights, sounds and smells of India",4.0,,"I enjoyed walking around in this area, taking in all the sights, sounds and smells. I loved the interesting architecture, the energy and vibrancy of the place, and the crowd. There is a market, a temple and a 24 hr shopping mall."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Should visit this place. May be atleast for the shopping mall here ""Mustafa"".You wouldnt realize the time flying once you enter this building. Very much Indian place, with lots of people and restaurants, temples. A nice walk around. Do not expect the same cleanliness and beauty of other part of Singapore. you have to take it in however way it is. Not definitely a let down. There are 2 MRT stations. Once in Farrer Park and the other Little India. Farrer Park is very close to Mustafa."
,,A little disappointed,3.0,,Maybe we expected too much of this area. Although worth a visit for the cuisine alone there is little there to remind you of India. We thought we would spend a day here but had seen pretty much everything after a couple of hours.
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Little India is an interesting mixture of smells, sounds and a feast for the eye's, the Temples are beautiful, brightly coloured, we didn't go inside though. We found a shopping centre called Mastafa's which was a place you could get lost in, unless your looking for something in-particular, then you really must ask for help otherwise you'll waste a lot of time wandering around aimlessly. People have told me they love going there, but I wasn't really fussed, probably didn't help it was raining that day."
,,"like India, but cleaner",3.0,,"Well if you've ever been to India, this is a pretty good representation. It's obvious the residents made it to resemble their home, and they did good. Much cleaner than real India, but otherwise pretty similar. I am not sure I would make this a must see while in Singapore, but if you're missing india or just want to see what it's like it's worth a visit."
,,love it!,5.0,,"i love india, been there for 1,5 month and really miss this place. It was like real India in Singapore. Real indian people, tasty indian food, shops with indian spices, clothes... Thanks God that i can find India not only in India:P"
,,Smorgasbord of experiences,5.0,,"Little India is spread over a largish area, with small lanes off the main road offering interesting sights. Avoid weekends and public holidays. An early morning start is good. Little India wakes up early and you will beat the heat. Check out reviews for restaurants offering different cuisines. Start with the Tekka Market area and walk down towards Mustapha. Water and comfortable walking shoes are a must."
,,Awful.,2.0,,"Poorest part of Singapore, in my opinion. Buildings were maintained to a low standard. Sapped my energy, and made me dizzy at the end of my hour there, Would never go back!"
,,Little India,3.0,,Lots of the same shops worth a look but don't go if you don't like to be hassled to buy something. There are some great bargains and you can bargain for a lower price.
,,Hot and crowded but a great experience,3.0,,"Little India is a great experience. The sights, the noise, the smells all add to the experience. We travelled with a 6 year old and it was a great experience for her. If you want to shop in Little India would recommend going to Mustafa that is an experience in itself."
,,Little india indeed..,4.0,,"Little india is a colourful area in singapore and you really feel you are in india..
I visit here mainly for Indian food options especially veg. All types and price ranges are available.. From hawker center in tekka to some expensive. Mostly crowded on weekends due to lot of worker people around mustafa..
Mustafa shopping complex is large and where you get best exchange rates for your dollars.. You can get anything and everything here..
Taxis are difficult to get..
Lots of temples and jewellery shops..
Little shabby by singapore standards.
But still didn't find that bad as made out to be..."
,,india in singapore,3.0,,good place feels like home. you can get indian food and indian people and hindi speaking people. a big shopping mall is also there.
,,"Very indian, dirty, plenty to eat",3.0,,"This is the dirtiest place i have been in Singapore so far, i am not saying in a bad way, it is because it looks so Indian! Plenty of places to eat around with a lot of variety on food and restaurants/cafe. there is a few amount of cheap shops and souvenirs, some roads are filled with shops on both sides.
A few Hindu temples to visit, they are quite inspiring, loved the ones i have visited! Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, Shree Lakshminarayan Temple, Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple, just to name a few.
There is a train station (MRT) right in the middle of Little India. Busy place day or night. Plenty of tourists walking around too."
,,This is actually so indian,3.0,,"An India in every part of the world, maybe that's the plan. Although not everyone living here is Indian, the place name broadly suggests what to expect here. Vegetarian food (lots of it), departmental stores selling almost everything, Indian drinking shacks and the works. Most of it is passable. We had a vegetarian in the group and he could only eat in little India. It's a functional place for Indians if you are missing home or destination for Indian food."
,,Lost,5.0,,"No worry, you could get lost in shops but not where you are. You will be full with all the sights on the streets, no matter how trivial they are."
,,A FABULOUS treat for the senses!,5.0,,"Upon arrival in Little India your senses are in for a wonderful treat so many colors..foods, fabrics, painted temples and floral leis. The aroma of freshly cooked Indian delicacies, sandelwood incense, flower fragrances is everywhere. It's like a trip to India without the airfare! I love this part of Singapore and highly recommend a visit!"
,,"Hectic, but interesting",3.0,,"This is a fairly hectic and somewhat chaotic area in Singapore, compared to most other areas of the city. There are plenty of shops, which extend well on to the pavement, and the 24x7 Mustafa shopping centre to provide for your shopping needs. There isn't all that much to see and do, though there are some interesting looking places to eat (which we didn't have time to try) and the buildings are colourful and distinctive. It's worth a visit for the lower priced shopping options."
,,Many thing to see,3.0,,"After few hours walk under the sun, the Indian heritage center is a must visit, it open recently in Jan 2016 with full air conditional and interesting stories and thing too see.
There are many Indian restaurants are very good too, all in a reasonable price.
The little India is not very big but it form by many street so it will take a long time for you to explore."
,,its like you are are really in india!,4.0,,great food and walk abouts. be amazed by how similar this little streets hub takes you back to india. spics and garlands in rich supply go to Mustaphas for good shopping try Muthus for the fish head curry( huge portions and so so delicious)!
,,Actually its a little India in Singapore,5.0,,One can find everything for daily needs over here.. Good food joint for Indians.. Specially for vegetarians.. You can have local shopping from here.. Many Indians prefer to stay here.. Mustaffa center in little India has everything thing an Indian needs while in an other country.. Good place.. No food problem at all...
,,Singapore Trip,3.0,,"This area was ok, but it was just like being in East London, certain parts were very untidy for Singapore standards, would not go back."
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"Quit nice place to visit Lot of Indian male, no women at all :) You can do some shopping and eating there"
,,Jewelery stores everywhere,3.0,,"So so so many gold jewelry stores. I was expecting allot more food options, but we did find a lovely restaurant that was very authentic and delicious."
,,"Looks, Sounds and smells just like the real place.",5.0,,"India is a favorite travel destination and little India in Singapore is such a nice 'India away from India'.
We loved zigzagging through the streets , taking in the sights and sounds while finding some good bargains. We ended our own walking tour at the temple before heading back.
If in doubt, just take an hour to visit the Indian Arcade, you wont be disappointed."
,,Little India.. cheap food center for budget travellers..,4.0,,We took a little walk around little india.. somewhere its clean.. somewhere its just Crawford market of CST Station MUMBAI.. hawker center available(food center) in center of the place... all tamil indians served food on cheap rate.. its heaven for non vegetarians. Hindu temples located here along with small gold silver Jewellery stores.. there are about 150 food stores available in hawker center.. 350 meteres from LITTLE INDIA MRT station.. people here are helpful.. a small vegetable and food shops also available in market along with small hotels like mumbai magic restaurant where people can get pure veg food. .
,,india style,3.0,,i think it okay if you want to go this place cause you will see the culture of india and hindu mixing i think like that! even this place will make you think it dangerous but not warning people in here is really cute! and don't have anything you have to beware just beware yourself when walk have to see the road!
,,Take your time,4.0,,You need to take your time in Little India and zig zag up and down the streets. Make sure that you check out where the locals are eating and have a meal. This is the only way to experience the area.
,,Small India inside the Singapore,3.0,,My hotel during Singapore visit was in little India. Being Indian i have preferred to stay at this place. You will feel that you are in India while traveling across this place as you will see many Indians or say many South Indians around you. Many of the shops are owned by South Indians. You will get almost any Indian food in this part of Singapore. Little India MRT will connect you to almost every part of Singapore.
,,Uninspired by my visit,3.0,,"Having read other reviews I cant help feeling I took a wrong turn and missed something here. All I saw were loads of gold jewellery shops, some tailoring shops and some footpath shops selling cheaper clothes and foodstuffs. We were hardpushed to spend a couple of hours here. It all seemed a bit dowdy with rubbish in the streets and alot of pidgeons because of it."
,,Unique neighborhood in Singapore ... almost like getting a peek inside India itself!!,5.0,,Unique neighborhood in Singapore ... almost like getting a peek inside India itself!! I loved walking around a Mustafa Centre and getting a bite to eat at the many restaurants ... plus all of the Hindu shrines ... !!!
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"I've visited a few little India's in south east Asia and this one is the cleanest by far, Little India in Kuala Lumpur is very nice bit a little dirty and sketchy looking people. Singapore's little India is a great place where you'll find great food, homemade items and nice people."
,,Incredible Little India in SG,5.0,,"Little India in SG is an incredible experience for me. I was able to explore the colorful ambiance of their culture and tradition. Passing by the market and seeing their products displayed for sale, made me eager to visit India one day.

Their authentic Indian food was amazing too. From the biryani, the side dishes, the curries and the last zip of lassi, I am coming back for more. The next time I visit Singapore, I will definitely try more restaurants from Little India.

Note: try their little pastries from the market, it was really delicious!"
,,cheap shopping,3.0,,"Good to have a walk for shopping.. everything is there,,,can bargain as well...most of them are Indianas..."
,,Interesting,3.0,,Spent an interesting hour or so wandering through the streets of this part of Singapore. Loads of places for cheap nick knacks.
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,"Although I have never been to India, - after visiting ‚ÄòLittle India‚Äô it felt like i time traveled there for the day‚Ä¶it's such a drastic scenery change and very easy to get to by MRT.
There are lots of little shops, markets and plenty of authentic food to try.
The 'typical touristy souvenirs' are not as great as in China Town but is has lots of other unique stuff to look at, - love the great selection of cheap sandals...
It is very colourful with a couple of Temples. It is also known for the Mustafa Centre (separate review) which is half way done the main strip however if you walk all the way towards the end of that road there is also has a modern shopping center called City Square Mall which has a nice food court up the top,- which is great if you are not daring enough to try any of the street food and it also has a MRT stop right there when you are ready to head back..."
,,An unexpected delight,5.0,,"Little India had not been on our agenda, but after a recommendation from a friend, we really enjoyed the morning strolling down the vibrant streets and finishing with a local Indian vegetarian lunch."
,,Tasty family style India dishes to numble our appetite,4.0,,"AYYA INDIAN FOODS 01-281 Takka Hawker Center Opens 11am Long Queue, value for money. Sambal fish and mutton masala are the must try. Ask for their home made Yogurt FOC. SGD5 pax."
,,gold gold and more gold,3.0,,"there are stalls full of flowers and indian wears, you can pick up unique souvenirs or even antiques. Don't forget to bargain with the price. I pick up some wonderfully handmade pieces here.

As for gold, if your looking for the ultimate souvenir there are so many stores along the streets and lanes that sell and trade in gold. There is some leeway with price so don't be afraid to haggle a little! We purchased a stunning 22ct gold ring at an amazing price!"
,,Little India,3.0,,"I was not impressed. There was plenty of food, to crowded but just not my kind of place. It was a nice place and service for drinks was terribly slow. I wouldn't visit it again."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,May be my wife and I would be more impressed if we came here before kampong glam but we found it a let down. Yes there were plenty hawkers and stalls but found the sellers pushy with similar items per stall. We spent a good few hours wandering around and found little to inspire. There were less fabric shops compared to Arab St. All the stores seemed to be more tailored for locals. They trying to leave area was frustrating. We found several taxi stands with frustrated people waiting for long time so we actually walked 10 mins back towards main roads to wave down a taxi. Worth a quick stop to see area.. That's it.
,,Not much to see,4.0,,"Come visit for mustafa center, not much for sightseeing. Most are street vendors and shops. Very quite in day time. But very crowded in night time. 90% are Indian people's hangout with friends. Easy to find phone sim card and souvenirs with very reasonable price. Mustafa center are extremely crowd. They have everything here."

,,To experience India in Singapore was an eye opener!,4.0,,"Little India was on the train route and easy to locate! It was as tho we were in India, busy, dirty but friendly! We found a local who helped us identify the local shopping spots and great eating places. We ate a local dish that we have to go back to experience again. Mustafas was a gigantic departmental store that crossed a few blocks and had everything you cud possible think of!"
,,Atmosphere and interest,4.0,,"Just a few streets in old Singapore but home to the Indian culture of the place. A few curio shops, a lot of Indian restaurants and a great big department store selling everything cheaper than elsewhere"
,,Small trip to India from Singapore,4.0,,Just if you want to have change in taste and escape from marvel industrial city like Singapore to some traditional old culture just go to little India.

,,Great but exhausting!!,4.0,,"Fabulous to visit but exhausting too - not quite as easy to find everything as lots of the area is fully working rather than touristy. Still, I found some beautiful saris for so little money it was ridiculous - happy me :)"
,,It is actually Little India!,3.0,,"If you want to have authentic Indian food from home away as well, this is the place to be. In fact at many restaurants the taste and quality is better than some big food joints.
There are also two temples here.
Best part Mustafa Center is just 5 mins walk from here."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"We live in California, where we have many Chinatowns, Koreatowns, Little Vietnams, but I have never before visited a Little India. It was fascinating, as you really did get the feeling of being in India---there are many people and many colors and many tiny shops. It was also amazing to see the temples and the colorful signs hanging over the streets."
,,Name stands for what it is,4.0,,most of the Indian origin singaporings are living in this area. Its like chennai but very clean and very polite people. you get plenty of places to eat and the famouse shopping mall which runs 24/7 Musthafa is in Little India. There are hotels in this area which are cheap and good. there little India and Ferrera park metro stations are within walking distance so travelling is no problem at all.
,,more chocolates,3.0,,the place is full of people always busy and its hard to find taxi aswell. even walking is hard because of too many people. but in these place is where you can buy the cheapest chocolate for souvenir. its the same chocolate you see in duty free airport but the price here is way lower.
,,Home away home for Indians,4.0,,when you come out from MRT. You will find there are so many restaurant who serve different type of Indian food and also various Indian stuff for buy. mustafa market also in LIttle India where you can buy lots of things under one roof.

,,Indian architecture,4.0,,"I was living around this area, so from time to time was passing by. I can say it quit clean ( for people who been to India, and understand what to be dirty) planty of little shops, that sell cheapest Chinese products. People are friendly, not abrasive at all. Most of all I like architecture around there, specific for Singapore, and smell. Smell of Indian spices"
,,Food and shopping,4.0,,"Another great part of Singapore ! Check out ""The Mustafa Centre"" for shopping (I think they have anything you could ever want). The food is excellent and the vibe is ""Indian"" of course. I wandered around a lot and enjoyed it."
,,Nice place..,4.0,,"It is a must go for Indians! you can easily get Indian vegetarian food.. you will also see Gold shops there, Singapore is also known for its gold as well."
,,Old feel to it,4.0,,I enjoyed little India as it felt like old Singapore. Great place to grab a ‚Äòthali‚Äô on a banana leaf or a ‚Äòmasala dosa‚Äô. Then explore the little streets & shops surrounding the area.
,,Was a delusion !,2.0,,"You see photos of this area and think it is really cool and vibrant but on a normal week day it is empty ,quite dirty ,the only dirty area in Singapur and not interesting at all ,it was a waste of time except that we visited the museum and luckily we took a guided tour ,at 11 am that was very interesting .
Hard to find a good restaurant or even decent in the area ..."
,,Great Indian food and atmosphere,4.0,,"This is the place to enjoy great Indian food, particularly at the local hawkers market where there is huge variety of stalls serving delicious food at ridiculously low prices. it is very clean and great to eat with all the locals.

The surrounding shops are also interesting: old shop houses, very busy with a wide range of goods from India and elsewhere."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"If you have not previously been in India is a nice place since you can feel like moving to another country. There are lots of Indian restaurants with good food at reasonable prices and beautiful temples all around.
As in china town, go there if you have time and you haven't been before in India"
,,"Ethnic wear, Food, Fabrics",4.0,,"A good place to shop for Indian ethnic wear. You will be spoilt for choices. Sarees range from 15 dollars for cotton and can even go up to hundreds of dollars for silk.

Designers looking for fabrics will be able to get 6 yards of saree material for about 15-45 dollars for cotton material.

There are lots of eateries along Little India serving North and South Indian dishes."
,,Georgeous! The most Look and feel alike place outside India,5.0,,"So many things one can do in Indua India - from shopping at Mustafa to food, to smelling the flowers and guzzling along the India shops, it's a vibrant place to visit. Prefer the night scene"
,,Rich india culture,5.0,,"When you drop by singapore, its not completed without a cultural tour. Try out the different spices and delicious indian crusines.

Add more heat to your tour despite the warm summer sunny island, feel the chills and jalape√±os burn your throat as it enters, as well as it exits."
,,Just as busy as ever,3.0,,I've been back here a few times recently for dosas with the family. It's quite an interesting experience for young children to wander around and explore the area. Also some interesting vegetables available for purchase which might be harder to obtain in other parts of Singapore.
,,Oh my!,4.0,,This place was such a wonderful place just to get some really good food and enjoy the first leg of my backpacking trip. Great spot!
,,Great food,5.0,,"Cheap and cheerful. The hokkers markets are a great way to eat,just off the train station, but also exciting place to just walk around and see the sights"
,,The place in Singapore where traffic lights are not used,2.0,,"This is the most unruly place in Singapore which I avoid as much as possible. Even if I need to go shopping at Mustafa ....I try to go late to avoid the crowds but it seems Little India is never without crowds.
It still a great place to go for shopping for some cheap stuff..but be prepared for the crowds."
,,Interesting area and feels like India,4.0,,"I was just in India but still went to Little India. Great food options! It was the day before a festival so they were setting up and preparing flowers, etc. Later that night was a parade through the city. It really feels like India, minus the dirt roads and cows wandering around. As such, they had stand-up cows around to help you feel like it was India! Funny. Go there for some great food and the feel of India!"
,,Nice Food and drink,3.0,,"Enjoy nice and cheap food with tea shop , but nothing to buy ,except the food As it is all expensive , comparing to Dubai city , where I leave."
,,Good Shopping and Food,4.0,,"Great place to go and hunt for a bargain on jeans, shirts etc but very crowded and not easy to find the space to try on anything.
Some good food places if you can handle the pushy guys at the doors of the food stands and restaurants all fighting for business.
Just move along and leave them to it. You are bound to find a place that suits without the hassle."
,,A true Indian experience,5.0,,No need to go to India now on my travels this place hit the spot and so glad we went here!!! Amazing colourful streets amazing Indian cuisine and little gift shops all over the streets and market stalls selling beautiful flower necklaces !! A must when you are visiting Singapore
,,Colourful buildings,3.0,,Just colourful buildings and restaurants. There wasn't much to do here on a rainy day so we just took a few photos and left
,,Would not make it a top 10 must see place in Singapore,3.0,,Spent about 2 hours here. Really found nothing that made me want to stay longer. Not as clean and other parts of Singapore but not appallingly dirty.
,,Interesting & historic,5.0,,"Like Chinatown, this locale has many interweaving streets that contain a multitude of restaurants & shops. Many interesting places are present & it is well worth a stroll if you have the time. Vendors are not pushy & wares are different enough to encourage visitation of a few stores. I recommend your taking the time for a look."
,,Little India,4.0,,One of the best place to get different variety of Indian Foods. I always wanna go here when get really hungry and wanted to try something indian traditional food that can hardly get in other places. For Indian lovers... :D
,,Do It Once!,3.0,,"Not crazy about this place but guess if you are going to experience the diversity of Singapore this is a must visit-once! The day we were there the place was mobbed but I'm told it is like that every day. Started at the Mustafa Center which was abuzz with activity. If you want to buy something you have to find it and then try to navigate the aisles crammed with goods and people only to find long lines at the few cashiers that were available. Not a rewarding experience. Next we walked along Serangoon Rd. with its gold shops, clothing vendors and restaurants. Took photos of the ornate and intricately detailed Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple before moving on to the colorful and beautifully restored houses on Kerbau St.. Then chose a nice Indian vegetarian restaurant on Serangoon for what turned out to be a delicious albeit different repast!!"
,,You must becareful,4.0,,This is one of red district at Singapura. At night many police guard this area. You can find the real taste of curry here. Recomendded to visit at noon.
,,Good food but not so much to see,3.0,,"We had a good time in Singapore stayed there for 4 days and in little india you cana find authentic food but didn't really much enjoyed it, crowded and everybody is trying to ripe you off."
,,Love the heritage and architecture,5.0,,Take a tourist map to ensure you don't miss the important landmarks here. SMELL!! The fragrant spice flavour in the air that made this pace unique!
,,Little India,3.0,,"This is another of the different sectors found in Singapore and many other cities worldwide. A diaspora of Indians live and deal business here and for those who have never been to India will certainly get the taste of it, no pun intended but I'll go with it, in this small area of Singapore."
,,A MUST DO little india walk with The Original Singapore Walks,5.0,,"Go for a wander yourself and enjoy the hustle and bustle, smells, art, temples, architecture BUT to really enjoy and find the wet market with its HUGE variety of food stuffs, history of the area, restaurants and many interesting back streets you MUST go on one of the excellent walks with The Original Singapore Walks. FASCINATING."
,,So interesting!!!,5.0,,Really happy to visit there... A lot of things i wanted to try and test.. I wish to go there again.. See ya Singapore......
,,Good experience,3.0,,"It's nice to walk around in Little India. Colorful markets, smells, restaurants and small houses... and the usual traffic. It all makes Little India. Worth a visit."
,,Amazing!,4.0,,Loved the customer service and the food was delicious . Really recommend this place . Will definitely come back on our next visit üëåüèΩ
,,Lots of colours!,4.0,,"A busy little area in Singapore with mostly Indian people shopping and going about their business. Huge variety of Indian shops, lots of stunningly bright coloured sarees for sale and other clothing stores, lots of hawkers, and an excellent selection of food stalls and restaurants. We couldn't stay long but it was worth a visit for a look and our next visit to Singapore will program in a longer stay and a dining experience in Little India."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Easy to get to via MRT so definitely worth visiting if it's your first time in Singapore. This is my second visit and my experience was totally different. Last time I went on a weekday between 10am-1am. Hardly anyone so easy to stroll through the streets and get food from the tekka centre. This time we went on a Sunday and I think so happen there was some sort of festival going on. Streets were blocked in a way that it was hard to cross abs get around, police everywhere and was super crowded. So to me, it's a bit of a mix review but I still recommend at least one visit."
,,Great Food. Great Vibe,4.0,,"We love going here to eat when we're in S'pore. So many places to choose from as vegetarians and the meals are usually tasty and satisfying. Lots of gold jewellery available in the streets, and they come alive at night with the hustle and bustle of mostly Indian people. Delightful."
,,Nothing Special,2.0,,We recently went to Little India mainly because we had read some good reviews about the Mustafa Centre but was really not expressed. We did not stay long but there might have been more to see...
,,Dazzling,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to go to Little India during the Deepavali Festival in late October. Serangoon Rd was a sea of coloured lights seeming to go on forever, it was spectacular. Of course to get the full effect you have to be there at night. We had come to Little India in the afternoon, checked out a temple, walked around and had dinner at the Mustafa Centre. We walked back to Serangoon Rd and was blown away by the lights. We walked up and down the road for a while and found what seemed like a temporary market set back off the road a bit. I'm not sure if it's usually there. Walking through we saw the most incredible womens dresses with heavy gold, silver or coloured embroidery. There were new and vintage and the prices were mostly reasonable considering the work that had gone into them. There were stalls and stalls of them, it was really hard to decide what to buy. There were also other stalls of jewellery, homewares, food, etc.The colours of the dresses, the embroidery design and the fabrics were so beautiful, particularly the vintage dresses. Even though they're over-the-top, gaudy, there was just something about them and even if you didn't wear it, it would make a good wall hanging due to the work in them and the colour. I didn't buy one as I couldn't decide and was at the tail end of my trip with less ready cash to spend. I would like to return during Deepavali though and spend more time in Little India and get one of those superb dresses. There were lots of stalls in the streets with fresh flower garlands, so there were some lovely smells with flowers, incense and food. It was pretty busy around that time but it was worth it and at night it was just a little cooler with a slight breeze. Definitely a good time of year to go."
,,Very authentic experience!,4.0,,"I went there at night during the week. The streets were filled with people, sound and merchandise, buzzing with energy. The Indian restaurant i went to was great - felt like dining in Delhi. Walking through the streets and checking out the stores as well as sampling the food in different neighborhoods is definitely a great way to explore Singapore."
,,Great food everywhere,5.0,,"If you like Indian food this is the place to get it.
Little India is what it is, full of Indian culture.
We stopped and tried various places for food all genuine Indian food but with an classic Indian atmosphere. This is not high end dining,I but the food is so good. There are shopping centres, restaurants, endless small shops all trying to get your business and more importantly we felt safe .
Definitely a place you should visit in Singapore."
,,Better than KL little India,4.0,,"This place is full of mobile shops, and other India items. Good place to eat authentic India food both north and south Indian,"
,,"Plenty of Colour, Sounds ,, incense whoofing,, plenty of photo opportunities",5.0,,"Chilled vibe , in this Indian neighbourhood,, also has the Indiam Heritage Centre , great visit to prehaps dodge the Singapore downpours. Plenty of snacking available, Vegetarian,,many options...
Completely unrelated Tip,,, to split a high value Dollar note ,,, $50 or $100 ,, ShengSiong Supermarkets have New self Service type till ,, I bought a newspaper and can of juice, paid with $100 ,, machine dispensed the $97 change amazing.!!!"
,,Cool,3.0,,"A cool little walk, it is remarkable that one minute you are in singapore and then all of a sudden you have the sights, feel, and smells of india."
,,Little India a place to explore!,5.0,,"We loved little India, Mustafa mall, markets, hawker stations, endless food, streets to explore. We stayed at Wanderlust Hotel and loved everything little India had to offer!"
,,Good Shopping and Food,5.0,,"This is mini India of Singapore. The main market for vegetable and meat known as Tekka is located here for many years. One can buy clothings and many more things here. The nearest MRT Station is Little India. There is a bus stop with many buses from all over the island stopping here. The Bus #170 from Johor, Malaysia also stops very close to Little India. There are lots of Beauty shops, Jewellery Shops, Indian Restaurants with fine dining and budget and vegetarian and non-vegetarian Indian and Non-Indian food sold at almost all over this place. Tourist will never regret coming here as it is also rich in culture and more. When you are in Singapore this is one of the main attractions."
,,"Indian temples, food and people",4.0,,"This was by far the place I visited the most, because of the abundant availability of Indian (particularly Jain) food. Extremely crowded on weekends, especially Syed Alwi Road (near Mustafa Centre). However, safe overall in my opinion."
,,Real India in Singapore,4.0,,"Well....the home for all the indians...esp south indians. Its truely India in every sense, eateries, chaos, nativity, desi food, the complete desi stuff. Murugan idly, sankranti, anand bhavan....n 24*7 mustafa centre - the one stop for all stuff."
,,I dont like it,1.0,,"The only district in Singapore i would never go again. Many many Jewlerys, again a gold jewlery and wait... again. If you want to go to a have a meal, chinatown is the better choice. You can go through within 1 hour but there is nothing i have to tell what you have to visit. Sorry Little India but i dont like you ;)"
,,"Manic, chaotic, full of life and people and a treat for all the senses",4.0,,"Having never been to India, this area is what I would generally feel it is like. Manic, chaotic, full of life and people and a treat for all the senses. The smell of spices coming from merchants all over the area invades the nostrils while the volume of people is brilliant. Easily accessible from its own train station, ensure you leave enough time to really enjoy the area when you visit."
,,Very busy,3.0,,I wasnt too impressed by this area as it was very busy and not so clean. The people where not so friendly either.
,,Chaotic as India!,3.0,,"Little India was so different from the rest of organised, clean and free-flowing Singapore. Little India was chaotic, grotty in some areas, a plethora of Indian food stores, clothing, jewellery and convenience outlets. We had a stroller and found the footpaths quite congested with shops and items for sale. It seemed very crowded with local and visiting Indian nationals. Nonetheless it is part of the Tamil and Indian-Singaporean experience."
,,Little India - Truly Indian,5.0,,"This is an absolute gem of an place, especially for the Indian community. This place is also the saviour of vegetarians [indian vegeterians ;) ], as you can hardly find something veg and which could fulfill your appetite elsewhere in Singapore. Although this place is known as Little India and it truly is but still its based on only one geographical segment of an entire country such as India, i.e; the south indians. Maximum people here are from south india and this shows in the type of restaurants and shops that you find across this place. One major Shopping centre is situated in the centre of Little India known as Mustafa Centre. You can find each and every thing over here. This is the best place for people shopping on a budget. You'll not be disappointed as you'll find each and every thing in this shopping centre. This place is busy the whole day (& night) :P"
,,Chaotic as India,5.0,,"A must visit area of Singapore. Good fun, lots of colour and movement, great shops especially the Indian and Bangladeshi grocery stores for spices, the butchers, the saris and cafes and restaurants. Want to go back often especially for the dining."
,,Nice place to hang around !!,4.0,,"i visited this place when I visited Singapore in late December 2015. My main intention to go to Little India for shopping. There is Mustufa mall which is very popular and very vast. Along with that, this place is nice for vegetarian and Indian food too. There are all kind of known food chain restaurants like Sarvana bhavan, Anand bhavan etc.. which offers great variety of Indian food at reasonable rate."
,,Amazing,4.0,,We loved walking around here great authnic food and a hive of activity .we visited day and a night beautiful flower offering stalls to take some photos
,,A place for South Indian food,4.0,,"Mainly Indian people come here for veg food, chettenad non veg food, Muslim halal food because these foods are difficult to find in others places of Singapore, cleanliness is the problem, good shopping not there, Still life saver for vegetarian people"
,,Cheap Food And Cheap Acommadation,4.0,,"when i went to Singapore i stayed in little India area.you can take MRT to anywhere in Singapore. there are many places to eat in Singapore and very cheap and cheap accommodation Mustafa center is there if you want to shop.can buy sim cards ,Phone. Calling Cards.Its Good For People Who Are Vegetarians Lot of Option Available."
,,Bustling Indian Quarter.,4.0,,"- Sights, smells and the crowd on weekends. Soak in the complete sensory experience around Thaipusam and Diwali.
- Some of the best affordable eats are 'round here. Dum briyani is generally good.
- Unique arts/cultural area: visit the jewellers or get tickets to traditional performing arts shows during the Indian Performing Arts Festival.
- 24h shopping at Mustafa Centre.
- Can get overcrowded on weekends, mind your stuff - and yourself.
- Consists of a very small number of nocturnal alternative pleasureseekers: not all of them are after good clean fun, but relatively safe (as in licensed). You pays your money, you takes your risks, OK?
- Alcohol consumption laws strictly enforced here.
- Some really good budget/boutique hotels available.
- Consider this area to complete your self-guided city sights tour."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,If u r Indian n wanted to go Singapore little India is d best place if u wanted to see ur tradition in Singapore..majorly all pure veg Gujarati / Jain restaurant are in little India as well as best ever place mustafa centre is there for highest rate money changers.u can visit ganapaty temple n many places malls metro station bus stop everything nr.by
,,A little disappointing!,3.0,,We took a taxi one evening to little India hoping to find some fantastic Indian food and taxi driver dropped us off on the street with main run of restaurants. We walked up and down this road 3 or 4 times as many seemed to be a buffet which we didn't want and in the end we took a chance on a restaurant called Anjappar. The service left a lot to be desired and the food was average. We seemed to find what we had hoped for a high class Indian restaurant so maybe take time to find a decent one before you go as we really didn't find it easy!
,,Nothing great.,3.0,,The area is only good for indian veg food else there is nothing to waste time for. Suggest to visit only if you are looking for veg food.
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,Good place to visit especially for the people travelling from India. Nice place for shopping and good eateries.
,,Soul of Singapore,4.0,,"I found downtown Singapore sterile and wanted a cultural experience that Marina Bay was lacking. Little India yes, was dirty compared to other areas of Singapore but the place was real and had soul.

It is easy enough to catch the efficient MTR train to Little India. Straight away one smells and sees the authenticity of Little India where local Singaporean Indians are shopping at market stalls and praying inside ornate Hindu temples .

My suggestion is to walk the streets, through the markets and take your shoes off and go inside temples. Eat some local food and repeat."
,,Nice Neighborhood,4.0,,Nice Neighborhood you see here the Indians gathered regardless to any different in culture or religion off course it is old but not bad
,,Chocolates,4.0,,"If you're looking for a great pasalubong for chocolate lovers, you should head out to Mustafa shopping complex. They sell everything in bargain price.. especially chocolates.. =))"
,,It is good to visit but dirty,3.0,,My husband and I went here just to roam around via train. The place is some what dirty. There are garbages around and food stalls are very dirty.
,,The old charm of Little India,5.0,,"You can take bus number 170, 66 and 67 to Serangoon Road where Little India is located. You can also take the Downtown Line (blue line) or the North East Line (purple line) and alight at Little India MRT station. Exit at Buffalo Road and you will get to Serangoon Road. Outside the MRT you can reach the Tekka Food Centre where you can eat Duck rice, Nasi Bryani and Mee Siam.
In Little India you can see Hindu temples and churches. The Kampong Kapor Methodist Church is here. The area around Dunlop Street, Serangoon Road and Desker Road are full of Indian shops selling vegetables, curries and Indian products. Some stalls sell the beautiful Indian garlands which are snapped up by the Indians to be used in religious ceremonies.
Many tourists come here to buy Indian products and also visit the Indian Heritage Centre which houses the legacies of famous Indian Singaporeans.
Many goldsmiths here are Chinese but their shops have a shopfront full of Indian and Tamil words as their clients are mostly Indians both local and from abroad. Many foreign workers from India and Bangladesh make a beeline for this place on Sundays to purchase their goodies and groceries from the famous Mustafa Centre which is a 5-level shopping mall and opens 24/7. You can buy anything from a pin to an oven or a fridge. The goods sold here are good and cheap . If you have deeper pockets then go for the branded goods in Orchard Road and be prepared to pay through your nose."
,,To get the feel of India,5.0,,This location houses variety of Indian food joints and shops selling stuff like souvenier. It is good to take a walk in this area to check variety of options and try Indian food. The place is very close to Mustafa center and also has a Hindu temple. Little India is good for a walk around and trying the Indian food.
,,Unexpected,4.0,,"We walked around Little India and went into Musteffa Centre which spans two blocks, six floors and is open 24/7. The food section alone blew us away and if you can't find it there you won't find it anywhere. We ate lunch at the Tekka Centre which is a food court on Buffalo Street and had Roti Prata and a murtabek, really yummy and very cheap. For something different I would recommend a walk around the area, we felt safe (two women) so shouldn't be a problem for anyone."
,,Smelly and extremely crowded,1.0,,"We stopped there on Sunday to have a bite to eat. The whole place was overly crowded. Lots of people just hanging out on the sidewalk just shooting the breeze, doing nothing. The whole place is quite filthy and filled with bad odor, may be not as bad as in a Chinatown. Could not find a decent place to eat. Ended up eating at Delhi Restaurant on the main drag, disappointing and expensive food. It was a huge mistake and waste of money to visit Lil India."
,,Fun,3.0,,"Good fun you have to go and see it but wouldn't eat there as its a bit dirty , lots of noise and Indian music lovely temple to take photos when I went the men in the temple were stripping off !!! Maybe to get blessed !!!! And you could see this from the street this is not set up for tourists it's just the Indian community going about there daily business oblivious of all us nosey tourists but interesting"
,,Good food!,4.0,,"This is India within Singapore. Noisy, dirty and colourful. Satiate your wishlist for curries and more here. Food is mostly South Indian (Tamil to be precise)."
,,Really is a little India!,3.0,,"We went here in search for good food. Once we exited the MRT station of Little India, we were overwhelmed with stalls after stalls of fresh veges, jewellery, clothes etc.
There are so many side streets that it's so easy to get lost!
It is worth doing the heritage route around Little India. You will see temples and colourful buildings with beautiful facades."
,,Very colorful,1.0,,We did not expect what we saw here. A lot of people and a lot of pushing shaving dirty smelly. Such a contrast to the rest of Singapore. Singapore people in general are polite and in general little India is a busy little area with a lot of people. The area is a bit crazy so I would not stay there if your claustrophobic. Stay near the bay.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"This attraction is easily accessed by Purple Line SMRT, SMRT bus or HIPPO bus red route( Hop on Hop off bus)
Interesting array of small shops, cafes, restaurants and Malls.
Be aware though it doesn't really fire up until around 11 am and all shops, cafes and restaurants stay open until late.
As the name suggests, lots of Indian food on offer. Shop around."
,,One of the must see places? Perhaps..,3.0,,"We have eaten in Little India many times over the years, and the choices, smells and sights are unchanged! This is not a glossy mall like you will find in Orchard Road (eg. Lucky Plaza) but if you're out and about, it is worth a try. Photographers will find 'street' opportunities inside the markets and the spices are worth a moment to pause and inhale."
,,Don't miss a visit to Little India,4.0,,Plenty of shops and some shopping malls and a temple. Plenty of places to eat Indian food and lots of hotels. Most of the shops are along Serangoon road but you'll find some in the side streets too. The highlight of the area is Mustafa mall.
,,Almost like in India,4.0,,"I've been in India, and this is somehow very similar than the real one! Only richer, cleaner and more expensive - but still very much like India. As a great India fan this was so super! Plenty of nice things and buildings to see here!"
,,The largest Little India ever,4.0,,"First of all, this place is huge. There is a famous mall called Mustafa mall, you will get anything you want here. There are scores of restaurants and I spotted the familiar name of Saravana Bhawan.
The best part of this place are the open spaces and some nice hotels where you will find all the Indian tourists in Singapore. A nice place for any Indian to spend some quality time. When we visited it was Dusshera and the whole place was lit and decorated, felt like walking to a mundap in Kolkata."
,,Food food food and some bargains,5.0,,"Tekka Centre for a curry! That's the #1 here, the wander down Seragoon Road thru the shops and heat to the Mustafas Centre (open 24 hours... Its craziness!)"
,,'Feels like India',3.0,,"This place makes you wonder if you are in Singapore or in south india,buzzing with plenty of Indians.Perfect place to have Indian food.If you happen to be here don't miss chicken Kadahi at usman's Pakistani food restaurant served with excellent naan."
,,Different scenery to the rest of Singapore,3.0,,"Worth a visit as it doesn't feel like the remainder of Singapore, a district that is heavily influenced by the Indian culture. There are plenty of things to see if you are into exploring, from food options to grabbing a potential bargain at Mustafa's."
,,Good,4.0,,"Hi, It is good specially for Indian who are vegetarians and have good choice of Indian restaurant but the best of them is Kailash Parbat and the others are average - but not bad and good for someone looking for choice or want to try different restaurant . Also shopping as most Indian enjoy and normally do on Mustafa market which is opene 24Hrs - though nothing great but everything under one roof and can do sightseeing during day and at night can do shopping at mustafa larket but for shopping malls will have to go to Orchard Road. Specially for Indian would also advise to stay at Parkroyal on Kitchiner road as in Little India will be easy for food, shopping and also taxis are easily available thoughout."
,,A must visit area,5.0,,"This is one of the few area's where you can find cheap hotels in Singapore, keep in mind that $100 Singapore is Cheap by Singapore standards. Little India is not only a culinary must visit but also a historical area with interesting buildings and architecture, its also a Shopping mecca, discount shopping center Mustapha's is located here and open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Little India is served by the MRT with 2 stations plus plenty of Buses and taxi's.
You can enjoy a scruptious Indian meal at varying prices from a few dollars to gourmet meals, aswell as Hawker stalls off Serangoon Road. A must visit are the grand Temples which were built over a hundred years back by Indian laborers tolling in the hot sun and Singapore marshy environs."
,,Only If You Want to Experience the Chaos of Indian Cities,3.0,,"This area of Singapore can be used by visitors to get a ""demo"" to the chaos, filth and disorganization of an Indian city.

I believe that the authorities tried hard to bring some order to Little India. Having failed to do so, they have converted their failure into a 'tourist attraction.""

Though Little India is the filthiest part of Singapore, it may still be cleaner and more organized than most of the Indian cities.

In Little India we can experience unruly traffic, shops spilling into the pavements, haphazard parking, litter and everything that is just the opposite of what Singapore stands for.

The best thing about this area is that you get yummy veg food at decent prices. Also, there is Mustafa center, where you can get almost anything at a bargain."
,,a taste of india in the middle of Singapore,4.0,,one of the best experiences in Singapore - but only because i was with people guiding me to the most yummy restaurant and really knowing their way around...
,,Very different and worthwhile to visit,4.0,,The area is quite large and worthwhile visiting for a stroll if anything else. The buildings are very colourful and it has a very Indian feel to it as the name suggests! Lots of gold shops and food places!
,,Mustafa Centre,3.0,,The only reason we went here is to go to Mustafa Centre which opens daily 24/7. Its pretty hard to get a ride back from here unless you cross the road to the opposite mall where they have a taxi stand at B1
,,Awesome!,3.0,,"I was here to try a vegetarian restaurant and I love the hustle and bustle along the streets! There are many shops selling gold and jewelry, fruit stalls, and Indian restaurants. Be prepared to sweat a little as it gets pretty humid!"
,,A good overall experience,3.0,,"bare bones, but great location For the price point nothing much to complain about. The room was clean even if the bathroom was a bit basic... the adjoining restaurant serves a great roti prata breakfast for SG$2-3
the only downside was the music plays by the shops on the street from about 7 am or so... but that's part of the experience I think..."
,,Experience India out of India,4.0,,In this area you will find as if you are in one of the cities of India. It is having good market where you can do shopping. You can get good Indian food in this area
,,good enought,5.0,,you could see real indian person that live & have their religious place & their origion form without any poroblem
,,Transported to India while still in Singapore.,5.0,,"I spent a few hours walking through Little India my last day in Singapore. The streets were decorated for the upcoming Deepavali Festival and had a very lively atmosphere. The street markets were full of fresh fruit and vegetable carts. Most also had flowers and the flowers had a lot of bees, so be careful if you attempt to smell them. There are some temples worth paying a visit to and lots of shops to browse through. Don't come to Singapore and not stop by for a visit."
,,More shopping,3.0,,"There are shops and stalls here selling the usual tourist stuff and clothing, a couple of temples and a metro station of its name sake. Sadly nothing like India, just a sanitised Singaporean version."
,,Cheap Goods!,5.0,,"my family told me to go to this place to buy some goods and food for my family back in my home town. and this place offers a lot of cheap but great goods, also the food in the mustafa store is very very cheap."
,,The cleanest Indian part of any City,4.0,,I thought that anything with Indian means poverty and total mess etc. In Singapore- I was speachless because this part of the City was so clean and we found many street restaurants serving their really good food with the beers and everything which is forbidden in most areas because Singapore is a Muslim country. I suggest to go there and also find something rare for gifts to yourself or relatives from the local markets.
,,Indian food n food,5.0,,The place is best to feel how it will be if you are in indian city. The place is awesome for indian cuisines. This used to be my weekend eating place in Singapore. Loved Little India!!!!! try Biryani or Dosa or Idly here !!!
,,Enjoyable place,4.0,,"My hotel was situated in little India. It's beautiful in the day time with its ethnic decorations and little shops along the streets. The food at select restaurants were very delicious (be careful though, because some restaurants offer food that has been sitting out for hours and there are flies everywhere). I got lost and the shopkeepers were very helpful in instructing me back to my route. A lot of people weren't very friendly, but I noticed that throughout the country. Perhaps because everyone is busy and they're all in a hurry?"
,,"Cultural , or is it ethnic",2.0,,"A whole area , many blocks that is so Indian , and so unlike the rest of Singapore , shops full of cheap rubbish , and one of only two places we saw rubbish ( litter) good to see , but take it or leave it , it's not much to miss"

,,Full of Temples and Indian food varieties,4.0,,"My visit to Little India was in search of authentic south Indian food. As my friends suggested i tried Komala vilas. The food was authentic. You can have a hearty Indian meal for less than SG$ 10. If you are coming by bus, then you have to ask the driver to drop you at "" Mustafa "". It is a very famous shopping mall. You can find Kali amman Temple, Srinivasa perumal temple in the vicinity. Little India MRT is also very close which connects you with other parts of the city. So many gold shops owned by Indians can be found in Serangoon road. You can get nice souvenirs for cheap prices here apart from China town. Four Singapore logo T-Shirts for SG$ 10. Nice place to stroll in the evening."
,,Little India-Authentic Indian food,5.0,,"I have visited Singapore with my friends, We were searching for Indian veggiterian food and we got Little India. Its awesome Indian Authentic food we ever had in singapore. Budgeted cost and like home made food. Pleasent staff and fast services."

,,"Smells, Sounds & Feel of India",4.0,,"My favourite ""neighbourhood"" in Singapore, Little India, in parts, sounds and smells like India and I sometimes have remind myself that I am not in Old Delhi or some other part of India. Typical Indian heritage pervades the neighbourhood, centred on Serangoon Road. Their are loads of shops selling Indian food, materials, gold and jewellery and many indian cafes and restaurants serving typical Indian food (make sure you check-out the chilli challenge at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining ). Don't miss the fascinating Sri Veeranakaliamanan Temple but otherwise just wander and let your eyes, ears and nose lead you through this area of majesty."

There's a great hawker centre there for cheap food and strong drinks (Knock Out and Kingfisher are 8%!)
Would recommend but it might be too busy during Deepavali."

The one thing which we observed was south Indian influence.

We also found a punjabi style dhaba with the name Bikaner express vegetarian outlet which was great choice.
The overall experience was nice."
,,Home away from home. Almost.,4.0,,"When Indian travellers visit foreign lands, they yearn for Indian food. They miss mingling with the crowds, miss the aroma of spicy food preparations and in general the milieu that they have become accustomed to while living in India. Little India compresses all the above points and gives it to the weary Indian traveller in a nicely marketed package. Must visit for all home-sick Indians!"
,,An interesting place to spend a few hours,4.0,,It is a great place to get a curry fix. Try and avoid going there on Sunday. It is crowded. Be prepared to ask for the best price!
,,Avoid Little India on Sunday,4.0,,"Lots of good Indian restaurants , souvenirs shops & Mustafa Centre. But avoid this place on a sunday evening as it gets quite noisy and dirty due to huge influx of Indian crowd (mainly blue collar workers from India)."

Little India has Veeramakaliamman temple. Also it is where Indian celebrates Durga puja and Diwali as well. If you reach Little India through MRT, take Gate E to reach the streets where you get plenty of vegitable/fruit shops and array of south indian , especially Tamil restaurants. Good for a wholesome meal and coffee at very moderate price. However, other side of area has full of expensive restaurants and fine for a speciality dinner and a dring. Then there is bangladeshi delicacies available at 'Gharoa' or Shapla (Shapla was not a favourite place to sit and dine but food was very tasty).
Mustafa centre is one stop for shopping, grocery, money exchange or jewellery - anything. Farrer park and city square mall is not also far away, if you want to catch a movie and then take MRT.
Overall, it is always crowded and you go there more when you need than when you love to go out."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"I was that tourist that started at everything here. I loved the colors and sites (smells were a different story). But I thought it was a great taste of India. I wish we would have had more time to check out the whole area, we didn't realize how big it was until we arrived."

,,Buzzing,4.0,,"Our hotel was near Little India. Being close to the Deepavali festival it was all lit up, a bit like Christmas. A great atmosphere and worth a trip if you are into that sort of thing. The hawker food market is interesting to say the least."
,,Charming place,4.0,,"This is a very charming place with many food and shopping options. The restoration work on the buildings in this community is admirable that you can't help wonder why buildings in your own country (mine, the Philippines) can't be treated with the same respect and dignity."

,,Interesting for those of other races,4.0,,"Went last Saturday to soak up the pre-Deepavali mood.
It's a cultural enlightenment if you want to have a feel of what's visiting India is like.
The Goldsmith shop manned mainly by Chinese were very crowded with many Indian customers.
Good to pay a visit to Little India once in a while even if you are Singaporean."
,,Typically Indian,3.0,,"`You can take an Indian out of India but you cannot take out his / her Indian habits out' - No matter which part of the world he/she is in. Little India is a famous place infamous for housing Indians. So much so even the tube station here is named Little India. Once you are walking on the streets and by lanes here you can witness all Indian food joints ranging from idlis and dosas to curries and fries.

Throughout Singapore you won‚Äôt find any dirt and filth but here you would. Thanks to the Indian inhabitants. Throughout Singapore you won‚Äôt find people chewing gums and other stuff but here you would. Thanks to the Indian inhabitants. Throughout Singapore you won‚Äôt find people shabbily dressed, here you would thanks to the Indian population. Throughout Singapore you won‚Äôt find dustbins overflowing, here you would. I don‚Äôt think I need to thank someone specific again.

So if you are visiting Singapore for a long time and missing India or Indian food, or Indian people feel free to come here and spend some time, you would feel like you are back home."

You can take some nice panoramic pictures from the 2nd story at the Arcade, beside the MRT Little India."
,,Stayed there a year or so ago.,2.0,,Needed to see if it was the same as last visit to remind me why I decided to stay near Orchid Road. Only plus is it is close to Chinatown. Love it there. Found the box we stayed in last time walked the same streets but found lots of street stalls we missed last visit. Food stalls were fun. Saw food I have not ever seen here in Aus.
,,Cheap Shopping and Amazing Cultural Experience,5.0,,Little India is a long street full of tiny shops and stalls. Tailors work on sewing machines in the street and goods are hung from every possible part of the shop interiors and exteriors. The prices are rock bottom and there are some great deals available. A wonderful cultural experience with curries available on every corner and the aroma of herbs and spices mingling with incense.
,,Better shopping than Chinatown,4.0,,"I enjoyed strolling up the main streets here more than the more popular (and more touristy-fied) Chinatown. Better offers, too (sunglasses from 1$ - 2.90, while CT is unanimously 10$) .. great atmosphere currently with all those extra stalls selling Deevali items. Lots of food options available, i.e. Tekka Centre"
,,Colourful,5.0,,"Little India is great for finding bargains, including eau de toilets, watches and clothes, if you like Indian style clothes. We had a splurge of a time!!"
,,Little India,4.0,,"October 2015 . Little India is a very nice Place to visit . The peoples here are friendly , eatng is no Problem , they are enough Restaurants . There are Musicshops , if you want to buy a Bollywood DVD or CDs with Indian Music . Many Shops with Clothes you will find . It is much nicer than the ""China-Town"""
,,Well worth the visit.,5.0,,"Little India on Serangoon Road is well worth the visit. It is easy to get to and once you are there, the world is your oyster. Great bargains to be had in the many, many shops/stalls. If you require a genuine Indian meal then there are plenty to choose from. Walk up the right hand side of Serangoon Road, be prepared for bustle, and when you get to the Musapha Centre, go in there and have a look at floor upon floor of bargains."
,,Not impressed,2.0,,"Just a road with shops selling Indian jewelry etcs and electronics, no character just a busy mixed up place."
,,Totally India,4.0,,"Well nothing so special from me since I am Indian but those from other countries will like it since it gives a small glimpsr of India, the markets, cloth and gold shops not to mention the small temples everywhere!"
,,Visiting the Little India area in Singapore,3.0,,Visited the Little India area on a tour during the daytime. Walked down a couple of streets and viewed the small vendors in the area. Okay but didn't seem to be anything to get excited about.
,,"Authentic food, cafes, restaurants and bars all mix in the smells and aromas of India",3.0,,An amazing warren of streets and alley ways. The atmosphere is amazing with the sights and smells of spices of the delicious food. Recommend to go in the morning for a great breakfast or in the early evening as the place gets busier. Many very reasonable hotels in the area with many cafes and bars to sit in and soak up the atmosphere.
,,Not what we expected but we'll worth a visit,4.0,,"Visited late evening. Very busy and all the shops selling exactly the same thing. A couple of smaller markets were worth it. Main street is fantastic as it was setting up for diwali. Visited a restaurant on main street which I can't remember name of( just after the main temple on the same side of the street there are 3 side by side set hback slightly, we went to first one) but prob best curry I have ever had. Overall lovely atmosphere and you get a glimpse of the sights and smells of India. It is like a little bit of India has been lifted and set there"
,,Mystical Fragrance and Exotic Spices,5.0,,"My preference to eat good food in Singapore is to visit Little India for lunch, Geylang Serai for exotic and spicy Malaysian food.
Of course these dishes are available in the tourist districts of Orchard Road, Tanglin, and the posh hotels too, but I believe in authenticity, and the best food is home cooked style without the addition of fancy displays and inflated prices. Little India is such a fine place to visit, and popular with foreign tourists because of the selection of jewellery shops and Indian restaurants, plus beautiful Sarees and perfumes. If you would like to eat vegetarian food then the perfect place to visit in Little India is the Mustapha Shopping complex. There are several vegetarian restaurants in the area which serve tasty food. At this time (October 2015) Deepavalli celebrations are ongoing in Little India until November 13th."
,,Little India,5.0,,"The entire area esp two big lanes the Campbell street and the parallel one are like magic world. The festive village is having an array of display of decorative items for navratri, Pooja,the haldi kumkum functions, the Torans the diyaas!mind boggling!never seen such a wide choice of items back home too. Was very pleased with the vibrant sales happening everywhere. The social fabric is in!"
,,Worth a visit Main drag is clean but areas off could be cleaner,3.0,,"Interesting area to stroll around Plenty of cheap shops and places to eat, We were using the Red Bus and got off at one of their stopping point and picked it up at next. Worth a few hours seeing the sights but though different from Chinatown I would prefer C/Town"
,,Little India,4.0,,Very interesting place. Enjoyed the vibrant evenings when people are all out and about. Great food and plenty of choices.
,,Culinary Delight,5.0,,"Little India is easilyu accessible via the MRT or local buses. We used our Singapore Airline bus passes to get there and really enjoyed the food and cultural experiences.

The shoping is not bad either but remember to haggle a little as some of the prices can be quite steep.

We also visited during the Deepavali Festival so there was plenty to do. We also felt safe there travelling with two small kids.

The restuarants on Race-course Road are worth the visit alone but beware the smeels from the drains"
,,Singapore's dirty market,3.0,,"If you walk along the market here in night, especially Friday night, you will think that you are not in Singapore. The place is so dirty. Many construction worker get drunk here. But do not worry about your safety, they are so drunk and sleepy"
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,"This is one really interesting place to visit and it really feels like you've stepped into a completely different country altogether. Take time to stroll the different streets and soak in the sights and sounds.
I'd recommend evenings to nights since the weather's a lot better then but avoid this place during weekends at all cost!"
,,"Little India, full of colour, smells and lots of people.",5.0,,"Little India has a wonderful charm all its own. Yes it's busy, yes there are a lot of people, yes there is a distinct aroma that can only be found in little India. All the spices and herbs combine to assault the senses. Amazing amount of sensory overload in one small section of Singapore. Mustafa open 24 hours. What more can I say."
,,"It is really """" LITTLE"""" India...",4.0,,"Small area, you will ""Smell"" it on reaching its entrance. Indian life, Indian food, and Indian people are notice on every inch of little India. you can see it while you have a tour on the hop on hop off bus.

,,Indian,3.0,,"Exotic colours, foods and smells of India but done in a classically clean and tidy Singapore manner. Not my favourite part of Singapore but with a visit if you're passing through."
,,Mustafa!,4.0,,"little India has a department store called Mustafa, very cheap and famous place to shop. I went there with MRT, make sure you choose Ferrer Park as your stop point, not Little India. Otherwise, you'll need to walk sooooo far (like I did) nice place but a bit crowded"
,,Go here for shopping,4.0,,"This palce was close to my accomodation and nice to explore. A lot of good and nice shops, a lot of nice people around and some nice things to buy. It is open till late in the night and worth to visit this area. It gives you an idea of the Indian Lifestyle and the country themself. I liked this place really much."
,,Very interesting area of Singapore,5.0,,large area which is predominantly Indian with many temples and Indian shopping areas. Very busy on Sunday's. Great place for a stroll and to do some shopping.
,,Tekka Centre - Little India,3.0,,My teenage daughters and I caught the SMRT to Little India station and had a look around the Tekka Centre markets. Lots of bright coloured clothes. The girls had henna tattoos done which turned out great.
,,Smell the Curry,3.0,,"Walking Little India is like walking through Mumbai or other parts of India. You have the smells of spices, curry, food, and shops to make you feel like you are there. It is another place to watch people from another culture and you can be a part of it by shopping and eating in the area shops and restarants. Curry is great and you can get tailored suits and shirts real fast!"
,,Buzzing with activity,5.0,,"Everything is non stop, from the side street stalls to the restaurant workers inviting you in, the honking traffic and the people pushing carts of their goods over the road. There are good transport links, plenty of tasty places to eat and although some areas there were a bit dirtier than others, with a bit of planning you can avoid if needed. We took in everything and explored the lot - would highly recommend visiting."
,,Home away from home,3.0,,For Indian travellers must visit Little India. Home away from home . Very colorful and attractive shopping .
,,Hustle and bustle - vibrant,5.0,,Little India was all lit up this month. The Main Street was awash with lights down the entire length. The markets were bright and vibrant with a wide variety of souvenirs for those so inclined. Plenty of options for a meal and easy to access by taxi or MRT.
,,Little India - an interesting place,4.0,,No visit is complete if one does not visit Little India... This area is covered with shops & restaurants all over the place & also has a couple of Temples to visit... Highly decorated during the Hindu festive seasons. A must visit for all tourist...
,,vibrant culture,5.0,,"This place is a historic area that shows off the best of Singapore‚Äôs Indian community and architecture. It is good for shopping too. The stores here provide all kind of Indian goods from food, spices to clothes and fabrics. Go to the busy Tekka Market for food and souvenirs. The 24-hour shopping mall Mustafa Centre offers everything from electronics to groceries, or take your pick from open-air Tekka Centre, goldsmith shops and sari stores."
,,Must see,4.0,,We received a rich explanation of the how the Indian people came to Singapore and how they are living now. I would say you have to see Little India both with Chinatown and Kampong Glam in order to grasp the multicultural identity of Singapore.
,,Feel home,4.0,,"May be the least clean district in Singapore but, if you are from India you won't miss home.Good Indian restaurants of budget and mid range. Plenty of small shops selling Indian goods. Mustafa is the biggest mall."

,,ok,5.0,,"Very interesting district, feel so different, not like in other parts of Singapore. didnt find any special things, but just for a walk"
,,Can be skipped...,2.0,,"Dirty, smelly, unatractive; one doesn't feel too good when in Little India, unfriendly people, unpleaseant ambience, a permanent stench and dirt everywhere. Quite surprising for Singapore, but if they want to live like that... fine with me but definitely without me. Again, can be avoided. If you want to see a really nice Indian Temple you'll find one in China Town..."
,,Highlight of Singapore trip,5.0,,One of my favorite things about Singapore. Definitely go to eat at the food cafeterias and you will not be disappointed. The streets are so colorful and beautiful to view that you could spend at least an hour or so just exploring the streets and the art. Very easy to get to by metro and well worth visiting.
,,Ate at rooftop restaurant kebabs-n-curries at Mustafa center - they have fountains and atrium setting,4.0,,"This is another place not to be missed if you like to check out different types of cultures in many countries. There is a lot of shopping at reasonable prices and also many Indian and Pakistani restaurants. There is an area called the Mustafa center where one can buy lovely 22k and 24k gold jewelry as well as watches, perfumes, and just about everything like electrical appliances, bicycles, etc. Mustafa Center is many blocks long and crosses several streets. Each building sells different items. Gold is sold in two different buildings several blocks walk from each other!"
,,Little India,5.0,,"A shoppers delight this place and much cheaper than the rest of Singapore, delicious indian food (veg and non veg) o"
,,Colourful Temple,4.0,,"From Boon Keng MRT station, walk south along Serangoon Road and you will reach the colourful temple of Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple. This South India temple is dedicated to the Destroyer of Evil. The carving are probable some of the best in Little India, and worth a visit."
,,Full of staring men,1.0,,"I visited with my wife and toddler and was shocked at the amount of men in the area. Thousands of men and I would have been lucky to have seen 10 women. Compared to the rest of Singapore, it was very unwelcoming and even intimidating. My wife was stared at constantly, it was overcrowded making it hard to get around. On the positive, the food was very good."
,,Colorful building,3.0,,Stroll around this area and you can find a hindu temple and the famous colorful building which most of the tourist will drop by to take a picture. Its a beautiful place for sigh seeing.
,,Quiet and Interesting,3.0,,"For an hour away from the hustle and bustle of the city, wander round here. There's a massive shop that sells everything over about 5 floors. It's a marvel to walk round just to look at the wacky thing they sell next to each other. There are a few little restaurants nearby for lunch or a snack. Not a smart area by any means."
,,Very Authentic!,5.0,,"I loved this neighborhood, really the closest thing I have ever come to a truly authentic Little India. The food was absolutely amazing (we ate with our hands, like how you're supposed to) and had fun exploring the little shops. (Went Summer 2012)."
,,We the people...,4.0,,"It doesn't matter whether it's in a country called Singapore, we Indians tend to know how to go about doing our business. The sights on the streets of little India in Singapore aren't much far from those seen in India itself. Easily accessible by MRT station of the same name, Little India is a very popular neighbourhood in Singapore with locals and foreigners alike. If you have a penchant for Indian food, and affordable shopping, Little India is the place for you in all of Singapore. You'll find places of worship, mouth watering eating joints, really affordable shopping, a taste of south Indian kaapi (coffee), all in this small neighbourhood of criss-crossing streets. Food here varies from authentic South Indian cuisine, to Chettinad, to mughlai, Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati, food from almost all parts of India. The best part, its very affordable. You might easily find this area as one of the most pocket friendly area in all of Singapore. Beware of going there on Sunday evenings, you might be up for a huge crowd of people gathered to have a good time."
,,Feels like a piece of India,4.0,,Enjoyable place to wander through and get a feel for another face of Singapore. The minute you cross the canal it feels like you have walked in to another world. Some bargain pricing in the shops make browsing worth while.
,,Little India,5.0,,Nice place to roam and shop....statying is cheap in the area...the mall is open 24*7 can roam anytime...has many indian restaurants
,,Exciting!,5.0,,"I loved the hustle and bustle of Little India, I did not shop here but I am sure the prices were not bad!"

,,There's a touch of the chaotic everywhere in Little India.,5.0,,"Little India is a small district - not much more than a few streets filled with Indian grocers, jewelry stores and some of the best Indian restaurants in the region.

But the sights, colours and smells are reminiscent of India. There's a touch of the chaotic everywhere in Little India.

Go to Little India if you want authentic Indian Food - the way the Indians eat it.

You can also buy cheap souvenirs, clothes, jewelry, electronics and other Indian stuff.

During Divali, the Indian festival of lights and the streets are beautifully decorated."
,,Never ending discoveries,5.0,,"Whether it's the arts scene, or the temples, or the jewellers, or the bewildering F&B options, or the processions, or just the insane human traffic, Little India never surprises, even on repeat visits."
,,Worth a meander,4.0,,"After several visits to Singapore, we managed to take time to have a wander through Little India and weren't disappointed , made extra special due to the Hindu festival taking place, we were invited into the Temples and offered food and made to feel welcome. I also had some of the best veg pakora I've had in a long time at a local cafe"
,,"At first you'll hate it, and then you'll love it.",4.0,,"It's an assault on the senses - views & smells that (if you're a Westerner) you might not have experienced before. It feels like you've been transported directly to the real deal. Expect to be pestered by street vendors, but just take it on board and don't be offended. Would recommend stopping by the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple - amazing sight!"
,,worth a visit,4.0,,Very accessible via subway. The name speaks for itself... i felt like i'm not actually in Singapore. Had a try of authentic india cuisine just beside the famous Mustafa Center. The goods are so reasonably priced...i purchased a trolley bag 20% cheaper than its mall price. Chocolates and nuts are way cheaper. Downside: a little bit overcrowded...not so orderly...not enough signs to guide newbies like us in exploring the place on our own.
,,Skip it:),2.0,,"Nothing interesting to see. Recently painted two storey houses where at the street level plenty of shops selling Indian fabric, not in European taste. Artificial tourist ""attraction""."
,,Feel like Indian!!,4.0,,"The place is accessible via SMRT and is aptly called ""little India"" as you will Indians all around. It is a great place for tourists as it has ample restaurants with all cuisine options and and other articles."
,,An afternoon exploring,4.0,,We had a wander around the many streets of Little India. The temples were great to see and we found a great little Indian Lagnaa Barefoot Dining.
,,People who goes to this place can experience India without going to India!,4.0,,An India Away From India! People who goes to this place can experience India without going to India! Lot Of Indian Shops Around! You should know how to bargain or you are in for a RIP off!
,,Indian Food and Shopping,4.0,,"Go to Little India if you want authentic Indian Food - the way the Indians eat it. The restaurants here are traditional rather than the fine dining restaurants found elsewhere in Singapore and so is the food.

You can also buy cheap souvenirs, clothes, jewelry, electronics and other Indian stuff. Mustafa's is great for shopping and there are restaurants all around.

I visited close to the Indian festival of lights and the streets were beautifully decorated.

Avoid the weekends and public holidays as it gets very crowded."
,,"Great Food, Cheap Shopping!",4.0,,"Little India is a great place to explore, great food, loads of vendors as far as you can see on the strip, especially if you're vegetarian.

There's also lots of bargains to be had, with cheap shopping deals on clothes and electrical goods, you'll be sure to find s bargain. There is even fresh flower shops making beautiful arrangements.

There is several temples that can be visited and are a site to see, with ornate carvings and and array of bright colours.

The area can get very busy on weekends, so I suggest a weekday visit if you can."
,,Desi flavour in Singapore !!!!,4.0,,"A proper Indian experience in the cosmopolitan place like Singapore .Expect a good Indian foods and shopping market place . Not as extravagant like rest of singapore ,but a must go place for every Indian . Loved the Indian desi market and especially Mustafa ."
,,Unique Quarter,4.0,,"Intertsting place, great food nice shops. You don't need much time to enjoy the area but I recomend it."
,,Interesting place and shopping,5.0,,"Sacred temple, truly place for Indian products and atmosphere, good price products at 24-hour open Mustafa."
,,"Great curry, very dirty",2.0,,"A great place for a curry with the lads, and the mostapha mall has everything you'll need for a basic shop...but it's very dirty and can be quite unfriendly."
,,MUST VISIT - Local Markets and Indian Heritage Center,5.0,,"What a transformation Little India Singapore has gone through over the years and all for the best. Walk around the neighbourhood and take in the sights and sounds of local shoppers, wet markets, fresh fruit, flower and veggie market stalls, whilst inhaling the wonderful aromas of bubbling curries from the many restaurants. I love this neighbourhood - its a positive assault to the senses - Enjoy it!"
,,Only Visit at Night,3.0,,Little India is the only place where you can find alot of Indian and Pakistani restaurants. Try to visit at night bcz at day time there noting to do there. the only place in Singapore which stay open till late night
,,Not much,2.0,,Not much going on here and unlikely to be worth a detour or special trip. A few temples and a few indian food stalls
,,Mustafa mall,3.0,,"Felt the place to be tidy like rest of Singapore.... We had actually forgotten how to not use the zebra crossing until we came to little india...felt like chennai, revisited. Unless guys are craving for Indian food ( we really didn't like the taste, which was not at all like Indian food). Could have been better to make our nation proud..
Tips: if you really want Singapore stuff, visiting here is useless, unless other wise for food. My verdict avoid it or take snaps and run from it."
,,Hit and miss,3.0,,"Like a ward of Singapore, it's not as clean as other area. The streets seem more crowded, and the pedestrian walk ways are further apart. The local shops are more business related than tourist. We spent about two hours walking around, and unless you are going to a specific restaurant or location, it's not an area I would recommend."
,,Felt as if I was back in India,3.0,,"We visited little India, after visiting few other destinations is Singapore. We felt as if we have been transported to an entirely different place - didn't feel this was the same Singapore...
Mustafa shopping centre is the biggest attraction here.. another one being Mariaman temple..
One should avoid going there on Sunday evenings.."
,,Little India,5.0,,"This is the place where you should go if you are fed up of having chinese, malay food. A place where you get variety of Indian food. A place that gives you a feel of walking across Indian streets"
,,Very similar to India proper...,4.0,,... but this version a whole lot less dirt they have the other day was that there was from building to building was nice see. We stopped in for a beer and flowers. Nice for a few hours and easily accessible by the MRT.
,,"Like stepping into another country, must visit!",5.0,,Singapore is full of pocket developments offering different cultural experience for its visitors and Little India is definitely one of those areas that is a must visit. Here you can feel like you've stepped into India and you can feel the vibe and the great cultural influence of the Indian population in Singapore. Top activities here is shopping and local Indian food tasting. There are several areas in Little India that offers cheap finds like the Tekka Mall and the Mustafa Centre. There are several Indian restaurants offering authentic Indian cuisine so don't be afraid to try them. Tip: go to where most locals go because it means the food is great!
,,Little scary India,1.0,,"This area of Singapore is really the opposite side what you read in travel books.
Streets were dirty, bunch of young guys were staring my girlfriend, (with a kind of hatred look) it was pretty annoying, people were coming and going in groups, men hand in hands.
Shop assistants did not want to understand that we did not want to buy anything. After an hour and a half we left and to be honest this experience really reassured my unwillingness to ever visit India."
,,"Little India, can be more clean",3.0,,"Cheap booze can be purchased here, feels like you are in India, also not the cleanest part in the city. Visited the Mariaman Temple and very tranquil. Food court seems very dirty and unhygienic. Did not feel like eating here, so some of the food like very authentic. Eat in the restaurants around avoid the cheap food courts only for sanitation reasons, my opinion any ways."
,,"Mustufa Shopping Centre,",5.0,,"If you don't mind cramped shelves while shopping then go to the Mustufa Shopping centre,,great bargains to be had,,everything you could imagine is in this one shopping spot,,and very reasonable prices,,,"
,,singapore trip,4.0,,loved the little shops in little india. you can find good stuff here that you can give to your friends back home.

,,Little india,4.0,,"The Area is must visit for Indian tourist who want to visit Market for indian goods, Indian food outlets, Mustafa market are regular place of visit for Indian tourist."
,,Another great destination in Singapore,3.0,,"Another great place to visit in Singapore, however, be warned. Sunday nights is men's night. It can be very intimidating for young females visiting the area. Any other time, this is a great place to visit. Buy some silk, enjoy the smells. A walk between Arab Street/Kampong Glam and Little India is easy and with a small detour will take you through the electronics and camera shops."
,,"If you are looking for great food in Singapore, look no further!",4.0,,"Very exciting busy place. All kinds of cool things to buy, like spices and trinkets. The restaurants and very reasonable and the food is outstanding!"
,,must visit!,4.0,,"The people, the shops, the restaurants... don't forget the markets! There's excellent deals to make in this area..."
,,Taste of India,5.0,,"The food, smells, shops, jewelry and Mustafa's. It is a little part of India in Singapore. it has it all the Indian grocery stores, sweet shops, clothing stores the atmosphere and the people. A great way to spend the day"

,,Mustafa Center,4.0,,Always come to this area on the last day to Mustafa Center. The neighborhood is crowded. Mostly shops. There's a mosque near mustafa center..clean and convenient. Next time would like to stay in one of the hotels here. Very recomende for everyone
,,A Taste of India in Singapore,4.0,,"Okay, I've never been to India (though I hope to rectify that sometime) but this little corner of Singapore did give me a bit of a taste of what I was missing. I loved walking along Buffalo road looking at all of the produce and textile shops, and some of the clothes here were absolutely gorgeous. There are a number of arcades around here that sell pretty much anything and everything Indian from spices to really colourful textiles, to food. Unfortunately due to the limited amount of time I really wasn't able to take this place in fully the way I did in Chinatown. I also found myself wandering around trying to find a place that sold a decent curry. I guess I probably should have paid more attention to the internet, but then again I was too busy taking in the sites."
,,Little of India in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are an Indian, you can skip this place, cause you already know how it is... Unless you want to eat indian food.

For others, its a great place to visit to understand the Indian culture, the vibrance, the riot of colours, the temples, the festivals (during the seasons). A good way to connect with it. Though its not as clean as the rest of Singapore, its definitely a place to visit, especially if you want some bargain shopping. And of course, Mustafa Centre is right here, where you will get the best deals in Singapore."
,,Indian gold galore!,4.0,,We really enjoyed shopping for and comparing prices and styles of gold jewellery in many jewellers who were clustered together in the central shopping district. The shopping is a short walk from the station. It was also interesting wandering the streets to meander in local stores where the locals shop. Temples and buildings were interesting too. A very different pocket to the rest of Singapore and easily accessible by MRT.
,,Best Place to buy Gold Jewellery,4.0,,"The shops are located along both sides of Serangoon Road and the jewellery are all hand crafted. They sell the best 22 carat gold. There are also some good Indian clothing shops. Another interesting pplace is the also a produce market that sells Asian vegetables/fruits, seafood, poultry, beef and crabs from Sri Lanka. Singapore's most famous Mustafa shopping centre is 20 minutes walk from the MRT. This place is open 24 hours and a must visit place. There are also some good Indian restuarants and shops that sells Indian music/movies"
,,FAMILY TRIP,4.0,,"We went to Singapore in Nov - 2014 , stayed in hotel aqueen jalan besar which is in little India . A lots of Indian Restaurants , shops are their .Famous Mustafa centre is also their"
,,Little India,3.0,,"We went here about seven years ago, i can see some temple for Hindu we praying there And feel so Happy, maybe next time i will come again"
,,The name says it!,3.0,,"Singapore is known to be one of the cleanest cities in the world. However, there is a loophole in that statement and the loophole is Little India. I'm not saying that the place is not clean or is filthy, but the place is extremely crowded and has very narrow lanes, which makes it really congested. All said and done, this place is fantastic for Indian restaurants, specially for vegetarian Indians and of course you have the Mustafa Centre!"
,,India in Singapore,5.0,,Litte India is a great place to spend a few hours or even a day. There are a lot of food opportunities and it is hard to choose one - there are so many! Great
,,"Goldsmiths everywhere, plus cheapish clothing, curry reastaurants and much colour.",3.0,,"I enjoy my visits to LI where I go to eat and buy Indian sweetmeats (eg. burfi), spices, artificial flowers and to take photographs. The area is served by the MRT and buses from town. Attractions include a Hindu temple, Mustapha's department store and colourful side streets."
,,Good Bargins,4.0,,If your looking for cheap shopping in Singapore try Little India especially for hippy pants and small souvenirs - not the cleaniest of places and wouldn't eat there but shopping okay. Mostly in Singapore shopping is expensive but Little India and Bugis Street were okay.
,,Very different,4.0,,We enjoyed strolling the markets here and seeing all the different things for sale. Definitely a different side of Singapore.
,,India in Singapore,5.0,,If you are looking for good Indian food here you can find it. During the day you already have a bit the feeling of being in India but after the sun goes down you will feel like in India.
,,Little-Madras not India,1.0,,"It's named wrongly as Little India... it's most dirty place in Singapore. U don't feel like being in Singapore. .. untidy roads, v unfriendly hotels, cheap looking place... it's dirty version of Chennai.... Any one traveling from North India or other clean locations will not like it. No good place to get north Indian food.. only available option is Copper Chimney, which is a shame on name of copper chimney chain.... I repeat it's DIRTIEST place in Singapore"
,,Great!,4.0,,"Great food and cheap, maybe one of the few cheap foods in Singapore (althouth way expensive the most indian food around asia). The looks, the feels, the colors, the people, the smells, the music, it's like been in India."
,,Don't waste your time going here.,1.0,,"There is nothing exotic, mystical or interesting here. The whole area is scruffy and untidy. The restaurant we went to (Charcoal BBQ) was overpriced and the quality was dubious. I could have got the same meal for 2 adults and 2 kids for less than half the price in Manchester, Leeds, Bradford and it would have tasted better. Don't bother visiting this part of Singapore - it's rubbish !"
,,One of the most colourful neighbourhoods in Singapore,3.0,,"Suggest you to first visit the Little India from the Tekka Centre that features one of the largest wet markets in the city, as well as a food court and a complete shopping mall.

Opposite Tekka Centre you‚Äôll encounter the Little India Arcade, selling Indian clothing and fabrics, spices, jewelry, handbags, handicrafts and so on.

Following Bukit Timah Road south-eastward, you‚Äôll soon come to another major shopping destination named Sim Lim Square, one of Singapore‚Äôs largest electronic and IT malls.

Towards the end of Serangoon Road, you‚Äôll arrive at another of Little India‚Äôs highlights: Mustafa Centre. which is a unique discount department store."
,,Home away from home,4.0,,"We stayed here mainly because we wanted to have indian meals away from home. And we were not disappointed. Tons of Indian restaurant to choose from, temples, flowers, indian people.. very homely environment... home away from home"
,,Miss it any time,1.0,,"Dirty, overcrowded and uninteresting. the other face of Singapore that reminds you that you are in Asia, after all...."
,,A very nice place to hangout for Indians specially,4.0,,"A Very nice place with combination of Chinese hotels, and Indian restaurants, with beautiful indian temples, and most amazing few sculptures. And most amazing place like Mustafa market for purchase chocolates and indian items."
,,The names says it all,5.0,,"I guess this can not even compare to real one but I think it gives you enough of it to whet your appetite. Indulge yourself for a bite of India. Little India offers the cuisine, culture music as you walk along the street. The shops also offers great bargains and if you have the time get yourself a tailored shirt. The place also hosts temples, just remember to adhere to local customs when visiting a temple of worship."
,,India 2,4.0,,"As soon as you enter this area of Singapore you feel like you are in India; people wearing traditional clothes, markets with Indian food, lots of beauty salons where you can get your eyebrows threaded... needs to be visited as singapore is known for many different cultures living in one place!"
,,Great place for tourists,3.0,,When I first moved to Singapore. I went to this area a numerous times. A lot of small to medium size of Indian restaurants along the road. Also I was into Indian jewellery accessories. This is great place for Indian foods lover and Indian clothes and accessories style shopping. Please avoid after work hours and weekend too crowned.
,,Can't wait to go again,4.0,,I recommed checking out the hawker market. Great cheap food and beer. Good atmosphere. Can't wait to go again.
,,Not entirely a comfortable place,3.0,,"There's something fundamentally incongruous about the idea of a Little India in Singapore. India is a land of colourful chaos: it's noisy, it's dirty, poverty is on view almost everywhere alongside ostentatious wealth and nobody in their right mind would touch the street food unless they enjoy emetics. Singapore, on the other hand, is clean and ordered, mostly well-to-do and boasts plentiful, safe food court delights for less than $5 that everyone should try.

So this is kind of India-lite really, a bit like Singapore is Asia lite. You might enjoy this if you are Indian and seeking a little taste of home, or if you have never been to India and therefore might find it exotic. But the truth is there's a tension here: so many of those you will see in this area are poorly-paid Bangladeshi construction workers, who in December 2013 rioted when one of their compatriots was crushed under a bus, the first riot in Singapore since the 1960s. As a result, you still can't buy a beer in this locality at the weekends....but if you visit Mustafa, you can buy just about anything else at any time."
,,amazing little india,4.0,,Its an annual visit as usual- for the ambiance- the food and the shopping. Always very good and has its cultural character
,,Enjoyed!!!!,5.0,,"Good place to eat whosome banana leaf meal. Plent of restaurant's to choose from... Overall, enjoyed my visit to this place."
,,Little South India**,4.0,,"As the Name suggest, this place in singapore will make you feel like home if you are from INDIA. I would recommend anyone from India is visiting Singapore, look for the hotels and accommodation in Little India. The location is really good. One big MRT junction Dhobi Ghaut is at walking distance. If you are shopping enthusiast, Orchard road is also nearby. Most important thing you will love in Little India is South Indian Food. There are couple of good restaurant chanis like ANand Bhavan, Sarvana Bhavan. Moreover 2 temples are also situated in the area. South Indian population is more and even Tamil is an official language in Singapore.So if you are an indian and planing to visit singapore, the place to stay should be Little India only. Also try the GINGER TEA available in big cups at food court.

GJ"
,,The Title says it all,4.0,,If you are into Indian food then this will be just the place that you will want to visit its easy to get to as there is an m r t station called little Indian as well as other M R T stations nearby.
,,Home away from home,5.0,,"The best place to be if you like the Indian atmosphere outside of India. No wonder, the title. Clean and yet authentic food and items can be purchased here."
,,"Strategic Location for tourist spot with afordable price for hotels, food and shopping",4.0,,"recomended place for backpacker. with shopping malls around, many affordable n decilious food especially when you looking for halal food. you can reach with bus, MRT and taxi."
,,Just Indian feel!,5.0,,"If you want to feel Indian essence and vibes, don't miss place if you are in Singapore. A lot of eateries around for Indian cuisines and others. Good place for shopping also."
,,Small & Smelly Quaint,3.0,,We stopped for 30 minutes as part of tour but not very impressive as very congested small shops and few smells along the way. Did want to try some food but wife won't let me as afraid may get sick or stomach upset. Looked delicious. Definitely worth a visit
,,little india indeed!,3.0,,"its like walking in streets of India. went on a week day so not much crowded. they have ethic foods, vegetables, ethnic clothing to sell for low costs. also there are shops which sells flower necklaces made of colourful fresh flowers like small roses, carnation petals, jasmins..etc. they were very smelly and really fresh. there are Hindu temples in the area. totally reflect Indian culture. not so clean like other areas in Singapore. but better than Indian markets of course!"
,,Justifies the name,4.0,,"Little Indian is located into the heart of Singapore's residential area. Little India offers an Indian vibe from the hotels to the roads, from shops to restaurant. Closest MRT station is Little India MRT station. Worth a visit if you're in Singapore. Try the street food vendors and the ladies will love this place to shop around. You still need to have some bargaining skills thought."
,,Fantastic Eateries,3.0,,"Vast kaleidoscope of colours and cultures all meeting in one area. Everything definitely has an Indian edge to it. Lots to do see and eat. The Indian department store, open 24hrs a day 7 days a week is a sight to behold. The biggest 4 story 2 buildings over 2 blocks and is a serious overdose."
,,Interesting,3.0,,Interesting area however China Town is far more active and seems to be better value. The smell of spices is very strong and gets the old taste buds working.
,,A different Singapore,3.0,,"Great food as a very different vibe make this neighbor worth at least a quick trip when in Singapore. There isn't much by way of sights, however."
,,good place with few minus points,4.0,,"please do not go there during afternoon time as it was very hot. Another minus point was there were lots of Indian men hanging around on the streets and staring as we walked by will make us feel very uncomfortable.

There were lots of Indian men just hanging around on the streets and open spaces doing not an awful lot other than staring as you walked by making you feel rather uncomfortable!

However, the place has a lot of indian shops. It is a great place to shop variety of Indian stuffs, from indian cuisine, texstiles to groceries. There were few temples within walking distance if I am not mistaken."
,,Little India walk,3.0,,I hang around this place when I need to get some good fish head curry. The Apollo restaurant have been serving the great food over the years and still maintains its great taste till today
,,Must Do!!!!!!!!!!!,4.0,,"When here a couple of times during our 2 week holiday in Singapore, first time was on a Sunday and couldn't get over how busy it was, it wasn't until later on reading the Lonely Planet guide that we realized Sunday was the busy day in Little India. I Would love to go back next time I am in Singapore"
,,This is India,3.0,,"I have to chuckle about those (below) who complain about a) the drainage b) the smell c) the crowds and d) questionable merchandise.

I'm not entirely sure what they expected.

Singapore's Little India is quite a tame version of the real thing! But the upside is that a) the water is drinkable b) The temple is cleaner c) No one dares steal your shoes!

For all that, there is someauthentically good food (biryani) as well as the inauthenic (chicken tikka) and clich√©d (butter chicken). But this is Singapore - they try to cater to all!"
,,Smelly drainage and poor cleanliness,2.0,,The minute I stepped out of the MRT building the waft of rotten food and stinky drains permeated my nasal passage. A real shocker for an otherwise spotless Singapore!
,,come for the crowds,5.0,,"If you want to check out Little India you should go on a Sunday. On Sundays, thousands of migrant workers from South Asia come to Little India to socialize and shop, turning this part of Singapore into a completely different place. Monday through Saturday, Little India is just a (mostly empty) collection of Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants, mobile phone shops, and backpacker hostels. Sundays is when this place comes to life.

Exit the Little India MRT station at Buffalo Road and slowly work your way to the Mustafa Centre and the Farrer Park MRT station. In between be sure to visit Campbell Lane, Dunlop Street, the Sri Veeramakaliamman temple, and the Lembu Road open space.

Finally, a visit to Little India without a stop at the Mustafa Centre is a wasted visit. Mustafa Centre has everything you can imagine, and wandering the aisles is an experience in itself. This is the one thing you might not want to do on a Sunday, though, if you're planning on actually buying anything. Maybe come back on Monday..."
,,India in Singapore - Little India,5.0,,"If you are indian, your visit to Singapore can not be completed without visiting Little India. Little India is a must do attraction on any itinerary in Singapore. Specially go there for Mustafa Shopping Center and cheap eat at various Indian Restaurants."
,,Wasn't prepared for the grottiness,3.0,,"I was really looking forward to Little India but have to say it was slightly dissapointing. Streets are lovely and colourful but quite dirty, not like the rest of Singapore. The fish market smelt so bad we didn't want to eat at the hawker centre."
,,The place to go to immerge yourself in the Indian culture.,5.0,,"The shopping is fantastic in little India. Such an interesting, vibrant area of Singapore. Has many great little restaurants. A definite must-see."
,,I did not .ike it,1.0,,I didn't like it I am not going back there for a visit it is not worth it going. Back there I rather go and visit other place
,,An interesting experience,3.0,,We visited on a Sunday and I don't know whether we were just unlikely but we did not enjoy our time there at all. There were lots of Indian men just hanging around on the streets and open spaces doing not an awful lot other than staring as you walked by making you feel rather uncomfortable! However there are some lovely very reasonable restaurants there which are definitely worth a try. Our second visit was on a weekday and it was a lot less crowded and busy...a much better experience.
,,worth a look but not clean,3.0,,"we took the kids for some culture, it is very busy and vibrant but it is not clean at all, we did not eat anything from there.

Mustafa's is a 5 storey building that has lots of souvenirs that are much cheaper than the other shops, it has everything in their.

worth a look but only for a hour or so, has a great sleeping budda to see, huge and some great temples as well."
,,Great cheap food!,4.0,,"Little India has many restaurants of various kinds of specific regional tastes of the home country. The prices are generally quite reasonable, especially for lunch. Look for the most crowded places and you will probably find the best food at the lowest prices."
,,A good place for indian tourists .,3.0,,"Little India a homely place for Indian tourists . Here one can find many Indian shops , food runes by Indian and chines people. it is a good place to purchase small articles to take home. The famous Mustfa shopping mall is here."
,,"India, out of India!",4.0,,"What can be more homely than having a miniature version of India that too in a foreign land. You have it all here! From spice shops,to Indian restaurants and hotels too. If you hear the car horns, see a lot of bicycles and hear the vibrant chattering of residents, you know you've reached Little India. So all those feeling homesick, go visit Little India. I'm sure you're not going to miss India anymore."
,,Aromatic Shopping,4.0,,"Quite an experience being met with the aroma of spices and all sorts of merchandise that are distinct to India. Amidst the cacophony of sounds, vibrant colours and multitude of smells is the wonderful array of shops selling what seems to be everything and anything!"
,,Like the Indian culture?,4.0,,"You love Indian food like we do? Like to experience something new? Like to see (really) an Indian community gathered in such a concentrated spot? Are fine with traditions, habits, flavors and tastes? Go there, see crowded places, have amazing food in the 'banana leaf', enjoy strolling around and have a wonderful time until late after darkness. It was worth it for us. Highly recommended!"
,,Love the Indian food and buy gold,5.0,,This is another place you must visit when in Singapore. It's an illustration of Singapore's ethnic diversity. We love Indian food so a great place to explore and test the aromatic flavors.
,,too crowded,3.0,,"When we went we were the traditional feast . people sitting in the streets. Empty spaces were covered with people. They were praying in the temple. a very, very crowded. Beware of visiting Mustafa center . There are too many people. absolutely not possible to enter and exit."
,,well worth the travel,4.0,,What we loved about Singapore was the cosmopolitan and diverse nature of the city. It was nice to see many different cultures living together. the food in little india was worth the travel to go there and the little shops were interesting and had some great unique items
,,Shabby,2.0,,This is very much the run-down element of Singapore. Even the temples looked so-so and unattended. Architecturally not that impressive. did not find it that appealing and wished had visited something else in my time there
,,Literally 'little india',3.0,,Totally different from the city centre of Singapore. No big buildings or skyscrapers just little shops and beautiful buildings. If you're in Singapore for a few days or longer. Go visit!
,,visit very quickly and move on,3.0,,"little India is dirty and very run down compared to the rest on Singapore, this is worth a look but quickly there are better places to see. gold is charged by the gram rather that a total price."
,,Look before you buy,4.0,,"There were a many shops, some had the same products for sale at various prices. The shoe shop we visited and bought some shoes the lady was so polite and efficient."
,,photo walk in little india,4.0,,"bustling place of culture - the sounds, the colors & the aroma of India. Visit to sample Indian food, fashion & buy souvenirs. There are a couple of temples in this area you can visit. Nice place to take photos."
,,Little India outside India,4.0,,"Felt really a home away from home. The market was really accessible within few feet. As always felt bad for being a Vegetarian since had lot more options for Non-Vegetarians. Do try out the Mustafa mall.

I stayed for 2 days within Little India, in Hotel 81 Dickson. Atleast an overnight stay here in Little India will give you an all round experience.

Only one thing that may not appeal to few is missing the typical Singapore shopping mall feel."
,,a little piece of india,5.0,,"Great place to have a look around for Indian souveniers. Busy and bustling, some good shopping to be had"
,,Feel for An Indian experience,5.0,,"The feel of being in India . If you crave for a good , inexpensive South Indian meal , shopping , temples - this is the place for you . The Most famous ""Mustafa "" shopping mall is situated here . A must visit place ."
,,Markets and foodie fun,4.0,,Markets abound and plenty of great eats to choose from. Great atmosphere - especially at festival time! Worth a look.
,,Little India in Singapore,4.0,,"As the name of the place suggests, it is a replica of India in Singapore. For an Indian it is a place where he will forget missing India.

This area has several Indian shops where you can get all & everything that one can get in India. The famous shopping store MUSTAFA is also located in Little India where you can get almost everything for your daily needs from a needle to grocery to vegetables to all types of electronics to medicinal equipment to clothes to jewelry & almost all that you want. There are also several other shops & malls in this area to go shopping & eating.

This place also houses lots & lots of Indian restaurants with many different varieties with new shop coming up constantly bringing more & more choices."
,,So-so,3.0,,"I am quite familiar with Indian culture, particularly Tamil, but this location did not strike me as appealing. It was dirty and the food wasn't that good, though, I have to admit I saw some authentic dishes that may have tasted better than what I trialed.

Keep this at the bottom of your list for when you run out of things to do."
,,In Contrast to the Singaporean Malls...,3.0,,Little India is easy to get to via the MRT. To enjoy Little India you need to have a sense of adventure and exploration and be prepared for an absence of the usual Singapore shopping mall experience. Whilst there are no doubt treasures to be found here you may not discover them without first doing some prep walk. Suggest you follow one of the recommended walking tours and if you know a local ask for recommendations for eating out..
,,Singapore's LITTLE INDIA is the genuine article!,5.0,,Explore for as short or long as you want in the wonderful clean conditions of the easily accessible Little India district. Shop or just look around!
,,Nice place,4.0,,Very nice place I really appreciate the indian foods most of all the sweet cakes... I have also done henna on my hand It's just like visiting india and the name fits it well :)
,,Always busy .,5.0,,"Very busy place , lots of different Indian communities here , awesome food and good shopping . The Mosque there is also of interest and was designed by an Irishman!"
,,A little bit of India in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore's Little India is one of the 'do not miss' places in the city. Little India is a Tamil Nadu in miniature. Here you will see Indian fabric shops, food shops galore and see flower garlands being made on street stalls. All the sights and smells you would expect should you be in India!"
,,Old school and great bargains,4.0,,"I come here often when in Singapore. Mustafa Center is manic, but they have absolutely everything under the sun. I also enjoy the traditional shops on the main road."
,,I love this area.,4.0,,"There are many Indian food restaurants in this area. I have favorite one near Mustafa, this restaurant serves the best Indian tea I ever taste in Singapore and their roti is also delicious. Looking for the restaurant near Mustafa, the one that located at first floor and has no wall."
,,Jalan Besar is a hidden gem!,5.0,,"This part of town is definitely Singapore‚Äôs next hotspot! Cool cafes hidden in between hardware shops and old-school food options at various streets, this is where you hang out with the cool kids."
,,Truly Little India,5.0,,"Been from India and having heard about the cleanliness of Singapore, we least expected Little India of Singapore to be just like India. Crowded streets, crowded markets, typical indian eataries and all. We went on Diwali night and it was very well lit and decorated"
,,"Little India, Singapore",4.0,,"We, the vegetarian North Indians, always crave for good food while visiting abroad. Hotel Supreme gave good healthy heavy breakfast but stomach doesn't satiate. We searched for good vege food. When we see names such as ' vege chicken' etc., the Restaurant asked us not to get confused for the nomenclature. The food is vegetarian. In almost each and every town of Malaysia also there was a 'Little India'. We can have a glimpse of our country there. Same is the case with 'Chinatown'."
,,Don't bother,3.0,,"Caught a taxi to Mustafa Shopping Mall. Spent about 1 hour looking around. No bargains, average shopping, nothing all that appealing. Hoped into another cab and headed to China Town."
,,Good place to revisit Indian Culture & restaurants,3.0,,"This is a good place to explore Indian culture and Cuisine as it is thronged by hundreds of Indian restaurants and most of them are pure vegetarians which is an added advantage.
It is easily approachable by SMRT from all across Singapore and it boasts of various temples and mosque built in 18th century. We visited this place everyday for dinner :) as it has n number of restaurants serving veggie food at affordable prices.
There is not much to explore in this part except and can be visited in just 1-2 hours maximum.
Best time to visit is evening or night as shops and restaurants are open till late ."
,,It's OK,3.0,,I expected a little bit more... it's nice to walk around but if you are shirt in time you can skip this part of Songapore
,,Realy a littile india,4.0,,"Great place for the Indian and must visited place in Singapore. great indian market, every small thing is available at this place. and the restaurants was really good"
,,It appeals to some people,2.0,,"Frankly, not for me. It is a part of Singapore that is very quaint, very authentic, but very crowded. There are a few interesting food places and a very large department store, catering mainly for locals but offering good value also to tourists."
,,"Literally ""little"" India",2.0,,"We found Little India a bit run down, the shops shabby. Some shop owners were more intent on eating at their counters than helping with our enquiries."
,,One of the things you need to cross off your list.,2.0,,"I guess this is one of the things you ought to do in Singapore, but frankly it's a bit disappointing. The area is a bit shabby and ordinary. As you'd expect there are lots of Indian restaurants which seemed to be predominantly vegetarian, and an assortment of general stores and drapery. The big draw card is the Hindu Temple which is as garish as you would expect. But overall for me it felt a bit lacking in character."
,,Patronize by all Indians..!!,4.0,,"Once abroad you feel home sick,and if given a chance you go to a place where you meet Indians and eat some Indian food you feel at home and this is what Little India is all about,and it is patronize by most of the Indians visiting Singapore."
,,Little India,5.0,,I think anyone visiting Singapore should visit here I loved walking down the street going into the shops enjoying the people coming to the sites amazing
,,Cheap Place in Singapore ==> Little India,5.0,,"First of all, I was in Singapore for 2 days therefore, I was having trouble finding little India though people might say it is easy, I wasn't taking train or taxi instead I think you should just use Hop in Hop off bus for you commute which was great.

Somehow I managed to reach a place called Mustafa Center though I just bought a I LOVE SINGAPORE t shirt, I think this is the one of the cheapest place in Singapore. I did go have Indian food which was fabulous. It was S$6 approx ¬£2.5."
,,Too many people,3.0,,"The little India is dominated by Indian population. There are huge crowds on Saturday and Sunday. It is difficult to walk on the street. Most people were pretty rude and pushing and shoving in Serangoon Road. The Mustafa Mall is overflowing. The Citi Mall is overflowing. There are numerous Indian eateries like Komala Vilas , Saravana Bhavan, Anand Bhavan and Kailash Parbat etc. There is a Little India Metro Station and Farrer Park Station in Little a India. If you need EZLink card you can get only in Farrer . Park. There is A Kali Amman Temple in Serangoon Road and Perumal Mandir in Perumal Road which will fascinate the Indian traveller. There are branches of State Bank of India if you need to use ATM. The ICICI branch did not have ATM. Better to go to Little India on week days. I felt a lot if the people in a Little India on weekends were just time passing and hanging around. The ParkRoyal Hotel is in Little India."
,,Indian Paradise in Singapore,4.0,,Little India is a place which gives you shock and pride together. It is place where you get all Indian food items and also option to visit one of the temples.
,,"A place to soak up some bollywood music, indian food & dressing",4.0,,"My most recommended place for overseas friends. Here, the indian food are inexpensive and aplenty. A gift of friends ? How about indian style of saree (lady's dressing) for about $10up."
,,Little India - Truly India,4.0,,"What else can I say about this place ... I found my India back in this area. The roads, people, shops, crowd etc felt as if I'm in India. We get everything that we get in India in this place. We can also see people wearing Indian wear and speaking in Indian languages."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,Been a couple times over the years always very intersting with lots to see including the temples and shops a real place worth visiting
,,Indian - rather South Indian home away from home,4.0,,"It was so nice to visit Little India- it really feels like one of the streets and shops in South India - blaring South Indian movie songs , people, typical mogra flowers and garlands reminded me of being in Chennai- only a whole lot cleaner.
I also came across a Nalli silk saree store.
A very nice location if you wish to enjoy home style or better south Indian meals.
There are a number of goldsmiths lining the streets and most of them are selling 22k gold jewellery.
That's what makes Little India sparkle some more. After all what is India / South India without Gold :)"
,,""" Good Food""",4.0,,"the only good thing there was a good Indian food. We stop a same restaurant an have chicken curry with rice naan bread and a delicious mango juice. Many souvenirs stores . We went to a Mustafa Centre store,there is a lots of things to buy. The bad thing there is , they play a loud music on the streets,is hard to listen anything. The houses they are very colorful on the streets.,Not far is the Chinatown.wich is nice too."
,,Little India in Singapore,5.0,,"Feel like in India in Singapore Fully crowded market , lots of people hanging around on roads , loud music & enchanting mantras outside temple"
,,"Good for food, and easy transportation",3.0,,This place in the center of Singapore. Not a very good place for visit. But asian foods are available at low cost at this place. Also transportation for attractions is abailable here.
,,Lovely atmosphere and food,4.0,,"Worth a visit to see many souvenir shops and very tasty restaurants. Many rave about Mustafa Centre - this is a huge huge department store selling everything but we did not find it mega cheap and not really worth the visit. The walk around is pleasant and we found a wonderful restaurant called 'Khansama' at 166 Serangoon Road. We chose as they had an upstairs air conditioned posh seating area. However we were very pleasantly surprised that the food was terrific and being from India, I know my Indian food - another added bonus was that our meal was cheaper than the UK too at less than S$20 for a main plus a drink!"
,,not bad,3.0,,"looks like india- food people and stoers. more cheaper tan other places in singapore. there are some resturants serves good food. but in the other hand lots of resturants arnt clean. A Must go attraction when in Little India, is the famous Mustafa Centre"

,,Indian Food lovers Delight,5.0,,There are many vegetarian restaurants here which have food which is better in quality and taste than what you may get in most places in India!Also has Mustafa the one stop shop for everything you wish to buy .
,,India indeed...,5.0,,"True you feel like you are in India when you visit this area in Singapore. Nothing like Singapore in fact which has the name of a clean city..here they forgot the clean part. A big road with all shops where you can hustle and bargain...fake things too. The side Streets are dirty, food on the Streets, garbage,...There are some Indian restaurants but never tried, some cheap hotels too,...and ofcourse Mustafas centre..a big warehouse where you can buy everything you are looking for.. 7 days on 7, 24hrs on 24.. Worth a visit only to experience it.."
,,Name Says it all,5.0,,"Place is almost replicates India, the place is full of shops and restaurants offering India cuisine with variety of dishes for the taste buds and good place to explore Indian food!, the most popular attraction of this place is Mustaffa center for shopping which sells almost every other thing available to sell from branded Chocolates to cell phones. And you will also find couple of temples and if you happen to someone who enjoys seeing the traditional process of worship then must visit the temples in the evening."
,,Dirty,2.0,,"This is the dirty side of Singapore...street hawkers, lots of trash n garbage on the streets with people sitting on the floor and having their food. Not a highlight for me..."
,,Feel like you are in India!,4.0,,"I have not yet been to India, but from what I know, Little India feels like you are in India. We were there on a Sunday, which is a very busy day as the locals are usually all off on this day. Had very good indian food too. Great to see the locals going about their usual shopping etc. Very cultural place.

Comments/tips: This place can get very crowded so wear cool comfy clothes and shoes. Try the local food shops, very delicious."
,,A good place for street food and lots of people,4.0,,"Evenings are not a bore when going around Little India - this was not far from our hotel the Park Royal on Kitchner Road.

Lots of street food places - very tasty food - soft crabs, chappattis, currys etc. Two can eat well for about ¬£5 - ¬£6. Not a fly or insect in sight. You will never get a bad stomach - take this from someone whose stomach is extra sensitive

Great place"
,,Another world in 5 minutes.....,4.0,,Travelled with my 14yo son and loved roaming the streets at night after dinner at Banana Leaf on Race Course Road. Felt safe and thoroughly enjoyed the colours and smells of the food being prepared in the Hawkers Markets. People were lovely and friendly. Worth a visit.
,,Resembles India,3.0,,"Name of this place truly reflects India. It is a crowded place. There are lot of Indian restaurants & shops. Area is not dirty, as some earlier reviews suggest. It is well connected by MRT. If you are looking for comparatively cheaper options, without loosing quality of stay, you may stay in any good quality hotel, located in this area. Hotel Park Royal, located near this area, is one such example. Famous Mustafa Center is located in this area & is very famous for all types of shopping."
,,India with a touch of Singapore,5.0,,"A rather intriguing experience, you cross a line and suddenly you are in another, totally different country. The houses, the temples, the restaurants, the food, the shops, the music in the street and most of all, the people, their looks, clothes and language. It is totally as being in an Indian city, but with the near normal Singaporean standard of cleanness."
,,Dirty ....,1.0,,"I went here with my grandmother and mother , the minute we stepped out of the taxi I was disappointed with how dirty it was compared to the rest of Singapore . We also felt very uncomfortable and intimidated as the people were rude. I was really disappointed and headed straight for the train to get out of there."
,,Interesting bargains,4.0,,We went there initially to buy Indian saris but we got more than we expected. There's the authentic chaos that you would expect Indian settlements but it affords an interesting slice of life of a culture juxtaposed into the Singapore. You may dare to bargain when shopping and do try one of the local restaurants for Indian food but request something with less chilies. Good for an afternoon trip.
,,Okay if you want cheap items that wont last too long.,2.0,,"Was disappointing. Everything was super cheap for sure, but also super cheap quality. If you've got a lot of time in Singapore, then i'd recommend it. but if you're pushed for time, skip it, there's better things to do like eating black pepper crab!"
,,Dont waste your time,2.0,,"You will go to this place maybe for the Indian food, else just avoid going there. You may find this place even worse than India forget about Singapore"
,,A worthwhile experience if you have not been to somewhere similar....,3.0,,"The familiar aromas of various Indian spices attracts your immediate attention as you walked down the many shops selling spices.

As you proceed further down the road & lanes; you see more shops selling sarees, various Indian food, jewelleries, accessories, etc.

It is an interesting & worthwhile experience to come here if you have not been to similar places like this elsewhere.

A Must go attraction when in Little India, is the famous Mustafa Centre. This is a huge departmental store , with a big supermarket to match. Many products here are pretty unique and can only be found here. Many locals & foreigners alike love this place.

Another place worth going is the Tekka Market & Food Centre. Here you can try various local food at reasonable prices. And experience a wet market too.

Avoid coming here on Sundays as the whole place is very very crowded. Sunday is when thousands of foreign workers spend their off-day here."
,,Colourful little corner of Singapore,5.0,,"This kitch little corner of Singapore is bright and colourful, is bustling with activity, everything from Tourist wandering about, locals going about thier day shopping and working, even mid week weddings at the local temples. It is here you will find the famous Mustaffa Centre which quite litterally has everything you could think of in it and is a 24hr shopping mecca. Its actually quite impressive really! You are sure to find a bargain here.
If its authentic indian food your after you will not be dissapointed!"
,,Like being in India,4.0,,"Really enjoyed Little India. The sights, sounds and smells would have you believe you really were in India. Ate some really good food in the hawkers centre which was some of the cheapest food of our trip. Got a couple of bargains too to bring home as gifts."
,,BEST FOR FOODIES AND SHOPPERS,4.0,,"As name says makes more comfortable to Indian tourist, Many Food choices from every category (South Indian, Jain's , Vegetarians, non vegetarians etc....) more special is MUSTAFA shopping paradise for indian's, everything they need on one stop shop"
,,Crowded - you can miss this part.,2.0,,"Very Crowded place. The only good thing about this place is it has Indian hotel foods available by dozens. For pure vegetarians - one can expect good food here. Otherwise this place is extremely crowded.

A lot of people from India and Bangladesh assemble here and make it a meeting point. Otherwise this place doesn't have anything to offer.

A lot to be desired of this place."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Sound very interesting, but has been over run by large buildings, the markets aren't cheap but never the less interesting, catch the hop on hop off bus there and you will enjoy the ride and walking around the safe streets of Little India"
,,give it a miss !,2.0,,its a busy street which resembles any Indian village market .. lots of restaurants in the area .. you can skip this place without regret as visiting it will surely be regretting :)
,,A vibrant place which gives a preview of South India,5.0,,"Here you get a Hodge podge of Indian culture,Food and music. The food in small restaurant are cheap and tasty. You could get almost anything South Indian be it food, clothing or artifacts. Nowhere else in southeast Asia is more connected to India than Singapore. You could even get fresh flowers and vegetable from India. Walk into any of the clothing stores or restaurants or even grocers and experience mini India hence Little India."
,,Nothing worth to come,2.0,,I don't think little Indian is a great place to visit. It has nothing to buy. I only saw the souvenir with bad quality but the price is higher than other place.
,,Vibrant,4.0,,"It's quite unique atmosphere here as if you were in India, but more organized. here you could find range of shops, selling fruits, electronics, till jewelry. thinking about tasting south asian food street? you come to the right place"
,,Not Much there....,3.0,,"Wasn‚Äôt too impressed with Little India. Didn‚Äôt have much there. The smell of curry whilst walking around was nice but it was too hot and early in the day to sample one of the restaurants, plus it didn‚Äôt seem like the most hygienic area to eat in.."
,,Waste of time,3.0,,I went there on 8th June 2015. Metro station is very near. Many Indian restaurants. But no one is good enough. Nothing interesting there.
,,Crowded,5.0,,Truly it is little India...you will get every indian food and spices there...though very crowded in weekends..
,,Dirty and overcrowded,2.0,,"I was told I had to experience it and make my own mind up, and I'm quite glad I did because it made me realise that if that is a very small, sanitised version of downtown India, I am not interested in visiting the real thing any time soon! As I do whenever I visit somewhere new I went wandering without sticking to a map too much to explore a little, but I just found myself stuck in a maze of filthy alleyways and stepping over cockroaches outside tiny food stalls, it wasn't pleasant. I felt stared at no matter which part of the area I was in and although there was some novelty about the Mustafa Centre, I didn't feel at all like it was worth the rest of the experience."
,,Crowded...,3.0,,You can feel you are in different place in Singapore as soon as you enter this area. Vegetable shops on footroad makes it messy sometimes. You can visit Mustafa for some cheap shopping. There are lot of Indian food options and if you are vegetarian then you'll love it.
,,Multitude of Indians - Yet peaceful and Great for Foodies,5.0,,"This is the ""most"" happening place in whole of singapore... literally!
The Mustafa Centre Shopping mall is open 24/7 and is almost full all the time, hence the whole place is live easily upto 2 in night! Many good Resturants are open upto 1 AM or even later and so you can fill up your stomach easily. Many good budget Hotels here to stay but I suggest you check with them the basic amenities like Refridgerator, Kettle and Wifi as its not a standard in many of them here.

Good place to get your mobile/Data plan recharged anytime in the night too, nice helpful people. It has Moneygram and Western Union both so will make it easy to send/recieve money incase you need.

Clothing and Jewellery shops are good if you are interested, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables (mostly Indian) are available.

Little India is a little oddly located from attractions, not to say far but the MRT stations of Little India and Farrer Park are on the purple line (harbour front), so you will need to interchange 2-3 times to get to major roads. For Eg: Bugis market is almost walking distance from Little India, yet the via MRT its a big loop including Chinatown interchange. To get to the east-west green line you need to interchange at outram park station which is quite a walk within the MRT station. The Other side of Little india (Serangon Road) has farrer park station which also needs quite a walk.

Sundays can be quite ""chaotic"" as hurds of Indian/Bangladeshi Construction workers and Labour workers meet across to have a drink and chat with their friends. You will see many small hawker stalls selling sim cards, fruits and other small things and hundreds of people relaxing on the open grounds. so mind you Sunday here and plan well. It is still very safe and controlled.

All an all good Stay here, you won't regret if you like lively, peppy environment and love to shop around. Would stay again if I visit Singapore."
,,wow,4.0,,"Little India is totally different from the rest of Singapore, you can experience a little of Indian culture hear"
,,Unique part of singapire,3.0,,There is a lot of history in this part of Singapore which you can still see with the crowd that gathers in this area. Has a lot of potential to attract tourists but felt like it needed more guidance for visitors
,,Shopping Area,4.0,,"Cultural variation is obvious, Indian culture, shops, hotels with Indian foods and jewelry shops are available in Little India."
,,messy and congested,3.0,,"Did some shopping at Mustafas which had loads of stuff, some of average quality and some a bit better. Did not feel too safe walking outdoors amidst a sea of people. Difficult to get taxis back."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"We caught the MRT to Little India and wondered through the streets at random just having a look and ended up at the Mustafa Centre. This is a real eye opener, you can get anything you want here. Left my swim goggles at home and was able to buy a pair here with my optic prescription (gotta love that). We then got the MRT back from Farrer Park which is just across the road"
,,Interesting Little India,3.0,,I loved walking through the markets and seeing so many beautiful & unique articles. I had a henna painted on my hand and bought 2 beautiful shawls. One for winter & one for summer. We also bought some Indian snacks. Wonderful array of sweets.
,,If this is what India is like - I'll take this experience as a warning!,1.0,,"I went here with 2 girl friends - it does not feel like anywhere else in Singapore. Went there via taxi to the shopping centre. Walk through the crowd, smelly. It rained so everyone crowded inside the shopping centre even more. Went across the road and had some street food, it was great but everyone just kept staring to the girls. Left immediately."
,,julab gamun for dessert,5.0,,"this area is really interesting if you're the curious type of other people's culture. From their lilting language to their clothes to their food, this is quite an eye-popping experience for me..."
,,Interesting and Exciting.,4.0,,"This place is like a visit to a town in India except that it clean and orderly. Great atmosphere and food. A short subway ride away from Orchard Road and Clarke Quay, Little India is a place to get a bargain and buy souvenirs as they are so cheap. In addition it is also a place to get a cheap meal and enjoy a different Singapore."
,,A trail of Indian culture,5.0,,"Little India - as the name indicates, this area is full of Indians, specially from Southern part of India. The area is full of variety of shopping malls and food gaints offering Indian food. Its a must visit to get mostly low cost or average priced, yet good quality items."
,,A nice walk through Little India,4.0,,"We enjoyed walking thru the colorful sights, sounds and smells of Little India. It was a little different than waling through Chinatown, we didn't feel as secure. But the little shops and wonderful shopkeepers made it a bit of fun. Be sure to see the Temple and the Mustafa shopping building. Avoid Sundays, it's packed.
Easy to get to from MRT"
,,Colorful and completly diffrent than the other parts of the city,3.0,,"Really original place, a piece of India. My recommendation - go to Mustafa Centre and stroll among thousands of malls with enormous of different products (including original Indian products) and visit some local restaurant to enjoy an Indian cuisine. At this region you can see a lot of very original (I mean for a European at least) dressed people which adds some positive and spirit to this colourful streets."
,,Interesting,3.0,,Our trip here was in the hop on hop off SIA bus we walked around and found some interesting things but it was a bit of a let down the area felt strange and not welcoming.
,,A should do!,4.0,,"Easy to get to on the MRT and as we ascended the escalator from the station we could smell the spices! Truly a cultural experience with the museum, the architecture, the shopping, the resturants, the food halls; everything! People here were very friendly and we loved wandering about. The wet market with the fish & meat, fresh vegetables and spices was truly amazing. Very authentic food and dining in the food hall. If you like the food tell them, they truly appreciate it when you do!"
,,unimpressed...,2.0,,Its like its not in singapore...its not what I expected after coming from the Chinatown that same day.
,,Little India in Singapore,4.0,,"The title says it all

A definite place to see the cultural diversity of Singapore. Can be easily accessed by MRT. The main road that runs through Little India is Serangoon Rd. There are many Indian restaurants and Indian clothing shops.
There are two temples located on Serangoon Rd.

The famous Mustafa centre is also located on Serangoon Rd Little India. However it is closer to Ferrer Park MRT station."
,,A busy and thriving community,4.0,,"Little India is a mix of old and modern that combine well to make a vibrant and thriving community. From the old Hindu temples, the modern shopping centres, the amazing Mustafa Centre, the numerous accommodation houses there is much to interest the tourist. There are two MRT stations and numerous public buses servicing the area (a number of the costly tourist buses also service the area - being a budget traveller I used the MRT as it cost less than $2 to travel from China Town). I found a number of tourist maps do not list all the tourist sites of the area, partly I feel due to the commercial considerations of the companies that finance their production. A little prior research will help, but my husband and I enjoyed walking a few of the back streets to find a few hidden treasures. The area is well worth a visit."
,,Nothing to interest us,2.0,,"We were quite disappointed, after visiting China Town we were expectant of a pleasant experience and nice good instead we were left wondering why we'd bothered. We couldn't find somewhere we would eat as everywhere looked unhygienic and I can assure you we usually try the local delights of any area we visit! Didn't find anything of interest to us I'm afraid."
,,An India far from India,5.0,,"If you are an Indian or looking for Indian cuisine in Singapore, this is the place to come for. I visited Singapore in Aug 2011 and again in Sept 2013 and stayed in Park Royal Hotel in Kitchener Road on both occasion. Close to this is a Big Shopping Complex - Mustafa. This shopping complex is open round the clock and from what I learnt from local Singaporeans, this is where you get best bargain in Singapore. There are quiet a few Indian Restaurant as well, serving great Indian food.

I recommend any Indian who is visiting Singapore for Business or leisure to stay in this area, as there are lot of option for Food, Shopping. The place is also well connected by subway and buses. So a Big Thumbs Up for this place...!!!!"
,,Good food,4.0,,Good food in little India and one of the tour stops on the airport's free Singapore tour. A nice area to check out while in the city to experience some of Singapore's ethnic makeup and sample the delicious cuisine!
,,sense sensation,4.0,,"the first thing that hits you when in the area is the overwhelming wonderful smells, of all the spices, and your eyes are dazzled by the colour array, shops are plentiful, are many bargains to be had, always try a little bartering, it adds to the fun, the array of choices of food within the large food hall is amazing, and so reasonable
little india is a must see"
,,Little India is really India,4.0,,"If you are Indian. I think this is the place you will connect mentally. You can find temple, Indian food joints, Indian snacks, There are many hotels in this area. And most of the hotels serves Indian breakfast. Also Mustafa market is nearby. You can hang around and shop."
,,Shopping & Food,5.0,,"Browse the many shops for beautiful shawls or material, while enjoying the atmosphere and aromas. Try something different to eat a Murtabak, you won't be sorry."
,,Great Atmosphere,5.0,,"Little India is my favorite neighborhood in Singapore. It is colorful and beautiful, especially at night when all shops and restaurants are lit up.
Lots of interesting shops with Indian gold, sparkling clothes and spices. Must see in Little India is Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, Mustafa Centre and Komala Villas for a delicious food."
,,A melting pot ...,4.0,,I have visited Singapore so many times but it's my first time to explore Little India. I was really amaze at how people converge and spend time in a crowded eatery enjoying all that is set before them. Young and old alike were there enjoying to the hilt . Little India is a cultural spectacle one should not miss!
,,India in Singapore,4.0,,"This place is just like a india, once you are in little india you dont feel at all away from home, all type of indian food from north to south you can eat out.. masala tea like india and what more you have mustafa market to shop with every thing availble in the market. The street shopping is not much but good to explore in little india..Must go if you are in singapore"
,,Amazing Food,4.0,,Little India is a great area of Singapore with a huge melting pot if people and cultures. Take a stroll down one of the streets to grab a bargain in the various shops or taste the amazing cuisine on offer at every street corner. Some of the fruit stalls sell exotics delights including the infamous Red Banana. There is also a nice temple on the Northern side that's worth a visit.
,,Good place to have indian food in Singapore,4.0,,"Home away from home...one felt like in any other indian city when in Little India Singapore...But compared to other parts of Singapore , Little India is not that squeaky clean . The many restaurants that dot Little India serve excellent indian food...Komals, Saravana Bhavan ,Komala Vilas stand out. Shopping at midnight in Musthafa Centre is a great experience..But never visit the place on Saturdays and Sundays...the mass and sea of humanity really frightens...its the get together day for the labourers...Indian's..Bangladeshis...Pakis all assemble in the all available places making it impossible to walk...it will be a harrowing experience even by standards of Indian Cities"
,,A touch of India,3.0,,"As an Australian expat in Singapore this is where I come to get my prints framed or to go to the wet market at the Tekka Centre. A little enclave in Singapore dedicated to India. If you are a tourist, then this is a nice morning out. Lots of restaurant along Racecourse Road, or eat at the hawker stalls in the Tekka Centre."
,,Yes it is 'Little India',3.0,,"If you are from India, this place would make you feel like you are back home. Anyways, for me it was nothing very special, as I traveled all way long from India only so the 'little India' was ok for me. Yes, the street lighting is really different and for gold lovers, here are some very good shops."
,,"Little India , Singapore",3.0,,Interesting area of Singapore - good for a walk around. Don't miss a wander through Mustafa's Department store. Easy to get to the area with the MRT stations at one end of Serangoon Rd and Farrer Pk station at the other end.
,,Love Indians,3.0,,You can really feel like you are in India. Foods are great as well as SG Tamils..:) You can buy gold jewelries here and other Indian stuff..:) And don't forget to visit some temples..:)
,,Feels like India,4.0,,A must do area when visiting Singapore! I could not get over the amount of Gold Jewellery shops there were! A very colourful area....
,,Love little India,4.0,,There's some great vegetarian restaurants here and other great Indian food restaurants. A cool market and a fabulous temple.i love taking a walk around here.
,,Little India,3.0,,"The Little India is a place in Singapore which reflects the Indian culture. It is a market selling different goods relating to the india (country). Most of the staff working in"" little India"" are also Indians. You can say you are standing in an indian bazar like in Delhi city. The sweets and jewelry present there are proper Indians taste and style. I can't add my photo due to technical reason, I tried but failed"
,,Awkward but great food,3.0,,I have not been to India however I love Indian food. In this area you are spoilt for choice with both northern and southern cuisine. If you are expecting a bustling marketplace you will be disappointed. The area does seen a little contrived where perhaps they are trying to create a tourist spot out of a local ethnic community and other than local restaurants there really isn't much to see
,,Great place to visit and shop,4.0,,"Excellent old architecture, some good stalls and lots of food choices. Train and lots of buses, so it's easy to get to. I loved walking around checking out the shop houses and the interesting little bits of adornment added to the architecture, like a group of horses on top of a portico or Buddhas, etc. The colour the shutters are painted and the overall beauty of the buildings. I can imagine that market/shop owners get a little frustrated with tourists and maybe they have a high incidence of shoplifting, but I felt that sometimes I could not browse in peace as I would have a shop assistant watching my every move and sometimes looking on disapprovingly. Sometimes when asking a price it seemed an imposition. I'm the sort of person who likes to buy things when travelling, but I also won't put up with rudeness as I'm neither a thief or someone who unreasonably argues over price. I am friendly and respectful but that doesn't seem to matter to some retailers in Little India. Hence I didn't buy much there as I would rather spend money somewhere where I'm comfortable browsing and asking questions. The Mustafa Centre department store was another matter. I went there with a friend the first time and we were like kids in a candy store. Floors and floors of the usual, the unusual and the just plain weird. You can shop there 24/7 and I think there are two stores in Little India. There was an amazing array of groceries too, things we don't see in Australia, we wanted to buy so much but had to be realistic (unfortunately). After hours spent oooohing an aaaahing over everything from vitamins to silver Buddhas, we went to the rooftop Indian restaurant and ate with the soothing sound of running water with coloured lights and the cool breeze of night. We really liked the food there, the ambience, the view and the service. We were so full when we left that we couldn't even look at the variety of cakes and other goodies that were available to purchase inside. I would have given the whole experience five stars but for the rudeness of some of the shopkeepers. Mustafa Centre is definitely worth a visit though and that earns five stars on its own for me for the entire experience."
,,Well worth a walk around,4.0,,We spent a couple of hours walking arojnd little india following the Lonely Planet route. Well worth it. The wet market was an incredible experience and we were made so welcome by a volunteer guide at the Mosque. Given a robe to wear to - very useful. Lots a sights sounds and smells.
,,Didn't like it,1.0,,"I've read other reviews and I feel as though I went to a different place. Little India is one long road full of shops and places to eat. It looked a bit down trodden , poverised , dirty and smelt aweful . Other than that people were nice but it I wasn't impressed and wouldn't really recommend it . Not sure it represents Indian or Indians if I'm honest...."
,,Amazing you would not believe you are in Singapore,5.0,,"Does not resemble the singapour you see in the marketing material. Great place for food especially the so called street food, prices can be ridiculously cheap with really good quality. A must visit to see the real singapore"
,,INDIA IN SINGAPORE,4.0,,Ideal place for gifts and indian food. Street is full of indian temples restaurants gift shops. There is no place here for bargaining. prices are fixed and are low than supermarkets like mustafa. Best take a walk on the road observe each shop and then decide to buy. we bought handbags T.shirts footwear keychains and merlion minatures. Try serangoon road for the main shopping hub. Very near to little india metro. Go to mustafa if u plan to buy candy perfumes.
,,Feel at Home,4.0,,"After spending 4 days at high end locales of Singapore, we took a bus to little India for the final day shopping. We walked down Sarangoon Road and thereafter moved into the lane leading to Mustafa's. A visit to Little India is a must for every Indian Tourist for best deals.

Little India is a place where you will find several South Indian Temples and Churches. You can also eat very authentic south Indian Restaurants.

At Mustafas we picked up nick-knacks, good quality nail cutters, chocolates - especially the green tea chocolates, the Sri Lankan Camomile Tea some eats for the stay at Changi Airport before the late evening flight.

I have been visiting Mustafas since 1985 and always for that their prices are the lowest in Singapore."
,,Indian culture,3.0,,"Good place to come for a little Indian culture, lots of Indian shops and places to eat, you do feel like you are in little india here. Worth a visit."
,,Needs another visit,4.0,,"We stopped off in Little India for a 20 minute visit during a half day tour. We will be back and will visit for a lot longer. We were well taken with the very large food court that will need a visit to have an authentic lunch!! I was taken with the pawn shops and all their gold, not that I can afford to buy but can enjoy seeing what is on offer!! The market shopkeepers were a little more pushy than in Chinatown but were not ""over the top"" as they generally accepted the ""No, thank you"""
,,A small sight of India...,4.0,,"A must visit while in Singapore ,Little India has a lively atmosphere ,there are loads of interesting shops selling beautiful carpets ,pashminas ,material and lots lots more stop for a while and look up at the lovely houses in different colours and shutters, there are lots of places to photograph even if you just stroll down this area you can get the feel of the exotic,well worth a visit"
,,Soak up the atmosphere,4.0,,"Great for a walk around, see the sights etc. We went for breakfast here and it was great. We ate with the locals - did get a few funny looks at first but then a few people helped us with what to choose and were really friendly! Great experience."
,,Missing Home at Singapore..Come to Little India,4.0,,"Wow...Singapore is so clean, so disciplined, no police around. Feeling different nah.Dont worry, just visit Little India, people breaking traffic rules, roads full of police.Feels India"
,,Not for me,1.0,,"I felt incredibly uncomfortable in little India. This was not somewhere I felt safe. I am short and look slightly Asian (especially with my holiday tan) and I was looked on by the locals with disgust as I was accompanied by my very white husband. To busy, to smelly, just wanted to get out there."
,,must visit :),5.0,,"It's a little locale - very little more than a couple of avenues loaded with Indian merchants, adornments stores and a portion of the best Indian eateries in the district. In any case, the sights, hues and scents are reminiscent of India, yet with all the staid guideline taking after of Singapore... well practically. There's a touch of the turbulent all around in Little India - from the server frantically attempting to stay informed concerning all the benefactors in his occupied eatery, to clients falling over heaps of okra in the shambolic merchants, to the grown-ups taking up living arrangement in the kids' play area, to visit on their telephones in the shade and hindering the youngsters who attempt to have fun.

Little India is by a wide margin the most socially rich place in Singapore.

The must do's in Little India

1. Shop at Mustafa

2. Walk around the different shop houses as yet offering items made with the same art went from eras anytime recently

3. Appreciate an Indian Meal at one of the numerous eateries lining the lanes

I have concocted my own strolling voyage through Little India - here you will discover subtle elements on the most proficient method to GET to Little India and WHAT to eat, essentially a mobile voyage through Little India!"
,,Spices & everything Nice!,5.0,,"One can claim that Singapore is unique with its different ethnicity & cultures. Little India is really very authentic with the small vegetarian restaurants & other shops that sell mostly products from India & of course some from other parts of the world! One can smell the curry, yellow ginger ( tumeric) and other spices when one enters Little India. The people are friendly with ready welcoming smiles & will stop to advise as what best food served in other shops within Little India. There are little make-shift stalls whereby workers will create lovely flower garlands for tourists, or anyone with requests. Besides, it should be a great place to explore not only for locals but for tourists especially. One should find it meaningful."
,,Too short a visit,4.0,,"This was part of my city tour and I think the stop was so short, I didn't get a chance to see most of it. What I did see indicates it's a great spot for shopping and dining."
,,Worth a visit (1/2 day) / Quiet area to stay,4.0,,"I stayed in Little India for 3 nights and found it to be very pleasant.

For day trippers, it's great to see some older buildings and do some shopping! Very nice change to the high rises and has endless shops and markets. Prices comparable to China Town for goods and food.

I found week days quiet, especially in the morning. Most shops not opening until 10.30 so don't get here too early. Not busy like others described. But certainly warm, not much air con round here.

I stayed at Footprints hostel (Perak Strt), shopped mainly in Mustafa Center (2 streets on from Roswell Strt if walking from MRT) and ate more than once at The Countryside Cafe (Dunlop Strt) and Dickinson's (opposite Footprints)

If you're staying here, it is safe. It's very quiet on the evenings at my hostel, I think because there's no public drinking allowed and location of hostel means not many party people stay here. It's also a lot cheaper than other areas, around $60 for 3 nights stay, meals around $16 inc a drink, plenty of 7 Elevens around too.

As a single female traveller that dressed in shorts and knee length skirts I did get stared at a lot and some uninvited male attention but nothing nasty or malicious."
,,Have your waking shoes,4.0,,I really enjoyed visiting this area but boy you better have the right shoes and stamina! Endless streets of shopping and food. Lots of Indian specific items obviously. Fun to explore different cultures!
,,perfect place for spending your money,4.0,,I went there to buy lens for my camera. The price is very cheap. And also visit the Mustafa and bought some items. You can bargain for the price here. It is very good..And they provide storage for luggage at the entrance of the Mustafa
,,Very Crowded,3.0,,"I would suggest driving through to get a feel of the area and to see some of the temples. I am sure there are wonderful places to eat, but the crush on the street was not comfortable."
,,Hot Hot Hot,5.0,,A day in little India under the sun. It was 41 degrees and we walked around to discover the area. Hot hot hot
,,Amazing Bargain Shopping like you were expecting,5.0,,"Little India will change your mind about Singapore bargain shopping for the better. There are so many floors of bargains of all kinds it is hard to describe. I got a pair of sandals here for $34. Everywhere else they were $119. Women, you'll need at least 3 hours if not more. Guys, you've never seen so many torches, gadgets, computers, TVs. I want to go back."
,,Interesting afternoon wander,4.0,,We went for a quick wander and it was well worth it... Bought some interesting souvenirs and our kids were amazed at all the beautiful fabrics for sale in some of the stores...
,,Crowded but great sight and food,2.0,,"The place was crowded, most available open space was occupied. Aside from that, the sight of bold, colourful fabrics and glinting gold jewellery was absolutely marvelous. I have not seen a place more colourful than Little India in Singapore. The smell of spice and tantalising aroma of foods beckoned, and the food definitely worth battling against the crowds and the hot sun."
,,The most overrated 'attraction' in Singapore,2.0,,"Singapore is famous for it's cleanliness and high level of hygiene but those values couldn't be further from the Little India district. Or maybe it's me, maybe it's supposed to mirror the original atmosphere and street scene of Mumbay. Compared to Arab street or Chinatown, or even the notorious Gaylang for that matter, the fact is that Little India is the filthiest part of Singapore. Worth a visit and a valuable experience, of course, but do not expect to find a romantic setting for your dinner. For obvious reasons, we chose to eat somewhere else."
,,Truely Asian subcontinent : Small version :),5.0,,"As the name suggest its truly little India. Or let me be very precise south Bombay: Matunga. You get the essence of south Indian culture throughout the place. Typical grocery shops resembling the murgan shops in south, The food stalls serving pleasant biryani both southern type as well as north India. The streets on little India gives you the feel of busy roads of link road in Mumbai. There are ample of shopping places with Indians taking care of it. Food during late night be to this place. Get souvenirs from Singapore in discounted rates than any where across Singapore. Don't miss the Mustafa shopping center."
,,Very authentic,4.0,,Enjoyed wandering around and looking at the temples and enjoying a yummy curry at a street side cafe. Liked this place better than Chinatown but of course folks in Chinatown a lot friendlier.
,,Overwhelming!...,2.0,,"Perhaps we went here on the wrong day‚Ä¶ Every Indian, Bangladeshi, Nepalnese ‚Äúman‚Äù was out and about. Totally overwhelming and had to get out in 5 mins! The question to ask yourself is what are you here for? To buy gold? Indian goods? Eat Indian food? Then good luck! If not go to KL. It‚Äôs cheaper and less stressful ‚ò∫"
,,Not Little India but Little Indian Sub-Continent!,3.0,,Leave the mall aside and you are wasting you time here if not for food. Only thing you would love about it is a unlimited options for indian food as you might struggle to find good indian food elsewhere in singapore. once done with food just leave and leave quick..
,,Great experience,4.0,,visited Little India and went to the Sri Mariammon Temple on a Sunday and saw the full ceremony - very visual and special. Rest of Little India was OK - many older buildings from old Singapore. Worth a visit perhaps combined with China town
,,Must See,4.0,,"Your in Singapore, why wouldn't you want to go see Little India. It's not one of our favorite places to visit, but you really need to go once. There are many shops and some great eating places, it's like the rest of Singapore, clean, friendly and safe, enjoy."
,,Had the best Indian food here!,4.0,,"Came here with a few friends from the hostel to have an Indian meal (wish I could remember the restuarant, it was a tiny little place, but it was so good!). We had such a good time looking around, and had one of the best meals of Indian food I've ever had. We loved going around to the various enclaves around the city, and this is one that you must go to!"
,,Great Food,5.0,,If you want great food you must visit little India and eat at the hawker centres. The food here is magnificent and really cheap. We ate here many times and very much enjoyed it. A must do! Also a great place to shop.
,,not a positive experience,2.0,,"My experience at Little India was very poor. The area was very busy, it was very dirty and smelly, and hot. Just went to the temple which was close to the MRT station, and quickly went away. Not happy at all."
,,An enriching experience,4.0,,"Not a tourist trap, but a real, thriving neighbourhood. It's colourful and energetic. Lots of nice Indian food. Lots of interesting clothes and other items. Indians make up a large part of Singapore's history and population. You can't really enjoy the Singapore story without experiencing this. It's also low-budget entertainment. There's no specific place or site to recommend. Just get lost in the maze of streets and experience the area as a whole."
,,Loved it.,4.0,,"Little India is not a very large place to look around but it should take you 1-2hrs at least to cover all the side streets. Lots of little shops hidden in the side streets so don't miss them.

I love Indian food and nothing back home tastes anything like the wonderful food we tried in little India.

No need to take one of those tours just jump on the MRT and head to little India (NE7) and your right at the beginning of fresh food markets.

Don't miss this part of Singapore what ever you do."
,,If you need clothes worth a visit,4.0,,It's interesting just walking around this area but we needed some clothes for our visit and there were lots of shops with inexpensive clothes. I ended up keeping some of what I bought and leaving some behind when I returned home but either way it was worth it not to lug lots of clothes from the US.
,,Saw all we needed to to in about 10 mins,2.0,,"We were disappointed in the time we spent here. I know it is important part of the society, but we were not impressed with it all. It was hot, dirty, smelly and crowded. It didn't even feel like were in Singapore. We felt like we were in a totally different city. Maybe there was something we missed, but we would not spend the time to go back. I am probably being liberal giving it 2 stars. Maybe it is getting a bad rap because we went there after spending 8 days in Singapore and we had enjoyed the best part in the previous 8 days. Chinatown was much more impressive than little India."
,,A slice of India in Singapore!!,4.0,,"Little India is an enclave of Indian sights, smells & the legendary Indian disregard for traffic rules. :) Haha.

This little quarter in Singapore is the place to visit if you're looking for Indian food (not at Indian prices - mind you) & a taste of home (esp. if you're from South India).

Here are some of my favorite things to do when I'm here. I'm an Indian working in Singapore...& visit this part of the city only when my cravings for Indian food reach the critical point. :)

1) Walk across to Serangoon Road from Dunlop street that houses the Prince of Wales backpacking hostel which has a great bar & cozy vibe. You can also head to Zsofi Tapas bar for a quiet evening under the stars drinking some wine & having some well meaning Spanish Tapas. A good place to take your guests!

2) Some of my favourite eats in Little India are as follows...

a) Keema Chapathi at Norris Road at Azmi Restaurant. This guy is apparently a legend & his chapathis are rumored to be among the best in SG.

b) Malai Tikka at Khansama. They do some mean kebabs & Dal makhni (if that's your thing) but it's a bit on the pricey side.

c) Nihari, Palak Paneer & Dal at Usman Restaurant. This streetside eatery boasts of rich Pakistani cuisine that's guaranteed to have you coming back for me. The prices are excellent!

d) Ponnuswamy has some great Chicken Chettinad & Neer Dosa. Even Indian Chinese starters like Chicken Lollypop are available here. Don't miss the masala chai at Ponnuswamy.

e) Premaa's has some wonderful Kerala food but not all their dishes are great

f) Bismillah Biryani at Dunlop Street probably makes the best Biryani in Singapore but call before reaching or reach early. He often runs out!

g) Hungry Heroes is a new superhero themed cafe at Buffalo Road. You gotta head here for the Ribs & Burgers & to check out their Superhero displays!

h) Mustard makes a great Shorshe Maach (Mustard curry fish) & their Biryani is fragrant.

i) Head over the Banana Leaf Apolo to try the legendary Fish head curry of Singapore!

j) Tekka Market is an interesting stop for super cheap food in their food centre (as you rub shoulders with always smiling & the super hardworking construction workforce of Singapore) & you can always pick up fresh produce from their basement wet market which I hear is some of the best you'll find in Singapore.

k) Laxmi Narasimhan does the best South Indian thalis in Singapore. It's right outside City Square Mall. If you have someone craving for homely veg food. Look no further. They'll love you & thank you for taking them here. The food is that good.

l) I hear Rangoon Road has a famous Bak But Teh joint - I haven't been there but look it up...

3) If you're looking to stock up on your groceries, prepare to over-shop for groceries at Mustafa Centre. Please note that Mustafa is NOT A NOVELTY for Tourists unless we're talking about Indians who haven't done enough research before coming to Singapore & are merely looking for Indian sights & sounds. Does someone visit a Wallmart as an attraction when they visit New York? No right? Skip Mustafa is you're making a short trip since it's nothing but a very big & well priced department store.

Those Indians who wish to ONLY eat Indian food in Singapore by completely ignoring the local food scene here often find themselves roaming the bylanes of Mustafa Centre & also having to suffer its perennial crowds. You will always have trouble finding a taxi in the streets near Mustafa Centre & should ideally walk to Jalan Besar to up your chances of getting where you want to go. (Jalan Besar is yet another treasure trove of good food with delights like The Scissor Cut Curry Rice, 24 hours Tim Sum offerings of Swee Choon & so many more waiting to entice you! )

I have seen many vegetarian families spending a major chunk of their time in Little India during their Singapore visits due to this hankering for Indian food only & paying more than double the price to just have access to the things that they are used to eating. My suggestion? Plan your trip & avoid eating the things that you'll be eating soon after your trip ends back home in India. Singapore cuisine is delicious & there is no dearth of options for vegetarians & non vegetarians. You will not be disappointed.

A little exploration goes a long way!

Avoid going to Little India on Sundays due to the excessive crowds & if you must visit the Mustafa centre go very very late at night since it's less crowded then & the place is open for 24 hours. There are also some temples you may want to check out while you're there :)"
,,Glimpse of India,4.0,,"Little India, mostly Serangoon Road ,is very popular among Indian tourists. You will find here Hindu and Chinese temples, mosques, churches, and lot of shopping places.
The 24-hour shopping mall Mustafa Centre offers everything. Tekka Centre (wet market) many goldsmith shops and number of sari stores are also there.

South Indian vegetarian food, North Indian tandoori dishes, roti prata, and teh tarik (pulled tea in Malay) are specialties here. Fish in Banana Leaf and fish head curry are very popular dishes.

Deepavali (October or November), and Pongal (mid-January), Thai - pujam are major festivals and the celebrations are so nice to watch..

Reach here by getting down at Little India MRT or Farrer Park MRT stations."
,,Some shops everywhere.,3.0,,"We like to see new places, and this was one of them. With the architecture of the building I was very impressed, but there is mostly cellular shops around. We managed to get a descent place to eat real authentic Indian curry, this made the trip worth while."
,,Indian Culture In A More Accessible Format,4.0,,"Singapore is home to many Asian Indians, who have created an enclave north of Chinatown. It is a dynamic neighborhood of small shops, restaurants, busy streets and interesting people. I appreciated the chance to interact with Asian Indian culture without having to deal with the intensity of the real place. This being Singapore, begging, filthy streets, wandering animals, uncontrolled parades and visible human misery are not tolerated. We had a nice time doing some shopping and eating a tasty dinner. It would be unfortunate to miss Little India if you're visiting Singapore. One of Singapore's best achievements is building a successful multi-cultural society, and the neighborhood displays one of the most important cultures that has built the city-state."
,,a place to make you feel in India,4.0,,"although not everyone is Indian here but you get to see a lot of them in evening. Visit this place if you want to have some Indian food as you will get large no of choice here, also another place not to miss here is Mustafa the super mall which has almost everything and you can easily spend hours here."
,,Make use of the air conditioned shops!,4.0,,"The are plenty of shops with a huge variety of goods. Singapore can be very hot and humid, when you start overheating just head into the nearest shop and stand where the fans or air conditioners are blowing before heading out again."
,,Home away from Home for indians,4.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Little India enclave which is a heritage certified place. A must visit for your favourite dosas, idlis and vadais is the Komala Vilas and Shakuntala though there are many more. You will be surprised to see lot of expats and asians who frequent these restaurants. Though predominantly South Indians ( Tamilians ) dominate this place there are a few good North Indian cuisine restaurants like Kailash Parbat, Delhi Darbar, Tandoor etc.Muthu's which specialises in serving sea food in Indian style is a sought after location here. Also do check out the small pub like street cafes which offer some lovely fusion and continental cuisine on the main Little India street. The best part of Little India is its just a 5 minute walk from Buggis Square where you can savour the multi cuisine Singaporean street food, a huge fruit, vegetable and souvenir, market, modern malls etc. The famous Mustafa mall ( it doesnt get cheaper than this) sells everything under the sun. There's something for everyone in this enclave. The MRT is again a few minutes walk which makes it a central and interesting place to be in. Add to all this the supreme feeling of safety in Singapore and you cant miss visiting this place next time you are in Singapore !"
,,Walk with purpose,3.0,,I ended up here at the end if the day after a full on day sightseeing. I thought I would have a look around and then walk back to my hotel in novena. After a short shine I noticed that there were very few women around and large groups of men. Decided to save this for the next day and jumped in a taxi back to the hotel.
,,Leisure time walk-around place,4.0,,"try visiting this place if you wanna experience a bit of indian culture although its no representative of india as a whole...
there are temples, ...u can visit & pray
find out various articles to buy to get the glimpses of liitle india

also, there are many eateries that offer indian food as such that u can sample to get mouth ful of indian meals"
,,Must See Area!,5.0,,"Stayed with family on trip and was able to explore this area as a local. Wonderful area! Must see the super store here - Mustafa! They have everything! Lots of great restaurants - Roti Prata was really yummy! Singaporeans like to eat out a lot and mornings at the market and eateries was a nice routine. Easy to get around....underground system to avoid the heat and humidity if you want, although I enjoyed above ground as I love the heat as well!"
,,Indian Culture in a Centrally located area,3.0,,"During my visit to Singapore, stayed in a hotel in Little India. The area is centrally located if you want to walk around and also has MRT access and transit to most parts of Singapore. This enclave has Indian culture flourishing and if you go for a stroll in the evenings and night could here loud Indian songs and music emnating from road side boutiques. One could buy Indian clothing, especially Sarees, eat out Indian food and also visit a Hindu Temple along Serangoon road. The famous Mustafa Centre which sells almost any item (prices are not that cheap!), which is open for business around the clock, is also located in Little India."
,,Love it,5.0,,"I have been to New Delhi and Jaipur and this is almost as good, without the rickshaws and cows.
The hustle and bustle was energising. We went to Mustafa's Mall and you can everything from gold to electronics.
There are people everywhere and the food is great.
Just pick a place and try it.
A must-do. Just wander around. You'll be amazed."
,,Indian street in Singapore,4.0,,It is amazing that such a small country like Singapore could accommodate almost all continents people of the world. Whether it is china town or little India you will love to visit this places may be for nothing else than just for the food as variety available here. Avoid weekends at Little India cause you might feel that little India has expanded to real India.
,,A way to experience the fabulous culture,5.0,,"The smell of the yummy spices and the beautiful fresh flowers being strung in the street fronts where noticeable as soon as we got off the bus that took us here. Our two girls were fascinated by the Henna tattoos, so we chose a little boutique upstairs on a side street, where they adorned us all. $10 each for the girls and $15 for me - a very cheap way to entertain them and decorate them at the same time. The tattoos took around 30-40 mins for the three of us.
We then went to a curry parlour for lunch and this truly was one of the best meals I have EVER eaten.
The temples, the gold, gorgeous fabrics. You feel like you are in the centre of Delhi!

I would highly recommend going there with children the same age as mine (6 and 8) as they were fascinated by it all."
,,Don't Miss,5.0,,"I'm so glad we made it a point to stop here. Took a cab for about $10 and they dropped us off right in front of the market, where we ate some naan, chicken tikka, and saag. We loved looking through the saris and floral arrangements. It's a real great experience and so different from the rest of the city."
,,24-hour mall,3.0,,"This is where you'll find Musafa Mall - famous for being open 24 hours. You may buy your gold jewelries or do your grocery shopping at 2am :)
The concept is nice but there are lots of people on the street even at 2am around the mall that it's quite intimidating.
Of course there are other places to visit in little India from Mustafa. Mostly, I think, are mosques. I only was able to see from the outside as we never alight our ride but I find it small and not so grand, though still bursting with colors."
,,India in Singapore,4.0,,"This is the place where you can find Indian Culture.

Many indian's are staying here preserving there own culture. Must visit to have a look.

Info For Indians:
You can find hotels here where Indians are staying regularly.

Vegetarian food is easily available. (Also Pure Veg restaurants are available, and some of them serves Jain food also)

From Little India train station, you can reach to Dhoby-Ghaut train station and from there you can reach anywhere in Singapore."
,,Spicy,4.0,,"Little India is a fascinating cultural place to see, but the best places to eat are down the little side streets. It covers a vast area and some bits are more touristy than others. The Sri Veeramakaliamman temple is worth a visit.
One word of warning - avoid the place after about 4.00 on a Sunday. All the Bangladeshi construction workers congregate there in their hundreds, along with the young girl maids. It's mayhem, and quite intimidating."
,,A different side of Singapore,4.0,,"Spent a couple hours in Little India -- perusing the market -- upstairs is clothing, downstairs food -- visiting the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. If you're not into shopping and you're not hungry, then really, just visit the temple which is well worth your time."
,,"Food market good, but that's it",2.0,,"The food market will overwhelm most people as it is quite busy and in your face, but it was some of the best Indian food that I have tasted. Make sure that you have a look at all the stalls and make your decision based on what you see. Travel guides say to only eat at the A rated stores, but if you just observe, you will notice that those that are rated lower or not at all actually have more local customers. We made th assumption that the A category stalls got that rating because they had time to clean and reach certain goals, whereas the lower or non rated stalls were sooo busy they didn't have this time. I chose to eat at a non rated stall purely due to the number of locals eating here and the food was just lovely, no problems at all. Make an informed decision and what you are comfortable in doing.
Our young niece also loved the atmosphere here and chasing the pigeons."
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Every Indian who visit Singapore might be going there. Mustafa market is one stop shopping market, but its not cheap. You might get a lot of other shops outside with better deals. Niranjan is famous for his mobile shop and there are a few temples too here.
Not at all a quite place but, worth spending an evening if you have spare."
,,Little India,3.0,,"Our hotel we stayed at Singapore was very close by to little india. Certainly the dirtiest place we saw at Singapore.
There are many low coat food courts and restaurents, but their clenliness is very much questionable...
Some great shopping centres whih are offering considerabaly lower prices.
Finally, my auggestion is if you want a calm and clean stay.., never select little india..."
,,Enjoy the culture while you can,4.0,,As with most of Singapore the concrete is everywhere so it's nice to see s few blocks where there is some traditional culture left. Great to walk around and take in the local life. Lots if great placed to eat. Don't miss the great and colourful sari shops
,,Just Indian,4.0,,You can get Indian things in here and also Indian food though they dont exactly tastes like. The hotels are generally cheap.
,,Lot of Bangladeshi restaurants,3.0,,There are a lot of bangladeshi restaurants in this place... You can see quite a resemblance to organized Indianized culture in this part of singapore.....
,,It's like stepping back in time and all the better for it enjoy,5.0,,The smells the shops the smiles the tastes all brilliant . I ate drank and walked fantastic !!! Try the curry at the banana lead Apollo and tell them I sent you ! Very very good food and staff . Book at taxi as it's hard to hail a cab here too busy ? Or they don't like to stop !
,,Little India,5.0,,Visited last October with my sister totally amazing place. Shopping if you're looking for traditional Indian clothing then this is the place to go you're spoilt with choice and it's totally a treat we went two weeks before the Diwali festival so there was dance performances and many small gifts you could buy as for food totally to die for it was so dam good we took a MRT to Little indian 6 hours before our flight just to eat as much as we could. Spend say from 5 in the afternoon till 8 so you see the day life and also be able to see the area come alive when the sun goes down
,,Genuine Indian atmosphere!,4.0,,"I stayed in Little India, since my hostel was there. I truly recommend going there, it's a great place to feel the genuine indian atmosphere, try genuine Indian cuisine, buy souvenirs. A must in Singapore!"
,,Just like India,3.0,,"If you want a taste of India without going there Little India is perfect. Unlike the rest of Singapore, it is run down, cluttered, and somewhat dirty. But this is a reflection of India itself. Nevertheless, many restaurants serving a variety of regional Indian dishes and a bewildering array of Indian shops selling the usual junk along with endless gold jewelry and textile stores make for a worthwhile evening for sinner and wandering through the streets and shops."
,,"Shop, dine or get a beard trim",4.0,,There are plenty of shops in the Little India Arcade to find a knick knack or well priced postcard. There are restaurants and grocery stores to grab something to eat. Find henna and other fun things in the various shops. It is worth the hop off or a great place to stay in one of the inexpensive hostels there.
,,A Cornucopia of Colors,3.0,,"Little India is a great place to spend about a half a day. While you are there, make sure you take the time to eat at one of the many restaurants and barter for vibrant textiles and unique souvenirs. If your time is limited and you‚Äôre looking for a cultural experience in Singapore, I would recommend spending your time in Chinatown over Little India."
,,Indian neighborhood in Singapore,3.0,,"The name says it all. Indian people, indian culture, lots of indian food, Restaurants, jewellery shops, vegetable stalls, fruit stalls. I tried some indian restaurants. Ordered a Butter Chicken from some place. It was awesome. So if you are a indian food lover, most of these restaurants won't disappoint you. And don't forget to go to jewellery shops. Try out your bargain skills. You will find good deals. Singapore's busy indian neighborhood ""Little india""."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,My friend and I took the subway to little India. What a lovely experience. Reminded me of my childhood when my dad would wake me up every Saturday to go to the markets. We had delicious biryani in the little India arcade at the coat of $5. The mango lassi was just as delicious. There is a shopping mall close by that we wandered into where we bought some Indian traditional clothes at dirt cheap prices. A lovely experience.
,,Scared and disappointed,1.0,,"Ladies be aware of Indian guys at Singapore little India especially walking along the the shop houses I was there recently a middle age Indian guy who was walking opposite me accidentally elbow me on my chest , I guess is their tricks to touch women on their private area , it happened so quickly lucky I realise in short period of time I push him away the next moment he disappeared very bad experience never go there again."
,,A varied mixture of colors and aromas,4.0,,"The district is full of shops of textiles, jewelery, spices, vegetables, fruits, gifts. There are many restaurants and also vegetarian offering great food at an affordable price. We recommend to visit Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple at 141, Serangoon Road. The site has a very pleasant atmosphere and is easily accessible by MRT - Little India or Farrer Park MRT stations."
,,Very Colourful.,4.0,,"The Jewellery shops are a must, many designs that I hadn't seen elsewhere. Hindu temples are very ornate and they seem quite happy for you to wander through taking pictures. Quite an atmosphere in this area. The vegetable and garland stalls are something to behold."
,,Cheap shopping and Indian feel,5.0,,"In my opinion, Little India is definitely a neighborhood to stop by in Singapore. It is a great cultural experience, you can also find nice and decently priced restaurants there, also shopping is much more affordable then elsewhere im the city!"
,,A bustling venue,4.0,,"Pleasant day out, we ate at the Jungle Tandoor Restaurant which was not one of the top 35 restaurants but we were the only non Indian people in there and the food was great and would highly recommend it."
,,Disappointed - Not really worth the visit,1.0,,"This being our first time to Singapore we were so impressed with how clean everything was and the nice wide pavements one could walk on without being harrassed by motorcycles or motor cars. However we found Little India, to be dirtier than other places in Singapore, also the shop vendors placed a lot of their goods on the pavements thus forcing pedestrians to step onto the road in order to make progress, it was also the only place we heard cars hooting their horns. There were a handful of restaurant's none of which looked particularly appealing but it was during the day so we decided to give it a fair chance and return during the evening. There really wasn't much improvement the small number of restaurants were pretty basic and not particularly appealing. There were a couple of bars aimed I think at the back packing community but they seemed a bit seedy. In the end we left without eating. I would point out we have travelled extensively around SE Asia and also India so are not not shy of sitting down and eating local street food. Overall, if your Tour Bus stops here it's probably worth 30 mins to say you've seen it but I wouldn't make a particular effort to visit."
,,Its really feel like India....!!!,4.0,,"Whenever I visit Singapore, each time i visit Little India. Busy, noisy and happening place in singapore. Mustafa Center, Banana Leaf, Ferrer Park Hotel are one of the attractions nearby. But I like River Park Tandoori restaurant to eat Indian Food."
,,India outside India,4.0,,In this place you will feel India outside India. you will find lot's of Indian shops..restaurant over this place.
,,"Interesting cultural experience, but not a lot of it.",3.0,,"One of the three ethnic areas of Singapore - European, Chinese and Indian. The hint is in the title - ""Little"". It is interesting to visit and explore the shops. My biggest disappointment was that I visited a number of spice shops but in all cases the spices were pre-packed - I expected to see big bowls of spice that customers could buy loose spice from."
,,This really is like India,5.0,,"We have been to India and as we came out of the Metro station my family all had the same impression - this is really like the real thing. Bustling, busy, noisey, colourfull. Well worth a visit."
,,Fav Place to Go,5.0,,"I always, like always always visit Little India every time I visited Singapore. Mustafa Centre, Banana Leaf Apolo, One Farrer Hotel and Spa...all the thing I love the most from Singapore."
,,Ok for a short visit,3.0,,Little India seemed a bit disjointed to us. A cluster of Indian shops and caf√©s interspersed over a larger area. It wasn't as obvious where it started or finished. Perhaps it was better in the past.
,,Bless for people who are from India,4.0,,"This Place is really a Bless for people who are from India to have lunch and dinner.

Many Restro have south Indian food.
Veg and Non veg North Indian food is also available here.

Try not to purchase any other thing from the market all the things are imported from India.

If you want to purchase anything then go to Mustafa Center which is very near by to Little India. all the things are also available in India but this is a good place to shop any thing. Mustafa Very Big shopping complex."
,,The best part is Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple,4.0,,"Bring your money because there are deals to be made here. There are a lot of shops here featuring everything you can think of. My wife was particularly impressed with the jewelry shops with their fantastic displays of gold. I was smart enough not to let her go in, though. The best part is the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. (See my pix). We went to the Mustafa center, a large department store, but found the prices too high, especially after what we had just seen on the street shops."
,,Ethnic Indian area - well worth a visit,4.0,,"Little India is what is says on the tin: an area strong in Indian ethnicity, but all seem to get along just fine. My first real introduction to ""Hawker"" markets, where there are loads of stalls from which to buy food to eat, and then you sit down at one of the many communal tables to eat it. The fruit stalls were fascinating, the meat stalls not so enticing. Wander around the streets to get a flavour, we were lucky that it was close to a Hindu festival, so there were still a lot of stalls with special goods on them. A fair walk from the City Centre but very possible."
,,Little India: A place to shop,4.0,,Indian inspired fashion is beautiful. You will never go wrong visiting this place if you like to buy some of their stuffs like Indian wardrobe and shoes. They are guaranteed to be lovely and prices are reasonable. Some areas may not be pleasing to the nose though.
,,Impressiv,5.0,,"We had our hotel just around the corner from Little India. We enjoyed it to go into another world, vistied the markets, had dinner in an indian restaurant and visited few impressive temples. Go there - it is a must in Singapore"
,,All things Indian,4.0,,"This area has lots to offer.Genuine food,clothes and souvinerSights,sounds,smells,chaos,places of worship.......India.Down side is this.Indian men seem to leer at women.Dont know if there's some kind of intent but it's creepy.Single white women get the treatment but even my wife got ogled."
,,Only worth a short visit,3.0,,"Found Little India a bit average the day we went for a visit. (Had just been in Chinatown and enjoyed it more). We did the Lonely Planet walk and found the only attraction worth seeing was the Tan House in Kerbau Road. The markets and alley ways for us didn't hold any new treasures, but that's not to say others wouldn't be excited by them."
,,Favourite hangouts by indian workers,4.0,,"Little India runs along Serangoon road and part of racecourse road. This stretch of road sells practically all things from Indian spices, mobile phones and daily necessities. It takes you about 45 mins to walk from one end to the other with good chapatti and Dosai shop eateries. It is clean and have a unique flavor of its own unlike the modern Singapore. Do walk into Tekka Market and drop by the well know 24 hours Mustafa shopping complex and wander in to desker road and others to lean of the history of these places. Saturday and especially Sunday you will get hordes of Indian workers congregating here but they are all peaceful and do not disturb you. Mostly, go try out all the Indian food and enjoy Singapore taste of India."
,,Little India - Singapore,4.0,,We walked from China Town to Little India on Singapore to stop for a drink and tea. This area seams to close up early. There are many Indian restaurants to eat. At the time of evening we were there (before 9PM) is was not too crowded and may shops were closed.
,,Indian Hub in Singapore,3.0,,"One of the most crowded places in Singapore
There are quite a few Indian eateries here, like Kailash Parbat, Copper Chimney, Komala's,Banana Leaf, etc
Lot of Tamilans on the street. There are Jewelery Shops, Branches of Indian banks as well.
There is park & Mustafa Centre nearby.
There are few temples as well in this Area."
,,Many little shops,4.0,,If you want go shopping you can find many little shops arround there..and many little bars and cafes...art- and souveniershops too.
,,Interesting and colorful.,5.0,,I went there to look around but there are lots of eateries there so I had to stop and eat some wonderful dosas and grab some nice sweets like julabee I really do not know how to spell this but it is an Indian sweet that is deep fried and really juicy sweet). I relaxed in a park on the east side of Little India and had a very nice time watching the locals go about their business. This is a very colorful place to sight see and there is also a very interesting temple that is worth a visit. One should not miss Little India when one visits Singapore.
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"The streets are heavily decorated for the new year festivals therefore many streets were closed for decoration.
We stopped in a bar for a drink & asked directions to the closest MRT station, whereby the incredibly helpful bar lady said I would feel conspicuous being female; bizarrely until that point I hadn't noticed it but the male population around Little India is far higher.
Plenty of shops to browse in.
We were turned away from a couple of restaurants as we only wanted a drink rather than a meal."
,,"Crowded, but easier to negotiate that Chennai or Mysore on a public holiday",5.0,,"Little India is a microcosm of Tamil and Telegu cultures assimilated by their fairly early arrival as part of the C19th Singapore workforce. Amongst the streaming scarves, gently pleated saris and cellophane-wrapped bangles, you will find fruit and veg of very variety, many of them without Western names. The fish and meat in the covered Tekka market may look exposed, but the turnover is so rapid that it is almost certainly much fresher than that from your average Camden Town supermarket shelf. Cafes and eateries have corner pavement tables or shopfronts open to the street, at which they offer mutton and chicken in a variety of styles, masala curried crab - small and sweet compared to the Chinese 800g whoppers - and 'original' vegetarian dishes from the South Indian repertoire. Cold beer is available for consumption - usually indoors only, but there is lassi and mango juice to be had in most places as well. The streets are particularly picturesque at night, when the faceted gold necklaced and earrings twinkle in reflected car lights passing the many jewellery shop windows"
,,GOOD1,5.0,,I went there for 4 days when i have stayed in Singapore for 4 days i like little india you can find easily Indian veg. food indian theater (tamil/telugu) you should visit it once when you get chance to visit Singapore
,,Nice street shopping,3.0,,"Mustafa center and the food, very good attractions of this part of singapore. Colorful in every aspect and serving all kinds of delicacies made this a unique experience . The street shopping was fun ."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"There was heaps of variety when it came to clothing, jewelry and food. Good if you want to pawn gold. Cheap saris and accessories."
,,Great to visit....interesting!,3.0,,"Never been to India but if it is like that....worth visiting! A lot of shops, stalls, etc a good day to spend visiting it! Didn't go to the temple though!"
,,Flowers garlands,4.0,,"We loved watching the flowers being made into garlands on the footpath. We were sorry we missed the celebrations of pongal, maybe we should have gone at night, not during the day. Brought back memories of travels in India"
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Very pleasant day out,it's worth a visit,it was very busy while we went there but also interesting,I would strongly advise visitors to wear sensible footware as some parts of the area can be quite dirty due to heavy rainfall occasionally in Singapore"
,,Once in a life time visit,5.0,,We had the great fortune of visiting little India during the Pongal festival. At the temple we saw people putting rods through their bodies. There was a ritual where men had huge head dresses on their head that were supported by lines that were impeded into their bodies. Once in a life time.
,,Avoid it,1.0,,"I went there on Sunday night, never seen so many men in my life in one place, there were easy over a couple thousand Indian men standing lining the streets, as 3 women walking along the street, everyone just stared at us like we were meat, it was very scary, did not feel safe at all, would never go back and would not recommend it."
,,worth a little visit and maybe a bit of shopping,4.0,,"Interesting place, lively colours, people shopping for their food. Not to forget the smell of spices..."
,,The Temples are so Decretive,4.0,,"Little India is a busy place where the aroma of the various spicy's from both Northern and Southern Indian will entice you to try one of their amazing curries. Unlike the rest of Singapore Little India has maintained it's own old style no high raise with small little shops advertising bargain prices. There is however large department called Mustafa, which sells almost anything at very reasonable prices. The temples are amazing and so decretive. A place to visit for something different."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Worth a visit if you're after gold, silver and trinket jewellery. Some good Indian food restaurants as you would expect. Be prepared to bargain, the quoted prices are inflated."
,,Wonderful Walk,4.0,,Wonderful walk through Little India with the smell of amazing curry. Many restaurants from North and South India (North is not as hot and South is fiery spicy hot). Kind shop keepers and very pleasant people. Great food and company.
,,Excellent Indian Food,4.0,,"A vegetarian Indian like me can survive for life just because of eating options at Little India. Have been to Singapore 3 times in past two years. Every time I visited I stayed either at Marina Bay or Mandarin Orchard, but always frequented to Little India for food."
,,Busy busy busy,3.0,,It is worth a visit into Little India.i have never seen so many men and so little of woman in the one area. More Indian men then you can poke a stick at. There are some great Indian eateries in the area and some beautiful temples to visit. Definitely a step back in time compared to the rest of Singapore. The hop on hop of bus travels through little India which can give you an outline of the district and what there is to see.
,,enjoy eating dose at liitle india,4.0,,"each time i went to singapore,i must stop a few times at little india and have my favourite indian food.Dose,idli with the vegetarian sauce hm delicious.Indian food are very spicy.it reminds me of my childhood where I used to walk with my greatgrandmother,had all my favourite dishes.There are not much changes at little india,the restaurants are still there,just like 50 years ago.The smells of incent and the shops with colourful textile.I don¬¥t like going to mustafa center,it is very consevertive and I don¬¥t feel well going there as a woman especially when you are using shorts even when it is a midi shorts."
,,Must Seen When in Singapore,5.0,,"Little India is a stop on the Hop on and Hop Off bus also can be reached by taking the MRT.

There is many different places to see and dine at. We visited the different temples that are listed in the travel guides. Please note when visiting the temples shoes must be removed and most places the women have to have their shoulders covered."
,,"Food & Shopping, a step back in time",3.0,,"Like stepping back in time, vast change to all the newness about Singapore. This is where the Indian communities eat & shop. Authentic restaurants, shops with imported & locally made Indian cotton clothing, rugs etc. you can take a bus tour thru Little India to give you ideas on where to visit, temples, architecture mainly original old British Colonial mixed with Indian. Worth a visit."
,,Snapshot,5.0,,"Took MRT to Little India at night. Vibrant, noisy area. A snapshot of the real thing. Shopped in Mustafa Centre which was like a huge hypermarket with so many entrances and floors. Worth a visit for the jewellery."
,,"It is ""literally India"" over here",5.0,,"If you are in these streets, you wont miss the Indian food, indian shopping (right from the basic ingredients to hifi shopping in Mustafa). I found that south indian food is better here than in India (not an exaggeration)."
,,Exotic,4.0,,"Little India is total different to the rest of Singapore. Small Shops, not as clean as the rest of the town and exotic. However, to get the full picture of the City a visit is a must. In January there is the Indian ""thanksgiving"" Festival and the Streets are delighted¬¥, what Looks beautiful at night."
,,Cheap Buys,3.0,,"Little India is just a 10-15 minute walk from where we stayed in Singapore (Gap Year Hostel). As a traveler, Little India has been very helpful since there's Mustafa Center, a 24-hr shopping mall. It has cheap buys and bazaars nearby where you can buy your souvenirs. There are also a lot of food choices that cook good Indian food."
,,Very similar in many respects to being in India ... great food :-),5.0,,"Love it here... fabulous food... many similarities to being in India... colors, street life, food, shopping - all an assault on the eyes - just fabulous :-) Really love this part of town..."
,,"Little, well, india!",4.0,,"India has had more than 2 millenia of historic ties with SE Asia. In Malaya (including Singapore of today), there's still visible and living remnants of that past. Little India (and Chinatown) are amongst the few districts decided to be noteworthy of conservation against the ever-growing pressure of development on precious land! It feels like India, but very singaporean ofcourse.

It is the capital of indian (and pakstani, bangladeshi) and vegetarian food (mostly south indian though there's ample north indian too but hardly any east or west indian). The area is known for electronics too (who doesn't know SimLim?). Bargaining is recommended while shopping. Mustafa remains a rags-to-riches legend, and a good one-stop shop for indian (and thai, philipino, indonesian) expats."
,,Don't get off the bus,1.0,,Filthy. When Singapore is so clean we were very surprised to find this area so dirty. It is full of little shops selling old electronics and computers. I wouldn't bother coming here again.
,,seriously like India,4.0,,"Well since We were of Indian origin it isn't any surprise to us seeing Indian stalls and people . its quite like India . you get all sorts of Indian cuisine if u search from Punjabi to South Indian . Restaurants are few and I'd suggest visiting the hawkercentres so much variety and much cheaper also easier to get food to go , we wanted to try out Chinese and Malay on our trip so stayed away from Indian food , but there are hundreds of visitors and the place is bustling at night up to 1am .

Pls note. DO VISIT MUSTAFFA CENTRE FOR BEST DEALS ANDEXCHANGE RATES. UNBEATABLE IN SINGAPORE ."
,,A must to visit,5.0,,Experience the Singapore of old.Amazing sights and smells If you love Indian food try the hawker stalls or local restaurants. You only find Indian food better if you were in India.
,,nothing much,2.0,,"our hotel where located here at little india
When i was walking going back to our hotel there was a 2 indian men
Having a drink at the sidewalk

Little i know one of them is following me thank god hotel is near
So be careful guys i know sg is a safe country but still be very careful

P.s. I dont like the smell of the spice here when you walk along the sidewalk you can smell it"
,,Suitable for SAARC country people only,3.0,,Prices are quite cheap than the other area. But I do not feel like I was in Singapore when I visit here.
,,"Wonderful shopping, beautiful decor.....",5.0,,I loved the shopping - excellent fabrics and clothes made on the spot. The flower market perfumed like heaven and the spices and sweets are addictive.
,,True to the name,3.0,,"Little India is exactly how I imagined the real India to be, being much safer and no doubt cleaner than the real place. However compared to the rest of Singapore it was quite grotty and slummy but a great cultural experience for my family. It was a scorching hot winters day when we visited but cold drinks were really cheap and so was food. We found some cool temples to photograph and some brightly coloured buildings but a part from that there was not much else to see. The people were very friendly and helpful."
,,Place to visit if you want to taste authentic indian food...,3.0,,"There are a few hotels and motels etc on Dickson street. Lots of indian clothing, jewellery shops on the main street. Lots of food shops only downside is there are no meccas or any other western food outlets close to this place ."
,,Worst part of the city,2.0,,"Nothing good here. Poor sidewalks, over crowded. Not many good deals and being part Indian they didn't have much that represent India such as food and clothes! Streets were dirty here"
,,Great to Wander but better to have a local with You!,4.0,,"I enjoyed eating at the local food courts - tasty food at great prices! We looked inside an Indian Temple and were very impressed with the colourful statues! We tried to be respectful as people were also praying and found that as long as you did this, the locals were in turn happy to explain how they operated!"
,,Tekka Hawker Center,5.0,,"I went to Little India on my first day in Singapore. I loved it. The Tekka Hawker Center was a sensory feast. Great scents, fantastic food, smells of incense, and strangers dining together. Fresh Naan was being made in the center. I could have eaten every meal here! A wonderful welcome to Singapore indeed. Great culture!"
,,Get Amongst the locals,4.0,,"Old Singapore shophouses, interesting side streets, buy anything you need and have a barter. Worth a couple of hours just strolling around taking in the aura."
,,Worth half a day visit,3.0,,Your visit to Singapore is not complete until you have visited Little India. It can be overwhelming and appear confusing if you have never visited an Indian Market. Great place to soak up the atmosphere. Shop around for bargains prefer to barter. Enjoy the experience.
,,Overwhelming,4.0,,"Just like walking in a well developed, cleaner and better organized city in India. A lot of souvenir shops along Serangoon Road sells stuff just like China town, in an Indian environment, of course. The Indian Temple has unique architecture. A bit overwhelming when I was there on Sunday, when people would come of of the houses, walking and chatting on every single road in the area. I think Sunday is like a meeting day for Indian people. It was quite hard walk outside on Sunday. If you don't like the smell and crowd, avoid Sunday. But I think it's also nice just to go watching and absorbing the culture."
,,Great half day,5.0,,"Great half day watching people and absorbing the atmosphere and history of this culturally rich city. Make a point of walking through Tekka Market, seeing the architecture on Buffalo Road and the Sri Veeramakaliamman temple."
,,A bit of an underwhelming experience,3.0,,"Having seen Little India in Malaysian George Town and other places, the Little India of Singapore is a bit of an underwhelming experience. It's Little India of Singapore, which, to my taste, is a bit impersonal and sterile. It's like Switzerland of Asia, too organized, too clean, everything is working and even though there is an Indian quarter here, one still feels it's a bit artificial. There are some nice Hindu temples and lovely chapati and dosa eateries, the overall atmosphere was a bit of a disappointment. I felt the local Chinatown maintains the traditional feel better."
,,A small slice of India in Singapore,3.0,,"i really enjoyed wandering around Little India and visiting the fresh produce and spice stalls. However when walking through the area selling silks, pashminas and other souvenirs I felt hassled to buy and shortened my visit. I have experienced this type of selling practice before in Bali and other Asian countries but after the more reserved approach adopted by most shops in Singapore I was put off."
,,Busy Little India,3.0,,"It's worth going here mostly because of some really good restaurants, serving pretty amazing Indian foods and delicacies. Also, many people come here to visit the Mustafa Centre for shopping (open 24 X 7). The Centre can get very busy though, so best to go there for example after midnight."
,,nice to visit,3.0,,it was nice to see the indian community in Singapore really nice to see fresh vegetables in their markets -probably the only place in Singapore you will see this. nice indian restuarants there with good food
,,Little Southern India as its got shops playing mostly tamil music,3.0,,"Just average with exceptions being Mustafa Centre (one of the most crowded supermarkets which is open 24 X 7) and some good restaurants serving Indian Delicacies like Banana Leaf, Kebab & Curries etc......."
,,Feel of India in Singapore,4.0,,"In 'Little India', one does not feel that one is in Singapore. The tamil name boards on shops, the people, the temples and overall atmosphere gives one the feeling that one is suddenly back in one's homeland. There are plenty of shopping attractions but a visit to the giant all-under-one-roof mega departmental store Mohammed Mustafa at the end of the road is almost compulsory for any Indian. Lots of indian (especially south indian) restaurants in the area."
,,Bustling and Exciting to walk around,4.0,,"This part of town was much busier than chinatown and the other areas that we had walked around and there were a lot of cars. However it was still a pleasant experience. There were lots of lovely little shops and stalls to look in and fun things to buy like Indian cakes etc. We walked a bit further out and came across some big shopping malls which had some bargains. Also a great restaurant right in the middle of one of the bazaars! If I ever come to Singapore again, a trip to Little India will definitely be happening."
,,Small India,4.0,,"Area full of indians, indians shops, Souvenirs & indian foods. Good place for shopping of electronics at Mustafa market. Worth a Visit!!"
,,A Piece of India,3.0,,"Singapore cultural diversity where you can sample multi-races, language, food and way of life.
Take the MRT to Ferrer Park Station (North East Line NE8 - purple). Walk towards Little India Station (NE9) and shop at Serangoon Plaza or at Mustafa Center. You may find varieties of merchandise which mostly catered for South Asia nationals.

As you walk along the streets, you will experience strong smell of Spice, Incense and local Foods. Take the opportunity to samples variety of Indian foods along the streets.. dotted with restaurants and shops.
Visit Indian Temple, Indian Muslim Mosque, Sikh Temple nearby and witness worshippers paying tribute to their religions.

However best avoid during weekend (Sunday) as the whole Street is crowded by South Asia migrant workers."
,,Feels like I just stepped onto a street in Mubai,5.0,,"This little area is quite unusual. Not, Singapore....India and just around the corner from a organized, clean, modern, and busy city. This little part of Singapore is worth a visit. The streets are full of saris and sari suits, gold shops, Indian veg restaurants and color! At some of the restaurants down the side streets, the patrons eat with their hands as in India, speak little English and really create a community that feels so unlike the rest of Singapore. If you are taking the Hop on Hop off bus, I would highly recommend this stop."
,,Little India,3.0,,"Little India is very interesting especially if you have never been to India. It gives you a taste of what India is like with it's temples, mosques, shopping and good Indian restaurants. A word of advise DON'T go on a Sunday. It's packed to the rim wall to wall with people mainly men. You can't move around freely like any week day.Difficult to get a taxi etc it's because the workers (men only) are paid on the Sunday and they all meet up to celebrate."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"found Little India disappointing. It is a small suburb with old run down buildings. I did not see or feel it had any culture or ambience. It was full of cheap shops, dirty looking restaurants and not much else."
,,Get a snippet of life on the sub-continent here,4.0,,"I love to visit Little India and come very time I'm in Singapore. Although it's only a small area, the atmosphere and culture is deep and enveloping. You can visit one of several beautiful and welcoming temples, there are flower garlands and spice shops everywhere, with lots of exotic products. The Teka Market and Arcade are both great areas for food, souvenirs and day to day market wares and interaction with the people around the area is always fun. Get a Henna too if you like - you can get one of the artists to pain a lovely design (big or small) on your skin. Find these decorative, but not permanent, adornments in a couple of stalls at the Arcade."
,,Interesting to wander around,4.0,,We just roamed the streets and stores and you would not think you were in Singapore. It is a charming little area and the temple there was lovely inside. Prices here are a little better than in a lot of the places in Singapore.
,,Little India is a Big Joke,1.0,,"This is arguably the shabbiest corner of Singapore, drab and dirty! Little India desperately needs to come of the time-warp... until then, venture here with a warning: it is nothing to do with today's India or modern-day Indians!!

Mustafa Centre - the mall which is open 24 hours - has an abandoned look after midnight. While the quality of available products is average, the prices are no lesser than those elsewhere...
The variety of food is dubious given the dingy and dirty eateries ...here again, South Indian fare (idli, dosa, etc.) is most popular though not the tastiest you've had. Shops selling gold jewelry are shady at best - well, even the designs are nothing to rave about:( There are a few temples and (what seems like) a million worshipers - go here with His blessings! Another big minus is the small pavements and narrow lanes - not advisable for wheelchairs or prams.

Not surprisingly, cab drivers offer solemn advice to watch out for your wallets and keep an eye on the passers-by ...one stroll down its lanes and you'll know why Little India is at best a bad joke on the real country:)"
,,Intresting but a bit scaring,2.0,,Little India was so full of men on a Sunday afternoon that you could hardly walk on a street. There where hardly any women. It was an interesting experience but I was glad to leave.
,,Great place for plenty of good Indian food,4.0,,The streets of Little India gives a perfect picture of how India actually is. Roaming in the streets of this place provides a opportunity to have variety of spicy Indian food. Mustafa Mall in this area provides all the essential items at reasonable prices.
,,A part of India in Singapore,5.0,,"Walking distance from Raffles Place, this is a charming area to visit for a morning or afternoon visit. The small Indian Shops and Restaurants are just like Mumbai! Good bargains to be obtained and thankfully the area still has a Charm that has been here for over 40 years of travelling to Singapore. It's a fun and interesting place to visit and have a meal."
,,Little India - great to visit during Deepavali in October,3.0,,"Little india is great! But it's even better to visit during Deepavali, because it is decorated, there is a large market area for the festival. Little India has loads of little indian specialty cafes, including internet cafes, food and particular indian specialty shops.

Definitely a must to see yet another side of the diversity and cultural implosions available in Singapore."
,,Go during lunch,3.0,,WE made the mistake of doing the Little India self guided tour during the early morning when most of the restaurants were closed. It would have been fun to sample some of the delicious food being prepared. WE did stop by the Hindu Temple which was quite large and very similar to many Hindu temples we have visited. WE popped into Mustafa's to have a look around and found that this massive store seemed to be made up of many smaller stores each selling different product categories.
,,little india,3.0,,"the first time i go to singapore i stay at little india area, not a lot i can tell about it, because i really never had chance to explore this area, beside i am not really like the smell
but i like the food such roti prata and biryani rice"
,,"As the name suggests, it is a little India",4.0,,"Great place to go for a brief sight, sound and experience of India's tastes and colours. It is right next to the MRT Station name after it, ""Little India"""
,,Truly a little India,5.0,,"As and when you entered in this area, you will get a sense why this place has been named as little India. Well connected through Singapore Metro system. Lot of variety of Indian food, and you will not miss Indian Food in Singapore, Must visit at least for an Indian."
,,Lovely Curry Paradise,5.0,,"Migrants from India have settled here selling cooked food be it in the hawker centre or restaurants.

Lots of vegetables and provisions stalls have sprung up to cater to various races besides the Indians.

You will be lured to the spices shops as the aroma permeates Little India.

Saris and Indian outfits can be found at the shops.

The infamous Mustafar Shopping arcade offers you everything."
,,"Great souvenirs, vibrant colours, Ayurvedic, herbals and spices",4.0,,"You get everything fresh and pure that you can get in India. The colours are so gorgeous that you just fall in love. The shopkeepers do not tire showing their wares that you feel embarrassed, you haven't bought anything, yet!

All with a smile and words that bowl you over.
It is a great experience. Right on Syed Alwi Road is a beautiful Temple (Mandir).

Go for an hour and spend half a day, you will enjoy it."
,,"As its name, really a small India",3.0,,A unique place that feels like India. Clean as other parts of Singapore and safe. Can be reached easily with MRT. A good place to experience Indian food without the need to go to India in particular the price is very reasonable and inexpensive.
,,Vibrant experience,5.0,,"Little India was such an unexpected and amazing experience, the blasting Bollywood music, the smell of spices, the vibrant colours and stunning trinkets were a sight to behold! The real Indian cooking like gulab jamun's (indian pastry sweets) was great and I got a henna tattoo which was amazing to watch and incredibly beautiful!"
,,"Vibrant Colors, Food and Life",4.0,,"I have been avoiding going to Little India for many trips in a row because I was worried I would not enjoy it and read about unruly people here. My four hours there on a recent trip were inspirational and I will return again.

I took the MRT from Clarke Quay to Little India (two stops away) and enjoyed all of the unique architecture, markets, trinkets and dried rose neck strands as I wandered street by street. I thought about the history of the place and wondered about all of the people that lived there and shopped for fruit, household goods or gold jewelry. Definitely an affordable part of Singapore where a huge bottle of cold water was $1.30. I saw some young women getting intricate temporary henna designs on their skin which was stunning.

I tooled around from restaurant to restaurant trying to figure out where I wanted to eat which was an adventure in and of itself. There were several Komala's, the original restaurant from 1945 and the newer one on Serangoon Rd, but opted out because they were vegetarian only and I wanted some meat prepared in the tandoori oven. Many of the old buildings had wonderful windows, paint details and mouldings. The light on the buildings during sundown was gorgeous."
,,"Bustling, little grimy but still worth a look!",4.0,,"Little India was a 5 minute walk from our hotel so it was easy to check out.

The first place we stopped was the Tekka Center. The first floor is street food heaven (but a bit smelly & grimy) and the second floor was brightly colored fun (cheap) clothing. Well worth a walk around.

Next we continued down Serangoon Rd about 5 minutes towards the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. There were some disturbing carvings and I later found out this temple is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, fierce embodiment of Shakti and the god Shiva's wife, Parvati.

About 10 minutes further down the st on the right was the Mustafa Center- open 24 hours! Good grief it was crammed with all kinds of things including cheap souvenirs, which is where I ended up buying most of mine!"
,,Singapore and the (south) Indian food scene,5.0,,"Being an Indian and also a vegetarian, i was apprehensive when i first traveled to Singapore in 1999. Traveling towards the east for the first time in life it was also an uneasy feeling on how I will find my way in a country known for its non vegetarian and meaty delights. That is when i had first known about Little India and at the time due to work I just used to go eat at one particular restaurant and head out to office, coming back late night to quickly call it a day.

But this time it was different....it was a family vacation. Saimaa and Adi traveled with me on our first overseas vacation. And this time we were bolder in our outlook of food albeit vegetarian. Over the next two days we immediately realized that vegetarian food is far and few and left us with very limited salad and starter choices with not much of main course. Which then meant that we would seek solace in that part of Singapore we could call 'home' for atleast food. Little India be beckoned us again....

Little India is nested between Race Course road and Serangoon road and many bylanes connecting these two roads. This place is like India....more like Chennai and has everything drom flower shops, a temple, a mosque, the famous Mustafa Plaza and our very own South Indian CD/VCD/DVD shops that we cant seem to live without!

Over the next few days we would visit Little India for lunch, dinner and some shopping. Our trip started with a visit to The Banana Leaf Apolo which is one of the known restaurants in the place and one that has 2 branches. They had an elaborate South Indian Thali which we enjoyed with Tiger Beer to go...this retaurant also has authentic Chettinad Chicken curry, Chicken and Mutton biriyani for all the meat lovers.

Then there is Sakunthalas which also is a very clean eatery which serves great food, i liked the vegetable biriyani there that was served with a pickle, veg raita and papads.

Komala Vilas serves great south Indian snacks like Dosas, Uttappams, Vadas and one of the fluffiest Idlies that i have tasted after Cafe Mysore and Cafe Madras that i have written about.

Komalas, Murugan Idli, Saravana Bhavan and Ananda Bhavan complete the South Indian food scene with another restaurant called Andhra Curry that specializes in authentic Andhra stuff.

One other notable, albeit more expensive place to dine is Mustard that serves great Bengali and North Indian fare. The begun bhaja, dal and rice there reminds us of durga pooja food in India. Its a small place but serves good food.

My vote to the South Indian Thali of Little India goes to Anjappar Restaurant. Served hot, this truly reminds us of authentic home cooked food and does not leave your tummy bloated or full. Instead you savour the taste and variety....of the sambhar, vetthakozhambu, rasam, kottus of two varieties, pickle and curd alongwith chapatis and rice. Situated on Syed Alwi road and adjacent to Mustafa Plaza, this is my vote for the best vegetarian thali.

And finally...there is Tamil Nadu Kitchen on the cross road just outside of Little India where you can tuck into the yummiest of south Indian vegetarian and non vegetarian food at a far lesser price for the food than some of these restaurants.

So if you are also apprehensive of what you can eat when in Singapore, then fear not....Little India has a solutionfor allthe questions posedto you by your hungry tummy. So got there, tuck in to some great food and enjoy your time in Little India....."
,,Little India - Eatries along Serangoon Road,5.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a leisure stroll along Serangoon Road, Little India. There is much to see and indulge. Indulge in souvenir shopping, throw-away vacation clothes, market food at Tekka Market and don't forget to have a cup of Ginger Tea, a specialty here. Serangoon road and its parallel street, Race Course Road offers full vegetarian menus, snacks (Indian Chat's) as well as full service quality restaurant's with great meaty dishes.

Try to avoid it on Sunday afternoon/evening when almost all of the islands migrant construction workers meet here for their weekly catch-up. It can be somewhat intimidating for tourists who come from scarcely populated places."
,,Average,2.0,,"Little India is full of yet more average shops selling overpriced tourist trinkets. It is good for a quick visit, but there is little to do except eat and browse. Overall it was pretty busy and dirty and i would not return."
,,Intresting yet freaky,3.0,,"I went out to explore Little India on my own & although the place was nice and had the Indian ambiance, I somehow did not feel safe there. There is a beautiful temple I saw and Indian wear is the cheapest. Do not eat the food there if you have a weak stomach. You are bound to have diarrhea. Also you have to be careful or you will get lost. I had to use GPS and eventually got help from the police to get back to the city."
,,Nice Place,4.0,,"Many temple araound here, close together and nice for explore. You will meet Indian people with typical clothes"
,,Reminds me of India,2.0,,If you wish to see India in Singapore this is a place to be. I don't like the place much. People will say that we should go to Mustafa and shop there but I didn't like the place at all.
,,Pretty legit,5.0,,Awesome to walk around and see the shops and eat delicious authentic food. Pretty clean compared to other Indian districts I seen. People are nice and don't try to peddle you things
,,Interesting part of Singapore. Very Indian as the name states.,4.0,,Central part of town and not hard to get to. Very colourful the day we went because of the festival Diwali the night before. Temple in the heart of the area. Lots of INdian food places and things to buy. Happy travels. Cheers.
,,"Fun, even if you're from India",4.0,,"It's a lovely, bright neighbourhood to walk around in, with endless photo opportunities. The colourful shophouses, the bustling markets, the pure vegetarian food joints, the open gold marts. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Singapore."
,,"Great place,food & historical but avoid weekend",4.0,,"I love this place as there is a lot to explore and see ... You can buy stuff an eat all the good food.. Just avoid weekend as it can get overcrowded with workers on their days off.

This place is easy to get around and you can never be lost, there are 2 subway depending on which one you choose, either little india or farrer park mrt station. But bear in mind that if you are thinking of going to tekka market then get off at little india. If you want to get to City Square then get off at Farrer Park.

Other than that always can explore on your own as i have seen a lot of tourist going in and out of the temple..

It all depend on how you look at this place, some people might like it and some dislike it.. Its individual preference

Great for family, friends and couples"
,,Great place with great atmosphere,4.0,,"This was one of the larger Little India areas that I have visited. It is easily accessible from the subway. There were several restaurants to choose from and a large selection of shops with fresh flowers, fruits, vegetables, souvenirs, etc. There were also quite a lot of gold jewellers. it was a great atmosphere and an enjoyable to walk through and have a nice Indian supper."
,,Really a good few hours spent,5.0,,"the look the smells, the food, the temples. It is a great few hours to spend exploring. I wish I could have taken the walking tour but was only offered on Wednesdays when I was not there."
,,Crowded and disaapointed,1.0,,"While visiting Singapore, colleague suggested to visit little India. I was very disappointed with the visit. It was crowded, smelly and disorganized. While it is safe to walk around, it was just an array of shops with cheap souvenir and jewelry. Will not return any time soon"
,,A great place to shop & eat,4.0,,"Cheap clothing. Friendly traders. Loads of Jewelery Shops. Tailors, henna tattoo shops, trinkets electronics and a fresh vegetable market. Plenty of browsing for everyone."
,,Great Place for Tourists,5.0,,"I used to work in Little India and I always wondered why are there so many tourists visiting this place. Having tried some of the Restaurants there, I actually enjoy the curry fish head at Banana Leave restaurant and their healthy yoghurt there. In fact, there are so many types of yoghurt, one of my favourite is the beauty yoghurt at Kamala, a kind of Indian fast food sets which is reasonably priced. I have also tried treading my face which can be quite a painful experience but after the facial hair is removed, I would think the pain is nothing compared to the results of a more beautiful face. There are also toe rings, bangles and other trinkets you can buy along the shops on the streets. I am sure you will discover many other interesting things to do like henna color of you need to color your hair brown or black for the aging folks."
,,Busy Little India,3.0,,"This place was packed with people when we visited it around lunch on a Sunday. They had great markets, but be sure not to buy on the first place you find. The prices fluctuates a lot."
,,Disappointing visit,3.0,,"It wasn't on our 'to do' list while in Singapore, but went along for the experience. I was really disappointed. It was dirty and smelly and just not for me. It was handy for the MRT so it's easily accessible and the market was interesting but very busy."
,,Best place to get saffron,5.0,,"Little India of Singapore is the best place to pick up some saffron for the foodies back home, they are plenty, cheap and hardly take up any space."
,,Singapore s Little Things In Little India,3.0,,"Singapore a Hub a Tourist Place a Attraction a Holiday Place a Honeymoon Place where every International Tourist from India either starts his International Tourism or follows his further Tour.
Lots Of Attraction and a Dream to Visit Singapore.Singapore has Huge sparkling malls areas to shop but Little India has Its Own Identity.
Indian Person likes to be part of Little india.It has its own Value thats the reason Person wishes to Visit.It has shops of Big Singapore country s small things.It has a Indian Essence which you will like to have away from India In Singapore.
Speciality of Area is The festival Preparations starts over here far before the preparations start in India.Diwali preparations starts in Ganpati with different colours Lightings Banners on Roads just embedding the festival In People.You can find almost every thing you need,as many Indians have business you can have the benefit of Language
By my means every Tourist In Singapore should visit Little india for Indian Essence Culture and Tradition."
,,Very busy,3.0,,"Little India can get very crowded, so make sure you're prepared for that. It's a good place to come at lunchtime to get a curry or a dosa, or to buy some Indian oriented merchandise. Easily accessible from the Little India MRT station."
,,colurful,4.0,,"Little India is, the centre for the large Indian community in Singapore. While a rather sanitized version of the real thing, Little India retains its distinct identity without degenerating into a mere tourist attraction and is one of the most colorful and attractive places to visit in Singapore. Little India's primary attraction is the town itself. Here too you can find the gaily painted shop houses that are an icon of Singapore. Stores hawk saris and gold bangles, spices and incense waft in from the doorways and Bollywood's latest sound tracks blare from every other alleyway. The central streets of Little India are packed with stalls selling all sorts of Indian goods. Two giant shopping centres, however, are unique not just in Little India but all of Singapore: The thing to eat in Little India is obviously Indian food. Both southern and northern cuisines are well represented, food is cheap even by Singaporean standards, portions are generous and vegetarians in particular will have a field day. Note that these are authentic Indian places and people around you will be eating the way Indians do, namely with their hands, it's best to shed your inhibitions and dig in."
,,Worth a visit for the different culture,3.0,,When visiting Singapore a trip to Little India is worthwhile. Certainly the place appeared messy and even dirty being so different to other parts of Singapore but it is interesting to witness this culture on their daily activities. For the ladies you will be amazed at the colours and styles of the traditional clothing. Have a wonder through a few of the clothing shops. Also the jewellery shops are amazing. We did a lot of 'window shopping'.
,,Things to Do. Things to Avoid- Local Expat Perspective.,3.0,,"You may not visit Little India if you have visited India before, as honestly there is nothing much to 'see' or 'do'.
Still if you come here, it may as well be for the following reasons:
1. Eat: Idlis at Murugan Idli (esp for breakfast or snacking), shop located opp gate no 5 Mustafa store on Syed Alwi road. They have another outlet in Racecourse road but that is closed for renovation for more than 6 months now.
2. Eat: authentic Biryani at the following places all along Racecourse road: Muthu's Curry, Banana Leaf Apollo, and Gayatri(I havent tried the last one but hear its not bad). Most other eateries serve the same fare which is South Indian dishes. If you do not like spicy food, avoid Anjappar, which has stuff grossly avoidable. Look for 'A' certificate behind billing counters or on the entrance before choosing a place, as it signifies hygiene standards as specified by Singapore govt.
3. Eat: North Indian food at Jaggi's on Racecourse Road - good butter chicken and mutton curry. Most of the food items here are good, and reasonably priced.
4. Eat: Bengali cuisine at Mustard- must try Daab Chingri, Chicken Rezala, Kosha Mangsho, Fish cutlet, Radhaballavi. Authentic taste, and a good meal will cost you 35$ per person. The food here goes very well with the Indian rum Old Monk, which you need to mix - 30ml rum, 100ml coke, and 70ml water for the best taste.
5. Buy: cheaper than duty free prices perfume (all authentic, not fake) at Mustafa stores near Farrer Park end of Little India on Serangoon Road. Be wary of the crowd here on weekends, and if i may suggest- Do not come to this area on Sat after 6pm and the whole of Sundays. Also avoidable on evenings on public holdiays. Mustafa is also known to stock everything Indian, and is probably the biggest store in Singapore. Currency exchange rates at Mustafa are also one of the lowest in SE Asia region.
6. Buy: Low priced mobile phones at Niranjan Electronics at Racecourse road.
7. Foot Massage at any branches of Wan Yang is a painfully unique experience. It will hurt you like crazy, but its supposed to be therapeutic. See their branch addresses online and appointments are recommended. They have an outlet in City Square Mall on Farrer park mrt station.
8. Eat: if you are looking for authentic Bangladeshi food, the. Try Ghorowa at Rowell Road. Its unpredictable as some days the food is good, and other days avoidable. They make Hilsa or Ilish in mustard well, along with some veg fares. The meat is passable or rather avoidable.
9. Photography- there are two temples, one near little india mrt end of serangoon road and the other beyond farrer park end. However they are not as grand as some temples in Cambodia, Thailand and ofcourse India.
10. Cheap but Good food- Go straight to the food court on 4th floor of City Square Mall. An avg meal here can cost around 5-6$, and you will not be disappointed. Most of the Indian restaurants are over priced, but they are catering to eager tourists here. There are a few cheaper options in Chander Road which is in between Race course and Serangoon Road. These include some Indian and not so authentic Nepalese cuisine.
11. On principle and for my emotional reasons avoid MTR restaurant on Serangoon road. They are over priced, portions are very low, and they are rude. I saw the lady manager turn away a lady tourist who was in some emergency need to use a toilet! I think when you are catering to tourists, you should be considerate.
Finally if you have any specific queries on this area, do write to me, and I will try my best to help or guide you. Thank you."
,,look i liked it,3.0,,semi clean location. Good Indian food with cheap hotels ect. eat were the locals eat and then use the MRT to get into the city. roughly 10 minute MRT trip. Taxi to orchard road your looking at $10 fair.
,,Indian vegetarian food,3.0,,"Lots of good restaurants for Indian vegetarian food, especially South Indian fare. Street shopping is very crowded."
,,Big surprise in Little India,4.0,,"We have been either visiting friends in Singapore or transiting it for over 30 years. But never visited Little India until this year. We expected perhaps at most a couple of characterful streets with colonial shop houses but wow, what a pleasant surprise to come across a relatively large area that was like a blast from the past ! So nice to see so many colonial shop houses in good nick, occupied by what appears to be a thriving mostly Indian community. What a stark and welcome contrast to modern Singapore.

If have a few hours to spare, do take a stroll and poke your noses around the place. You won't be disappointed. When hunger raises it's head, you will be spoilt by the choice of Indian restaurants."
,,It was fun,5.0,,"We liked travelling there but it was so dirty. U can have great henna drawings to ur hand but it was a little bit expensive. If your stomach is sensitive, avoid eating there"
,,Terrible :-(,1.0,,"I guess people go there for a taste of India, but I've got to say it is crowded, DIRTY, unkept, and so unorganized! I couldn't believe the Govt of Singapore allows this place to remain like this, in the heart of their beautiful organized and almost squeaky-clean country!
I didn't think the food in
Little India was all that great, and there's hardly a restaurant with a good ambience. There are better indian restaurants in rest of Singapore than in little India. And in 99% restaurants in little India I was worried about the standards of cleanliness and food handling. The streets are crowded and dirty. If I were on a short trip to Singapore, I wouldn't waste time in little India."
,,Very crowded and crazy,3.0,,"Little India is a crazy place to go shopping not bad but too many people. Quality of goods only average Lots of good restaurants, with prices varying from cheap to expensive."
,,Authentic Indian Melting Pot,4.0,,"Little India is almost all the Indian cultures crammed into one area minus the cows and what falls from them. The aromatic smells of spices and curries waft through the air from the restaurants and, Yes! It's where you can find some of the best Indian dishes there. I especially love the dosai and apum from the vegetarian restaurants. Peacock feathers go cheap here and they're lovely to use as decor and I use they to ward off house lizards too. Forget visiting on Sunday's as its wayyy too crowded."
,,Shopping and Food,4.0,,"Great place to soak in some very amazing markets. The colours and scenery are great. The people are all very friendly and its a great vibe.

Also there are a large amount of restaurants to visit I would recommend The Banana Leaf. It has great Indian food well priced and I loved eating it the traditional way with my fingers."
,,We had a ball!!!,5.0,,"Went to little India during Deepvali festival & we could not believe the beautiful lights!!! Our jaws dropped at all the gold in the shops plus shops we could also afford. Highlight was Mr Mutafas department store. You could spend hours here. Open 24/7 & sells everything from a nail rush to . $$$ gold bling. We ended up buying some bling jewellery very cheaply. Also Luved the the food, the whole experience. Not to be missed. Go in the evening to apprentice the lights AAA+++. We loved little India!!!!"
,,"Good place,Many Indian eating joints",4.0,,"As the name suggests, this place is like a little India in the Singapore city. You would get a feel as if you are in Chennai. Decent place for food etc, however gets extremely crowded on weekends and suggest avoiding it. Should go only for food and Mustafa."
,,A taste of India in Singapore,5.0,,"Having been to India twice, resulting a mini-obsession with the country, Little India was always a place we were going to spend some time whilst in Singapore.

As others have mentioned, this area of Singapore feels like a million miles away from the rest of the country.

Even if you don't specifically need anything, head over for walk along the streets and soak up the atmosphere.

Listen to the latest Bollywood hits blasting from every second shop, which surely makes communication inside near impossible.
Smell the fragrance of incense and the aromas of fresh curries and spices.
See the colourful clothing and vegetables in the many shops and the decorations that adorn the street.

The food options are varied and plentiful and this area is a haven for vegetarians.
Head to Tekka Centre for the ultimate indian hawker food and check out the wet market next door.
There are also many restaurants, serving both veg (some pure veg) and non-veg options. Look out for the shops selling freshly made Indian sweets - don't be afraid to try. Ask for suggestions if you need!

There is never a dull moment in frenetic Little India and you will often find yourself battling to even walk down the footpath.

Come to shop, eat or just watch. It does't matter. Just go!"
,,Good gold stores and Indian restaurants,4.0,,"Good location and u can easily find a lot of Indian restaurants if u love Indian food. It was raining when I and my friends went to there. We had a big lunch in a very big ""hall "" which is near by the subway entrance, cannot remember the exact location, we also enjoyed the big bottle Guinness beer with some local people in there."
,,Sensory overload,5.0,,"We had a great few hours here. We went to Little India looking for the Mustafa mall which we never found, but instead found the sights and smells of Little India. What a wonderful vision this place is. Great to pick up a bite to eat or something to drink, and some authentic souvenirs"
,,Beware of Sunday nights!,4.0,,"As it name suggests this area of Singapore is packed with Indian food / shops and a market. The main street was had decorations between the lamp posts during our visit (coming up to Diwali) and there are so many places to explore on the side streets. As always you will find the best prices, and best food, tucked away on the back streets rather than in the air-conditioned places on the main street, but be aware that on Sunday nights the area is packed with migrant workers doing their weekly shopping and we could not even get into the Mustafa Centre (which is packed with bargains). The evening market is full of stalls, including sugar cane juice which is most refreshing in the heat."
,,into another dimension...,4.0,,"Crossing the road from my hotel and into Little India, really was for me like stepping thru some kind of portal into another realm, so distinctly different it is from the rest of Singapore. I mean that in the most complimentary of ways. We were fortunate enough to head there on a Sunday evening, the streets littered with locals enjoying, what we were informed as, their solitary day off!! The sights, sounds and smells sent our senses into hyperdrive. We shopped, haggled, cooled off with some tasty beverages, then ate til we could eat no more‚Ä¶fantastic I say!! Silks, spices, silver, temples and much more will leave everyones hunger abated."
,,Walk on the Wild Side,4.0,,"Great shops, restaurants, and market stalls. Try some of the Hawker centers as well. Lots of eye candy to be taken in and lots of great buildings, temples, etc. to view"
,,Interesting,4.0,,Great shops and restaurants very lively and crowded.You can barter in the market and get good deals.Iti is worth spending a few hours browsing round Little India.
,,Happy Deepavali!,4.0,,"I was lucky enough to experience Little India on the final night of the traditional Deepavali festival. The place was ELECTRIC! Loads of lights and crackers, and very happy people! I didn't stay long as I'd popped in for a quick look post night-tour and had an early start the next day. The next morning (around 0900) it was a very quiet little market place with only the one stall open (I think there might have been a few sore heads after the previous night celebrations). Little India is definitely worth a visit if you're looking for cheap souvenirs and authentic food."
,,"Like India for real, I believe",4.0,,"Interesting place, looks as, what I believe at least, real India. Most of this is where real people live, it's not a set-up for tourists. Very crowded, lots of small shops and restaurants, recommended if you want to go to a place where you get to know the real Singapore, not just the rich areas. I found a small restaurant in the corner of Serangoon and Perumal Rd where I got a large bottled Carlsberg for less than half the price compared to the centre of Singapore. The food is also real cheap."
,,Excellent Bargain,5.0,,A lot of choice especially for women fashion clothes. One must bargain a lot to get it at right price. Shopping is not complete if you don't visit Little India market.
,,Interesting,4.0,,Much to choose from when shopping here. You could spend many hours in this area. It didnt take very long for me to find exactly what I was looking for.
,,Love this place.,5.0,,"My family loves visiting Little India. The colour, smells and food are absolutely wonderful. We try not to eat on the main Serangoon Rd. Try Dunlop Street. Or the Tekka Centre Hawkers. A great place to by vegetables also. Currently the Deepavali lights are up so get in and have a look before they come down."
,,Disgusting,1.0,,This place is extremely disgusting.This place is just full of Indian style markets and the place is extremely crowded.It's basically a shopping paradise for cheap stuff.Getting taxis is extremely difficult from this place especially on weekends.Not recommended for family on weekends.
,,"See the sights, smell the aroma and enjoy the food",4.0,,"What a feast for the senses. Whether you eat in the food hall on the street or in a local restaurant this place is vibrant.
Easily walk around and along the streets you buy probably anything here.
The food hall was very interesting seeing little tiny booths dishing out great delights. We ate at several of the booths. We had some onions bhargies were delightful and so tasty.

We did have a curry from another stall this was good but would not say great.

There are lots of tables and chairs for you to enjoy your food.

One thing I did notice that the portions we got were a lot smaller than want the locals got. I guess they thought westerners don't eat much.

The food was not cheap but compared to other places in Singapore offered good value.

It's a must on a visit to Singapore whether it's to buy food or bracelets.

If you use the hop on bus this is one of their stops."
,,A great district to explore whilst in Singapore... Sense's overload.,4.0,,"The Little India District of Singapore is a great area to walk around and overload your senses... So much to see and experience, and loads of great photo opportunities if a keen travel photographer.

There are markets, temples, food stalls, great old colonial buildings and interesting characters abound... What more do you need for a memorable travel experience.

Do go and visit the amazing 'Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple' (see my other review) as it's fantastic, so colourful and atmospheric. The markets and flower garland sellers in the Buffalo Road and Campbell Lane area, just off of the main Serangoon Road, are also a nice experience."
,,So much to explore,4.0,,"We picked up a Field Guide to Little India from the Tourist Board (they hold a wealth of info), which proved helpful as there's so many streets & areas to visit. We visited the Temples, two of which are outstandingly ornate and spectacular (Serangoon Road). Enjoyed trying a variety of foods at the food courts and very cheap. We avoided the restaurants where some staff are outside trying to entice you in (very pushy). There's an abundance of shops selling Jewellery and variety of gifts. There is a diversity of foods to be found here to please everyone. Some streets were particularly dirty, unkept and in need of repair - this did not however detract from the experience. Was so glad I wore my walking shoes - a definite must."
,,Lunch,5.0,,"This place was amazing.
We visited for our lunch after hopping off the city sightseeing bus.
The food courts were extremely busy.
The staff were helpful and kept you right for making your choice.
We spent 30 mins walking round all of the stalls trying to decide what we would eat.
It's ridiculously cheap to eat here. It means that you can be adventurous and nit worry if you don't like something.
Just purchase a replacement.
My wife doesn't like spicy food like myself, after some discussions with the stall vendors she got sorted out.
You have to visit this part of Singapore.
It's a amazing skill watching Indians eat from a banana leaf with their hands.
I tried it and made a mess, with bits of my Biriyani & rice flying everywhere."
,,Experience India abroad,3.0,,"Typical Indian style markets, very crowded and a shopping paradise for cheap stuff. Getting taxis is very difficult from here, especially on weekends. Not recommended for family on weekends!"
,,Interesting place to explore,4.0,,"Markets and stalls with food and souvenirs and everything else you could want. Shops as well with gold and jewels. Lots of good restaurants but I don't think we went to one, was a bit too touristy."
,,"Can go here for Indian food, but that's about it",3.0,,"Well, there is nothing much to do here. Unless you want to get a feel of India in Singapore.Or you want to have Indian food - there are plenty of options here (we tried Ananda Bhavan and Saravana bhavan, both were good and not too expensive either). Mustafa Centre is here as well. But IMHO not much here for a tourist - it is just like Walmart/Big Bazaar.Can be avoided unless you are looking to buy something specifically.

Important : avoid on Sunday. It was too crowded."
,,Good for tourists and locals,4.0,,"For tourist:

This is the place you want to have a glance about (part of) Indian culture in Singapore. The area dominated by Southern Indian (Tamil) population, at least you will be able to see temples, mosques, and certainly people just like in India.

To find good deals on souvenirs and gadgets, go to Mohammed Mustafa mega shop which is open 24 hours, so business travellers can go there at night without have to escape your busy conference schedule.

If you don't feel like the crowd or ambience, you may stay somewhere else but visiting this place is compulsory :)

For locals:

You must visit this place at least once in your lifetime in Singapore. The country has multicultural root and it is good to know each other cultures. Don't believe what other people say until you see it with your own eyes. If you smile to them, they will return to you with a bigger smile."
,,Just Like being in Chennai,3.0,,"If you are fond of Indian food during your visit, then its worth staying here, yeap you have lots of option of Indian Vegetarian restaurant. Else its same like being any south Indian cities.
Its not as clean as other parts of Singapore.

And going to Mustafa, I don't think you have to visit this place, unless you have any specific item to purchase, other wise its like any other shopping centre we find in India, only pro is its open 24 hours and everything under one roof.

I stayed here as we wanted Indian vegetarian food.
Its well connected with MRT, Little India and Farrer Park MRT station are within Little India, there are several buses going around."
,,Smells & Taste of India,4.0,,"Start your trip from Little India Station on Serangoon Road up to Mustafa center. Crowded and like being in a market area in india. all indian banks, hotels and restaurants are in this area itself. it is a part of city sight seeing tours"
,,Just crowded shopping street,2.0,,On the day we visited it was just very crowded shopping street and nothing more. Walked around for 20 minutes and the scene did not change so we moved to somewhere else. It is not worth exploring as an area on its own unless you going there for a meal or to visit specific shop. We also had a peeked into the main shopping mall (I think it is called Mustafa) and it wasn't cheap.
,,Feels like being in India....to an extent,5.0,,"Having traveled several times in India, a lot of the sights, sounds and particularly smells brought me right back. Since I went during the festival of Durga Puja and leading up to Diwali there was a lot going on and this would be the perfect time to visit Little India. There are a lot of festival markets for Diwali where you can buy deepas, garlands and other decorations along with household items and clothing. It is a great place to get good Indian food, both the cheap and no-frills and more expensive restaurants. If you have never tried South Indian staples such as dosa and idli this is a great place to eat them."
,,Fantastic Food,5.0,,"If you love Indian food, then do yourself a favour and head to one of the local food markets here - you won't be disappointed. It was amazingly great!"
,,Little India- a Tamil Nadu outside india.,5.0,,"When you are there, you will forget that you are out of India. The people you meet, the eateries ( there are a whole host of Indian resturants ) the shops (including Mustafas) , and even Barber shops sport pics of Indian stars (mostly Tamil) And there is a typical tamil temple. Mustafas has almost everything available in India- I mean almost everything."
,,Not Singapore,2.0,,"Little India is like being in India, messy and noisy. Not the clean Singapore. Nice to see the festival decorations but would not go there again."
,,Little India..........for sure,3.0,,"We made a deliberate b-line for this place at night with it being decidedly cooler because I think it could be a whole lot different during the heat of day. Apart from that a night time visit is far more worth it due to the fantastic overhanging lights all the way down the street which you would not see in the daytime. It is nothing short of superb.
It is located very close to the Little India MRT station and is only a short walk from there.
As you wander down the street you are taken by the wall to wall bling in many of the stores, heaps of textile shops, restaurants and much, much more.
It really is a little piece of India plonked right in the middle of Singapore."
,,Great food and culture,3.0,,"If you want to experience nice indian food and are into indian clothes and gold jewellery, then it's a must. Otherwise it's a good experience to just have a look at what little India is all about. It's hard to get a taxi when all the shops close at 10, so make sure you book one or use public transport. It took us a good hour to get a taxi that was available! One taxi driver couldn't go to our hotel as he had to go to the toilet! Hahaha! Best time to go.would be early evening for dinner and then explore at night."
,,"Colorful, Noisy at times, Great Place for Vegetarians",4.0,,"Little India is actually a little India inside Singapore. Full of colorful shops and Indian cafes. Lot of bargain shops as well.

You can find goods at a lower prices compared to other parts of Singapore. But some merchandise the quality is low. If you explore, you may find good quality stuff at lower or reasonable price. I have bought electronic products from Mustafa, the 24 hour open super market. Before purchasing I did check from original manufacturer and found Mustafa is their agent.

You can find Indian food and also pure Vegetarian cafes in abundance.

In Sundays, the place get over crowded. The nearest MRT stations are Little India and Farrer Park"
,,Mixed feelings,2.0,,"There are very mixed feelings amongst locals and tourists about little india, and most either love it or dislike it, and this also seems reflective of whom is reviewing it on this site, so you have to go see for yourself.

Can come across as a bit dull, dirty and average in places yet it also is colourful, real and lively especially in the evenings.

Seemed to be lots of construction around the main roads

Overall just average."
,,"Vibrant atmosphere, especially on sundays",4.0,,"A real feeling and taste of Indian culture, habits and food in the heart of Singapore. Explore the little streets and restaurants, temples and shops in order to get to know the very lively and ever-growing Indian community of Singapore.

Sundays are especially busy and crowded as the workers celebrate their only day off of the week by meeting up and spending time together in Little India. You should avoid this place on any Sunday if you are claustrophobic, otherwise hop in and enjoy the ride!"
,,Indian food and shopping,3.0,,"If you are looking for Indian food, the kind you will not get in a regular Indian restaurant, you will find it in little India. Also if you are shopping for something specific and Indian, then this is the place. This apart there is a temple and a huge shopping store (Mustafa) in this area. Mustafa is open 24 hours and you can find most of the things here. That apart there is nothing more in this area."
,,Really Little India,5.0,,A place to feel Indian atmosphere while at SIngapore. Lot of shops to buy chocolates and goodies. Enjoy Indian food in all famous Indian hotels
,,India in Singapore with a different perspective!!!,5.0,,"Little can sometimes be confusing for people who have never been to India and think India is actually like this. Most shops, restaurants and other things around Little India trend to be on South Indian nature which is awesome. However there are few North Indian restaurants around like Jungle Tandoor on Serangoon Road.

As one would know India is vast and cultures differ from one state to other so as the language. Little India is an effort to bring this vast country into a suburb in Singapore. They are trying hard to match with his vast country and for some this might sound boring. However, if you are away from India and need to have some spice filled food then you surely must visit this place.

Serangoon Road is lined with souvenier shops and restaurants along with temples as well. Little is an attempt to show Singapore's diversity and cultural tolerance towards multiculturalism."
,,Colorful but a bit boring,3.0,,We visited it during the day so it might be totally different at night. The nice architectural building are beautiful to watch but besides that it was a bit empty and lifeless. We saw a little market but it didn't really looked appealing.
,,Good experience,4.0,,This is a very busy indian food and and indian shopping. One can find almost all the cousines here in Little india.Mustafa shopping center is also near to little india.
,,Little India..Safe..better than India. More like Durban,5.0,,"My wife and I visited little India, using the Hopp on and Hopp off Red Bus tours. Being Singapore, it was a safe and non threatning, hussle and bussle visit.In fact it was so good, we revisted for a 'Durban Curry' and again for Shopping. It is the chaotic side of Singapore.Safe, crazy. fun..Do visit..recommend a day on the Hop on and Off Red Bus.Leave if tired, via hopp on off bus..Did I mention.we went back again, third time,to buy kilo's of silk materials.from Tony fashions and in house tailors. Next time..go to Singapore with empty luggage.buy all your clothes, or have Tony Fashion make them within a day.Less expensive than most."
,,An Interesting Place to Visit,4.0,,"I always find something interesting in Little India. The shops always have something new to experience, the Masque was a highlight. There are several restaurants that I always go back to for the wonderful food they prepare."
,,Nothing spectacular,3.0,,"Nothing special, vegetable/fruit market worth a visit but for the rest it's a waste of time. It does not have the same character like many other Indian markets around the world. Food court - food did not look appetising and it was quite messy after probably a very busy lunch hour."
,,Nice experience,3.0,,"Little India.. Great experience to see indian restaurants, shops, spices, and market.. You will know you are there when smell the unique scent and colourful buildings.."
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"This is a road with shops on selling cheap tat, that's it, very little to see or do other than walk up and down it. Not got the character of China town. It was dirty, not closed off to traffic and crowded on Sunday with young Indian men hanging about in groups - if you have teen daughters I'd recommend not going here as the constant stares and occasional comments are disgusting."
,,Very busy,4.0,,This is a very busy indian food and and indian shopping. One can find almost all the cousines here in Little india.Mustafa shopping center is also near to little india.
,,Very busy,4.0,,this is a very busy place. I bought some indian clothes for my granddaughters as they love the sparkling dresses. There are a lot of food choices here. Mrt station here
,,Watch the footpath,3.0,,"Interesting to be here during deepawali, / Diwali which is a Hindu festival of lights. Extremely colourful. But watch your step, as there is a lot of uneven pavement. Interesting architecture. plenty of market stalls to bargain at"
,,A disappointing area in fabulous Singapore,2.0,,"Smelly, dirty and littered with garbage. After having been in India just a few months ago, I was really disappointed with what had purported to be an interesting area of Singapore. I can't recommend a trip to this area of the great city of Singapore. If you have only a few days explore the many beautiful areas of the city."
,,Nothing Special,3.0,,"Just an area of Singapore where there are a lot of India stores, restaurants, and other businesses catering to the Indian population."
,,The Indian Feel,4.0,,"When I get the opportunity to visit Little India in Singapore, I enjoy visiting the place primarily because I like all things 'Indian'. Little India is home to the Indian community in Singapore. One can find authentic Indian cuisines with different price range. Beverages like lassie (Indian yoghurt drink), Indian ginger tea (teh halia) and Indian spiced tea (teh masala) are good. For the artsy lovers you may find some treasures of art even in some shops along small lanes. Ladies looking for costume jewellery can find lovely, glittering bangles with beautiful designs, not forgetting the beautiful saris and punjabi suits. The architecture of the Hindu temples are also worthy sites to visit. December 23, 2014 is designated as the public holiday of Deepavali. It is known as the Festival of Light. This will be a good time to visit Little India. There will be a big light up where the place will be creatively decorated with dazzling, colorful lights and oil lamps. The oil lamps usher in light, good will and fortune to the homes. Little India has changed somewhat over the years, it used to be more traditional. But the Indian vipe and feel continue to draw visitors there."
,,No need to spend too much time here,2.0,,"Probably I have been to India, so I didn't really wanna go to little India again. Honestly, nothing special here. Only recommend people who never been to India but feel curious about or interested in Indian life style. Otherwise, you can just skip here. I even don't wanna try food here. Not very clean area, as a woman, not felt very secured walking alone because they stared at you as you never found out. However, there are quite a few budget hotels here. So if you want to have cheap hotels, you may find one near here, again, not really for female travelers, especially traveling alone."
,,really its a little India,5.0,,"when i visited this place , i felt as if i were in Tamilnadu. There are many indian stores, restaurants. Lot of hindu temples are located here. You will enjoy the place by doing some purchases or just walking on the streets."
,,Dissapointing,3.0,,I was disappointed with little India in Singapore. It was mostly mobile phone stalls and other electrics and very expensive gold shops. It didn't have a very nice atmosphere.
,,My favorite corner,4.0,,Went for a vacation nd stayed in park royal hotel in dat area. One of its best. I loved shopping in city square mall nd many other places.. beautiful place. Delicious restaurants. Wish to go once again nd enjoy all dat once more. Best ever
,,"Would not stay again, India in Singapore",1.0,,"Everything is indian based, Indians own almost every store, feels like a different set of rules, do need to dress quite covered up, didn't feel safe at night walking around, approached on numerous occasions by men in both day light and night time, all restaurants were Indian based, curry stores everywhere, no shops, wouldn't stay here again..."
,,Awesome curry,5.0,,"Amazing curry. Although more expensive than curries through malaysia, food here was a lot cheaper than other places in Singapore and as good if not better."
,,A must for all curry munchers,4.0,,A mix of good and bad. A must see for all visitors to Singapore because this place shows the full indian aspect of India in a very small way. Has the great Mustafa complex that sells items as small as a needle to stuff as big as washing machines etc.Than comes the chillie crabs which are the best in the world and the Banana Leaf is the place to go. Shopping is quite cheap here compared to malls and other shops around Orchard road. An eye opener for all tourists.
,,"Crowded, dirty, overwhelming and GREAT!",4.0,,"Great place to see an authentic Indian neighborhood. Sure, it‚Äôs crowded, dirty and may be a little overwhelming, but it‚Äôs a great chance to experience a little of Indian food and culture. Dozens of shops, many with souvenirs, jewelry and clothes. Lots of food stands. The Hindu temple interesting and welcoming. Definitely worth a visit."
,,pin it on your next,4.0,,"Not know what are you looking for, and what come to your mind. I love everything about India, no matter where is north or south, as long as indian stuffs, I go for it.

Hence I visit s'pore with my Malaysian friend for renewing my visa while I was working in Malaysia. It was such a nice and cool place for travellors and visitors.

We walked from China Town to Little India by Map Reading lol not bad as being a girls whom is good with Maths (my friend). We had wonderful indian vegetarian meals here, there are many choices to be selected.

Well, as asian travellors, you are in budget, we have to tight up our money, then, need to think properly what to eat and where is the best for budget"
,,Disappointing location to visit,3.0,,"Travelled on the MRT to have a look at the Little India area. Some of the buildings were interesting to see. Very colourful. Was looking forward to having some indian food but after waiting in a queue at 2 different outdoor food outlets, only to be ignored, and having males served before me and treated as if I didn't exist, I got back on the train and went to eat elsewhere. If female travelling alone I wouldn't recommend."
,,Avoid it,1.0,,"Dont go there when travelling with kids, streets are dirty and you most probably would pick up a bug when eating in one of the restaurants. If you wanna eat indian, go to restaurants in Orchard Road or anywhere else. The market above the MRT Train Station is nothing special. I have lived in Singapore, only went there once and never again. You might find a good restaurant if you are lucky, but there are 10 others that you dont wanna eat..."
,,Assault on the senses!,3.0,,"A real eye opener. We ate at the hawkers market (great food at reasonable prices) and wandered through the streets and shops. There were lots of colorful characters - this was certainly the dodgiest part of Singapore I had experienced! All in all, an interesting place to see."
,,Feast of Colour,5.0,,I absolutely loved Little India. Little vegetable shops along the sidewalk have a small grocery/hardware shop tucked into a tiny space behind. Shop owners were so friendly but not at all pushy - dignified is a word which comes to mind. I loved the covered market - food on the bottom and saris on top! I bought some lovely bits and pieces for next to nothing. We ate in a little place on a sidestreet - under $11 for lunch for two - including soft drinks. There is no attempt made to exploit the tourist here - I was truly humbled by the prices here and I just hope that the traders can survive on the prices they charge. This is a must visit for anyone spending a couple of days in Singapore as it would be all too easy to come away with the impression that the designer boutiques of Orchard Rd are the flagship. Go to Little India - it's well worth the visit and easily accessible on underground.
,,Food and shopping,4.0,,"If you are in a mood to try Indian food, this is the place to be. Have some clothes shops too. Don't think it will appeal everyone add it's mostly Indian wear, but if you wanna try something, why not? The popular Mustafa mall is also located here."
,,Visit if you want to try great food!,2.0,,"I dint enjoy being there! Of course, the food was great we went to Sankranthi to try south Indian food and it was purely delicious! and yes you can expect lot of unavoidable staring!"
,,some nice old buildings and restaurants,2.0,,"some f the shops are housed in old houses, they are quite attractive. Obviously the restaurants are fine. But other than that, there isn't a whole damn lot to see here, except for tatty shops."
,,Little India in Singapore,4.0,,"Such a fascinating place. There are so many small colorful shops & stalls and interesting to walk around. It is very busy with lots of people & for a minute you start to forget that you were in Singapore as you can smell the spices, and surrounded by Indian people. Very exotic feel to the place.

If you get hungry, why not try the authentic Indian food? There are many restaurants to choose from. I had a really delicious meal for such a cheap price. For less than S$10, I had a set of curry which included 3 different types of curries, saffron rice, nhan bread, & condiment, plus drink. The restaurant I went to was busy with locals & that was good enough for me try. I tired to eat with fingers like others there but I was hopeless at it, the person next to me got me a spoon.

Shopping was interesting as well. They are not necessarily the kind of things you'd buy or want but window shopping was fun. Some shop keepers can be a little aggressive but just say no thank you & they will leave you alone."
,,Not the nicest part of Singapore,3.0,,"We visited as part of an organised tour around the city. Was quite disappointed. Quite dirty and not very welcoming. Some beautiful buildings, bright and colourful. Short visit."
,,Another must do experience,4.0,,If this is your first visit then don't miss roaming around little India and the shopping arcades. Goods are as expected which are not the best of quality but lots of fun bargaining for stuff you really don't need. Eat at one of the banana leaf restaurants with a multitude of food choices.
,,Visit Little India for some great Indian food,4.0,,"Very busy area lots of shops and restaurants. Restaurants have great food, large portions and cheap prices. Most open late some are 24 hours. If you like to shop visit Mustafa. The shop carries everything and quite cheap. I found it safe walking here at night. I even got lost and just asks locals for directions. But all pointed in different directions."
,,Very dirty place and crowded,2.0,,"The visit to little india left me wondering how come this part of the city can be so different from the rest of Singapore.
The richness of indian culture is really undermined by the dirt in the restaurants and the streets.
Shouldn t be an equivalent, dirt is not necessarily indian culture at all.
I think that the business man in the area they just could do a little more to have the place more pleasant for a visitor."
,,realy little,4.0,,"this is a really small place, just a few streets.
But worth seeing, you will feel the climate of India, shops, market stalls, local restaurants.

This will take you to a maximum of one hour, unless you consume a shopping or spend a nice time in one of the local restaurants."
,,VEG. Indian food,4.0,,"If you are vegetarian this is the place to be, you can find all variety of Indian food here, Its close to MRT..................................................."
,,Looks are deceiving,3.0,,Good perfume prices and nic naks gallor plenty of jewellery shops great food even if it don's look like the trendiest place the food was brilliant.
,,Food trip,4.0,,Great stopover for those who want to try something new. Food is relatively cheaper here compared to other places in Singapore.
,,Don't go on a Sunday!,2.0,,"I went with my husband and the streets were packed to the brim with Indian men. I felt extremely uncomfortable and out of place. Apparently this is the day they have off so they congregate on the street. It had a very bad vibe to it! We couldn't get out fast enough and I would not trust the food, the street seems so dirty."
,,April 14 visit to Singapore,4.0,,"Reminds of the vibrancy of India, its cuisine, culture, traditions. Highly recommended, who would like to get a glimpse of India. Many great Restaurants serving Indian food from Norht Indian dishes to South."
,,a great experience,4.0,,We spent a day there and really enjoyed it as it was so different and full of character. Our favourite place.
,,Great!!!,5.0,,"Took the kids to Little India for sightseeing and lunch yesterday. Little India is such a fantastic learning experience for kids. We took them to a traditional South Indian restataunt where they ate on banana leaves and ate with their hands. My 2 boys enjoyed the experience so much and actually
Want to go back. This is such a fantastic place to to teach kids about another culture of Singapore instead of the affluent, fun lifestyle they are used to."
,,There's a little India????,2.0,,"Was told this was a good place to visit but really we couldn't find anything interesting.

The shops were closed and the ones that were open were dingy.

And we couldn't find anywhere to eat

Basically we left and headed to Bugis instead, I certainly wouldnt recommend visiting here"
,,"Put simply, since the riots, it's not the same place.",1.0,,"Years ago it was full of vibrancy, colour, energy and a shopping Mecca. Sadly it's no longer getting out if bed for, some stalls have moved on, the buildings are in desperate need of maintainer, there us less goods to pick from and most are now poor quality at higher prices. Worst thing is local traders and hoteliers really do not like you and go out if their way to be rude and hostile if you look English, chinese or are Singaporean chinese. I was told don't go there by Singaporean locals but my travel agent booked me in there and I couldn't believe the bad wraps. But they were right, and perhaps more unsafe than you can inagine. Sadly what was a magical place had now turned into a racist enclave full of hate and frustration, perhaps impoverishment. They may have some right to feel jaded, but they really shouldn't be rude and try pickpocket tourists because life's cards have not fell their way in recent years."
,,Little India,5.0,,I had the most amazing curry here in Singapores 'Little India' which is a market type area full of takeaway food. My food was Fantastic cost was ¬£1 and was served on a giant banana leaf.
,,Not much to recommend in Little India,2.0,,Easily accessible via the SMRT we wandered into Little India. It laked the vibrancy of Little India in Kuala Lumpur. Few flowets displayed and a lot of poor quality souvenirs. The restaurants appear to be fairly well patronised but we didn't stop to find out as we were disappointed in the over all feel.
,,Walking and shopping,4.0,,"Little India is very nice place for walking, sightseeing and shopping for bargains. I like to taste different street food there. It is tasty and safe. Of course once you are there visit Hindu temples like Sri Mariamman Temple. I prefer to visit Little India during the day as it is very crowded in the evening."
,,Cheap food,3.0,,Spent a couple of hours exploring Little India. There is nothing special about the area however there is a great hawkers market with cheap India food where we had lunch. Most people in other reviews have commented that this is probably the dirtiest part of Singapore and I would agree however it was still pretty clean. The shopping centre wasn't very good and was more of a trash and treasure type market.
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Having been to India this area was disappointing. Hard to find good shopping, although we did find a great Indian restaurant for lunch. Probably the dirtier more disappointing part of Singapore."
,,Little India in Singapore.,3.0,,"I recently took my wife and two daughters to Little India on a sunday night for dinner. It became apparent quickly that I had chosen the incorrect day and time.
The place was crowded with drunken Indian men which made it a frightening experience for my oldest daughter.

After I had spoken to a shopkeeper I was told that sunday night was when a lot of Indian men frequented the area. It was when most of them were not working.
On a positive note we tried some delicious Indian food, the chicken masala dish was both hot and spicy.

So if you intended to take the family out for dinner I would avoid a sunday night if at all possible,"
,,Dirty overcrowded,1.0,,I would not recommend this place. It was dirty and crowded and smelled bad. The stores were small and crowded and we had to walk I. The street due to no room I. The sidewalk. Chinatown is much better.
,,A Feel of South India,3.0,,A visit recommended only if you like to have a feel of South India. Nice Indian food at a reasonable price
,,Exaggerated,2.0,,"Here You can find small shops selling souvenirs. But these indian things are all over other places also,so nothing NEW."
,,"Dirty, noisy and run-down",1.0,,"I do not recommend Little India to anybody. It is noisy, dirty and run down. There was also nothing to do there apart from look at the old buildings."
,,little india singapoer is of worth for pakistani and indian people,3.0,,little india was at walking distance from our hotel albert court. it is cheap and indian and Pakistani foods and soft drinks are easily available at reasonable rates. mustafa hotel and restaurant are especially value for muslims for halal food. quality of food is good and Pakistani foods and desserts available. bofay is also . check for halal certificate in the restaurant or hotel .many kfc and McDonald restaurant also provide halal food and have halal food certificates. major bus terminal also available near Mustafa centre for Malaysia. bazzars and shopping centres in little india are costly and are of no worth quality wise.
,,Away from the squeaky clean.,4.0,,"It's not dirty but seems to have the oldest buildings in Singapore. The scene of what was quite possibly the only street riot since independence. The only area that has government imposed alcohol restrictions ( as a result of the riots ). If you want to go west of pristine then this is a great place. As with most of Singapore it's best avoided on weekends. Every Indian and his dog on the island has the day off and that's where they head.
An eye opener."
,,The only grubby place in Singapore,3.0,,"I wasn't particularly overwhelmed with this. We have been to Singapore several times, and have seen this area before, but on my last visit it felt quite grubby (unusual in Singapore) and really nothing very much to see there as such. Easy to get to if you want to see if, just for curiosity sake."
,,Amazing Area!,5.0,,We took the MRT from Chinatown to Little India. What an amazing difference for a 5 minute ride. We went from the smells of fish sauce to curry and felt like we were in a different city! The area has great food and many interesting temples. There are also good shopping areas for handmade Indian goods.
,,Missing India Visit this place in Singapore,5.0,,"you will recall how India looks like. You will get everything from food, vegetables, to goods which are popular in India. everything from Indian aggarbatti to pan to your churrans and other rare to find stuff."
,,Not clean,1.0,,"We have been three times,mainly for Mustafa's centre.it is crowded and not as clean as the reataurant of Singapore.also we had lunch in on of its restuarants ,good food but poor presentation"
,,dont do it,1.0,,"sorry but not my cup off tea,the traffic & noise was unbearable to be fair lots off road works happening in area not dirty but certainly very old & in real need off some mintenance"
,,Absolute Filth. Total misrepresentation of India,1.0,,"While on a business trip, I had a craving for India food. So I was told that Little India is the place to go. Worst advice I could have possibly got. The roads are dirtier than a vege market in India. The restaurants has such dingy look from outside that it feels like you'd catch a virus or 2 just walking in there..

Came back to the city and had a decent meal at Clarke Quay.."
,,Feels like back home!,4.0,,"If you are tired of the spotlessly clean roads and huge skyscrapers in Singapore, a visit to Little India will make you feel that you're back home! Lots and lots of Indian restaurants, and pretty inexpensive too."
,,24 hours for shopping,4.0,,"Traditional area served by both Little India MRT & Farrer Park MRT, you can reach with walk. And also a traditional market who provided all kind the Sari's (India traditional fabric), India's food and many choice of India seasoning. Indian cuisine is very tasty and tempting tastes, such as roti prata, curry chicken, etc.
Even with a fairly chaotic environment, keep us going back to shop and eat in this area.
Around little india, straight roads along Serangoon Road we will get to Mustafa Center is open 24 hours, then you shop till drop. Happy shopping.."
,,Like a mini trip to India,3.0,,"Little India is India without the crowding, dirt, and poverty of the real thing. There are some good restaurants and snack stands, but many not so good as well, so choose carefully."
,,Back Home,4.0,,"Feel like you are back in India, good Indian restaurants are there , also all other kind of Indian style shops"
,,The non-sanitised side of Singapore,3.0,,"if you are tired of spotless concrete, faceless skyscrapers, and western watering holes, then have a wander around Little India - but perhaps selectively. For someone with little prior contact with South Indian culture, it makes for a good little ""taster"".

The area is served by both Little India and Farrer Street MRT stations. You might like to spend just a couple of hours here, having a walk around. It's a great area to have vegetarian and non-vegetarian Indian food, at pretty reasonable prices, and has some shopping and dining options that are unique to the area.

If you walk across the road from Little India MRT, you will found yourself in Serangoon Road. Walk about 300 yards down to reach Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, which has just been renovated and reopened. You can enter freely - remove your shoes - and even take pictures, but respectfully.

Now, on your way back up the road, you can explore the many small shops that line either side of the street, and which sell a huge array of merchandise, trinkets and souvenirs ranging from the tacky to the useful to the mind-boggling. You can bargain, to some extent. Along the way, you'll come across a restaurant called Komala Vilas. Go in and order a ""masala dosa"" (Indian pancake stuffed with potatoes and spices), and a cup of hot masala tea. Cheap, filling, delicious.

There are two tourist traps in Little India - Mustafa Centre (24-hour market selling anything under the sun, usually crowded) and Sim Lim Square (electronics; good luck with getting working warranties or spare parts, but it's cheap. Always go with a local who knows his / her way around. There are bargains here, but you need to be careful.)

By the way, do not be in the area on Sundays, unless you enjoy a massive human crush - this is when Singapore's copious amounts of foreign workers descend into the area."
,,Unique experience,3.0,,"I did not have a very pleasant experience at Little India as my comapnion and I witnessed a nonsense brawl between two, drunk Indians that freaked us out. However, we managed to explore a little part of the place such as discovering indian restaurants and delicacies which were really cheap and unique in taste. Most of the Indians we encountered were really friendly and helpful."
,,Not worth going for,1.0,,Dont bother coming here. Nothing to see. It was a big disappointment on my part. The street is stinky and dirty. I have been to different parts of India but its not like this.
,,Reminds you of the Small town in India,5.0,,been to this place late in the evening and had our dinner in one of the Indian Veg restaurants in the corner of this street.
,,underwhelming,1.0,,"I had such high expectations of Little India. Unfortunately I was very underwhelmed by the area. Sidewalks are almost impossible to walk on, and you have to watch where you walk because some of the sewer blocks are missing or cracked and you could really hurt yourself. The shopping centres were full of junk and the markets weren't any better. The food was ok and probably it's only saving grace. If I didn't travel outside of this area, I would have had a very negative opinion of Singapore."
,,A peep at Little India,4.0,,"You know exactly where you are in this part of Singapore - the somewhat messy part of the city-state (well, by Singapore standard) with unique stalls selling everything with prices so cheap you'll be dizzy with the choices available, e.g. Mustafa Center. Just go around and spend something for little things."
,,A TASTE OF INDIA,5.0,,"Little India gives you a good taste of the real thing, only in miniature.
It's a great place to wander around, and great for photography.
It's also fun to stroll along Racecourse Road trying to choose a restaurant for lunch - so many choices!
I would recommend a visit to Little India as part of your stay in Singapore."
,,Don't go if you're a lone female!,2.0,,My boyfriend and I stayed in the Bunc hostel which was great for 4 nights and every day we walked to the MRT station and I would not have liked it if I was by myself. Groups of men walking around staring at me which made me feel really uncomfortable. I was constantly watching my pockets and bag as well as it was such a busy place it would have been so easy for things to get stolen. If you go out during the day there are some great restaurants but not somewhere I'd recommend to go if you're in Singapore.
,,Sadly dirty and polluted when there is so much potential.,2.0,,"We had high expectations because of the good things we had heard about little India and Singapore and unfortunately although it was mediocre we were quite disappointed. Dirty, polluted and litter everywhere made what could've been an interesting cultural experience quite negative. There are some very good restaurants and some interesting things to look at but the markets are a joke and just full of junk and overpriced stereo typical Indian garbage."
,,Little India,4.0,,This area gives you a peek at India. For most Indians its close to home and helps with tThere is a 24 hour super sized store called Mustafa Centre which houses everything from bathroom slippers to plumbing equipment to food and clothes. It's two buildings and over 4 storeys high. Ideal for last minute shopping or mid night cravings.
,,"shop, eat and stroll in a colourful city within a city",4.0,,"Really buzzing by 11ish am. If eating, only truly fun eating here if visiting with a bunch of good friends, cos you're gonna want to order lots of the different dishes. Pace yourself and try out North Indian, South Indian, East and West Indian, cos each cuisine is quite different. Shop: Bangles and costume jewellery easily found. Pure gold shops are also nicely priced but the designs are generally very ethnic. Some pearls too. Saris and Punjabi suits are generally well priced tho the more elaborate ones, eg for dinners, can cost hundreds of dollars. Beautiful incense sticks and holders, for just a few dollars. Stroll thru the smaller lanes, which are slowly become more jazzed up of, and watch out for traffic, another reason to go with a friend!"
,,The best neighbourhood in Singapore,5.0,,"Little India is exactly that - a great slice of India. It has great restaurants, the amazing Mustafa Centre, shops, temples and pretty much everything Indian you can think of. I would happily just stay in Little India for a few days eating and drinking tea. MUST MUST MUST visit."
,,"If Orchard Road is the heart of Singapore, Little India is ...",3.0,,"We have come to Little India few times, we have even stayed at one of the hotel here, none of those times I was impressed. This place is the one of few places in Singapore where you can see rubbish laying around. If you walk around with a teenage daughter be aware as people will stare. I wouldn't bother coming here on Sundays as this place is full of foreign workers especially during the evening, even the locals try to avoid coming out during this time."
,,Another cultural side of Singapore,2.0,,"Consider carefully if you want to spend half a day in this area, there is noting much to see other than colorful buildings. the narrow sidewalks are overcrowded, and not as clean as the rest of Singapore.
You can find many stores selling some sort of jeans at around 5 SGD, gold and jewelery shops, last decade electronics shops.
Expect to be offered many invitations to restaurants with ""nice"" or ""good"" chicken."
,,Little India,5.0,,This is a place like home. You feel as though you are in India. Ladies if you want to buy gold cheaper here. Plenty of Indian restaurants lots of variety of food. Good place to visit if you miss home.
,,worth a look,4.0,,"Not quite as good as China town but again a must see if you want to introduce different cultures to your family. Loads of restaurants and street vendors, tourist buys etc. Mustafa centre not as good as it's said to be, but there is a 'western' shopping mall just over the road if you get bored with local Indian fare."
,,Little india for indians,5.0,,This area is totally filled with indian people. Sometimes you forget are you in Singapore or in india specially in Chennai ?? . But its a very safe area to rome around to shop. & don't forget if you want something to eat a god indian food like your own home. you will get here.
,,Not bad,3.0,,"Our visit to little india was not bad, although I do not recall we bought anything. It was just for the experience and a nice walk through their shops - gold bangels, chapati & flowers."
,,Feel India away from India .......,4.0,,"Many Indians, Pakistani , bangadeshi in the area ,, Many many Indian food option in and around this area ... You can find budget hotels too but dont expect too much from them... Mustafa shopping mall , which is open 24x7 also in the area.."
,,Gotta visit it!,5.0,,"Yes, Little India is bustling, filled with an assortment of sites, colors, and odd smells...but that's what makes it all part of the adventure! Singapore is insanely clean and orderly, so the chaos and authentic vibe of Little India is what helps complete your trip to Singapore. Grab some bread and curry in a typical whole in the wall joint, and you won't be disappointed. Gotta visit it!"
,,An oasis of chaos,4.0,,"Singapore is so orderly and neat that it is almost a pleasure to wander into an area that is chaotic, dusty and un-ordered. Small shops, no high rises, lots of markets, temples, flower sellers etc. It is like you have walked through a space warp into another dimension.
The streets and shops are reminiscent of Indian cities, but not so crowded. Lots of great places to eat, shops selling a host of items including lots of jewelry and gold. Some of the streets have goods spilling on to the streets, there is hustle and bustle and the smells of India.
This is a great place to explore and try out the food and investigate the shops and peek into temples. I found a market where you got lots of fresh juices - try the sugar cane juice - excellent.
It want take long to walk around but it is fun"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"This was one of my favorite parts of Singapore! It was really neat to explore it in detail, and meet some incredibly nice and friendly people. The food and selection is quite good as well!"
,,"Little India - big on sights, sounds and food",5.0,,"Originally under British rule there was a policy of ethnic segregation so that‚Äôs why Singapore has ended up with Little Arab town, Little India , Chinatown etc. (the Raffles Plan).
Serangoon Road is the main road in Little India. It starts at Serangoon River and it has something for ALL the senses; full of stuff to see, buy, eat and smell.
I loved the food here.
If you're looking for somewhere quiet then this is not it!!
Loads of colour, loads of noise. Plenty of atmosphere.
It‚Äôs one of the older areas in Singapore but there are a few modern buildings and a couple of Malls.
There‚Äôs Hindu temples and mosques and a church or two, with some of the buildings dating back to the mid 1800‚Äôs and some lovely old architecture.
You can get there easily enough with a couple of MRT stations in that area or cabs are plentiful and cheap.
One must see, must do is the Mustafa Centre which is on a side-road (Syed Alwi Road).
It is not as fancy as some of Singapore‚Äôs other malls but it IS truly amazing. I have NEVER seen anything like it.
It is said to sell over 300,000 items and I can believe it!!
Clothes, electronics, books, music, dvd‚Äôs, phones, perfume, souvenirs, makeup and its own supermarket with a BIG range of food and groceries.
From the bottom to the top floor there's an enormous range of items, and from what I saw what seem like pretty good prices as well.
I was just totally amazed by the number and volume of products that can be stuffed into this place AND it‚Äôs open 24-hours.
Set aside a couple of hours for this Mall alone if you want to have a really good look around.
Also there is a newer addition to the Mustafa Centre, just across a side road and I did venture to the roof top where there is a relatively new restaurant and got some great pictures of the local area from up high."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Easy to get to vis the MRT and a great cultural experience Fresh produce and flower weaving They're building the Indian cultural centre presently which will be great once finished A compulsory visit to Mustafa centre is necessary
,,Was ok,3.0,,"We went a walk around Little India and most of the shops that were there were gold shops.

We were hoping for some really good indian food and were sorely disappointed when we walked around for hours and couldn't find anywhere remotely clean enough to eat from.

If you are adventurous and don't mind the thought of dirty food areas then you will be fine, if you are like us and like everything clean not that great."
,,Fun morning shopping and exploring in Little India!,4.0,,We ventured from the Marina Bay area (on foot) to Little India. We had a lot of fun shopping and checking out all of the vendors. We bought more here than anywhere else during our trip in Singapore! The shops were fun and the prices were very reasonable. You could dedicate anywhere from 1-4 hours in the area and have a great experience!
,,India abroad !!,4.0,,If u never get a chance to come to India or really miss it then this is a definite stop. Cheap on the pocket there are lots of things to buy (so go with empty bags!!) n good food. This place is really good for shopping n more shopping at very reasonable prices but dont forget to bargain :) do try out the Mustafa Centre which is the main hub for getting anything u want :)
,,Good food and Cheap Good Quality Indian Traditional Cloths,4.0,,Good food at tekka mall. Varieties of choices. You can get punjabi suits or jippa or other tradition cloths as cheap as $5 to $20 where the same in malaysia valued at rm200 to 300. Must visit.
,,Singapore little India,3.0,,"You don't have to travel very far to India to feel the India's way of life, it is right here in Singapore. Little India starts at the junction of Serangoon Road and Bukit Timah Road and ends at the junction of Kitchener Road and Rangoon Road. To explore this area, walking is the best way to absorb and see the happenings around. Along the way you will see temples, eateries, and shops selling a varieties of goods etc etc. There are plenty of very good Indian foods( northern and southern ). Take the main Serangoon Road which is a one way street as your bearing, you will never get lost in this area. If your are daring try detour into the many side streets where you can absorb more of Little India, finally your walking tour will end at the World famousvery large 24 hours shopping complex where on weekends you may have to wait for your entry into the complex- the Mustafa Centre (Mohamed Mustafa & Samsuddin Co Pte Ltd)
You can spend a whole day in this large complex where you can find anything under the sun. You can easily get transportation back to your hotel. The Farrer Park MRT is next to the shopping complex making travelling around Little India and the downtown very easy."
,,Great shopping for Ethnic Indian wear and food!,5.0,,"Okay, if you are visiting Singapore and not averse to Indian spices, you got to check out the many restaurants in Little Indian. Go to the one that is crowded enough, chances are food is good and affordable. Burn the calories by walking around Little India. You can shop for ethnic wear according to your budget, buy fancy costume jewelry and take in the culture just by sitting quietly at a cafe while sipping a cup of ginger or spiced chai! Bus stops and train stations make it convenient if you don't want to walk much."
,,Little India - The Name says it all,5.0,,"Oh ! I am I staying in Singapore or in India ???? You get this feeling if you go here. Anywhere and everywhere you see you can see and hear your own people talking. The whole place is flooded with our own people and our own hotels. Great to be here. The working community make sure that every Sunday they all meet here to spend their time and meet their friends and relatives every week in Little India. I experienced a huge crowd of people standing on the roads meeting their people and sharing and caring about their experiences.

You have markets, Shops to buy vegetables / Fruits and you have good Indian hotels especially South Indian Hotels. You feel really good being here."
,,An unusaual experience,4.0,,This part of town feels authentic Indian. The shops and the food seem to sell all orginal items. The smells are unique and the food is tasty. We really enjoyed experience there.
,,Experience Indian Culture!,4.0,,Little India in Singapore is famous for all Indian related items and food to main meals and desserts are available here. The place is crowded and traffic during weekends. The famous MUSTAFA shopping center is located in the heart of this place where all bargains and other stuffs avaibale on which you cannot find from other stores.
,,"Love it or loath it, it's a world of wonder not to be missed",4.0,,"Little India should more aptly be called little tamil nad, for the India is too diverse for anyone to figure what to expect. It's main attraction for one and all is the Mustafa center for shopping of any sort. Next will be the north-indian food, everything from punjabi to chettinad, from jain to street food, from chicken to gujarati thalis, it's heaven for anyone who has love for typical indian cuisines.
The crowd is majorly Tamil, particularly avoid on Sundays due to sheer rush.
Parking is difficult, prefer to take the MRT."
,,Visit for Mustafa and Indian Food,3.0,,"If you love Indian food, visit this place. Mustafa market is the heart and must visit. Only if you dont have any problem with the unending and huge crowd."
,,Take the MRT into another world,5.0,,"Firstly let me say that I have avoided Little India at the weekend, at the advice of my daughter who lives in Singapore. Apparently it's mayhem for shopping then. Take the MRT to Little India and have a wander down some narrower streets, smelling the spices etc you would expect. Shops have a range of fruit and vegetables at variable quality, but cheaper. Be careful that you see what goes in the bag! Streets are jam packed with produce on the pavements to entice you in. There are other hidden gems, such as places for eyebrow threading at a fraction of the price compared to down town Singapore. Allow a couple of hours."
,,Little India a must visit place,4.0,,A must visit place for having desi food and while visiting Little India visiting Mustafa Center is must.... as it is open 24 hours and have a lot of variety for shopping.
,,not much to do or to see,3.0,,"if you expect little india to be something of Chinatown - don't.
it's clear that the Indian population in SG is the poorest, so even though the streets are clean (like everywhere in SG), one can still feel the poverty & neglect.
the main street is full of jewelry shops - every 2nd store is selling gold & precious gems, so if you're interested - there is a large assortment.
other than that, there is not much to do."
,,A Sanitised version of India/Tamil Nadu...,3.0,,"the name Little India is a misnomer... Little Tamil Nadu would have been more appropriate... here you can get a glimpse of the the flower stalls, the fish market, the vegetable mart and dozens of small traders bustling about.. this is also the home to the famous seragoon plaza/mustafa mall which is the place to go if u've been itching to buy stuff. the rates are cheap and the quality is good.

also worth mentioing is their 24/7 money exchange center which gave me much better rate for my money than in India. also if you are missing home food or find the food here expensive or you have a digestive system that accepts only indian food... then restaurants like komala nivas and ananda bhavan will cater to your needs !!!

p.s dont bother buying cheap souvenirs and memorabilia from here... you get them even cheaper at china town !!!"
,,Avoid this area,2.0,,"We went in the evening with a view to do some shopping and get some dinner while we were there. The streets seemed to be quite dirty and the smells coming from the food areas was really unpleasant. We did not hang around to eat anything.
We had been recommended to visit the Mustafa shopping centre as I had lost my sunglasses and needed some new ones. The Mustafa centre wasn't very cheap and seemed to be quite messy, but we did manage to find some very cheap sunglasses along the street, which was great.
I felt very uncomfortable here- It was very crowded and we really did not want to stay long.
When it came time to leave, we struggled to get a taxi. We waited at the taxi rank, but hardly any taxi's would stop here- they all drove past. Eventually we managed to flag one down.
I really would recommend avoiding this area. If you want cheap shopping- head to the Bugis street markets!"
,,Garbage can of Singapore,2.0,,"This can be an interesting place to visit to study the neglect of this place by Singapore government or maybe to study how a section of Singapore society or area chooses to remain backward. Why? Dominated by south Indians, the center of Little India in Singapore is by all accounts the famous Mustafa Center. A large and ever expanding poor man's version of Harrods of London. I am willing to bet that Mustafa Center does more business than Harrods. This is where pilots, international airlines hostesses, Asian shopping tourists and curious Westerners gather to buy everything. This place is a paradise for small time smugglers, who bring two empty suite cases for their return journey and find a way to pay off part of the travel expenses. Other than Mustafa Center, the place is dominated by South Indian culture, jewelry stores, vegetable and fruit sellers and tons of small grocers selling Indian spices. Certainly a place worth visiting to experience the dirty side of Singapore and wonder what happened to this part of Singapore? You find plenty of photo ops here"
,,Go on saturday morning around lunch time!,5.0,,"OMG guys, I had such a great experience at the Little India in Singapore, we went by subway and when we got out of the tube I was surprised! The architecture was very similar to Indian architecture and also thousands of Indians mainly males, on the streets talking, hugging each other, restaurants, shops, almost the real India. Amazing! If you are female I don't suggest you going by yourself as my friend who was with me didn't feel very safe as those thousands of Indians guys were staring at her eyes lol."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,Its a good place offering variety of food options nearby. Mustafa Centre is a great place to shop and eat late night. Street shopping is fun too. The temples are worth a visit too. Avoid sunday as its very very crowded.
,,An Enjoyable Experience,4.0,,"To taste one of the the four main ethnic regions within Singapore is to come here. To strole the streets, and the see, taste and smell the aromatic influences of the culture is to experience the diversity of Singapore."
,,Little India,3.0,,"We had been over there for having our Dinner at 'Park Baloochi' Restaurant serving very tasty & delicious veg. food. It's really worth for value for money. We stayed at Singapore for four days & almost everyday we had gone over there since my children like the Indian taste of their food.
There is lot of Hotel situated in this area where lots of Indian you can see.
Mustafa market is near by where you can get almost everything at reasonable price but please ask for international warranty on electronic gadget is available or not.
It is well connected with bus & train.
we bought Ezlink card as well as 4days singapore saver pass which is very useful for travelling in Singapore."
,,A must see,5.0,,spent a lovely morning walking around Little India ‚Ä¶ interesting! Stop off and have lunch at Tekka Centre! Fabulous food we tried stuff from a few of the Hawkers delicious! Very clean loos!
,,Just like INDIA,5.0,,It's a Best place where you can see a lot of Indians and the place just resembles like Chennai but so crowded on Sundays.
,,Crowded and 24hour business,3.0,,"Mustafa Store - yes you can buy everything your life needs here, I really mean it..everything. With 24 hours open for business and always crowd. And for little India you can find Gold and jewelry store and for Singapore price here you can find cheap product with standar quality of course, for daily home use, why not."
,,NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED,2.0,,"We had enjoyed our visit to Chinatown, and having just been to India we decided to take a quick look to see if we could find any of the spices we had missed buying in India (we had travelled to New Zealand, where importing whole spices is a no-no). We were very disappointed, from the metro station nothing is clearly laid out, unlike Chinatown you cannot be sure you are even in the right area. We had eaten in a Chinese food court and found that an appetizing place and felt happy to eat there. The Indian food court had some horrid smells, with stagnant water round the building. We managed to find some saffron but didn't stay long."
,,It was definitely Little India!,4.0,,"From the time we hopped off the train it was definitely little India. We only went there to get a good curry. We eventually found the food mall which was under a building near the train station. There were many food stalls here including Chinese and Malay. We eventually chose where we wanted to buy our meal, but one cannot be too choosie here!!!!!! After we received our meal an India lady said they make good curry where we bought our meal so that was a bit of a relief. We saw the man make the bread in a tall concrete cooker so u could not get any fresher than that. Our meal cost us $17 which included two meals, three lots of nann bread and two drinks. We considered this cheap compared to meals we had bought in shopping centres. There were lots of tailors, gold sellers, fabric shops and of course the traditional dress shops. I asked the price for a sari and I got it down to $140 but I could have haggled for less if I wanted one. So now we have been here too."
,,Preview of India in Singapore,5.0,,It was so cool to walk around and feel like you are in India but still be in Singapore. The food was great and the little shops had amazing things to purchase. Can;t wait to go back.
,,Tourists from India can skip!,3.0,,"I traveled to Singapore from KL and had been away from India for a couple of weeks, and even then was disappointed on reaching this attraction. For those who are travelling to Singapore directly from India, this attraction can definitely be missed as it has nothing new or interesting to offer besides Indian food. The shops are more like flea shops in India and do not offer good quality stuff. Although most shop keepers are friendly.

To be visited only if you have spare time or if you are a non-Indian and would like a glimpse of India's flea markets :)"
,,Get a glimpse of India,4.0,,"We went in Little India to have that kind of feeling that we are in India, and we did feel that we are, though its kind of a bit dirty and kind of busy place, me and my family went to buy stuff in their stores that is composed of cheap yet really good products."
,,Messy on Sundays,3.0,,"Whilst its a good place to see and experience the diversity Singapore has to offer. If you dont like crowded places , pl avaoid serangoon road on sunday evenings near Mustafa. Its like getting lost in a indian market...messy."
,,Part of Mumbai - but very clean,4.0,,"everyone comes here like this is the heart of the city. you can see shalwar wearing pretty ladies, indian men, flowers and Indian authentic sceneries here. at the same time you can feel the scents of laddu, freshly fried wadai, curry powders and rose petals.
If you're a fan of Indian food do not miss this. There are nice restaurants who serve Veg and non veg Indian food. Try Banana Leaf. Very nice restaurant with several cuisines such as; North Indian, South Indian, Kerala, Malayalam and etc.
You can shop gold, sarees and Indian related stuff. Also you can get done the Mehendi arts too. This area is little bit crowded so better skip the rush hours to avoid the traffic."
,,Quick taster visit,4.0,,We shot through Little India on a trishaw. Mainly we were interested in getting photos and not shopping. It was one of the areas where everyone waved and smiled at us tho'. My husband was in heaven with all the restaurant smells and the kids enjoyed the colours.
,,Affordable place to stay and eat !,4.0,,"Singapore is probably the most expensive city in the world ! We had decided to stay 7 days in this beautiful City so we had to find an area that we could afford ! Little India proved to be the right place for us as we found very good lodging at a reasonable price and there are some excellent restaurants around ! The area is also easily accessible by public transport and the HOHO sightseeing bus has 4 stops at different locations .
It still has the feeling of India but it is really cleaner !"
,,Not a nice experience,2.0,,"We got a taxi from our hotel to Little India as the taxi driver who had picked us up at the airport had recommended that we go to Mustafa's. As soon as we got out of the taxi, we felt uncomfortable. We went into Mustafa's which is a big department store like any other, or more downmarket. Before we were allowed in, we had to have our bags tied up for security reasons which rang alarm bells as we had thought Singapore was very safe and had very little crime.
We spent ten minutes in there before walking down a road with tourist souvenir shops and then the heavens opened and we were in the most terrible tropical storm. We had no choice but to wait under some shop awnings as the thunder and lightening was terrible and the rain was bouncing a metre off the ground. We tried to flag down a taxi but none of them would stop. A shopkeeper who said he had spent some time in England very kindly tried to phone a cab for us but was not successful. We were very grateful to him for trying. We were ogled by the men which made us feel very uncomfortable. We thought that one of them had his eye on our camera which shocked us because we had heard that Singapore was safe. Eventually after an hour and a half the rain eased off and we set off to walk the 3 miles to our hotel. It was a horrible experience. It was dirty and just had a horrible atmosphere. I would not have wanted to eat there and if we wanted decent Indian food, England would probably be the best place to get it. Would never go back there and never recommend it to anyone."
,,Shops with a bargain,4.0,,"A visit to Little India for lots of bargains to be had,and I am sure you will find something that takes your fancy, again can be done by the city tour."
,,colour and character,5.0,,"Seriously lacking in much of Singapore, Little India is as the name suggests - a slice of colour, character [and chaos], just like India itself. Great food abounds, and the mad and amazing Mustafa's Department store is worth a few hours in itself."
,,It's just ok....avoid on a Sunday,3.0,,"Little India is not all it's wrapped up to be.... If you are looking for quality Gold jewellery then it's definitely the place to go in Singapore, but like anywhere, shop around.... And barter your heart out.
The Mustafa centre is one of the largest department store in Singapore and has everything you could possibly imagine....
Avoid Little India on a Sunday.... It is crazy busy, and uncomfortable for the average tourist...
In summary, it's a time filler for a couple of hours..... But I personally don't rate it.... There are far more attractions in Singapore above it."
,,not good,1.0,,"out of all the places in Singapore we visited,this was just dirty and smelly. stay long jumped back on the subway then of to china town heeps better"
,,Vibrant and interesting,4.0,,"Serangoon Road in Little India is packed with shops selling a huge variety of wares from cheap ""3 for $10"" trinkets to exquisitely crafted gold jewelry. Little India is a fabulous area for delicious and inexpensive meals...Komala Villas is a favorite of ours... try the Masala Dosai! Mustafa department store is also worth a wander around, just for the sheer size of it and the variety of goods available."
,,Home away from Home,4.0,,"Being vegetarians, we enjoyed here a lot. Cheap trinkets, lovely Indian food, language you know. But typical Indian cleanness everywhere. Unlike rest of Singapore. You know what I am saying"
,,Little India for food,4.0,,Whilst on our recent family holiday to Singapore we decided to go check out what Little India had in the way of Restaurants & shopping. All the usual little shopping stalls & market kind of stuff. Lots of beautiful textile & gold jewellery too. We took a taxi from our hotel and the driver dropped us off outside a nice Indian Restaurant right in the middle of Little India. Good to experience the area.
,,"Tikka Market , Little India",2.0,,"This is very much different from other places in Singapore. The Tikka market is not clean, no air conditioned shops and also smelling since the fish market was in ground floor.

There were sarees, salwars and jewellery which used to wear by Indians , although the market is not maintained nicely as other places the goods are not cheap."
,,Only Recommend It for Mustafa 24-hours Shopping Store,2.0,,"If not for the famous Mustafa Store, I wouldn't recommend this attraction.

The last time I went to Little India was in 1996, during a business trip and haven't been there again. Until recently. And now I remember why I never returned to the neighbourhood, although I visited Singapore quite often after 1996.

Little India is famous with its Indian culture and atmosphere, and you can find so many interesting things to buy and to visit. Among the most is the famous Mustafa store. A 24-hours supermarket, selling so many things with affordable price. Ranging from biscuits, chocolates, drinks, candies, coffees, teas, to souvenirs, watches, shoes, bags, leather products, etc. Most of them have good quality. Some said that customers should notice food/ beverages expire date. Don't worry, they don't sell expired ones. Usually the foods/ beverages have some 6-9 months til expire dates.

And I can recommend Mustafa. Me and family bought so many chocolates and biscuits.

But it is hard to recommend other little shops in the neighbourhood.

For example, it is difficult to know the reasonable price for things you're interested. Several stores offered them at different prices. Of course you must bargain. But how can you know you already got the best price?

Another lesson, please check again your purchase after the store wrapped it in a bag. Make sure you got what you bought. During my last visit, the store cheated my wife by exchanging the bracelets. The design was the same. But the ones (she bought two) she got after opening it in our hotel have marks. Very ugly spots. And very different to the ones she chose from the display.

Ok you can argue that I/ she should have examined before we left the store. But shouldn't every transaction is done with trust?

So we were cheated.

Return to the store and make complaints? Don't bother."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,Preferred Little India to Chinatown - greater variety of things to check out and had some great vegetarian Indian food. Easy to get to and plenty to look at.
,,Slightly disappointed,4.0,,"Somehow expected lots of narrow streets full of colour, noise and the smells of indian cuisine however as we wandered along a busy high street it all seemed a bit commercial.
That said, the prices were cheaper than other areas of Singapore with no hard sell shopkeepers and the wet market with its indian clothing stalls upstairs was worth the visit. Still prefer China Town but pleased that we took the time to visit Little India. very easy to get to by bus, walking or MTR"
,,Worth a look at something in Singapore that is not sanitised,4.0,,"Having first visited Singapore in the early 1980s and stayed in a family hotel, it was really pleasant to see that the 'character' of Little India has been retained. I like to eat and shop where the locals go, so of course Little India provides some colour and interesting sites.

I found a very interesting clothes market not far from the MRT with clothes of every colour of the rainbow and lots of 'bling' a la Indian style. If you are hunting for some Indian style clothes, fabric, or tailoring then this is the place to go. There is also a clean food hall at ground level where I enjoyed eating a meal of spicy curry, vegetables, roti and rice. If you are there to eat, be sure to go before the school kids turn up mid afternoon!!

You aren't hassled to buy with the stall holders being helpful and pleasant to deal with.To top it off, there is a very clean toilet facility that provides paper and tissues at the entrance for a small fee.

Walking the streets also provides plenty of photographic opportunities and a chance to watch the locals going about their shopping. The area is not overrun with tourists despite being a stop for some city tours."
,,Awful,1.0,,"Compared to Chinatown, there is very little here to interest the average visitor. If you like a good bit of traditional Indian food, then perhaps you can come at meal time and enjoy yourself. However, for purely touristic purposes, there is little to see in Little India. I did like the colourful houses, and there were many little street vendors in tiny shops on the side of the road selling everything from vegetables to fabrics, but this was the only part of Little India that was actually any different to the rest of Singapore. There is simply nothing else to do here, and even as a cultural location, it still doesn't compare to Chinatown, or even Kampong Glam! I found that I wasted my time venturing into Little India and I won't be going back in a hurry."
,,cheaper price,3.0,,"The price is a bit cheaper, place was messy. Food was good even not as delicious as we though. Many indian jewelry here. The Mustafa Centre open for 24hours."
,,unique town,4.0,,Little India offers a totally different experience in Singapore. There are a lot of markets and stores with so many different items. Here the price always cheaper and lower than other place. Its best place for us (and traveler) to shopping
,,Good place for shopping and Indian food,4.0,,"The place is packed with Indian food outlets and shopping malls that will spoil you with choice at amazing prices ! especially the mustafa center sells stuff at almost 20 - 30 % lower prices compared to the rest of singapore, the prices are great and the choice is good... must visit for shopping as well as indian food !"
,,Too Many India,4.0,,"as mentioned w/ the name, it's a India Town in the middle of the busy Singapore.
Travelling by Subway is more smelly whenever the train is closing down to Little India.
But, Once U get used to it, everything will be okay... I like how they pronounce their English sounding much clearer than the Southern Americans...."
,,the place is not so clean,3.0,,the little india is a very known place in singapore. nice to see so many indian faces in singapore. but the place is not so clean . though there are so many good indian restaurants in this area. but every where in the streets there is a filthy smell of drainage in the air. it is well constructed but not maintained compared to other areas of singapore.
,,Traveling without flying,4.0,,"I visited Singapore after a trip in India and I must say the atmosphere, although much smoother than in some Indian cities, was so similar to places I was a few days back, I though I was back in India again.

Colors, flowers, groceries displays etc were fantastic to catch up again, it was like a travel to India without flying.

I'm from Paris and we get this feeling too from a quarter to another and I was happy to sense that in Singapore as well."
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,4 days in Singapore in March 2014 - Starting at the The Verge Shopping Centre at 10:30 we met our guide at the start of an informative and amusing 3 hour tour of Little India. We had a great time and learnt a lot even though our guide was an ethnic Singaporean Chinese his knowledge of Little India was great and seemed to know many of the locals.
,,A place for everyone to visit,4.0,,From cheap food to cheap souvenirs to cheap hotels and cheap shopping.. Indian Restaurants are a variety of them .. Mustafa Market is a place to shop which is open 24/7 and has got everything in it. you name it and you have it. from grocery to clothes to confectioneries to medicines to souvenirs . Everything !!!!!! . all in one store at the best price
,,Must Visit,4.0,,In singapore if you want to eat Indian food then this is the write place.... You get good south Indian food... More over you have 24 X 7 open shopping center Mustafa... Its same as Alpha market of Mumbai....
,,"Better than i expected, taste and buy",4.0,,"Great selections of items, interesting deals everyday. Great indian food at cheap prices and very friendly service."
,,"Genuine, lovely part of Singapore",5.0,,"Little india is a jewel in Singapore. Friendly people, amazing food market (with cheap and lovely roti prata, amazing mango lassi etc.) and a genuine atmosphere. The crazy Mustafa centre (open 24 hours) is interesting and an enjoyable contrast to the other malls in the city. During my four days in Singapore, I became most fond of Little india, China town and the island Pulau Ubin."
,,a special region,5.0,,The region is full of the Indian features. And Indian food is special for me. It's hilarious at night.
,,"Need to skip something, this might be it !",3.0,,"We found Little India to be dissapointing, measured against the other areas like Bugis, Chinatown, Arab Street and the like. Walking the area you will find an amazing amount of gold jewellery shops in a ridicuously small area. If you know how they can all make money, please let us know. Apart from the beautiful looking intricate gold pieces there really was not a lot that jumped out, very little in the way of welcoming places to sit down and have a cold drink, considering the warm and humid climate. Even the geographic setup of the area wasn't as friendly as most of the other places you will likely visit.

While it's interesting it may be one to miss if you have limited time, If you like a beer to help refresh in the warm climate, you may find it difficult to actually get one at this locale :)"
,,Need gold?,3.0,,"As you might expect there are basically three things in Little India, Singapore.

Firstly there are some cheap eats. Some are quite tacky but hey, when on holiday excesses are permitted right?

Secondly jewellery stores. Selling gold. Some also get around to selling some gold too. Oh, and gold - did I mention gold?

Thirdly there are some inexpensive market style sections of the area. These may appeal to bargain hunters.

Oh and the fourth thing - some of Singapores cheapest accommodation options for the backpacker crowd."
,,Indian Culture at its Best,5.0,,"This place is near to buggis street. Little india is a place that will give you view about Indian culture. It is also a very good place for shopping of indian items, clothes and accessories. You can have a taste of Indian cuisines."
,,Boring,3.0,,Better than Little India in KL but also here its just a few shops with many colours and a different smell Nothing beautiful about it...
,,Mixed Feelings,3.0,,"OK - so little india is kinda nice, but its also kinda ugly. I don't really like the eating areas as most seem a bit unclean. But, I really do like the indian dress shops and really recommend it if you are looking for something nice."
,,Nothing to see,1.0,,There is nothing to see here and no where to go for shopping. It is very hard to find taxi's and the only time we are here is for its inexpensive hotels
,,One of my favourite places in Singapore,4.0,,"I really like Little India. The sights, the smells, the sounds - there is something about it that draws me. My profile pic was taken here many years ago - Singapore Chilli Crab. You can eat delicious curries, drink fresh sugar cane juice, buy a perfumed lei, source a sari or salwar and kameez, have a henna 'tattoo', check out the fish market, scrounge around in one of the many 'junk' shops at the Tekka Centre, buy cheap bags.... A great place to while away some hours just taking it all in."
,,Not much to see,3.0,,"Its a small indian community in singapore, they have shops and indian restaurants, and i hear hotels are also quite inexpensive, but for some reason i feel less secure in the neighborhood."
,,An Indian Community with in Singapore,4.0,,Little India as the name suggest is a small locality of Indians in singapore. Most of the visiting Indians like to stay here. Most of the hotels are inexpensive. Indian food is easily available specially for vegetarians. Mustafa Centre is one stop shopping for all. otherwise also street type shopping available. it is colorful having Indian temple and all types of Indian Food.
,,Not very interesting,2.0,,"Some good street food to enjoy and some interesting shops selling saris, but the most interesting/best shop was a Chinese trinket shop. Little India has some interesting vegetarian restaurants (not tried) and a lot of jewelry shops, but not a lot of other interesting things."
,,"Great Henna, Thats about it...",2.0,,"Little India was more run down and dirty than we had anticipated. Construction forced us to walk with busy traffic for blocks on end. Not a lot of shops or stalls to buy stuff other than groceries. The best part was venturing into a salon to get Henna and even at that, the price was quite higher than expected. We kept walking to Little Arabia which offered a beautiful mosque, great shopping and a ton of cafe's and restaurants. We stumbled upon China Town and found China town to be picturesque and have the best shopping in all of Singapore that we have encountered. You won't miss much by skipping out on Little India."
,,Mustafa Market,4.0,,"One stop shop, under one roof you will get everything at Mustafa market in lil india. The best stop for everyone, good prices. in overall, value for money market for everyone."
,,Busy on Sundays,4.0,,"A riot of all that is Indian in Singapore, very busy on Sunday, quieter in the mornings. Georgeous clothes, persistant tailors"
,,"Great food, smells and shopping",4.0,,Stayed in Little India on my trip and was pleased with the vibrant nature of the area. There are many restaurants and don't miss the Mustafa Centre open 24 hours!!
,,Clash of cultures,4.0,,"In the midst of this highly organized city, where you cannot smoke, chew chewing gum and where everything makes a structured sense, there's little india. In little India, people actually jaywalk and act like people. There's an indian chaos in it's own fantastic way!

I like this place, it was a nice collision with Singapore as a whole!"
,,Real Life,4.0,,"This is a great area to visit, quite compact, spreading over twenty or so blocks south of Serangoon Road. Easy to access from Little India or Farrer Park MRT stations and quite easy to walk around during the day. Lots of very reasonably priced Indian style garments and souvenirs and tons of places to eat. A touch of real life rather than a theme park. After dark it can feel a little intimidating for female tourists as there are so many men in the streets and very few women, but it is a tourist area so they are used to it, just dress sensibly and don't loiter."
,,Will not revisit.,1.0,,As a family we were not impressed with this area and did not stay for long. Felt very uncomfortable and decided to leave. Will not return.
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,If you want to taste a bit of India in Singaproe that is the place to be. Could get crowded on Sunday but the other days is just fine.
,,Wouldn't bother,2.0,,Got off at the little India MRT stop and part of the map is worn away so hard to get your bearings from the start. Took a walk and didn't see anything of interest until we came to a small chapel that looking like a dilapidated building. It was the Indians call to prayer so we didn't intrude. Wouldn't waste my time going to see it unless you've a particular interest or want to see something specific
,,Funkytown,2.0,,"In Singapore this area is a real anomaly. It's crowded, dirty, smelly and not very welcoming. I walked nearly every street in Little India and didn't see any shops with anything worth checking out."
,,nice part of the town,4.0,,A visit of little india should be included in every Singapore tour. If it's only to get the atmosphere (probably go there at night time) or also to taste some of the amazing indian food. While you are here you should also have a glimpse into the Mustafa's Mall. Basically you can get everything there!
,,"Great spot, especially for the vegetarians!",4.0,,"We spent about half a day wandering around Little India and really enjoyed it. There are loads of little shops, stalls and places to eat and it's bursting with vegetarian food, a relief after the meat fest which is most of the rest of Singapore! We ate at Big Bites, an unassuming little spot on a corner (go upstairs for a sit down meal or downstairs to take away) and it was delicious. We walked the length of Arab Road (again, lovely little shops, stalls and cafes) and had a quick visit to the Masjid Sultan mosque. You will get a certain amount of people trying to lure you into their shops to buy rugs, fabric etc but they are in no way aggressive and a polite 'no thanks' is enough to fend them off."
,,"Not on Sunday, and not if you're female!",2.0,,"My Dad and I couldn't wait to visit this place after hearing about the bargains and the food - never again! In our few hours there I didn't see more than 5 other women, it was ALL men. I wore a holiday sundress and after 5 minutes was wishing for a burkha :( The food was super but we didn't get round to the shopping as it was just too intimidating - can't recommend especially when there are so many amazing places in this awesome city - try Chinatown instead x"
,,Has lost charm,3.0,,"I make it a practice to visit Little India every time i come to Singapore and each time the place gets a bit more boring. There were plenty of shops earlier but many of them are gone now. Also, the place could be better maintained.

However, it is THE place for good authentic cheap Indian food"
,,slum of singapore,2.0,,Very dirty and smelly place compared to the rest of SG . Great for the hawker food if you are prepared to take the risk. Im not a fussy person and I love new experiences but this place is pretty bad. Bit like denpasar local markets .
,,Severly underwhelmed here,3.0,,"Little India was meant to be a highlight of our stay - in fact, we were initially looking to book a hotel in Little India. Well, I'm glad we didn't. Don't get me wrong, the colours are lovely, however, I found Little India quite dirty - where the rest of Singapore is incredibly clean. I didn't trust any of the electronic stores or the jewellery stores. We wanted to try some Indian food while there, but it was just so busy and dirty we were pretty much put off. Still worth a visit - but I wouldn't spend too long."
,,An Interesting Place to Explore,5.0,,"Little India is an interesting place to discover. There are lots of places to eat and there is an arcade off the main street that has an excellent range of local craft items such as bags, jewelery, cushions etc. at great prices. The local food is authentic, delicious and very cheap. This is an awesome place to explore. This is also the place to buy gold. There is also a local wet market and hawker centre to check out as well. Have fun :)"
,,Not what I imagined,2.0,,We went here to see the the local temple - which we then discovered is closed for repairs. The streets are overcrowded and dirty. We got a lot of funny looks being white girls traveling in an unknown area. Not worth our time.
,,Don't waste your time!!!,1.0,,"And don't forget to count your change at the food court, better yet just don't go at all. For the first time I agree with every poor review here."
,,Best Food,5.0,,"Nice shopping experience at Mustafa, and the best ever south Indian food one can have outside India."
,,"good food, close to mustafa shopping centre",4.0,,"amazing street, specially at the night time, there are a lots of halal thai, indian restaurants, it is not costly . try cheese or egg paratha nyummy .... shopping wise , there is bi mustafa shopping centre, they open 24 hours...the easist way to get by liitle india ... take MRT , alight at ferrer park station.
happy holiday"
,,"as the name suggests, this really is india outside of india",4.0,,"A great place to walk about, you really do feel that you are in some parts on india. An explosion of colorful visual, aromatic smells of food and incense, and sound. all manners of sound.
over a dozen hostels and backpackers inn around the small lanes, chic little bars and eateries as well."
,,Little India,4.0,,"The streets are bustling with people from all over the world, sipping on a cold coconut juice was a true high-light for me. There is an a variety of fresh vegetables, fruit and sweetmeats to tantalise your taste buds. People are helpful and friendly and I could not resist buying the traditional ""vadha"" made from chickpea, chillies, spices and fried lightly. The restaurants are affordable and since the portions are big, we always shared a meal. Shopping is great with different items from indian tops, sari's, punjabi's and jackets. I loved it and will definately visit it again on my next trip."
,,Nice,4.0,,Little india is a nice place to visit if you are found of Indian food. One can find all the variety of food over their beside you can also visit Mustafa for shopping
,,Nearly as good as the real India,5.0,,"I think it was here in Little India, that my fascination with real India, started years ago. I love the fact that it is a little bit 'grittier' than the other parts of Singapore,and I have not felt uncomfortable walking around the little side streets.....though Mustafa was slightly overwhelming. With so many original buildings, loud music, crowds, uneven sidewalks and exotic smells, if you close your eyes, you could almost believe you were in real India (without the pollution, rubbish and beeping horns).
Little India seems less touristy than Chinatown. It feels more authentic. There are plenty of little restaurants on the side streets off Serangoon Rd. It is easy to get to by MRT or is an interesting and easy walk from other attractions."
,,South Indian culture on display,4.0,,"Little India is a misnomer, as it does not represent the Culture of whole of India.Only a flash of South Indian culture is on display in this area. It is a tourist attraction due to its authentic South Indian food & famous Shopping Centre, Mustafa Centre etc. There are different Restaurants like, Saravana Bhavan, Murugan Idli shop, AB Mohammed Restaurant etc. The multi ethnic, multi religious character of Singapore is on display in plenty in this area, as there is the famous and age old Angulia Mosque and a Hindu temple on the Serangoon Road. There is a Church as well nearby. They all live in harmony and enjoy the benefits, except a few aberrations.During the Indian festival of Deevalli, the area is decorated and wears a festive look as any Indian street. Similarly, during the Muslim festivals, the Mosque is bustling with Men & children in new and colourful clothes attending the prayers. During New year the whole of Singapore wears a colourful & festive look.
The area is famous for window shopping and you get everything at reasonable prices. The area is easily accessible by Road and MRT. The nearest stations being ""Little India Station"" & ""Farrer Park Station"". Getting a Taxi during peak hour is very difficult. During holidays it is most visited by one and all to have a great time. As it is a busy area with lot of traffic, aged people, women & children have to be doubly careful in hanging around. Even though it is a crowded area, travellers who want to have a glimpse of South India in Singapore should not miss a visit to this wonderful attraction."
,,Pleasant and interesting,4.0,,"Not quite in the same league as Chinatown but worthy of a stroll around. A million miles away from the likes of Orchard Road/Marina Bay and, therefore, quite refreshing. Lots of interesting shops and great character in the buildings."
,,Colourful and crowded,3.0,,"Colourful buildings and especially sundays full of people. But not our ""cup of tea"". This was only area in S'pore where we felt little uncomfy, because some hawkers were really aggressive and there were some shady looking people hanging around. We heard that someone robbed one elderly lady in middle of the pedestrian walk."
,,feel the Indian's way of life,4.0,,"I went there before my flight back to see what kind of Little India that Singapore has. I came out in Tekka centre exit in Little India station and find a large food court in there. The price is cheaper compare to Indian restaurant near Geylang area and it is fun to eat in there like a local Indian of Singapore people. Try some Indian's menu like Briyani rice or Tulang merah, they are really delicious and has so many spices inside it. The area itself is worth for sightseeing. I also try to have a hyena tattoo in my hand like Indian newlyweds hand for just 7 sgd :)"
,,"Could it be better than the ""Big India?""",4.0,,"Depending on one's viewpoint, could this be better than the ""Big India""? Shopping, money exchange, lodgings, food and drink are all here.

So, unfortunately, are crowds of people ignoring traffic flow (and challenging vehicles to force their way through masses of jaywalkers), and masses of cars looking for places to park - and illegally parking if they can't find proper place to park.

If you think Singapore is a nanny state which uses overbearing tactics to subdue jaywalkers, gum chewers, or cigarette-but-throwers - come to Little India to see that this may not be a fully apt description. But while here, enjoy the shopping, food, drink, and people-watching."
,,sightseeing only,3.0,,"I spent my last day in Singapore here. I've try to look for Asia's Next Top Model photo shoot location. This area is not so big and you can reach all the corner of the street less than two hours. There are a lot of jewelry store, fabric store, and India restaurant with good food. Well I can taste it from its smell from the outside restaurant. Hahahaha
Don't forget to bring your camera, there's a lot of unique and interesting place around here."
,,"Nice to walk around, but thats it",3.0,,"Little India definitely has an india atmosphere. It's a not too big area, mainly around Serangoonstreet. The usual small stores, but nothing special. However, there are a few restaurants with good food. Khansawa is one of them."
,,Great cultural experience,4.0,,"A really interesting place to visit. Little India provides a very healthy contrast to the rest of Singapore. I spent an afternoon having a poke around the streets that come off the main road (Serangoon) and was delighted by the colours, sounds and all the othe stuff that tickled my senses. A must for anyone spending some time in Singapore."
,,Well worth a look,4.0,,Nice place A bit roudy at night lately but safe Great Indian restaurants People say it smells like India but in a very mild manner Interesting shops Very close to most other attractions Recommended
,,Great Curry,4.0,,"It is what it says it is and people should realise this, take it for what it is and you will enjoy the visit, we had a great curry in a really nice place and the staff were brilliant, we also had a great laugh with a few of the stall holders, although bartering was not on the menu. Very interesting odours floating about."
,,ENJOYABLE,4.0,,We found this place quite intreguing. The signts and smells I would imagine to be just like India. Lots to look but be warned - I tried bartering in the markets and the stall holders were having none of it:::
,,Exotic and exciting to this first time Canadian vistor,4.0,,Wow! From the vibrant colours to the excellent eateries (and all of the sights and sounds in-between) visiting Little India in Singapore really made me feel that I am becoming a World Traveller. Immerse yourself in this ethnic diversity and enjoy!
,,Meeting point for Indians,3.0,,"Little India is a meeting place for Indians in Singapore at Serangoon Road, same like I have seen in many other countries. Colorful Indian temples couple with chain of Indian restaurants with aroma of Indian food. The place is overall crowded and there is no much attraction for average tourist unless you love South Indian food as Dosa-samber, Uttpam, Vada and Idalies, that is cheaper and the quality is quite good."
,,Worth to visit,5.0,,"If you are looking for an area full of colors, smells and sounds, go there for a couple of hours. I was really impressed by Indian temples which aren`t so colourful in any other part of the world. South Indian food you can taste in Little India is cheap and delicios.An exotic place to walk and shop. Visit a wet market!"
,,Culture Shock...,4.0,,"I have never seen so many Indians in one place. The atmosphere was electric. The food market was buzzing with breyani dhall and every other indian dish. I enjoyed the experience, but could not bring myself to eat there. Being an Indian myself, born and raised in South Africa, the visit was to me a culture shock. As much as I loved the experience, I was scared to venture deeper into the crowds. Based on my experience @ Little India, I have decided not to visit my Mother Country.."
,,Terrible place,1.0,,"Arrived in Little India on NYE - end of 2013. Horrible way to begin the new year.

The good: The food I had was amazing. Best Indian I've ever had.

Tha said, I will not go to Little India again. First, it smells. The odour is a mix of raw effluent and rubbish.

Second, if you are a female I would not recommend coming close to this place. My girlfriend was constantly ogled. On NYE the place was heaving with people and entire crowds of men would turn around and openly watch her walking past. She was wearing track pants and a light sweater as we'd just gotten off the plane. There are very few Indian women and the men seem to make it a hobby to leer at women walking past. It made us both very uncomfortable. I noticed every female in the area getting the same treatment. Totally unwelcome. Do not come here as a single female.

Third, the place is just dirty. There is rubbish everywhere. Piled on the side of the street. New Years day I lost count of the number of people who just tossed whatever they were eating on the road. Also, the locals spit, constantly."
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"Don't bother, this is not an attraction... This is literally an area of Singapore where people of Indian decent appear to live. I really have no idea why tourists visit the area."
,,Average - but the barber shops are way cool,3.0,,"While I would prefer a visit to little India to Chinatown if forced to choose between the two, I still would not try and fit it into a short itinary.

There are definitely better places to have Indian food and it does lack anything specific that would make it worth a trip, unless you are craving the typical smells and colours of an Indian quarter.

The one aspect I do find really cool however are the Indian Barber shops, definitely worth a visit if all you need is a crew cut, the guys are a really cool remnant of the typical barber shops of the old days ( the even have the electric chairs that have built in sockets to plug in the clippers !! ) with the exception that they played really cool bollywood music

Probably also the cheapest cut in town ( 4-6 SGD )"
,,run down and dirty,2.0,,very disappointed to see how run down and dirty this area looked with not much to see or do to be honest.
,,"Fun shopping, great food!",4.0,,"I enjoyed walking the streets of Little Indian. I started at Mustafa (good place to change money on the corner with very competitive rates), but it didn't seem very special. I was looking for clothing and Nalli on Buffalo Road was fantastic! Great prices (wholesale) and pretty helpful staff. For South Indian food, Komala Vilas was great."
,,Nothing spectacular,3.0,,"Found nothing unusually interesting, the normal smells of spices and hustle of people. Depends what you shopping for, you can find bargains otherwise just another Chinatown. Mustafa centre was likely the only different concept we found but also quite busy."
,,shoping street at main walking road,4.0,,"good place to buy everithings,this street like indian street,many people who workat this place are south indian.mustufa market is main attraction for buy original things.there are many indian restaurent with all types of food.ladeis purse,suvenier from singapore,watch are main product to buy fron this place.prise are little more than india but still avrage tobuy something from there"
,,Depends on what you expect,4.0,,"So you are in Singapore, looking for some good Indian food. This is the place. I once had a meal for my family @ 1 in night. And the street was still lively. There are too many restaurants and 2-3 I tried I will rate them pretty good.

Please note that this can be crowded at times.

Apart from this there is Mustafa Market, and what a huge market it is. You can get pretty much every thing here. its spread across the road; and you may get lost at your first visit. Whether you want to buy some stuff or not depends; on what is the price at your native place. You can get things here tax free (get a refund of tax at airport) ; but obviously no warranty and your country may levy customs when you enter the port. So do your maths and see if works for you. We bought many souvenir from this place and rates were at par with the local market.(china town)

Other than this; I do not see anything else one could enjoy here."
,,Best Price???,4.0,,"I think it is expected that you haggle over your purchase. You are never far from the smell of Jasmine with the artisan flower binders located here, weaving garlands."
,,Shopping,4.0,,Good place to find gold jewelry and eastern clothing. Restaurants had good indian food. Pretty smelly and untidy place. Mustafa mall is a massive 24 hour shopping mall with all kinds of stuff. Perfumes and colognes were dirt cheap there. Just shop and get out. Nothing much else to do there.
,,Weird or exotic smell?,3.0,,"First i arrived at this place, weird smell is so fulfill the air that you breath. I don't know how to name it, weird or exotic smell? Mustafa Center is the most famous place at this area. Mustafa center is the place that sell anything an running 24 hour. If you need to buy something in Singapore just came to this place. You can find anything. Oh, there is a mosque that located at the corner of street. If you moslem dont forget to take a pray at this mosque."
,,Fun,4.0,,We enjoyed Little India and had fun travelling there. We enjoyed delicious India food and shopping in Little India. Nights are lively and packed.
,,Packed streets!,3.0,,"We made a special trip down after reading the reviews. We came at night. The streets are packed with people and roads packed with cars. Different from anywhere else in Singapore, people here have no regard for road rules and just cross the street wherever, causing chaos. Also in contrast to other places in Singapore, Little India is dirty. The streets are littered and pathways uneven.

There are lots of places to eat and lots of stores selling cheap bits and pieces and videos and cds.

Wet didn't like it and wouldn't go again."
,,"The description says it all - ""An Experience for all 5 Senses""",4.0,,"I travel to India every other month and was surprised how similar little India is to the real place. If you appreciate Indian culture or really want to experience India without traveling there, this is the place. The food, smells, people, culture, etc. it's all here. My wife and I both enjoyed it but were happy to leave after a couple of hours."
,,India with a slightly less in your face feel,4.0,,"If you're tight with your money like me (and you probably will be after paying the exorbitant prices for accommodation in Singapore) and like authentic Indian food, then this is the place for you.

Having been to India before, the food here is relatively comparable in taste in price. I couldn't get enough of the $1.40 Masala Dosas at Tekka Centre and $4 Biryanis!

If you are not huge to huge crowds, I wouldn't recommend going on Sunday night. Sunday is the day of rest for most workers and many of Singapore South Asian community (especially the male migrant construction workers) fill Little India's streets. I also wouldn't recommend it on a Sunday night if you're female as most of the thousands and thousands of people out and about are male, which could understandably lead to some women feeling uncomfortable.

Mustafa is worth a visit, the colognes and perfumes are quite cheap. If you think Little India is overwhelming and dirty, then I definitely don't recommend going to the actual India, it's a whole other world over there."
,,Yup. Definitely Little India. The nose knows.,3.0,,"You can smell the spices in the air and food places, shops abound. The prices of gold are exorbitant but the food is what I can for. Banana leaf Apolo was as advertised...pretty good food but spotty service."
,,the dirtiest place in singapore .........,1.0,,"the dirtiest place in singapore .........

we were end oct./early nov. in singapore. singapore airlines had a 220 usd all in offer ex manila.

also having been in singapore many times, we were never in little india. well, it's not worth going there. it is definitely the dirtiest place in otherwise clean singapore. there were signs ""don't wee-wee here"". don't spit ............. etc etc."
,,Need more time,3.0,,"It was really near from the place where we stay in Singapore. But since im getting lost it was take more time to reach Mustofa Center. Should be stay to had shopping more than 2 hours free. You wilk enjoy it full, because they sell many kind of stuff. Many kind of chocolate candy as a gift, souvenir, all type of food in the supermarket also available. Each floor contain different item. The price still in average. Small shop also available near in the street of MC. Some price looks expensive in MC comparing with the small shop near it."
,,Somewhat dull,2.0,,"Arriving in a taxi from our hotel we were all suddenly hit by the smell of tumeric and curry. The area is quite small and there are many many shops and restaurants but overall unless you are coming to buy clothes and eat Indian food, which is available all over Singapore, there aren't many redeeming features to Little India."
,,cultural walk..,3.0,,"After our Chinatown stint, I went to this place to give my niece an orientation of Singapore's cultural diversity. We saw a Hindu Temple, shops selling Indian ingredients and of course restaurants.... I thought that it was a huge place but realised that it's just a small neighborhood."
,,Good Culture and Food Experience,4.0,,"We always enjoy visiting Little India for some smells, views and foods. Actually first thing we do when we get to Singapore, we always first go to Little India to visit Komala Restaurant. I would not buy anything there other than some followers in the evening or some gold maybe. Great place for Indian Food. Lots of restaurants in this area. Also heard about some bars but no personal experience. Also Mustafa is best place for money exchange in Singapore."
,,A mild taste of India,3.0,,"Took a trip here whilst in Singapore - unique markets and bazaars, and great restaurants to eat in that serve up some great Indian food; authentic and tasty cuisine that is reasonably priced. In the markets you can get some great bargains, or general products at a cheap price.

However, the place isn't easy to get to, and isn't as easy-going as the rest of Singapore. You do feel stared at if you are Western. Quite busy as well so makes getting around with small children difficult."
,,Atmosphere and Serangoon Road,4.0,,"Since visiting Singapore over 10 years ago, this area has been cleaned up. It is pleasant to walk around and get the feel of India again. (We were calling into Singapore on our return from India). The colourful night markets and street food of Bugis Street seem to have gone now and it is pretty well sanitised. However, it was still interesting to wander around and discover that not everything has been refurbished or spruced up and that some Indian habits die hard. We envisaged that Serangoon Rd was in Chinatown after watching the Australian TV series of that name, but was suprised to find it in Little India."
,,Must visit if you love experiencing different cultures,5.0,,Getting to Little India is easy - exit at either the Farrer Park MRT or the Little India MRT. The main street is Serangoon Road and we enjoyed walking all the way from the Tekka Market to Mustafa (24 hour department store) by getting off at Little India. On the way back to our hotel we then went to the Farrer Park station as that is close to Mustafa. We wanted to end up at Mustafa to shop and not have to carry everything (if we had started off with Mustafa). In between there are so many various shops to see. You really feel immersed into the community. A nice break is to buy a refreshing coconut drink when you see the coconuts. If you come at Divali time (November) the whole area is so festively decorated and so many people.
,,You are in inda,3.0,,"This is a stretch of few streets that everything india. Being a multi-racial community, this is a good representation of the Indian community in Singapore i feel."
,,Little India in Singapore,3.0,,"It was amazing experience Felt like i am in India You must go to Mustafa Mall, although its cluttered but worth ""one time watch"""
,,crowded but tons of impressions,4.0,,"If you're not a big fan of large crowds and noisy and busy streets walk a mile around Little India :)
But if you like to bargin, smell and feel something different you can spend hours here!

Lots of carpets and things I don't know what turists can fit in their luggage but somehow they think you want them :)"
,,Highlight of my 48 hours in Singapore,5.0,,"Up until this visit I'd found Singapore bland and, while architecturally impressive, there was nothing I could get excited over. Even Chinatown, which I last visited in 1991, seemed to be more like a shopping experience and not the slightly edgy and very strange place of 20 years ago.

With just a few hours to kill before catching my plane home, I took the advice of the locals and went to the Botanic Gardens (which were very nice, just nothing spectacular) and then the advice of the guide book and went to Little India.

The taxi driver asked me why I wanted to go there, which didn't inspire confidence, but as I merrily told him where to drop me (while surreptitiously consulting the guidebook) I did wonder what the hell I was doing.

It was Dipvali and Little India was a riot of colour, bustle and madness with not a tourist in sight. My first stop was the Tekka Centre shopping centre where among the bustling market stalls upstairs I spent very little on beautiful scarves and children's clothes, happily getting lost among the hundreds of stalls, Downstairs the food hall gives so many options for eating and drinking (all SO cheap as well). I stopped at a stall at random and my plate was piled high with Southern Indian food, all for about two Singapore dollars, while I had a chat with the stall owner about the merits of various English football teams. Drinks were from another stall, where the owner made me a gorgeous green drink, I have no idea what it was but it was very refreshing. There's also a wet market, spice market and more on the ground floor.

Then I followed the Lonely Planet walking tour and visited the Little India Arcade (slightly more touristy and expensive but still fun - I had a henna tattoo) and wandered through the streets, soaking up the madness and taking photos of the buildings and the flowers, spices, food and clothes. The Abdul Gafoor Mosque looked impressive from the outside too.

Little India is still largely untouched by tourists - I certainly saw very few although there are quite a few backpacker hostels near the mosque - but despite this, as a lone woman traveller I still felt very safe and had no hassle or even any awkward moments. I'd love to go back and spend some more time wandering the backstreets and looking for treasures of all descriptions. I've also been advised that the restaurants are excellent!"
,,Best South Indian food outside India!,5.0,,"Even in south-India its not easy to find such a variety of restaurants with 60s / 70s decor, heavy, solid wooden furniture...marble top tables...etc and food served on banana leaf, excellent!"
,,Loads to see after dark,4.0,,"Colourful at any time, Little India is even better at night. We took an evening walk past colourfully painted shop fronts and throngs visiting Hindu temples. So much life happens fight there on the street: not just hawker food stands and vegetable stalls, but flower necklace vendors, tailors, mechanics, henna tattooists, all doing business at a frenetic rate with passing crowds. Food licensing in Singapore is amongst the strictest in the world so eat anywhere that looks good to you.
We took a turn to an alley one block back from the Main Street and found a whole different slice of life: restaurant workers loading supplies for grabbing a quick cigarette, locals hauling their shopping home. A terrific contrast.
Make sure you visit Mustafas, an extraordinary cross between a department store and a bazaar that never closes (REALLY never closes!). Before entering you must check your shopping bags in with the 'cloak', a counter and shelves on the footpath - never mind, it's quite safe - and it's a good idea to check the LCD display by the door to see how crowded it is inside. Then go in and just gawk at all the stuff you never knew anyone needed: shoes, iPads, Indian costume jewellery, confectionary, herbal medicine, crockery, clothes, Indian-licensed versions of brand foods and cosmetics... it's mind-boggling and so very, well, Indian!"
,,Takes you to another place,3.0,,"This area really feels like you've traveled to another place, like India. Shops, food stalls, fresh produce all are common sights. A nice to change to see from the fast-paced fancy city life of Singapore. Don't need a lot of time here."
,,Don't Bother,1.0,,"Had heard so much about Little India that I was quite looking forward to the experience. Shortest visit to any place I've ever been to. Caught the train from Clarke Quay (beautiful area) and stepped off into another world at Little India... had a quick walk to Mustafas and headed straight back to the train. Really, unless you are dead keen on experiencing 'sights, smells and sounds'...don't go! I just can't find the words to give justice to the experience... just saying I'm never going back there!"
,,Not to be missed!,4.0,,"This area is so different than the rest of Singapore, I'm very glad I took the time to explore it. Most of Singapore is ultra-modern and glitzy so Little India feels like you're in another world. The small, crowded side streets off Serangoon Road are a jumble of small storefronts selling a wide variety of goods and services - technology, clothing, food, mobile service, veggies and fruit, pet stores - it's all there smashed together with blaring music and TVs playing and lots of people. If you want a relaxing evening stroll, this isn't the place to go. If you want to see a real community going through their evening activities - noise and crowds and all - check this out! I also went shopping in Mustafas and was overwhelmed with the variety of everything. Quite an outing! A very ""real"" experience in a city that often feels very superficial. Oh, btw, I walked around on my own, at night, single female, and felt safe. However I wouldn't wear revealing clothing or massive jewelry on your stroll through Little India. Be smart and low key."
,,The Glimpses of India,4.0,,"The place keeps the Indian Subcontinent culture alive in Singapore. People from the region feel at home and experience the authentic Indian experience once they reach the area. Many of old day trades can still be found here. Fortune-tellers and their parrots, flower vendors selling garlands of jasmine, roasted nuts sellers on pushcarts, street-side newspaper vendors, stalls selling Ayurvedic massage oils, gold, incense and fabrics in a variety of textures are just some of the interesting sights to be found. Do not forget to do rituals at the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, a Hindu temple dedicated to the goddess Kali. The area has many Indian restaurants having South & North Indian foods. The taste & preparation is same as we have in India. Finally no trip to Little India is complete without an all-night shopping spree at the 24-hour emporium, Mustafa Centre for the lowest price in Singapore for any item. You can buy gifts and souvenirs from here."
,,"Thriving, bustling - it is India",4.0,,"Imagine the hustle and bustle of India without the maddening (or mad?) traffic and dirt - you would not be far off here. Lots to eat, wander about and he famous Mustapha's store which has to be seen and is a legend in itself."
,,"Place for Souvenir, Indian Clothes and Indian Food",5.0,,in This part of the City you find the Indian part of Singapore. You have a big variety of Indian Foods and clothes in this area. Also there is the famous Mustafa Centre. Also there is the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple.
,,Meh....,2.0,,"I walked around most of the streets in the little India district...ok for a look see, but nothing spectacular to be seen. Nothing bad about this area, just not overly interesting."
,,Place for souvenir hunting and budget shopping,4.0,,"A colourfull place for souvenir purchase.

Eat outs are good and competitively priced for Indian dishes.

Though the place is little dirty and congested its nice place around Deepavali season

Lot of Temples,road side shops selling variety of item......yes it's a good plae for budget holidayers"
,,Wont be going back,3.0,,"went to this place to visit took the mrt with hubby and children, it was a culture shock just getting off the mrt, straight away you could just smell the difference. as we continued down towards little India my children just wanted to get out of there they found the place to be very dirty and the smell was unpleasant, but we continued on. there are alot of jewellery shops and places to buy souvenirs but we didnt eat there as the children felt uncomfortable. Will never visit little India again. this is our personel experience."
,,Good place for budget travelers,3.0,,"A good place for south Indian people. Lots of shops and hotels offering good south Indian options.
Lots of temples there
Hotels like Komalas, Komala villa, Anand bhavan ......are available.
But if you are indian and planning to buy something in singapore , its really not worth it as you get far better things in India at a cheaper rate.
Finally if you want to have a feel of India, stay or visit there
Mustafa market is big flop show. Nothing great except for the size"
,,A deepavali time treat,4.0,,"Went to the night market during the late October festival time. No camera can truly capture the smells, sounds and vibrancy of the place. Lots of vegetarian restaurants. Market stalls heaving with fresh vegetables. Saw them making genuine flower head garlands. Incredible jewellery displays in the windows and henna tattoo artist at work."
,,Some of the best indian food,5.0,,When traveling to this side of the world my friend and I decided to pop into an indian restaurant that we thought looked very interesting. It was probably one of the best meals we have had. This area is definitely worth a visit.
,,So colourful,5.0,,"We went for dinner one evening and there was festival for october so lots of lights etc, was nice to stroll around and take in all the colours and smells,,yumm curry!!! we dined and the food was delish...a must do for sure."
,,Experience India in Singapore,4.0,,"The population of Singapore comprises many ethnic groups. Chinese, Indian, Malay, and others. They all meld together to form a marvellous multi- cultural base. For myself, I found little India too much, with thousands of traders selling much the same. BUT as a travel writer, and being objective, this place is a haven of colour, fragrant smells, culture and interest. The Indian quarter is alive, it is vibrant and it is welcoming. If you like Indian cuisine, hustle and bustle and a fantastic buzz then you must visit here, it would be a great shame not to whiteness what the community had achieved here. It is truly lovely."
,,Such a lively place,5.0,,Its a great place if you are looking for indian foods and restaurants ..fruits and of course the musthafa hyper market. ..which has everything u need.. My son lovved the place as he got his masala dosa.
,,Wonderul smells and sights,4.0,,The thing I loved most about Little India was the smell. As you walked the streets and allies the wafts of spices was wonderful. Lots of interesting little shops to explore and the randomness of these is interesting. One minute you are looking at tourist trinkets next antiques then hardware.
,,Bright and Vibrant,5.0,,"Wander at random around the streets and markets, we were blown away by the sights, sounds and smells and loved the street food."
,,Not for everyone,3.0,,"We stayed in Little India for 3 nights and I found it a complete culture shock stopping out of the MRT station! My 10 year old just never felt safe or comfortable.I think the smell and atmosphere.

I can't say I don't like it but would prefer NOT to go there or stay again.It is a very busy place!
Each for there own.A great culture lesson there!"
,,Colourful and interesting experience,4.0,,"First of all, Singapore is a city for walking around and visiting different areas full of people and markets. One of the ""must have"" in Singapore is Little India. Even though it is near big and modern buildings, when you arrive there, you enter in a different time and space. The neighbourhood's life burns around beautiful old houses where you can find all types of shops, where you can buy for example food, gold jewels, Indian clothes and fabrics or religious objects. In addition, there are some beautiful temples in the area, not only Hindu temple, you can also visit Buddhist an Chinese temples without leaving Little India."
,,Literally a little India !,4.0,,Very nice place for Indians to visit. Different kinds of Indian cuisine available. Every shops are very close and walkable.There is a Temple nearby and Musthafa shopping complex is close . Musthafa is open 24x7.
,,India in Singapore,3.0,,"If you want a teaser of India before going to India, this is the right place. It is overflowing with people on weekends. Best Indian restaurants can be found here. SO many men can be seen on the road, and the women population is very less. The Sim Lim Square and Tower provides you with the best electronics range. One can find almost anything there."
,,India in Singapore,4.0,,"As its name suggests, this is a place that tries to replicate India....... A nice place to shop and have good indian food.....If you are from India..you won't be surprised to see the difference from the normal places in Singapore... Its a bit dirtier, the people are a bit less helpful... bit overall a good place to shop and eat indian food."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Like Chinatown only all Indian. Plenty off shops selling all sorts of cheap things. A bit on the dirty side but an interesting experience. Had a very nice Indian meal there.
,,Worth visiting but not for everyone.,4.0,,If you are snobby and can't handle an unusual smell or dirty street perhaps it's not for you. If you love Indian food you will love it. From tiny stalls to hawker centres to decent restaurants its got it all. I did get a dodgy meal at seemed to be a chain fast food Indian place. But other than that it was good. Make sure you check out the Mustafa Centre at the top end of the street. Best money exchange rates and good prices in the department store. The Tandoori restaurant just up from the money exchange was friendly and quite good even for the western palate.
,,Absolutely Dreadful,1.0,,"We are currently in Singapore and visited last night. I found the people rude, there were mainly men in the area very few women and they stare, spit and push you out of the way. We walked into 2 shops and were ignored so left. The fresh food stalls did look fantastic for locals. We were disgusted that there were Singaporeans were cleaning up after the Indians as they just throw rubbish anywhere. There was no way we would eat here. Walked into a small store with electrical goods, gold jewellery and cheap make up. It was just so packed with people we left, there was nothing enjoyable about Little India. Would definitely not take children here, and would not return. Could not find toilets anywhere either, such a contrast to everything else we have seen in Singapore."
,,"Interesting, authentic atmosphere but very dirty",3.0,,We went to Little India after a visit to Singapore's Old china Town & there was a stark contrast between the two cultural enclaves. We arrived by hop on / hop off bus and many of the other people on the bus did not get off at Little India because they were put off by the 'slum' appearance. It is worth visiting but I feel the shop keepers and stall holders could do themselves a favour by cleaning the area up - there was a lot of garbage in the streets and slime on the ground which really smelled terrible in the heat and humidity. The stall holders and shop keepers were not as friendly as in other parts of Singapore.
,,"Stimulate the senses with the color, sounds, and scents of little India, Singapore.",5.0,,"Prior to my stay in Singapore, I did my research. Little India was one of my top 10 must experience.

No matter what time of the day you go, be prepared for the heat and humidity. If you are trying on clothes, especially important as the sizes aren't the same as American clothing, plan to slip them over your own top. They don't have dressing rooms, and only a few provide a tiny space with a curtain to stand behind. Three tops were my limit, as I just got too sticky hot.

Make sure to locate the markets for fresh ingredients and spices. I had extra help from our Sri Lankan/American friend who knew what spices I needed to get to begin my culinary exploration into Indian food.

I enjoyed my time in Little India, and plan to visit it again for a few cultural gifts for grandchildren back home."
,,Dirty,1.0,,"Hmmm so many better things to do in Singapore leave this one out or last! The place is filthy I would rather go hungry than contemplate eating there,"
,,A morning stroll,4.0,,good to get the ambiance and visit the local temples and experience street life. good place to pick up souveniers.
,,Very interesting shops!,5.0,,"The shophouses are very colourful. They sell lots of interesting goods, such as spices, jewellery, wigs, henna, and flowers. It was a very nice walk. Nice to take pictures!"
,,Most Disgusting Places in Singapore,1.0,,"Indians are typically low on hygiene, and Little India is a stark example of this reality (not being racist - I am myself an Indian).

It is the most disgusting places to visit in Singapore, with dirty streets (garbage lying around), people spitting in front of you and eyes staring at indian tourists (women) as if they have never seen a girl in their life.

The good part is the variety of cheap indian food (and the food smell around some places) that you can get when here. There is also a cheap hypermarket (Mustafa Centre) here, which is a great place for good deals on almost anything and everything.

You can give this a miss when in Singapore"
,,Fascinating,4.0,,A trip to and walk through Little India is an interesting and great experiences. It is a little like stepping back into Singapore as it was 20 years ago and well worth the visit.
,,A bit disappointing,2.0,,We were referred by a few taxi driver to head to Little India's shopping centre Mustafa for bargains. I found the prices to be the same if not not than Australia for most item. It was very crowded and dirty. The street food was nice and cheap. It was good to experience it but I wouldn't go back.
,,India in Singapore,4.0,,"Close your eyes and take a deep breath, Yep the smells of india rush in, walk around and have a curry, One of the best places I have seen without being in India. The shops are just great."
,,Mustafas,4.0,,"Lots of good bargains. Best to go through the week although they are open 24/7. Cheap clothes, tablecloths etc but you need to check out Chinatown first."
,,A Taste of INDIA in SINGAPORE,3.0,,"It was a great experience to be at this place. This was the first place we went on our first night in Singapore. It happened that there was a festival being held that time. They called it ""DIWALI"" meaning festival of lights. The streets were so bright with lanterns hanging and very colorful. Lots of restaurants to choose from. My friend who live in Singapore lead us to a restaurant that they know well. I wish I had returned in a day time for shopping and see the ambiance during the day of Little India."
,,Little India,4.0,,"Although I have never been to India, it feels very authentic with plenty of shops for the Indian community (and a lot for tourists as well!) it is a nice and colourful escapade from downtown singapore. Lots of shops, exotic smells, and restaurants."
,,Little India,4.0,,"The sights and smells are great, Good bargins to be had and a lot of very interesting stalls. For those who do not like tatoos the hena work is very good."
,,Solid only,3.0,,Fairly early one Saturday morning I took the MRT to Little India station. Walking around quite interesting and the older style Singapore shophouse architecture was of note and worth a photo. Obviously plenty of eating and shopping options. I then walked up to Farrer Park MRT and ventured elsewhere. Probably worth returning for a meal and some shopping.
,,Good for shopping and great food!,4.0,,"We took a taxi out to Little India and our taxi driver suggested he drop us off at the Mustafa Centre which is a huge Indian department store which sells just about anything. I bought some really nice shirts at a very reasonable price. The prices in general at the Mustafa Centre were very good.
After that we took a stroll down the main street and the shops had a great varietie of goods and we were not hassled at all.
We finished the night off with a great meal and cold Kingfisher beer at KahnsumaTandoori Restaurant which had outstanding North Indian food. I have reviewed this restaurant separately on Trip Advisor."
,,Good contrast of how 'the other half live',4.0,,"Sights and smells are very similart to real India, although much less harsh on the senses. Bright bustling and colourful. Kids loved it. My daughter had a henna artwork done, 5 dollars, bought some hair decorations, my some bought some bargain mangos. Food stalls galore.

A good day out. Go to the loo before you venture out!"
,,"Crowded, Dirty and Stares!",2.0,,"If you are South Asian by skin, be careful enough to wear very conservative clothing. Otherwise you will get unwelcoming looks. Even a decently covered mere sleeveless top gets you the odd looks! But you'll probably get to experience typical Indian atmosphere, culture, food and shops here. Sad that I personally couldn't all this though."
,,India - without having to go to India,4.0,,"If you want to buy Indian things like clothes, decorations, masalas then this is where you will find them. Full of Indian jewelry stores, clothing stores like sarees, restaurants and grocery store, its a must visit if you want to see a glimpse of India."
,,very India on weekend,4.0,,"Mrt station little India , There are many indian food along race course rd . Lots of backpackers inn . For ladies , can can the eyebrown threading at 5 sin dollar , and henna art from $5 onward ."
,,India in Singapore,3.0,,"Little india was a fun experience, with delicious smells wafting out of the countless food stalls. The heckling performed by some stall owners is also an interesting experience. Whether this is an authentic representation of India, I don't know, but it is certainly something to do when in Singapore."
,,Little India - True to its name,4.0,,"If you want a taste of South India in Singapore - this is the place to be. From Food to Shopping - this place has got everything.The area is quite big - lined with temples, textile shops, jewelry shops and fruit /veg markets and has two MRT stations ( Little India and Farrer Park) in the vicinity. There are also few indian banks that have set shop in this area. Overall - a good place."
,,A Must do,5.0,,"Loved the culture, colours and aromas. I wish i had more time to spend here, beautiful Saris and fabrics. My girls loved being able to buy beautiful bindhi's and bracelets at really reasonable prices"
,,Market Dream,5.0,,My daughter went mad here. Very different to Chinatown in Singapore but well worth going to visit both. While you're here make sure you stroll down to Bugis Street as well.
,,Because OF Its Name =One Will Be Tempted To Visit,3.0,,Well it on list of every tour operator to Singapore;‚ÄôSo called Little India is spread in large area with large number of big and small shops; located in lanes and by lanes crowded all the time. There are reasonably priced budged hotels; but not as good ;neat and clean as in rest of Singapore;. I feel one may visit this place but some may not enjoy it .Don‚Äôt forget to visit near by Mustafa Mal one of the biggest and very reasonably priced shopping mal in Singapore .
,,A Colourful Contrast ...,4.0,,"Little India was photographers dream. Full of colourful architecture, street markets and wonderful authentic Indian food.

Easy to get around, close to shopping centres.

We stayed 2 nights in the area. Hotels were reasonably priced, with a close proximity to Marina Bay Sands via taxi. A wonderful contrast of both worlds."
,,Good fun to visit,4.0,,"I went to Little India twice, once for a visit and again when I changed hotels and stayed for one night in the area. It is a fun place but this was extra special because the preparations for Deepavali were underway and the streets were festooned with banners and people were getting ready with food and special clothing for the occasion, Hinduism's very special religious event.

It is a busy place. The sights, smells and sounds, not to mention tastes when you dine in one of the local restaurants are rich and exotic. The indoor market was great fun and made for some fantastic photo's. Another indoor market, (on the other side of the road and up some escalators) was where I bought several outfits. A tip for the women reading this: in this market you will find lots of light,colourful and summery tips, dresses and Indian suits which will be perfect for your travelling wardrobe.

The food in this area is worth eating. I had a few excellent meals there, all South Indian of course because this area is populated by people originating from southern India. I also had an Ayurvedic
Massage there which was great."
,,"Little India, Big Adventure!",5.0,,I hadn't been to Little India since about 2009. Went with the family yesterday and had a great time. Crossing some of the big streets is a bit tricky with little kids (especially with the roadworks) but gee has this place been spruced up! The markets in Bugis Street are fantastic! Exciting and vibrant. The new shopping hubs are amazing with lots to offer. Sim Lim Square has floors and floors of gadgets to explore. Could easily spend many hours exploring this area.
,,Bag a bargain,4.0,,"Get an MRT connection to Farrer Park MRT station.
Start at City Square Mall, located at the junction of Serangoon and Kitchener Roads. It sits on the site of Singapore's historic New World Park. Some of the best shopping and a lovely modern centre (with a Metro Department Store).
Cross Kitchener Road to Mustafa's where the locals shop - you can get just about anything your heart desires at a great price.
Feel like a curry? Only place to eat for authentic Indian food,
Walk the streets and admire the old buildings, mosques and temples. If it's atmosphere you are craving, Little India is it."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Definitely come and see this part of Singapore as it perfectly represents Singapore's successful and multicultural community. Great food to be had in the indoor food market (think it's called the Imbi Centre) and a lovely morning can be spent wandering through the incense and brightly coloured fabric stalls.

If you really explore it there are hidden treausures to be found!"
,,"Little India, Little Marvel!",4.0,,I hadn't been to Little India since about 2009. Went with the family yesterday and had a great time. Crossing some of the big streets is a bit tricky with little kids (especially with the roadworks) but gee has this place been spruced up! The markets in Bugis Street are fantastic! Exciting and vibrant. The new shopping hubs are amazing with lots to offer. Sim Lim Square has floors and floors of gadgets to explore. Could easily spend many hours exploring this area.
,,"Disgusting, dirty, stinky - don't go unless you have lots of sanitary wipes",1.0,,Just try to find a decent bathroom or clean place to relax in this place. Every restaurant that i have been in at Little India has absolutely horrid bathrooms. One thing is for sure- it will definately take care of your appetite.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Little India is a place in Singapore that you should visit. While it is dirty and cramped with a lot of people its very interesting and cultured with a lot of beautiful Indian souvenirs that you can buy. There are lots of food places where you of course must get curry from, and lots of things to look at. Probably a place to only visit once but even still its a must visit."
,,"Typical Little India, lot of eating places",4.0,,"Lots of low cost (in Singapore Standards) Hotels and eating places. Overall, a nice atmosphere to look around shop and eat."
,,"Great food, shopping, lots of people",4.0,,"The only reason I didn't give the area a five is because there is some construction at the moment and made it a bit difficult to walk in some places. Other than that, I am really enjoying little India. There is lots of food, lots of shopping, and there are MRT stations available."
,,Nice place for food,4.0,,We enjoyed the sights and smells of Little India. We enjoyed the different food stalls and the personality of the owners of the different food shops. Very inexpensive food and snack. We spent $4.00 (Singapore) for 2 Samosas and 2 pulled teas for a snack.
,,something different,4.0,,"If you wanted to see something different beside chinatown little india may be the best next thing to be visit, may be you can eat here just to taste what india food taste like"
,,Tis what it is,3.0,,Interesting to look at the blingy jewelry and lovely saris. Bollywood playing on all tv's and competing volumes make for a loud dinner at one of the many restaurants on the street. Colourful at night. Good Indian food!
,,Not to condemn,2.0,,"unfortunate my hostel is near to little india. i'm quite afraid when i walk alone there, a lot of people but i just feel like i'm at chennai india gosh!

a lot of store and restaurant but i'm not into indian food. very rare malay food and chinese food there."
,,Very uncomfortable,2.0,,"Stayed in a hotel in Little India but checked out after 2 days of our 4 day stay. Very disconcerting to walk down the street with my husband past large groups of Indian men who stare and leer as I walk past. Certainly wouldn't walk around their as a lone female. Footpaths are appalling and uneven, crowded with market stalls and people. Just getting from A to B is an effort. Walk through here once for the experience but it's basically a dirty and undesirable area."
,,The only place for plenty of good Indian food,3.0,,The streets of Little India gives a perfect picture of how India actually is. Roaming in the streets of this place provides a opportunity to have variety of spicy Indian food. Mustafa Mall in this area provides all the essential items at reasonable prices.
,,Absolutely disgusting,1.0,,"Went to little India based on the many good reviews that I have read online. Upon reaching little India my first impression was ""this is not what I was expecting in Singapore."" There was crazy traffic and so many guys just perving at you it felt like they were taking a full X-ray scan of you. On top of that it was considered normal to just spit on the ground where ever you felt like and o just throw your rubbish away wherever you want. However the sour icing on the cake would have to be when I was trying to catch a taxi to take me back to my hotel. Every taxi driver refused to take me back and it literally took us around an hour and a half to find a willing taxi driver to take is bak to our hotel. Overall will not be going back there ever again.

Piece of advice, if you do choose to go ten go during the day where you instead of the night time"
,,When not to go there,3.0,,"I stayed at a hotel nearby last year while on a business trip. After getting out of the underground exit, I walked through Little India. It was during the weekend and the place was packed with Indians. I was the only odd one there. Later I found out from the locals that the place on weekend is packed with Indians and fights had been reported, so non Indians avoid the place on weekends. Therefore, try to go there on weekdays instead."
,,"Friendly people, bustling market filled with exiotic vegies, seasoned foods & colorful architectures all come to mind.",5.0,,"Just like Chinatown, I love the vibant color of the architectures that fill the streets. Restaurants, clothing shops, electronic stores, gold jewery shops, increditable intricated design silk fabric, vegetables markets fill with all kinds of seasonings ,exiotic plants and foods that I have never cooked with and am happy to learn about, and the bright and fragant flower necklaces (fun to watch some shop owners could thread the flowers in such a light speed). Every person we ancountered and interacted with was very friendly from any restuarants or shop owners in town.
We stayed at the Perak Hotel, so we spent 3 days in this eighborhood, every night walking out of the Little India MRT station, passing through the markets as we headed back to the hotel, I've just never got tired of what this town has to offer!
I have never been to India, I experience their culture mostly through films/TV, hectic sences are often come to mind when I think of India. Little India is nothing like that, highly recommend!
Also you can kill two birds in one stone, if you visit the Little India, you may want to stop over to the Bugis Village -- where you can find buget clothing and inexpensive food courts."
,,A cultural & historical gem...in the heart of the city!,5.0,,"Good: -Interesting photo-opportunities. -Colourful to see the different shops along the streets. -Famed retailer, MUSTAFA, which started Singapore's 1st 24-hour-shopping. Bad: -Hot weather! -Difficult to walk cause of limited space at the pedestrian walkways. -This place is ALWAYS packed! There is no peak hour traffic."
,,The charm of Little India,4.0,,"Little India, located at Serangoon Road, Singapore is a town full of Indian shops and temples. There are Chinese goldsmith shops and in order to attract Indian customers, the signboards are usually in the Tamil language. The shops sell saris, garlands and Indian CDs. There are Indian restaurants galore and you can eat anything from roti prata to nasi bryani. Even the statues are of Indian origin. Most of the shops sell products imported from Mumbai and New Delhi. Tourists like this place and would come again for a cheap bargain."
,,Little India.. Home away from India,3.0,,"Yes, Compare to rest of Singapore,things are available in reasonable cost. You can get down in "" Bugis "" MRT. Its hardly 5 mins walk from Bugis MRT.You can also visit SIM LIM Square(for electronics,mobiles, computer accessories), Sim Lim Tower ( parts of machineries),Mustafa shopping center( open 24 hours) in the same surroundings.

Dont go on weekends as it is very crowded not because of tourist but for the local pople in work permit as this a only day for them to meet and drink with friends."
,,"little india, J'adore",5.0,,"little indis can offer you all about india, all of them sell with very cheap price, indian jewelry, saris, even India song and india movies, its all there. most i loves most is all spices, cheap jewelry and hoe people dress, bring india culture in strong way. good tips for traveller to going there."
,,India away from India,4.0,,"Man, if you've been to India and need a hit, then Little India is the place to go. It's like stepping through an instant transporter. It's pretty crowded and you can get all that is authentically Indian from food to shopping.

It reminded me of Delhi a little bit. Definitely worth checking out"
,,Find for the cheapest shops...,4.0,,The best place to purchase...for cheap prices...than Mustafa...Many Shops were located one after the other.... Each shop differes to the other... So depends upon your interest you purchase...
,,"""Different Place altogether in Singapore""",3.0,,"If you are traveller from India and missing India & Indian food, Little India is the solution. I also puposely choose to stay closer to Little India to have access to Indian food(while Indian food in Singapore are availavle everywhere).
The place is little crowded & streets & the way it is designed makes you remember home. It has lot of shops to shop & lot many restaurants (Indian & other countries too) to try variety of cuisine.
Mustafa Centre is also there which is like one stop shop for almost everything. In terms of Indian restaurant few names which I remember are Sarvanaa Bhavan, Murugan Idli, Ananda etc.
What I liked was that it had lot of places to shop & have variety of Indian food.
What I liked least was the way the area has been architected. It is unlike the rest of the city.
One needs to plan for atleast 1/2 a day."
,,Good fun. Do you like henna?,4.0,,"Definitely a place to visit, I liked it better than Chinatown. Food, markets, etc. and, another easy train ride.
The highlight of my visit was probably popping up into one of the salons. My friend and I both got henna ""tattoos"" for fun. I'd had them in African countries but never the Indian designs, etc. I paid $35 for both hands and a design on my back and got to spend an interesting afternoon with a woman who moved over from India to get married (arranged marriage, all fascinating!). It was raining so we stayed and got hot oil scalp massages. My only issue was that they were t familiar with my hair type and one of eye ladies got a brush stuck in my hair. We worked it out, though, and it was worth the experience!"
,,Find the subcontinent in Singapore,4.0,,"For those who think Singapore is too sanitized - COME HERE. Smell, see and taste India with all its ups and downs! Miles of small shops selling saris, Hindu kitsch and other bizarre souvenirs. The amazing Mustafa Department Store must be seen with piles of all known brands and styles but featuring many things you wont want. There are some good curry restaurants in between the dodgy ones. Little Hindu temples are worth a visit. Fit out your partner in a full Indian outfit with total over the top jewellery for very little - just what you need for that Bollywood party back home!"
,,Avoid at all costs on a Sunday evening,4.0,,"Just manic but the temples are beautiful, the energy is crazy and you will not believe you are actually in Singapore. Mustafa is a must stop."
,,Flavours of iIndia!,4.0,,"The fragrant smell of spices hits you the second you arrive at Little India, and it gets even better Whether visiting the for the food or the culture, you won't be disappointed!"
,,Exactly like I imagine India to be like - not to be missed!,5.0,,"As we arrived we noted how many people were hanging out on the street socialising, though nothing could have prepared us for when we got to the main shopping street which was absolutely jam packed with people shopping and bargaining. Definitely not a place for anyone with claustrophobia. There were a wide variety of food outlets, shops and hotels. The whole area just felt like how I imagine India to be. An experience not to be missed."
,,"Vibrant colours, cheerful people and a place not to be missed!!",4.0,,"Come after 7pm on any Saturday and you might think that you have landed in India!! Because our hard working India, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, etc. foreign workers will gather here, to look for their friends, to find a resting place for a meal or a drink or simply a chat to catch up with friends after a long week's work!

Come visit Mustafa or City square or Little india Arcade, to bring a few souvenirs home before you leave Singapore. Wait, you gotta try our famous roti prata, nasi biryani (just to name a few) before you go!!"
,,A must when you visit Singapore,4.0,,"For a few moments, walking in the streets of Little India bring me back to my memorable trip in india ... I love the colours, the smells, the food, the busy life ... not to be missed when you are in Singapore!"
,,For Food and Colour,4.0,,"Start your day here with Breakfast, stop over for a quick lunch or have a Banana Leaf spread for dinner. If you go to Little India, do not skip a meal. The various vegetarian and non-vegetarian restaurants are the main draw, but the music and colours makes for a nice walk as well."
,,Great Local Market for Everything Indian,4.0,,"Bustling market popular with locals and tourists. My now Singapore resident daughter and I went shopping for outfits for her daughters to wear to an international day at their school. What fun, the stall holders are very friendly, ""encouraging"" and not at all pushy - the clothing is really inexpensive, I bought three, light, cool tops for S$18, they don't really bargain, but it's fun to give it a try! The food stall areas are well maintained and inspectors ensure the food preparation and cooking areas are clean - my ""Aussie"" stomach has absolutely no problem with the food. There are also lots of really good Indian restaurants along the streets, which serve authentic Indian food. There is also a large produce market, which is a sensation of sights and aromas."
,,Must visit for knick-knack shopping,4.0,,"Conveniently located, budget shopping place for souveniurs at reasonable prices, also get good Indian Restaurants"
,,Fun bustling area,4.0,,We came to Little India in the evening for dinner. I t was enjoyable to walk around and full of happening things. We ate out on the street very good Indian food the best I had in Malaysia and Singapore and all in all enjoyed the evening.
,,Noisy and dirty,3.0,,Looked run down and not too clean. Jewellery in the shops looked garish. Food was tasty but the restaurants are shabby
,,Not too much to see....,3.0,,"Little India is an area in Singapore that mainly centers around Serangoon Road. It has some great food but mainly, it is just a really busy area. Not too much to see besides small restaurants and trinket shops. Mustafa's is a very popular department store in Little India that pretty much has everything...worth a stroll through just to see how much stuff they can pack into one building. You can reach Little India on the MRT (Little India station). Sunday nights are the most crowded with seas of people. If you've never been to India, you can drop in here....otherwise, you can skip it."
,,cheap hotel,4.0,,"you can find many cheap hotels in this area. if you come to singapore with low budget, you can stay in this area. many backpackers also stay here."
,,"Must-do. Busy, tacky, wonderful.",5.0,,We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed - felt like I had been to India! Just loved sitting in a corner cafe drinking lassi and watching all of India pass by! Very atmospheric.
,,Not much to see,3.0,,"It's a nice walking route along Indian atmosphere, but there is not much interesting attractions and things to do."
,,A small taste of India,4.0,,"What I liked about Little India is that it has all the Indian looks, shops, buildings and traditions, right in the middle of Singapore. Having been to India, I found it not that surprising, but it did amaze me how this city can be so different from one neighborhood to the other."
,,Little India,4.0,,"When you enter to Little India, you will feel like you are in India, because it looks exactly like INDIA. Its a place where you will find all Indians roaming around. Indian food is served here at almost every restaurant. This part of town was fun to explore."
,,Colorful and Hot,4.0,,"To be able to appreciate the culture of Inidians, one must walk and roam the streets of Little India. It is colourful, noisy and at times people on the streets will have to look at you with the same curiosity. One's experience cannot be complete with eating in any of the restaurants in the place.

Tip: If you are looking for an authentic Indian food and is cautious of food poisoning, do not worry, any restaurants in little India is safe. You can choose between a vegetarian rest and non vegetarian resto. Tissue is not available in restaurants, go for soda instead of coffee.

Walk until you have satisfied your curiosity of the place, architecture, food and most especially to sit down and converse with the locals. I found my visit satisfying."
,,Like a Trip to India,4.0,,"Walking through Little India on a Friday or Saturday night is like taking a mini vacation. The streets can be teeming with people on the main drags. I lke Race Course Road for the variety of eateries and the more local flavour. The markets are great for spices, nuts, vegetables etc.. Prices are very reasonabe especially for Singapore."
,,Little India,4.0,,"Little India is the colony of Indian settlement near Serangoon, Singapore. And indeed it makes you feel like you are in India. It is old and it would be nice if they spent a few $$ on fixing it up.The area usually crowded with many Indian and international visitors. Many indian restaurants are vegetarian but very tasty food is served."

,,Best food in Singapore,5.0,,Great atmosphere. very safe. fantastic simple food from an unasuming curry cafe. very friendly people. Mustapha shopping centre is well worth a visit as it sells everything. the local money changers give you the best rates in town
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,"Please don't go there. The place is hot, humid, overcrowded and full of pickpockets and thieves. You wouldn't enjoy even a single bit of it. The only place that deserves attention is the mustafa bazar. Rest of it, not worth even a single second of your time"

,,Good to see,3.0,,Its nice but nothing really special. Can give a little taste of Indian culture. I think there are more interesting parts of Singapore
,,"Little India , close to ""INDIA"" !!!",4.0,,"little India looks exactly like ""INDIA"".. its a place where you will find all Indians roaming around..Indian food is served here at almost every restaurant..Best place to have Indian food in entire Singapore.Vegetarians have more options of food here than anywhere else..Very different from rest of Singapore. you get to buy cheap souvenirs here.. Mustafa center , one of the biggest place to shop for Electronics and other daily goods is at one end of the main market.. A lot of street side shops sell knick knacks , watches, apparel and cheap souvenirs..you just need to be careful towards your valuables and belongings."
,,Very unlike rest of Singapore,3.0,,"Little India is the colony of Indian settlement near Serangoon, Singapore.
And indeed it makes you feel like you are in India. There are a lot of street side shops selling knick knacks and cheap apparel, footwear etc. There are a variety of Indian dining options, and vegetarians have more options here than anywhere else in Singapore.
The mustafa market is a huge shopping complex housing everything like footwear, apparel, eatables, cds, electronic items, souvenirs and what not.
Recommended more for guests from the Indian peninsula region, for others it would merely be of cursory interest."
,,Worth Exploring,4.0,,Nice to take your time and explore this part of town where old Singapore meets new. The two temples are pretty but nothing special. The food in general is good and quite cheap. Take your time to look around.
,,An attraction for the culture,4.0,,"Little India has alot of food, and it is just beside Jalan Besar where there are many great foods like Dim Sum, Mutton Soup, etc etc.. Do be careful of your wallets and valuables, and don't visit alone especially if you are a girl. A lot of alleys that may evoke your curiosity but try not to walk there if possible, choose the brighter lanes."
,,Wasn't up to expectation,2.0,,"Generally dirty, alot of road works taking place when I was there. It didnt have much to appeal to the tourist to be honest. The shops were over priced and dysfunctional. Mustafa shopping centre is more for the locals, I was hoping to find cheap prices and gifts for family and friends, this was not the case. I dont see a need to return, having seen it once, that is more than sufficient!"
,,What a horrible little place,2.0,,"If you do decide to go there, wear long pants and long sleeved clothing. I did not, and it felt very uncomfortable. The people just sit around... and they glare / stare at you - it's very disconcerting.

There wasn't really much to do there so we didn't stick around to eat, i've heard there are some good restaurants in Little India.

If I want to go to a place where I will be heckled to buy wares or look at street side vendors, I will go back to Thailand. This place just wasn't my cup of tea."
,,Superb!,4.0,,As you enter Little India you will notice the smell of spices in the air. There are load of restaurants and an impressive temple. The best thing are the colourful and ornate heritage buildings which make this area a must visit in Singapore.
,,Sights and sounds,3.0,,"Will look like India on Saturday night. I think this is good for Westerners to explore. If you don't like crowded places, stay away."
,,Very nice street,4.0,,If you are in Singapore u have to go there . Very busy place u feel u are in India . You can shop and lots off restaurant .for me didn't eat there too spicy . Really enjoin walking there . It's just something different
,,Busy and crowded,3.0,,"OK, busy and crowded place. Seen some remarks about people not feeling safe, but to be honest I saw nothing of this - perfectly safe as far as I am concerned - nobody looked ready to steal anything. Lots of shops, not very clean, but yeah, an interesting place to visit and quite cheap to boot."
,,For those who miss India,4.0,,"If you miss India, this will bring you back there. Great little neighborhood full of mini-markets, textile shops, gold dealers, pawnshops, awesome little restaurants, jaywalkers, running children, and the benign chaos that is the subcontinent. Good subway service and authentic southern, northern, veg and no-veg Indian classics at very good (for Singapore) prices."
,,ethnic diversity,5.0,,"There are lots of markets, food stalls and shops selling all sorts of things. These are relatively cheap and make very interesting sovenoirs to bring home. Many indian restaurants are vegetarian but very tasty food is served. Observe that most wares cater to the indians and diffferent parts of little indian seem to have their gathering of indians from different regions of india. Highly recommended would be the mangos and the curries which already makes trip memorable. A good place would be Mustafa which is open 24hrs. Prices are very fair but crowded. This place is best explored on foot and take lots of pictures as the colours are wonderful. Avoid buying mens pants as color comes off and destroyed my other clothes. After 3 washes the colour still runs. Children will enjoy but keep them close as they may get lost because of the crowd. weekdays are better."
,,Plus the Arab Quarter,5.0,,"Colourful and full of activity. We caught the MRT and then did lots and lots of walking. The place was so colourful, we didn't want to miss anything. Quite a few stalls to haggle over items. Very pleasant people, they try to get you to buy, but if you say no politely they just walk away and wish you a lovely day. If you go to Little India - you absolutely must visit The Arab Quarter - Arab Street in particular. This was one of my trip highlights - some fantastic shopping was done here. i bought clothes, shoes and fabric - really good quality fabric. Absolutely loved it & if I'd had more time and money, I would've returned here. My feet were aching by the end of the day."
,,Immersing in authentic culture,5.0,,"This is about as 'real' as it gets, in terms of preserving the way of life of one of the races in Singapore. Numerous restaurants selling lovely food to tantalize your palate, and markets with their exciting colours."
,,LIttle WHAT ! !,4.0,,"my last vivit here was like a month ago. i visit Little India every once a month. Just to purchase some good quality sarees and just to walk around and feel as though im in India. And there is this sweet shop somewhere in the arcade ""MUGHAL SWEETS' or something..IT IS A MUST TRY"
,,Enjoyed this before going to real India !!,4.0,,"Singapore is so diverse , so much to see and do. Eating out in most of Singapore is expensive but we discovered the food halls in Little India ( downstairs) and the flavours were just exquisite. We had a couple of vegetarian dishes with chapati and it cost 8sgd for the 2 of us and was the best meal we had in our 4 days in Singapore. its a must to go there."
,,Love it - Opinion on long stay and short visit,5.0,,"We stayed in Little India for five nights at the Moon Hotel. We chose the Moon Hotel because of its value for money and its proximity to the Little India MRT station. I was really excited at the prospect of staying in Little India and I'm so glad we did. We later stayed around Clarke Quay and the different vibes between the two places is just amazing.

I can understand why people who come out to visit Little India for a couple of hours might be disappointed because I found the real joy in it was just watching the people, the businesses and the cars go about their day. While the buildings and temples are nice to look at the real attraction is the people and the culture that they live in. The energy of it can be a little overwhelming at first but I think in the end that was what really made me fall in love with it.

The people don't really smile at you or say good morning (and sometimes you feel like they're looking at you) but I can't say that anyone was rude or tried to make us feel uncomfortable. I think a lot of tourists misinterpret them as hostile when really it's just that they couldn't care less about (or be bothered by) your presence. Whenever we dealt with shopkeepers or waiters they were always very friendly and did their best to speak good english (although the shopkeepers are really pushy). I'm a 19 year old girl with pale skin and was travelling with my equally pale boyfriend but I can't say that I ever experienced any uncomfortable exchanges with the men there like some other women have said in their reviews here. I will admit that they stare at you, but you just take it in your stride and don't let it bother you. If you don't want to get stared at, dress respectfully.

A must-see is the Tekka Centre. You have to go to the hawker centre on the first floor and get lunch from one of the dozens of food stalls. We spent $6 on the two of us and it was delicious. The other parts of the Tekka Centre are equally as fascinating. Go upstairs and browse through all the shops - my favourites were an antique store and on old man who sells dressmaking supplies and had an amazing array of (cheap!) ribbon. On the same floor there is a huge balcony area that gives you a birds-eye view of the meat and seafood market section. We spent a good amount of time there watching how they prepare and serve their meats (a world away from any other Singaporean butcher!)

I would suggest giving the Mustafa Centre a miss, but if you have the spare time do a wander through Sim Lim tower. I don't know that I would recommend buying anything from there, but it's a bizarre treasure trove that's worth a look. Side note: the toilets in Sim Lim tower were the only clean ones I came across (not to say I didn't miss any) so seize the opportunity!

I wouldn't hesitate staying there again, but if you do I would definitely recommend splitting your stay with somewhere closer to the city because they really are two different worlds. If you've only got time for a short visit (which is super easy because the MRT stops right in the centre) then I would recommend a walk down Serangoon Road (plus any little alleys that jump out at you) and a meal and a wander around the Tekka Centre. Focus less on it being a top-class tourist destination and more on it being a chance to take a step back and live with the locals for a couple hours."
,,"Great collection of saris, shops, and eateries.",4.0,,Stall after stall of multi-coloured clothing and goods. The buildings were low-rise early 20th C. with ornate decoration and a wonderful feel. Several blocks of temples and markets gave this the atmosphere of the real India with the cleanliness of Singapore.
,,Enjoy this area.,4.0,,"After shopping on Orchid Road we went here and it is a different world. Prices is nice here, and we found several good India restaurant to 1/2 prices as in Orchid Road. Remember to visit Mustafa, and see all what he have in his shop"
,,Heart of Singapore !,5.0,,"I have been living close to Little India for the last 8 months or so. There is no place in Singapore that is more lively that Little India. This place has unparalleled energy - lots of Indian restaurants, temples and of course, Indians too !
Some of the best options for food are: Tekka Market food court, Khansama restaurant, Muthu's curry, Saravana Bhavan - the list goes on !
And, there is Mustafa too - the biggest shooping complex and the most complex designed shopping mall. This is a one stop shop for all your needs. It is open 24X7 for 365 days."
,,not a reason for going to singapore,2.0,,"given that there is not reason for going to Singapore, the very attractive little india is really boring with nothing that some indian shop and restaurants but nothing that is worth to be seen"
,,India,4.0,,"Take the metro and go to the littile India, you feel completely different, you can imagine yourself in India. you can visit Sri Veeramakaliaman temple but my advice just smell the difference and walk around the streets. Before enter the temple if you see the people who ring the bell, it is traditional and made to warn the spirits about you. between two metro station there is a place (close to other station at the right) where you can eat good Indian food, you have to try. there are lots of jewellery shops which solds tons of gold but be aware they can be worthless in your country."
,,only visit if you never been or never visiting india,2.0,,"There is nothing in little india, and its waste of time to visit, esp if you are on short trip. Never visit mustafa. But its a bit different in whole of singapore. You would get a different look and feel here from whole of singapore."
,,"Great atmosphere, good food",4.0,,It is truly a scene from India right in the middle of Singapore. This is as authentic as it comes not pandering to the tourist
,,Experience India abroad,3.0,,"Typical Indian style markets, very crowded and a shopping paradise for cheap stuff..Should visit Mustafa store which is open 24x7. Getting taxis is very difficult from here, especially on weekends..Not recommended for family on weekends"
,,Quaint area,5.0,,"This is one of the highlights in Singapore. I loved walking the streets with the colorful, quaint old-world buildings. Each has a nice looking boutique, cafe, restaurant or place to browse in.I visited earlyish in the morning and it was not crowded so I could take photos. I can imagine that the place will be vibrant in the evenings. A photographers dream."
,,A place to stay during your trip to Singapore,5.0,,"The cries from the abattoirs filled the air while the 'bhai susu' outside rang their bells ‚ÄòMilk, fresh milk!‚Äô Buffalo carts bearing goods and people of every shape, size and persuasion went rickety by. It was once said that there are three ways to India from Singapore: by ship, by plane, and by a short walk to Little India. Look here a spice, there a garland, and hail, a sagely old bird who tells your fortune! One always finds it so difficult to resist the charms of Little India."
,,Awesomeeee,5.0,,"This is one place you cannot afford to miss if ur an India . Fooooodddd is just tooo good here . Places to try are : Balaji Bhawan , Sarvanna bhavan , Copper chimney ."
,,uncomfortable surroundings,2.0,,"This area made us uncomfortable with the wandering Indian people staring at us in an unfriendly way, seemed like they were about to rip our belongings... Only good thing was everything's sooooo cheap including the currency exchange, which we felt like almost a steal."
,,Love the vibe,5.0,,"I love the vibe there‚Ä¶ colourful, full with store selling spices. Not too crowded as china town. But unique enough to just strolling down and take pictures"
,,Kind of Disappointing,3.0,,"Saw Anthony Bourdain go here on the Travel Channel and though we should check it out. I guess if you are into Indian food, this would be a good place to go, but we found it crowded, filled with shops with cheap quality goods and a little dirty. There were a few interesting temples and mosques, but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere in Singapore. I guess we are glad we saw it, but wouldn't go back. In my view, only worth it if you love Indian food or have some extra time."
,,Do check out Mustafa Centre!,3.0,,"The Tourism website for SG says that Mustafa is a place for great bargains, but of course NOT everything is a bargain. I will write down what I found are great deals - 1kg packets of chocolates which are mostly imported from Italy & Turkey (If you go to fancy candy stores found at shopping centres, they are priced at a staggering $4 per 100g but here at Mustafa, you can get similar ones for only $14 for 1kg!!!), chocolate soy milk from Thailand (at only $1 for 6 250ml packets!!! of course the expiry date was about a month later), organic fruit juice from New Zealand ($3.20 for a 750ml glass bottle. I doubt it can be found this cheap anywhere else), Japanese Kokuho rice (It retails for only $9.20 here but at major supermarket chains, it is going for $10.10 & even if it were on offer, it is still more expensive at $9.40), Snowman figurine chocolates (It is going for only $2 after X'mas! During X'mas season, it was going for $4.90! So now, it is less than half price! If you are a chocolate lover & don't mind post-X'mas chocolates, this is definitely a steal!!! Psst... dpn;t worry, the expiry date is in March for the snowman & in July for Santa Claus figurine chocolates), & yes ladies' shoes are cheap here too! If you compare them to fancy shoe stores at shopping centres, they are cheap. Most of them are priced below $20 & the quality is decent. There is a huge variety too. Go check them out! Happy shopping!!!

However, you may be disappointed to know that the toilets here are sub-standard. They have no toilet paper, sinks are clogged so you see the yucky stuff of whoever vomitted earlier, floor is wet with black footsteps, & there is no liquid soap. Maybe this depends on which floor you go to. I have not been to all the ladies toilet yet so I can't say for sure. But it is definitely better to use the loo first at the nearby City Square Mall where the toilets are a 100 times better."
,,Curry and a Pint!,5.0,,"Best place to find a curry at a great value as well as have an afternoon pint and meet other expats. Later in the evening a few hooks bars open up for business :) Zsofi's rooftop bar, and Prince of Wales. Also check out Star Cafe Inn!"
,,Interesting to explore,4.0,,"Little India MRT is close, Tekka centre is interesting and a must for the hawker market serving a wide variety of Malay & indian. The centre also has asian markets to borwse and the food stalls are most interesting. Do a walking tour of the area up along Serangoon Road and the surrounding side streets to see how the locals live and work."
,,If you really need something..,3.0,,"One can just hop on the MRT and it will lead you to Little India station and you are there.It's pretty busy,humid and crowded ,the roads are not well maintained as other parts of Singapore so be careful while you are walking about .If you are wheelchair user it's a huge challenge navigating as the lack of ramps and proper walkways as well as the narrow walkways.
There are a lot of gold ,textile ,eateries ( veg and non veg) ,flowers,beauty parlors and provisions shops .But I wouldn't say that they are cheap as I am comparing the prices with Little India in Malaysia and India itself it's terribly overpriced especially the textiles and flowers .Even the groceries in the market are slightly more expensive compared to other grocers (Mustafa &NTUC). Food is also expensive even in the vegetarian restaurants.
Unless you really need to get something urgent ,just sightseeing over there is good enough but don't go crazy buying everything in sight as it's not worth the price .
For ladies if you are into threading Gooday happens to be one of the better parlors around ,clean and neat work as I have experienced less desirable service and results at the few others."
,,Interesting Area of the City,4.0,,"We used the Hop-on Hop-off bus to visit this area of Singapore. The large market in Tekka Centre is big, busy, and noisy. Some bargains are available if you look for them and can stand the crowds. If you walk along Serangoon Street there are many little shops and restaurants set down just below street level (something to do with the settlement of the city). Overhead are brightly coloured street banners that clearly mark this as an ethic area of Singapore. As you walk down Serangoon take time to visit Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. There are also a couple of other temples along the street worth looking at. If you are visiting Singapore, it is worth taking some time to visit this area of the city."
,,Vibrant a must visit,5.0,,"Old architecture, street stalls with fragrant flowers and spice , great little eateries, take the MRT to little India station ,and your right there"
,,A good place for shopping,3.0,,"We visited here in search of a cheap sports bag (to help cart all of our extra purchases home) and were excited to find one easily and for a really good price. It seems that you could buy most things here from clothes to bags to sunglasses to groceries, but after a while all of the merchandise in the stores looks the same."
,,Cheap but not that pretty,3.0,,I chep place to stay. Plenty of hostels but the streets are dirty and the atmosphere isn't as glamorous as the rest of singapore
,,Best Shopping In TOwn,4.0,,"It is surrounded by little shops to snak or have a big meal...three main buildings, full of stuff...the locals swamp that place as well...24hr hours...must try is the canteen...spacious, and great local delights..."
,,Messy,1.0,,"This is not the place for getting exposure to Indian culture. Most stores are selling ""gold"" jewelry and the place is teeming with people all over. It is dirty, does not feel safe and definitely messy."
,,Interesting & cheap,4.0,,"Little India seems older and dirtier than other parts of Singapore but don't be fooled. It's a really interesting area and they have some great shops, rugs etc. one shop in particular I was thrilled to find. It's called Dilip Textiles on Arab Street BEAUTIFUL tablecloths and I got a beautiful hand embroidered rug to hang on the wall. They have a number of designs, the one I chose was more English looking than Asian. Hey also ad an amazing one with Noah's Ark for a babies room, absolutely beautiful.
Very cheap food in Little India $5 or a huge curry and ice - couldn't finish it!
Definitely recommend Little India and Dilip Textiles."
,,Take your time and soak in,4.0,,"Get transported into another reality with the pleasure of great food, 24 hrs bazaar & genuine folks. Little India is the spice of Singapore and her final bastion of old meeting new."
,,Only if you have time,3.0,,"I came here with the recommendation from a friend however found it to be an OK attraction. It was interesting to see how the Indian culture was integrated here and saw many interesting buildings and shops. Perhaps it was because I came around 5pm at night where most people were closing up.

However I did try an Indian restaurant here (sorry forgot the name) but the food was exceptional!"
,,great place for cheaper shopping,4.0,,"Although we didn't get to Mustafa Centre (I was told don't go at night), we enjoyed a browse through the streets near the MRT station and the foodcourt. Shopkeepers were very nice and not pushy. Some might have communication problem but just go with it. Lots of interesting sights, cheap bargains (do check the textiles well before purchasing and wash separately due to colour runs) and delicious foods. Yes, it's busy and crowded, yes there are lots of Indians (why are you surprised??) but we felt very safe at all times. Food court was very clean, people very nice so no worries there. Only minus for me personally was I did feel revolted by the butcher market and had to sprint through it as I couldn't tolerate the smell. My travel buddies wanted to go do some shopping above it. Lucky it was worth it!"
,,Missing home in the midst of Singapore? well visit this place for Indian restaurants and cheap food,3.0,,"In the midst of the busy Singapore lies the ""Little India"" for the Indian travelers who miss home and are tiered of eating all the junk foods, visit this place to have a good meal at cheap prices.

You will never feel that you are not in India after entering into this area. The places are crowded with all the people who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal & India.It was funny you can even get your brand of cigarettes, mouth freshener & all the stuff you can get in India. Try to go to Mustafa market, which is the most famous market here.

I would recommend, if you really miss home and are looking for cheap food in Singapore, then this is the place for you, else enjoy the clean and well maintained Singapore and cherish being in a foreign country!"
,,A walk through was enough,3.0,,"A short walk through is all that we needed. A complete contrast to other places in Singapore. Lots of shops, jewelry stores, restaurants. Nothing of real interest to us."
,,Stay Clear,2.0,,"Completely overcrowded place, full of males just hanging out, got out of here as fast as we could. I suppose it is ok if you live there but not really a place for tourists to go out of your way to visit as the guide books would have you believe. Any western (white) would stick out like a sore thumb."
,,Unforgetable Taste of India,4.0,,"Love the ambience, strolling along the streets, as if i m in India. Clean, beautiful and colorful and artistic side of Singapore. Plenty of yummy authentic Indian Cuisines for u to choose from. The place is very safe too, encountering people who are very friendly and helpful indeed. Mustafar, the 24 hours shopping complex is a MUST.for everyone."
,,Feel of india,4.0,,"Little india has lot of small streets which are dotted with Indian restaurants and shops selling Indian goods. You can find good vegetarian food here at really low cost. Try the south Indian restaurants which service idli and tosai. The india archade is hub of trading community. You can find lots of shops selling Indian artefacts and clothes. Take a stroll in little india and enjoy shops playing Indian music, small ols time stores. Mustafa the 24 hr shopping mall is also situated in same area. You need to take a 10 min walk to sargoon plaza , it's situated right there. Wide variety of perfumes, chocolates, electronics goods and gold jewellery is what you can buy."
,,Frequent visitor,5.0,,I frequent Little India's Tekka and side streets. Lots of good hole in the wall restaurants; great fruits and veggies at Tekka -- feels much more like Beijing where we moved from than Chinatown in SG.
,,A taste of India,5.0,,"Love the hustle and bustle, the mess and the confusion! Must check our Mustafa - the world rolled into one! Find absolutely anything!"
,,a bit of history,5.0,,"Somewhat of a tourist trap in parts, but it was nice to wander through and wonder if this was where my mum on her maiden voyage to Europe bought the yellow silk that I remember her wearing as a small child.

Its history and tells a story of what Singapore was :)"
,,Home away from Home,4.0,,"great food options (especially for vegetarians), relatively cheap shopping (mind you, Singapore is an expensive city), Mustafa centre...short walk away from our hotel....nice!"
,,Lttle India,3.0,,"Our coach left us off at one corner and gave us about 20 minutes to walk up and down one street. It looked interesting but there wasn't enough time to really see it. I went back another day by train (really easy) and saw a bit more. If you want to go shopping, go to the Mustafa Centre in LIttle India for everything - cheaper than Orchard Road."
,,Not much chop,2.0,,"Not really my cup of tea,maybe because it was a holiday,but a little crowed for me,there was however plenty of shops and market shop fronts open for bussines just not my thing."
,,Food galore.,5.0,,"Lots of Indian restaurants, serving great food. You will find something to suit your taste. They also have a huge food court, but i wasn't sure due to the hygiene side of things."
,,The place that never sleeps,5.0,,"I find this place excellent for stay and also for the food. There is loads of things to do if you ever bored in the middle of the night, this place never sleeps and there's people everywhere no matter what ever time of the day it is. I think the main attraction is Mustafa Centre which never closes, it operates 24/7 everyday of the year and you can get anything and everything in this shopping centre. There money changer , Indian food stalls in every corner , Internet cafe, hotels , motels, backpackers, travel agent, place of worships, MRT station ( Trains service) and everything else what ever you can think of.
If you are not fond of too many people with all kinds of unpleasant odour please avoid going there on the weekend as this place in Serangoon( Little India) is swamp and jammed pack with people like sardines in a can."
,,This is the real Singapore.,5.0,,"This is the real Singapore. There is not much left of the real singapore, but Little india can give you a real taste. My love of this city goes back to the hawker food carts that occupied the Orchard Road carpark in the seventies.
Little India with it's general shops, curry shops, small hotels and colourful human traffic reminds me of Singapore four decades ago. The department store Mustafa's is a must and so too are some of the curry shops around the perimeter.This is a great place to shop and spend a day immersed in the culture. There is a fusion of Asian foods to be had here and visitors will be rewarded if they try the flavours. I have bought European visitors here and they have been delighted with the time spent here. Singapore is still a great tourist destination and Little India a must see!"
,,A cultural shock,4.0,,I went ther after the week of Dhawali so the street is decorated beautifully with laterns and arches. Along the street are countless of jewellery shops.
,,"Great culture, great food and shooping",4.0,,"If you need go this place, just take MRT to ferrer park, just walk away and you will find mustofa shopping center ""the most visit shopping center in Singapore"". Mustofa open 24hours, so enjoy the great shopping, a wide range of stuff, snack, electronic etc available. A lot of India restaurant nearby, good food such as nasi briyani, roti prata and of course the famous the Tarik."
,,When in singapore,3.0,,"This was probably not my favorite place in Singapore.
But it's nice enough to go visit.

You have a bunch of different foods, I guess it's heaven for vegetarians - because of all of the veg restaurants. If you like shopping in small shops I guess you'll enjoy it more than me.
It's not as tidy and neat as down town Singapore, but as I said - when in Singapore, I guess it's ok to see this place too."
,,Great Food!,5.0,,"Little India was really fun! The food is fantastic and there are a lot of places to choose from! I recommend you go and try several different dishes. They also have a big market that has lots of souvenirs, foods, fabrics, electronics - basically everything you could ever want at great prices! Plan to bring something to carry lots of stuff because I ended up purchasing a lot of fun things - my family loved it when I brought gifts back to them! There are also some neat temples in the area so it's great to walk around a little bit."
,,Colour of India,4.0,,"Little India shows colour of India but in very sophisticated way.

You will get everything here which you gets in India from Indian sweets and dishes to electrical plugs which works in India and cloths.

Major attraction here is Mustaffa mall which is 24 x 7 open.

Note : Don't visit mall around 11 PM to 1 AM as its crowded with worker's families which may bother westerners and some Indians too."
,,Great taste of India,4.0,,"Have you been to India? If so, do you miss it? Assuming you said yes, come on down to Little India where you can have the same experience of overcrowding and creepy stares! But on a serious note, you can get some of the best shopping deals and food here. So don't hate!"
,,"Busy, chaotic - fabulous",5.0,,Little India is busy and chaotic and just fabulous. We spent hours in the Tekka centre on the second level looking at very cheap and some very beautiful clothing. We ate in the food court and just loved our Nasi Bryani and lime juice - the serve big enough to feed two of us - cost us a total of S$6.50
,,Authentic but much cleaner then the real thing,4.0,,First time I went to Little India I was a bit surprised to see how dirty it was comparing to the rest of Singapore. My husband who worked in India told me it was very clean comparing to India. Since then I have been there few more times and don't mind it too much anymore. There is a Sultan Mosque here and few other interesting places. I wouldn't come here during the weekend is this place is insanely overcrowded.
,,"Open 24*7, best place to shop in Singapore",5.0,,"If you have visited Singapore and come across few souvenirs you wanted to buy, do not buy them since they are available (with hell lot of many more options) in a much cheaper rate here.
Mustafa is a must visit and is open 24*7. You ask anything (literally anything, legal of course) and you will get it there: Apparels, Sim cards, electronics, currency exchange, visa assistance, etc.
If you are an Indian food lover, you can't really miss the options available in the area.
Very approachable from any part of Singapore and no need to plan your visit since it is open 24*7"
,,Like I've Been to India :),3.0,,"Indian foods, Indian goods, Indian people, Indian way of life. I can say, folks, I've been to India. What's missing alone is the Taj Mahal, the reason why I'm dreaming of seeing India one day. But at least, I had this chance of experiencing India, only by a little.

The structures are colorful, even the women's clothes. We looked for the mustafa center, but didn't buy much since I found the items in this mall a bit pricey. All I got for myself was a cute necklace, while my brother bought a real nice jacket. We bought some foods as well in the grocery.

We had lunch in a nice airconditioned restaurant just outside the mustafa center where we had chicken briyani. Food was good although I could've liked it better if my rice is served hot.

It was our 4th day in Singapore & our itinerary was Botanical Garden - Little India - Bugis. The next day was our flight back to Manila."
,,A good place to have a viewing of India cluture,3.0,,"A quite messy and cloud area, but if you are interested in India culture, it is a good place...but be careful your wallet. And may have many body contacts..."
,,Wonderful Shopping,5.0,,We got some wonderful bargains here. If you don't like crowds and getting amongst things - stay away. I loved the atmosphere. There is not a lot of room in the alley ways but I found that an experience also. If I was taller than average I think you might hid your head on a lot of things they have dangling. Enjoy!!!
,,Love love loved it!!,5.0,,You get off the MRT and you are right in the middle of it. Smells and sounds are fantastic. Loved the food and surrounds.
,,Reminded me of India!,5.0,,"First - I LOVED India when I visited a few years ago and have been dying to go back. Little India in Singapore has all the best of India, without the smell and the grime! The shopping is a blast and the food is incredible - don't spend a lot on food. My hostel was in the area - the first night I spent way too much on food - by the last night I learned I could eat for much less (<10SGD full meal).

I was there during Deepavali - so the street was decorated with lights. The tented markets were up (I don't know if they are year round or for the festival). The atmosphere was fun.

Went on Sunday night and it was jam packed - between the fire-walking festival and the fact that Sunday nights are always the busiest - it really had a very authentic India feel to it!! Avoid on Sunday nights if you don't like crowds - almost impossible to move around."
,,More Indian than India,4.0,,"Since Indians form 7% of Singapore population, it is expected to get some real authentic taste of India here. This place which is a small area of Indian shops, clothes and delicacies is a great way to spend some time in Spore. Shop at Mustafa complex (open 24 hrs) or eat at many of the joints or visit a temple...there are loads of ways to enjoy this place."
,,Indian Food and Culture,5.0,,Lots of things to do here but the food draws me. Chicken Briani at Allahuddins in Tekka Center ($4.50) is best I have had anywhere at any price. Mustards and New Everest are also great.
,,Great place to eat/stay/wander/buy real stuff,4.0,,"Great food - visit during Diwali for extra events markets etc. After a week of staying near Clarke Quay - found this area much more vibrant and real , with good MRT (metro) connections"
,,Diwali/Deepavali Festivities,4.0,,Was there during 2012 pre Diwali festivites & the place was crowded & the lights was wonderful. Didn't had time to visit Mustafa Centre which claims to sell almost anything under the roof. But will try the next time I'm in town.
,,Good to go once,3.0,,"It was ok but nothing special (although I would go once to experience it). The place is a bit full on and at time reminded me of the chaos in Phuket.

I didn't like the 3 lane road with fast moving traffic and narrow paths cutting through little India. Likewise, there are neon signs wrapped around around the power poles (very beautiful) with the words ""Warning High Voltage"" - all within a child's reach. Reminded me of how that Australian teenager died when he accidentally touched such a sign in Bali.

Once is enough"
,,india...out of india,5.0,,"india out of india..what a relief..hotels, shops all utilities..like india..what do we need more..while"
,,BUSY BUSY BUSY,4.0,,"What a busy area. From early in the morning to very late at night. There is always something to see in Little india. Take a walk around the place and take in the sights, smells and atmosphere"
,,Respite!,4.0,,"Afterall a few days of roaming around in Singapore, visiting Little India, was a huge respite - from just a familiarity point of view. You find several 3 for $10 shops, Indian stuff that you may be missing, and of course the famous Mustafa Shopping Centre"
,,Love this place,4.0,,"I have holidayed in India and all of the flavors are here without actually having to be in India. The food at Tekka market at the entrance to Serangoon road is on my itinerary a couple of times each visit. The stroll down the side streets opposite are better than the drag down Serangoon with a lot of small flower and incense shops for great photos and souvenirs. There are also a couple of computer shops with the lowest prices in Singapore at the end of these little street. Perak Road, I think."
,,Feel at home experience..,4.0,,"All the hustle and bustle here makes you feel alive.

Admitted, compared to the rest of Singapore, Little India is noisy, unkempt and unruly. Traffic rules are often bent and roads crowded with vehicles and pedestrians. In a country that has heavy fines for littering, Little India manages to relax those as well.

But in spite of all that, this place relieves you from the seemingly monotonous mechanic lifestyle of the rest of Singapore. It imbues some culture. The colors, smells and sounds makes one feel a little like in a safe town of India. And the food is delicious and authentic, even at the small outlets. This helps home-sick Indians living/visiting Singapore to survive. If you ever visit Little India, you MUST give the food a try.

Also, besides food, a lot of Indian stuff can be purchased from here. Vegetables, fruits, spices, flours, flowers, sarees, idols for worship, souvenirs and what not! And come Diwali season, the place is teeming with beautiful lights arched over the roads. And of course, a whole lot of discounts."
,,Very Nice,5.0,,"Little India is a very nice place in Singapore. You can find all of Indian community around with all shop owner are Indian and you can get India food, Indian people, Indian items and all. Fill as you are in India."
,,Thank you Little India,5.0,,"I loved the hours I spent in Little India. When I got off the train I couldn't resist going to the Tikka Centre and I had the best Chicken Briyani I have ever tasted in my life! I walked down to serangoon road and it was colourful, fragrant & so much fun to explore. If I had time I'd come back at night because the festival of the lights (Deepavali) is being celebrated at the moment."
,,A rainbow of colours,5.0,,"If you love Indian food,banana leaf eating restaurants,Hindu temples,beautiful saris and hand crafted goods,this is the place for you!"
,,Vibrant and worth a visit,5.0,,"I love Little India, the colours, the smells, the bustle, it's so alive. I love to browse the spice shops and marvel at the beautiful sari fabrics for sale. There are bargains to be had if you shop around. The food is amazing, every where you go there is a great place to eat. I have to admit I favour the Banana Leaf as I love their fish head curry - it must be tried. A sunday evening in Little India has to be seen to be believed, it's the workers day off and the descend up the place in their droves, coming in on buses, trucks and the packed MRT. There are men everywhere, the women do not attend this weekly event. There are street kitchens set up everywhere with huge vats of curry on the go to feed the throngs of people. If you are OK with crowds it is worth seeing."
,,"Been there, done that, wouldnt go again.",2.0,,"The brochures and travel information looked fantastic but it was very different in real life.
Once off the MRT you knew you were in India, the spices and aroma was very strong, and for some people could be over whelming.
The food preparation at the market section we saw was an eye opener to how different cultures have different ways."
,,A little bit of India,4.0,,"Lil' India is great, cheap clothes and great food. We regularly visit to shop at Mustafas and there are plenty of great curry houses."
,,Good food that's it.,3.0,,"We were disappointed with this area, it was Diwali (festival of lights) when we visited and thought it would be lively. Nothing of note to see, we had a good meal then wandered the streets to see the sights and left very quickly. Same scene anywhere in the world, cheap phones, cheap gold, not worth the trip."
,,Worth exploring,4.0,,"Little India is one of the few places in Singapore which probably still mostly resembles what it looked like 40-50 years ago. The narrow and crowded shophouse storefronts have been mostly preserved, only with new hawkers selling modernware like handphones, alongside older hawkers selling traditional goods like textiles and gold jewelry. On weekends it is very crowded with migrant workers from the Indian subcontinent. Otherwise, you will still get to find the narrow two-lane alleyways that will remind you of the shophouses in Malacca."
,,Cheap and green place to stay,4.0,,"If you want to go backpacking to SIngapura, the choices are Geylang, Little india or China town. Choose Little India if you are a mosleem, looking for a nearby mosque, a lot of halal restaurants, and a green zone (not like Geylang, the red zone !). Of course, the Indians are selling a lot of cheap stuff too :)"
,,Lots of people on Sundays,4.0,,"Our first visit was on Sunday. People were everywhere, just like India We thought. Sundays is all the migrant workers day of. To top it of It was the start Indian New Year."
,,Really have to visit ....,5.0,,"As soon as you get out of the MRT Station, your sense make you aware you are in a very different part of town, not least because of the wonderful aromas - spices, jasmine, incense, all mingle together to give this area of Singapore a very special scent all of it's own.

Little India is always bustling with tourists and locals. Don't miss visiting the Temple on Serangoon Road - it is beautiful and has a wonderful tranquility, even when the place is full of people. There are shops selling a vast range of produce, lots of cafes and eateries and don't miss the Mustafa Centre, which is a huge department store offering just about anything you care to think of!"
,,"Famous for Indian Food, Sarees,Suits etc",4.0,,"If you are looking for something bolloywood or kollywood style.This is the right place. From shopping shops to varieties of Indian Food is in the area and its one stop centre.All kinds of indian clothes, books, foods, cultural items can be found here."
,,"Cheap, lively and entertaining",4.0,,We went here during a stopover for the day and ate at one of the banana-leaf restaurants. The food was cheap and tasty and it was an experience eating on the floor with all the gorgeous little dishes. You can find some amazing little treasures in the alleyway shops and can even indulge in being 'threaded' (hair removal with pieces of string) if you're game. Not sure if I would recommend that! I found this to be so different to the rest of Singapore - I felt like I was actually in India.
,,"Fresh produce, delicious food, but beware of ""stalkers""!",4.0,,"I went to Little India this morning. It was easily found off the MR. There are plenty of stalls of fresh fruit juice where you can pick the fruit and veggies you want and they juice it for you on ice. It cost me about $3 US. YUMMY. I had some Biryani with chicken, that they serve on a banana leaf, from a stall and it was delightful! It cost me $4.50 US or $5.00 if you want a hard boiled egg with it. One of the best plates of biryani I've ever had. As I left, my friend and I were walking through the streets and I noticed a boy was following me. He had followed me from the food court outside, and was taking every turn I took. I watched him from my peripheral vision as he talked on a cell phone. After about 10 minutes of him following me I had had enough. I whipped around and yelled at him! He acted as if he didn't understand what I was saying and I motioned him to go away! Not sure what he was up to...but it made me feel queasy. Beware of your surroundings!"
,,Worth a visit if you like Indian Food,4.0,,"I am vegetarian and love Indian Food so Little India is great for me. I went last weekend for the Deepavali Festival lights and had a great time. We researched various restaurants before going and had two lovely meals, one in Woodland Veggie Restaurant and one in a place next to Mustaffa Centre on Serengoon Road. We also had beers in Red Bar. Lovely chilled out evening watching the festival goers - lights are on for the next month or so"
,,"Vibrant, colourful, lively....",5.0,,"If you enjoy seeing other cultures, like to meet new people, find lively, characterful streets and shops interesting, are prepared to involve yourself in new experiences, this is the place for you. The sights, sounds and smells of Little India, especially now, during the Deepavali celebrations, are not to be missed, and the history is interesting too. This is Singapore, so there is order underneath and there are no beggars. The inhabitants are mainly descendants of south Indian vegetarians, and there are temples to visit as well as stalls and shops to see. Life goes on well into the night but one never feels insecure or threatened. We found everyone to be friendly."
,,Cheap backpacker area,3.0,,"lots of hostels around the bottom part of little India, good prices for an expensive city. cheap food but obviously its mainly Indian, but does have some other ranges of food like Russian and Uzbekistan restaurants"
,,Dirty and repetitive,2.0,,"Once we'd walked down one street, all the others looked the same. While it is very easy to get to from the MRT, it is probably the dirtiest part of town. We looked inside one of the temples and there was actually neon decorating the idols...tacky!"
,,lOOk,4.0,,"Go for mustafa Centre where you can get cheap perfume etc and try out the indian food. I wish to specially highlight to MS Neelambari form MUMBAI saying that little Indian singapore is a disgrace to Indians..gosh..please look at the unruliness, pollution and dirt in your own country before commenting!!!"
,,Little India,4.0,,Crowded overweekend specially crowded on Sundays. You will get all Indian stuff. Tourist mainly visit this area
,,Found it to be a waste of time,2.0,,"We decided on visiting little India upon the recommendation of a friend. When we got there the buildings were pretty but we found the whole experience relatively unengaging and somewhat boring. I found it even less appealing as it seemed most of the people we walked past gawked at my blonde haired girlfriend, which made both her and I relatively uncomfortable.
Not my cup of tea."
,,Indian culture explosion,4.0,,Omg!! We went there in Dec 2006 for our honeymoon--so everyone sed you have to visit this one place LITTLE INDIA-1st of all i was shocked when my hubby told me that there are 4 national languages here in Singapore and one of them is Tamil! So i see Singapore zoo and malls etc and on day 3 we arrive at Little India station-I step out and teh place is so not like the rest of Singapore.Cars are parked hapazard.Dirt lying around--grrrr such a bad impression as Indian peopel staying abroad.The food was amazing and thats where I would reccomend you to visit the place if no where else its here taht you ll experience authentic Indian cuisines from the North to South. Rude shock otherwise.
,,Not too good atmosphere,3.0,,I visited there the next day of Singapore's National Day so many stores were closed but I must say you can find more interesting Little India in Malaysia especially Penang.
,,Like Chinatown better,3.0,,"...unless I suppose those two aren't competitors :P Colorful buildings, easy access from MRT stations.. Mustafa centre is crazy! I got completely disorientated and seriously; no-one need that much stuff that they have.. Or maybe it's called ""selection"".."
,,"Little India area in Singapore is alive with fragrances, sights and sounds of",5.0,,"A shopping experience not to be missed in Singapore. Buy any variety of Indian goods. Sari fabrics, foods, snacks, jewelry. Enjoy!"
,,Photography heaven,4.0,,"Great place to check out for photographers. Spend your day capturing the exotic colors, spices, expressions and what not. Attack of the senses and palate."
,,"Nice little india place, felt like being in India",3.0,,"Getting around there to get the feeling of india, many shops around there, you could find good cheap stuffs at Mustafa and be sure it's not fake but shops outside i dont recommend. Be careful of the food in that area, i got stomach upset but food is definite delicious.."
,,Indians Galore!,5.0,,"Before I start, I have to say I am a Singaporean Indian. Was born and bred here and while reading some of the reviews, I was surprised to see that some people rated Little India lowly. Here is the view of an Indian who has lived in Singapore for the past 24 years.

Firstly, Little India doesnt only cover the Little India Market (Tekka) or the Little India Arcade (extremely touristy). It starts at TEKKA and ends at a little off Mohammed Mustafa Shopping Centre. In my opinion, I have seen a lot of tourists venture just into the outskirts of Little India and go back. I suggest everyone walk down, just straight down (could take about 1-2 hours) depending on where you stop to look at things and stuff.

Locals like myself frequently shop at the shops above Tekka market. So, the market and the foodcourt is down below and the shops are on the second floor. There are many different varieties of things you can buy from there and its always a shopping haven for me! I rarely go to Little India Arcade as we know that the prices tend to be more expensive as it is a touristy area.

If you want to have a taste of how local food produce gets sold, I suggest you venture onto a small lane called Buffalo Lane, where you can see many different shops selling fresh vegetables. A lot of locals make weekly trips down to the shops to buy cheap vegetables in these shops. Also, you may be able to catch flower shops selling flowers. Since we are predominantly Hindus, we pray on Tuesdays and Fridays; therefore, the days before that, the flower shops are crowded.

As for just looking around, there are 3 temples (technically 4, but 2 are joined) along Little India. The first one is usually crowded, it would be better to walk further down and peep into the second one. Each temple is dedicated to a different god. At the same time, if you start feeling hungry, I suggest you go to the small stalls behind the temples. We rarely go to restaurants when we are in Little India (don't really know why) but prefer the smaller ones ( I think its good food for money). I recommend Ghandi's or Sakunthala's (not the main one, but the smaller one at Upper Dickson Road). Try the ginger chicken (my fav) or the kotthu prata.

If you want something adventurous, venture onto Desker Road around 7-8pm. It is located just off the main road before Mustafa Shopping Centre. It is the ""red-light"" district, a different sight from the more clean and green Singapore everyone is used to. :)

Lastly, there's always the Mustafa shopping centre. I dont really like to do there personally. Too crowded, sometimes its over-priced but the exchange rate for currencies are pretty good there.
Also, I would avoid going on Sundays because its the off day for foreign workers and Little India tends to get VERY VERY VERY crowded. Go on a saturday or any other weekday.

If you need more info on how best to maximize your exp, feel free to email me. I will try my best to help you :)"
,,Authentic Indian food options,4.0,,"We had lunch in little India at an Indian Chinese restaurant..the food was as authentic as it gets.. Basically the whole place looked like a scene out of a small town in India. Other than the food, there is nothing really worth seeing here"
,,"Little, but real India",5.0,,"Singapore will not be so diverse without this place. Cozy, colorful, smelly and bustling, this corner of Singapore looks like a real India. Dominated with Indian people, nice Indian temples and numerous eateries serving Indian food, one can forget that this is in fact other country..."
,,Fun to visit,5.0,,Nice little community and can be seen in a couple of hours or enjoyable to stay a couple days. 20 minute walk to the scenic Olympic walk or Night clubs.
,,Sadly disappointing,2.0,,"All of the travel guides I read before visiting Singapore strongly advised going to Little India. I was excited about the strange food stalls and little authentic gift shops I had read about. Instead, I was left thoroughly disappointed. We spent a lot of time walking round and only came across tacky gift shops. It is possible that we missed the area that everyone raves about, but if that is the case then it should have been signposted more clearly.
Save your time and visit all the other incredible things Singapore has to offer ‚Äì please see my other reviews."
,,"Crowded, nice food",3.0,,Visited a restaurant with a friend which was cheap and food was great. However we got followed by a guy for about 15 minutes so we told him to go away. You might have to be ready for that kind of incidents.
,,"Too little, but a small taste",4.0,,"Little India is a bit more than a block, but still gathers a few nice places and walking around you can catch the smell of curry and spices pervading around... Flowers forming garlands, splashes of colour here and there... It's nice to have a different evening out (shame we weren't there on Sunday, when it's said to become a kind of Bollybood...)"
,,"Back, again.",5.0,,"We went back to Little India again this visit because it was so interesting last year. This time we walked from our Hotel on Victoria Road. The walk, an easy fifteen minutes of interesting sights and sounds and smells. We spent the usual amount of time in the gigantic 24/7 Mustafa complex. This time more in the #2 building in the Designer perfume area. Actually ended up buying more (volume, not dollar-wise) of these products from the street level shops. The footpaths are 'interesting' to say the least. Some major roadworks going on there. Food was available from numerous places at all sorts of prices. Even a McDonalds there. Next time that I'm lucky enough to be in Singapore, I'll be back in Little India, for sure!"
,,food and shop,5.0,,"When i walk along serangoon, i can feel many indian selling food, spices, colths, gold and restaurants. The smell of the curry make your stomach want to try it."
,,crowdy,3.0,,this place is crowdy and not clean so we avoided going to this place during our stay as name suggests people have made it very congested
,,Very exciting for a non-Indian!,4.0,,"Little India was a different but delightful experience. We enjoyed walking around the different streets with a culture that we dont normally experience. We were enthralled by the street scenes of people working on the footpaths, the different places of worship with their colourful temples and displays. We stopped for a fresh coconut drink on the footpath. The arcades with their shop fronts showing the latest saris and Indian dress was delightful. We also enjoyed looking at the 22 carat gold shops with their vast array of Indian designs. Dont miss it."
,,"Full of interesting Indian restaurants, and bargains in the Indian shopes",5.0,,"Loads of interesting Indian Restaurants offerering all that India has to offers many miles away from that continent. Taste Indian in the less chaotic surrounds of Singapore, where the Indianculture is fused with the local culture. Great fun to walkt around, look for bargains in the shopping malls, markets and shops and take in all the architecture, colour, and smells."
,,Average Place,3.0,,"Little india houses some good shopping and restaurants. However, it's a bit cramped and somewhat dirty compared to other areas of Singapore that I've been too. It's also home to Mustafa centre which is a good place to get a variety of stuff at reasonable prices but the quality of the goods is worth doubting."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"If you wanted to see something different beside chinatown little india may be the best next thing to be visit, may be you can eat here just to taste what india food taste like"
,,Best place to get Indian Food,4.0,,"This is probably one of the few places where you get real Indian food and mostly south Indian food. The Mustafa center in little India is worth a visit, it has everything under the roof and open 24 hours a day!"
,,Go during morning hours and avoid Sat/Sun eve,3.0,,"This is a great place to get some good Indian food or shop at the popular 24 hour Mustafa Shopping center. Just make sure you avoid the crowds, which is typically any time after 4pm and specifically avoid Sat/Sun after 3pm."
,,Great atmosphere!,4.0,,"Brimming with character, noise, colour hustle and bustle at any time of day or night. It is always lively and there are great bars and restaurants offering excellent value. A real gem of a place"
,,Little india,3.0,,Driver of bus 166 to little India was very helpful. First bus ride for daughter. Bus was clean. Since it was Sunday night not many shops were open and was looking for a shop that served south Indian food wasn't easy. Managed to find one that served tosai. Despite having naan on menu it was not available at that outlet......it was a let down. Condiments 4/10.
,,"A Small, Sanitized Version of The Real Thing",4.0,,"A great place to stop by when you're in singapore. As the name suggests, it is kind of a small version of India full of stalls of indian clothes, food, spices and other stuff. Many things here are very inexpensive and the salespersons are very helpful. If you want to find a good place to eat, try looking for a place with many people."
,,Crowded but Good place to visit,3.0,,Crowded place but pretty much you can get everything you want to buy. Try and avoid it in weekend. Mustafa is available 24 hours. Excellent Food options especially Indian Food.
,,Better than I expected,4.0,,"This was my first real contact with Indian culture, so I was quite impressed. I found it very safe and quite clean as compared to similar areas in Kuala Lumpur for example. The hotel I stayed in was located in this area and it was OK.
There are a lot of restaurants and if you want to shop I recommend Mustafa Centre.
If you are interested in a cultural experience or you just want to pray in a Hindu temple, Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple is the place to go.
Worth a visit!"
,,"Cheap, ethnical and proud to be singaporean",3.0,,no so many thing that i can comment on this.. but overall definately is one of the place you need to visit when you in singapore..
,,Nothing special,2.0,,You can see the same in UK but without the fancy name. Nothing to write home about. When I first visited back in 2004 it was a bit like a big marketplace with lots of stalls and the smell of different spices etc but now it seems to be very modernised.
,,A taste of India - for the newbie:),3.0,,"If you haven't been to the real deal then this is probably a nice way to ease into 'it'! If you go on a weekend then it is definitely going to be busy but that hustle and bustle adds to the craziness and atmosphere - but do be prepared for that. Lots going on, particularly in the way of fruit and vege stalls. Beautiful strings of flower garlands hanging round (watch the bees!), have your hand henna painted, buy some gold if you like the yellow 'Indian' gold, pick up some saris or bags.....there are lots of knick knacks. But if nothing else it is worth going for a look. Some great buildings, particularly in the street named ""Arts Street"" although not quite sure why it has that name as couldn't see the actual arts, but a few of the buildings were painted really funky. Oh - had a little trouble finding somewhere to eat but there is a cool restaurant in the market place ... think it is called the Banana Leaf."
,,Bad experience,1.0,,"I've been to Little India on many occasions and always enjoyed the cultural aspect, while being very little to do there. In fact, on one occasion I stayed in Little India and enjoyed the local food. On this occasion, however, I was travelling with my wife and she had A LOT of unwanted male attention, including men coming right up to her face. I appreciate Singapore is culturally diverse and that different people should enjoy the freedom of being who they are, but this intimidating behaviour is unacceptable and ruined the day. If you are male and alone, Little India is worth a trip just to see a bit of India. Otherwise, avoid this area, especially if you are a female solo traveller."
,,A real taste of India,4.0,,"Smells, sounds, people, life like in India, in the cleanliness of Singapore. For shopping, expect to bargain... or buy at Mustafa Centre (fixed prices). A part of Singapore I am never fed up to strool around."
,,Good,3.0,,You can see the population of Indians in Singapore. You need to take off shoes when you walk into the temple.
,,Don't expect too much,3.0,,"Definitely don't go on Sundays (or the weekends generally), as the area is very crowded with Indian workers - almost all male. My sister and I found it quite daunting.
We returned during the week and it was much easier to get around. We followed the walk recommended in 'Lonely Planet', and saw several temples and some of the traditional architecture in the area. Be aware, though, that this seems to be one of the more economically challenged parts of Singapore, and the only place we encountered rubbish on the streets etc.
I'd definitely recommend a visit to Chinatown or Kampong Glam instead."
,,old shop houses look all the same!,2.0,,"little india represents the way our indian forefathers live and traded in the past, though much has been left like the original, most of the structures are so run down that they need to be upgraded and repaired, cracks in the walls and pillars are a sore eye and repairs and paint work must be done or it would be more like a indian slum in calcutta."
,,Feast,4.0,,"Little India is a feast for the eyes. There are numerous shops selling colourful saris, spices and along the five foot way are the vegetable shops and flower sellers with their garlands of lovely flowers."
,,Have visited many times,5.0,,"Favourite parts: Teka market (downstairs is a wet market; upstairs you can imagine you're in India with all the clothing for sale), Mustafas - a wonderful Indian department store open 24 hrs - here you can find everything from rice to gold! Also Arab St and Haji Lane are worth a visit."
,,Don't go on Sunday,3.0,,"NOT a good idea to go on Sundays since most of the workers are off on Sundays too and the crowd could be very overwhelming. Its worth the visit to see the hindu temples and feel for a moment that you're not in Singapore. The place could be full of litters, smelly or traffic could be bad, both human traffic and cars."
,,Great Introduction to the City,3.0,,Great lunch in Little India. Our introduction to Singapore started here and we thoroughly enjoyed this quarter of the city.
,,good experience..,4.0,,"just outside one of the metro stations and a few mins walk would take you to the place little india, there is huge south indian temple at the entrance to the street ,,,
there are a lot of indian restaurants/stores with indian clothes/ indian suveniers/ etc and at the end of the streel is the shopping mall as well...
It gives you a more insight into the south indian community from tamilnadu , which is largely based in singapore, but there are indian cuisines from differnt parts of india to try at this street......."
,,Different taste of Singapore,3.0,,"During weekdays is the better time to visit little India. Shopping is activity most of us doing. At weekend, seems every Hindi speaking people in Singapore are there to gather. It is getting difficult to move around."
,,Bollywood town,4.0,,"Easy to get Indian products,nice sarees and especially mustafar mall that open 24hrs"
,,Loved it,5.0,,Had henna done the ladies did a fantastic job and didn't get ripped off! Have a wonder and enjoy a little bit of India!!
,,Indian Food! Mustafa Center!,3.0,,Indian flavours and 24 hrs open Mustafa Center are big plus in this area.
,,Indians at large,3.0,,Okay here you would find all the indian stuff and restra. food was not great though and overly priced as expected. The malls had cheap stuff ..nt that great an attraction
,,Must see,5.0,,So interesting to learn of the cultures and nationalities that make up Singapoe. Feels very much like a visit to Mumbai!
,,A little taste of India in Little India,4.0,,"The easiest way to get to Little India is on the MRT ‚Äì either the Little India or Farrer Park stations. Serangoon Road is the thoroughfare that runs through the vibrant heart of this place. In terms of vintage, Little India dates back to the early 1800s.

Today, ethnic Indians (primarily Tamilians) account for about 7% of Singapore‚Äôs population. While on the one hand they have earned themselves a place in the highest echelons of government, Indians have also physically contributed to building the edifices of modern Singapore ‚Äì even to this day, a significant proportion of those who work on Singapore‚Äôs construction sites are from South India, especially Tamilnadu. Indeed Tamil has the status of an official language of Singapore.

Little India is an exotic, heady mix of sights, smells, sounds and tastes that while preserving its cultural authenticity, make it quite different from the rest of Singapore.
- For one thing, it is certainly not as litter-free as the rest of sanitized Singapore.
- Second, it offers up a strange mix of fragrances and flavours ‚Äì jasmine flower garlands, spices, hot ‚Äòvadas‚Äô and ‚Äòdosais‚Äô, roasting groundnuts, ‚Äòroti prata‚Äô and curry, fresh vegetables, ayurvedic oils, incense and so on.
- Third, it is much noisier ‚Äì conversations at decibel levels that make it quite superfluous to eavesdrop, temple bells, street hawkers loudly announcing their bargains ‚Äì almost thumbing its nose at the rest of staid Singapore, the Little India website proclaims that they are ‚Äúproud to be loud.‚Äù!
- Indian cuisine has a long, rich, multi-cultural heritage and its signature preparations are quite well represented here ‚Äì a virtual explosion of tastes unlimited.
- In Little India people continue to ply ancient trades passed on to them by their forefathers ‚Äì and so you find flower sellers, gold smiths, butter milk vendors, ayurvedic medicine shops, fortune tellers with the regulation parrots, henna tattoo artists, the ‚Äòpaan shops‚Äô et al.

Bolstering age old traditions and community bonding are the festivals that Little India celebrates with customary gusto and vigour. Foremost of these is Deepavali (Oct/Nov) ‚Äì the festival of lights that symbolizes the triumph of good over evil, and which Singapore recognizes with the ‚ÄòGreat Diwali Light Up‚Äô right through the length of Serangoon Road. Other major festivals include Pongal (Jan) the harvest festival, Thaipusam (Jan-Feb) in honour of Lord Muruga, Navarathri (Sep/Oct) which celebrates the Goddess of Learning and features the ‚Äòkolu‚Äô doll display and Theemidhi (Oct) the fire walking festival dedicated to Draupadi ‚Äì Little India really needs no excuse to come together singing and dancing, worshipping the Gods in whom total trust is reposed for continued welfare and prosperity.

TIPS:

1. As might be expected, there are many places of worship belonging to different faiths that coexist peacefully in Little India and are definitely worth visiting ‚Äì they include:
- Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple dedicated to Goddess Kali
- Srinivasa Perumal temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu
- Masjid Abdul Gaffoor of the Islamic faith
- Sakyamuni Buddha Gaya Temple of the Buddhist faith
- Foochow Methodist Church of the Christian faith
- Central Sikh Gurdwara of the Sikh faith
- Leong San See Temple dedicated to Kuan Yin

2. Food options here are many and you will be spoilt for choice. Almost a century old, Ananda Bhavan is the oldest Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. If you are looking for budget South Indian vegetarian food, some good choices are Komala Vilas, Saravana Bhavan and Kasturi Restaurant. Tasty hawker food (think ‚Äòroti prata‚Äô, ‚Äòdosai‚Äô) are on offer at Tekka Market & Food Centre. Apart from Indian food, Tekka also has stalls selling very good Malay and Chinese food. Flavourful Indian Muslim food is available on the side streets near Mustafa Centre. Jaggis offers budget North Indian cuisine. Muthu‚Äôs Curry and Banana Leaf Apolo are a little higher priced but are well known for their signature ‚Äúfish head curry‚Äù (be warned - if you are not used to spicy food, fish head curry can be a little fiery.) Delhi Restaurant is still more up market, and serves North Indian vegetarian and non-vegetarian food.

3. Given its clientele, Little India is obviously best for Indian food, with a clear bias towards South Indian vegetarian food. And if you really want to blend in, use your hands like everyone else around you ‚Äì when in Little India, eat the way we Indians do!

4. Everyone shops in Little India. Well known shopping centres are Serangoon Plaza, Little India Arcade, Tekka Market and Tekka Mall. However, and there can be no two opinions about this ‚Äì if there is only one place that you can go to, let that be Mustafa Centre on Syed Alwi Road, the ultimate discount destination that sells virtually anything you can think of, works 24 hours a day all year round, and offers just about the best currency exchange rates in all of Singapore.

5. If you are looking for electronics and computer accessories, then have a look at Sim Lim Square (http://www.simlimsquare.com.sg). It is not in Little India but very close by on Rochor Canal Road, an easy walk from the Little India MRT Station. While it has been dubbed a mecca for electronic goods, unless you are an electronics geek and really know what you are looking for, there is a chance that your bargain can just turn into worthless counterfeit ware.

6. Just like Bugis, Little India offers staying options for budget travelers and backpackers. There is a choice of hostels, as well as some very affordable hotels. The latter in particular, offer pretty good value for money. The website www.yoursingapore.com which as per our experience provides very reliable information, strongly recommends Wanderlust, located at 2 Dickson Road ‚Äì a funky boutique hotel in Little India."
,,"Very Crowded,but good for shopping if you are looking for cheap stuff..",3.0,,"It is very Crowded specially during the weekends,but good for shopping if you are looking for cheap stuff..You will get cheap and decent Indian food here as there are plethora of Indian and Pakistani restaurants here... there are lots of purely veg good restaurants as well here like Murugan Idli..etc. Mustufa Shopping Center has almost everything you can think of and that too at reasonable price..."
,,A place for good veg food and shop,3.0,,"We went there everyday as our stay near to the Little India area.
We found that in the street of little India you can get great shopping deals.
Also for veg lovers the street near of Mustafa Market and Restaurants opposite side of the market offers good variety of northern and southern dishes which have great Indian taste.

Be Careful :: Do not Go there on weekends Saturday and Sunday. the place is very crowed even you can hard to get free space to walk easily on that days."
,,Another world in Singapore,4.0,,"If you go to little india in Singapore, you will find another world here, the people, the smell, the aura...for moslem people, its very convinient location since you can find a lot of halal restaurant here beside in Bugis, the place for shopping with affordable price (Shen Shiong and Mustafa Centre). The view in the area its good for photography, love it."
,,Nothing to see except the temples,2.0,,"Beside the colorful hindu temples there isn't much to do or see. Little India in Georgetown, Penang (Malaysia) is far better."
,,Excellent place to Shop and Dine,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore then Little India is a must visit place. Head straight to the Mustafa Centre to shop. (Ground Level for Electronics, B2 and B1 for Clothing accessories etc.). Mustafa Centre has its own Duty free booth at B2 level where you can get back the duty on the items purchased. The other shops on Seragoon road (Little India) also offer some cheap shopping opportunities (with compromised quality). If you are looking for souvenirs, then Little India is the right place."
,,My weekend Vegetable Destination,5.0,,"India away from India - mecca for Indian Foodies. You can get every type of indian vegetables and provisions in one place. Convenient and cost effective for locals. For tourists, it hosts Mustafa Center (one stop shopping). It also has some amazing indian hindu, Sikh temples."
,,Fantastic Food,4.0,,"Great area if you like Indian Food, especially South Indian Food like me. Most Restaurants here are Pure Vegetarian Indian, but you can also see mixed Veg & Non Veg Indian restaurants as well as some arab places to eat. Apart from eating there is Mustafa Shopping Centre for jewellery and electronic and the Indian temple."
,,Little India,4.0,,Totally different feel to China town. Find a few things to head for and enjoy the older houses.
,,Interesting place,4.0,,We visited Little India via the Original Singapore Walks. It's a better way to understand the place with someone telling you about its history and places to visit while strolling along its stores and temples. Very charming.
,,Unchanged,5.0,,"Little India is one of the few places that is relatively unchanged, full of atmosphere and lovely spicy smells. Dozens of places to eat and shops to browse, a 'must visit' place"
,,Hot and dusty charm,5.0,,"This is a very colourful area of Singapore packed with stalls selling sari material Indian gold jewellery, basketware, clothes, spices. Stroll along Serangoon Road and take in the sights, smells and sounds of India. Watch out for the Indian fortune teller with her parrot outside Komala Villas. Mustafa Centre, a 24 hour store stretching across into 2 buildings, sells absolutely everything at reasonable prices."
,,Lively and fun,4.0,,"Little India seemed to be everything that Singapore authorities abhor: chaotic, colorful, unstructured, smelly, hot... and extremely fun. There are tons of small Indian stores featuring everything from cell phones, gold, henna tattoos, clothing and lots and lots of fantastically smelling food.
Definitely worth the trip."
,,Spend a night wondering around!,5.0,,"i had some amazing food here, saw a great Hindu temple, got a henna tattoo and bought a few things here and there. It is definitely somewhere worth visiting to get a taste of India!"
,,Indian Location Replicated in S'pore >> Excellent .,5.0,,"We stayed in Park Royal on Kitchener Road and our hotel is in Little India .This was our first International Trip and was very much worried about my little daughter to adjust to Veggie food and indian style and so we chose this location and never regretted the same .

There is very big Supermarket 24x7 working Mustafa well known and proximity to the hotel we stayed and also we could easliy do foreign exchange as well very convenient location.

one does nt miss india any moment and absolutely good for food in particularly like Veggie like me .

,,a step back in time,4.0,,"taken by family we were visiting in singapore , very busy at the weekend we were taken too a hawker food court too eat local , it was all good, nothing memorable but all edible and a good price. would probably say ' visit for the experience of stepping back in time, but nothing exception '"
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"Go, Amazing place. I used to live there.. fun...

Food and drinks great.. Shopping at Mustafa Center is miles upon miles of anything you could ever want.

Go. go on a sunday for the full little india experience, chaos. (go any other time if you preer things a bit quieter!)"
,,More Fun & More Real Than Chinatown,4.0,,"Great restaurants, strange little shops, eccentric pieces of architecture, the remarkable Mustafa Center (selling a little bit of everything -- Little India retains an authentic feel that is increasingly slipping away in Chinatown."
,,Old style Singapore,5.0,,Little India is everything that Orchard Road is not. Full of independent retailers - in amidst interesting old temples and great mom and pop style restaurants with some of the best Indian food around. Everybody should try the banana leaf curry.
,,Its India in Singapore.,4.0,,"U get every indian food at this place may Punjabi or south indian etc.The place is good for shopping with Mustafa Market here................cheap stay and food..............................................
The area is having good transport both Metro and bus service.Generally singapore is costly for stay,food and shopping but here your pocket allows everything..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."
,,Not so neat as the other place of Singapore,3.0,,"Little India area is mostly suitable for the tourists from Indian subcontinent. Here has some hotels ranging from budget to luxurious. There are not so many places to visit here except some Hindu temples. Shopping is convenient here as street shopping to mall shopping. Some places of this area is not so neat and clean like other area in Singapore.

Here are some information of hotels and shopping in Little India

,,human traffick,3.0,,"weekend visits are too crowded for comfort. Unless Its really necessary, keep shopping to weekdays. Of course if one is looking for sightseeing and excitement by all means carry on"
,,The place for all things Indian in Singapore.,5.0,,"Little India has not changed over the decades even though much else on Singapore has. The place remains as exciting and engaging for Singapore's Indian foreign workers, locals and tourists. The sights, sounds, smells and tastes are exhilarating experiences. Expects an explosion of colours, sounds, smells and tastes. The best Indian food in Singapore is found here, and the price is cheap too."
,,Marvellous place to mooch around,5.0,,Some great places to eat & lots of shops to browse through as well as an interesting temple. Can bit a bit smelly (drains I think) but many places have incense burning away!
,,stay on the main street,4.0,,"I spent a few hours in Little India, walking around through little streets, but i wish i had stayed on the main street, as at one point i got lost and it took me some time to figure out where i was. I shopped at one of the shops there, getting some spices and mango. I also visited an Indian Sweets store and got some tasty desserts. But I wish I had had time to dine there as well. The area reminds me a lot of the Arab street, with cute little colonial style buildings painted in a variety of colors."
,,Indian Shoppin Heaven,3.0,,"The place is filled with row of Indian Shop offering a wide variety of Indian goodies. The clothes seem to be very attractive and they have a some good Indian Restaurants offering great authentic Indian cuisine. If you are looking for anything Indian, this is the place to go. They have everything from clothes, accessories, food, gold and spices.
There is some nice and beautiful building to look at if you have the time. The temple is very lovely. It was indeed a pleasure to see such a harmonious place in the midst of the busy shopping arena.
The people there are friendly and very welcoming. Everyone expects you to enter their store and have a look and you are definitely not forced to purchase anything if you do enter for a look.
There is a shopping centre located here but there was nothing much in it. It looked quite run down.
Overall, i felt very welcomed and loved looking at all the beautiful and bright color goodies they had to offer. Managed to get some nice souvenirs for friends and family. Cheers!!"
,,"Much more real than ""metropolitan"" Singapore",4.0,,"I got tired of ""Metropolitan"" Singapore very quickly. The same Louis Vuitton and other expensive designer shops as any other big cities in the world. So I decided to wonder around Little India and really enjoyed the afternoon trying saris, taking a look at colorful garlands and stepping into a Hindu temple. I got my eye brows done with cotton threads as well. Very neat and quick."
,,Not at all impressed :S,2.0,,"We basically had a couple of hours trip to little India and to be honest it wasn't that pleasant. If your a big fan of temples or religious places then go there, else its just a shabby dirty place. There is a big shopping mall, Mustafa centre (which I'll review later), and some Indian restaurants. To be honest, I felt like I was back in the old areas of Karachi because of all the betel nut chewing and untidy environment. And to top all of that, the taxis we were waving didn't stop and the cab service we called refused to pick us up from that are, said that we should come some blocks ahead because of the rowdy crowd. Never imagined this would happen in Singapore.

The only consolation we had was the very cheap shopping. This place is surely NOT recommended."
,,suited for visitors that love to shop.,4.0,,"Not suited for the young though, but there is an exhusting variety to chose from, but prices are not that cheap. With a little bargaining you can find a nice gift to bring home for yourself or someone else."
,,Exotic little village,5.0,,"Handmade bags, clothes and indian handicraft are displayed in the streets. All very affordable. People are nice and helpful. a lot of gift items and interesting exotic decors for the home."
,,"How authentic, the place is worth going more than once",5.0,,"I liked the area with all it's shops full of spices, beautiful produce, pickles, and the little jewelry shops with handmade pieces. I went twice in a couple go days and took my time and still I feel I have to return immediately on my next visit to Singapore. The place is so colorful. My hobby is photography and I took so many shots. There are opportunities everywhere.
The temple was also quite interesting, The way people hang our for hours and talk on their phones and meet as if it is as much a social event as anything else."
,,Our favorite Singapore neighborhood!,5.0,,"What a great area, shops, restaurants, street vendors and lots of atmosphere. We loved it. Had a great meal at Sakunthala‚Äôs on Dunlop. The Mustafa Centre is worth a visit. Some of our best purchases were made in this area, highly recommend."
,,"Temples, indian cuisine, and a bit of chaos",4.0,,"Contrarily to most other place in Singapore, Little India is a place where people jaywalk, where you can find litter on the floor, where there are mainly only men hanging around, and women wearing saris... This a place to get a glimpse of what it might be like in India, especiallly on Sundays when many workers have their day off and the streets get really crowded, Try to avoid the tourist restaurants on the main street and go have a look behind the main temple, you'll find lots of excellent local places there (my favourite is the Ghandi). You can also find souvenirs, get some henne bodyart done, buy indian clothing and scarves..."
,,"A colourful place to visit, but be prepared to explore to discover it fully.",4.0,,"A fantastic place for tourist and locals. Some of the best Indian restaurants are here but you must know which to go to. Interesting shops to just wander around and explore. In the night, you can see makeshift stalls selling vegetables and fruits. Best time to visit is in the evening, follow by dinner in one of the Indian restaurants, and then walk off the food by just wandering around the alleys seeing the makeshift market."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"We found Little India a great experience. A tad apprehensive on arrival as it looked a bit scruffy. The whole area comes alive at night and it was great to see a real working area and not somewhere dedicated as a tourist trap. There are some ""western style bars"" that are very expensive but you can easily source local restaurants offering much better value. If you are a vegetarian you will be very well catered for but if you like a drink with your meal check first because a lot of the vege ones do not sell alcohol. You should also note alcohol is very expensive in Singapore. A final selling point was how safe and accepted we felt - part of the scenery rather than being odd ones(tourists) out."
,,Don't waste your time...,2.0,,"After reading some of these reviews, I'm wondering if I was in the wrong place? There was no major ""wow"" going to Little India. I agree with other reviewers -- this place had an AWFUL smell to it. In one market I walked through, I literally thought I was going to be sick it smelled so bad. That left me not desiring to try any food being prepared there. As for shops...unless you were buying authentic Indian garb nothing else there. I would not recommend this when there are so many other nice places to visit in Singapore."
,,"Crowded,hot but it has authentic indian food ~",3.0,,"I would say that little India reminds me of India.I ate in Little India on our first trip to Singapore and the meal was very good, but a little pricey considering the surroundings.
Little India has great food and stalls as well as temples and other sights to see. However, on weekends, especially Sundays, it is fully occupied by the many male Indian foreign construction workers whose favorite pastime is sitting in public spaces drinking."
,,"Good shops, great food",4.0,,"Little India is more authentically Indian that Chinatown is authentically Chinese. Bring your camera and an appetite and enjoy strolling around for a couple of hours. The Mutton Biryani at a stall very near the MRT was delicious. Served on a banana leaf, it was pleasantly spicy. Finger licking good."
,,it smells,1.0,,"the aroma of open drains is delightful and heightened by the populous. must add, their have past time is leering at europeans. The highlight of this my only visit was catching an idiot attempting to steal my phone."
,,Yummy food,4.0,,"Banana Leaf Apollo is well worth a visit. Don't bother with the fish head curry as it is over rated, but stick to having the rice and veg they give you with a couple of standard dishes from the menu - divine and cheap!"
,,Lovely quarter!,5.0,,"Smells of inscents and spices, fresh vegetables, gold and gems at the market, small restaurants and massala tea. I had a fantastic experience there. Even eaten in a small street restaurant at reasonable price and still alive!!! Worth visiting!!!"
,,Most chaotic place in Singapore but a nice contrast,4.0,,I love how different this is from other parts of Singapore. There are many good south Indian restaurants here. I have had some saris and blouses tailored ( next day service) here as well- pricey but good quality and fast service.
,,authentic indian food,3.0,,you can get some nice indian food here but its very crowded
,,"When I miss India, I go to Little India",3.0,,"As an Indian, I will say that Little India reminds me of home. Well to be more precise it reminds me of a suburb called Matunga back in Mumbai - busy, chaotics, lots of jewellery shops, the customary temple and the air redolent with Indian spices and food. I shop for my fresh veggies and fish/meat at the Tekka Wet Market, at the start of Serangood Road and go for my Indian meal fix to either Murugan Idli (opposite Mustafa) and Mustard on Race Course Road. I haven't visited too many of the other restaurants yet. And the only time I dare to step anywhere close to Mustafa if when I need to renew my India passport. If you haven't been to India and want to see what a small part of it would be like, visit Little India."
,,Interesting and genuine,4.0,,"Little India is worth a walk through, especially for the Hindu temple I came across."
,,Hindu India,4.0,,"I've never been in India but I guess this place look like over there! The temples, the colors, the smells... Worths the visit!"
,,"Little India, Singapore",4.0,,"I was a little disappointed with Little India, in Singapore. I thought it would have more to offer. But if you are into a good Indian curry while in Singapore, this is the best place to head to. Good bargains can be found in most shops and there are a few lovely temples to visit.
Indian clothing is an abundance and not expensive at all."
,,Colourful,4.0,,"Plenty of colour and flavour - and scents too. See flower garland sellers stringing up fresh jasmine, check out vibrant displays of fresh fruit and vegetables on sale, peek into a spice shop with sacks of exotic spices, pop by an accessories shop selling bangles by the bunches, and then when you get hungry, stop for a break and eat a prata washed down with a cup of teh tarik. And when the heat gets too much, drop by the 24-hour Mustafa Centre, which hawks everything there is to buy. Even the kitchen sink."
,,Crowded place which has lost its uniqueness,3.0,,"This place used to be a great place for Indian cuisine and items but not anymore as the place is too crowded, both human and vehicular traffic is horrendous."
,,A feeling of being in India,4.0,,"With a number of Hindu temples in the area (and my hotel was located just beside one of them), stalls selling fresh marigold and jasmine garlands, sarees for sale and the Mustafa Center...not to mention the food (I love curry) and the people makes me feel being transported from the Chinese-Malay dominated Singapore to Indian...and to my discovery, a line of vegetable shops near the Mustafa Center owned by immigrants from Bangladesh (where I was able to purchase some handwoven sarong and shawls for my collection)...food and souvenirs are a bit lower in price (so who says Singapore is expensive ?)..I will definitely go back and have a feel of India again when I go back to Singapore"
,,you will feel like you are in India,4.0,,fun to shop for fabrics and great restaurants. really good choices for vegetarians. always crowded but part of the fun.
,,disappointed,3.0,,Not any bargains at the Mustarfa centre. Floor after floor of cheap rubbish dont bother going. as for the area also give it a miss.
,,A Hot Spot of Culture,5.0,,Great spot for shopping on the cheap side as well as to get in touch with gruff feel of rural India as the metropolitans are definitely side by side to first world cities. Recommended for Indians
,,A bit drab in parts,3.0,,"Not very friendly and not that much to see, temples, shops etc but good restaurants on Race Course Road."
,,One of the best in Singapore,4.0,,"The atmosphere here is a complete counter to the Chinatown and the rest of Singapore. The Mustafa Centre is brilliant, it is enormous and densely packed with international and Indian goods, it is easy to spend hours here.
For food, the restaurants in Race Course Road are good, in particular the underwhelming appearing Jaggi's Northern Indian Cuisine is billiant for affecinados of Indian food and possibly the best."
,,Not the best of Singapore,3.0,,"Little India is a point of interest in Singapore and worth the effort to visit, but is not as orderly and pleasant as the rest of the island.

Travelling to Little India is a breeze on the MRT or on foot. The area itself is immediately recognisable since it differs so much from the rest of the city. Shops are packed in tight and sell an unlikely assortment of clothes, food and junk.

Getting around with a pushchair is quite tricky at times with footpaths on multiple levels and the spillover of clothes racks and displays from shops onto the pavement. So not that easily navigable for those with young children on with mobility issues. For some reason the whole of Little India has an unkempt air as though the whole area is somewhat ignored by the Singaporean authorities. It is not as clean, nor the buildings so well maintained as other parts of Singapore.

We ate in Little India on our first trip to Singapore and the meal was very good, but a little pricey considering the surroundings.

As many other reviewers have mentioned Mustafa's is an interesting place to visit. Spread over a number of buildings and blocks it really does sell everything at what must be some of the cheapest prices in the world. Although organised more like a jumble sale than a department store it is an interesting little excursion.

We spent a morning wandering around Little India and probably wouldn't head back in a hurry except to grab a bargain at Mustafa's. An interesting visit, but not very Singaporean."
,,At last - a bit of soul in Singapore,5.0,,"In the cultural wasteland that is Singapore, Little India was a heaven sent find. I was expecting something like KL's Little India but despite this being smaller it had much more atmosphere and heart. Flower sellers, spice sellers, vegetable vendors - with gorgeous fresh produce and people milling around. It was delightful to wander about, and unlike in India, no-one was hassling you to come in to their shop. Lots of great food places to eat too. Its the real mccoy and should be on your 'to do' list if you come to Singapore."
,,cultural eye opener,4.0,,literally india in singapore. I had no idea so many indian people lived in singapore. very lovely cafes and shops galore! lots of little market stalls with spices and so on...
,,Little India and Mustafa's,4.0,,"The exit process from the LTA was much easier than the entrance and after finding the guard building, the guards quickly figured out which ID was mine even without the picture. Luckily, the LTA is located next to one of the areas on our list called Little India.

After a warm walk through a residential section, we quickly found ourselves in an area featuring retail and dining establishments providing many things to look at and photograph. After looking in many merchant‚Äôs storefronts, I decided I needed a short sleeve button-up shirt and a Batik model became part of my warm weather wardrobe. The merchant that won my business had the creative line ‚ÄúI have clothes for the big man‚Äù and a $23 Sing Batik size 20 was in the bag. This retailer was also informative and provided us directions to Mustafa‚Äôs, the Harrods of Singapore.

Many things can be found in Mustafa‚Äôs and although Anthony Bourdain bought a snowglobe for his daughter here, my daughter had the craving for the Cheez-its so we began our search for them. We had brought her some from the states, however, Mustafa‚Äôs did not carry that brand of chip. Needless to say, I needed to check out the Batik section to see what kind of deal I received at the ‚ÄúBig Man‚Äù shop. I found a Singapore Airlines batik that I purchased for $13 Sing which was half price of the one on the street.

After shopping, we earned an appetite for some Indian food and we ate some quasi-fast food at a restaurant located across from Mustafa‚Äôs. I had the biryani because I read it was a must have. The rice was good but the mutton option provided too many bone fragments for my preference. Mindy had the Tandoori Chicken that wasn‚Äôt all that spicy but didn‚Äôt contain any small bones so I assisted her with her portion.

,,The Incredible India in Singapore,5.0,,"Try Mustapha Shopping Center. It is like Macys of New York or the Harrods of London, but in the humble gesture. I can find my eye drops from Germany to special flavor like garam masala instant maggie noodle in India. The old Yadley brand powder for old folks to the latest cologne in the market. They are also cafes with Indian flavors and really worth trying. This is the best place to shop for souveniers and it is much cheaper than in Chinatown. Incredible India in Your Singapore."
,,An interesting part of Singapore life,3.0,,"This is an interesting part of the history of Singapore, and as important as say Chinatown. There are lots of things to see here, some interesting things and shops. The smell of spices pervades the area, but I dont find too overpowering. You can find a bargain or two, but be prepared to bargain as some prices can be high."
,,Quite big neighbourhood!,3.0,,"This is huge neighbourhood that I ever visited in Singapore so far. Been here twice and I can't finish my walking tour around this area. There's few MRT station that can connect you to this area which are Little India Station and Farrer Park Station. But preferably to start your walking tour from Little India Station as it is quite hard for you to complete your walking tour within short time around this area. So, planning ahead is essential. From the station, there's are few colourful building in Buffalo Street and nicely taken as photo. Buffalo Street will leads you to the major street of Little India which is Serangoon Road. There's small but busy and hectic street call Dunlop Street whereby can be considered as Backpacker Heaven, a lot of budget guesthouses to choose from in this street. Besides that, at the edge of Dunlop Street, there's beautiful Abdul Gafoor Mosque with Arabian style. Make sure wear a appropriate attire to show respect to the locals Muslim."
,,It's OK! Not too bad at all.,4.0,,"It's OK. Not too bad at all. Take a small walk around the area, you could see tons of Indian goods, spices, herbs & shops here. Well, if have got time in Singapore, just go and explore the area! :)"
,,"somehow dirty, rubbishlike",1.0,,"The smell in that place was extremely awful, i get a headache after visiting there. Even things are expensive there.Hotels are small(hotel 81). Full indians( i thinks that why it is called)"
,,Nice to visit if you have extra time to spare,4.0,,I did this part only before my flight as my schedule was tight. The best part was I got a nice Henna painting on my hand which keeps reminding me of my trip!
,,Spend an evening here,5.0,,"Little India has it's own community vibe. Walk around sit in a bar and eat at the Banana Leaf, very basic but the best fun to be had eating and Indian anywhere."
,,Tast of India,4.0,,"For all the Indians on a trip to Singapore, it is a place to satisfy their craving for ‚Äòhome food‚Äô. The streets are lined with numerous Indian food joints. If you are missing the Indian food, this is the place to head. With food varieties ranging from south Indian, tandoori delights, biriyanis and ‚Äòthalis‚Äô you could be sampling India on the plate!

Indulge not just in the food but shopping as well, especially at Mustafa Shopping centre where you find very good deals on all items."
,,Totally contrasts with most of Singapore,4.0,,"This was one of my favorite walking adventures in the city- mostly because it barely feels like Singapore! Oh, you can find straight razors at mustafas!"
,,An eye opener-lots if sarongs,3.0,,A sight worth seeing. Singapore is generally very clean but look out for the cockroaches near bins and eateries.
,,nice place,5.0,,this is a place where I will definetly go back if I travel to Singapour again. I've done some good shopping there and I was very satisfied specially at the Moustapha Complex. The little shops also offer some good bargains. I definitely like the place and its easily accessible through the MRT stations.
,,Not worth it,2.0,,I was disappointed in Little India seemed mostly all food area and tiny little shops with not much to offer the shoppers lot of cheap stuff like $2 shops in Australia
,,Great food,4.0,,"Not been to India before, and this was the first ""Little India"" experience also. Was impressed, the food was a hundred times better than you get in the local takeaways in the UK (would recommend Mogul's for nice Samosas and Indian desserts!)

There were also your token souvenir shops as well as Gold Jewelers.

Would definitely go back if in Singapore again"
,,Smell of Indian Spices,5.0,,"We just got out from little India MRT and wow, suddenly different world in Singapore. The first thing struck us was the smell of spices. There is a market call Teka. And along the road a lot old colourful shophouses selling spices herbs and vegetables.
There are a lot indian restaurants and so many foodd to try"
,,Autenthic for sure,5.0,,"Now that was the real thing. The smells, colors, music, sights, people...all was India...for real...Loved it! They also have great hostels in the area, recommend Prince of Wales of Dunlop street...cousy and cheap place to be in :D"
,,Gem of Singapore,5.0,,"Where people of various races flock to for food (anywhere!), shopping (24hrs @ Mustafa Shopping Centre), culture and spices (Tekka market) etc. My favourite restaurant is called Gayatri along Race Course Road, close to Muthu's Curry. The best way to explore Little India is by foot, go walk through the alleys and take it the smell of the spices, the sound of people bargaining.. and in the evenings there are bars around the area to chill, and you cann complete your night grabbing groceries at Mustafa. Well, they have more than groceries, they have EVERYTHING. My other favourite restaurant would be Swee Chun, Hong Kong dim sum. Around Rowell Road and a few street around there lives some local artists. If you are into arts dont miss Post Museum!"
,,Feel at Home,4.0,,This place in singapore is being visited by all Indians coming to this country either they stay here or visit it religiously even if staying in city centre.Mustafa open 24hours is one of the main reasons and also this place is dotted with lots of Indian restaurants and hotels. South Indians need not miss their regular idly sambar or dosa as saravana bhavan and anadha bhavan are situated here north indians too have a lot of tandoor restaurants which makes this place an indian tourists must visit.Accesible by MRT with two stations . little india and farer park - the latter is closer to mustafa.where one can literally get anything. Behind mustafa on the kitchner road is a new mall suncity mall housing 50 eateries in its food court.
,,It really is like India!,5.0,,"Little India has the authenticity and colors of India with the cleanliness of Singapore. Many very cheap, extremely delicious restaurants--you can walk into any one of them and be satisfied. It is extremely crowded, but that contributes so much to the experience. Any visitor to Singapore must come here to see a culture totally different from the rest of the island."
,,Array of delights,4.0,,Great area with all sorts to view including the temple. Right opposite Suntec city for all your electronic gadgets
,,Crowded and hot,3.0,,"You need to know what you're looking for before you even attempt to trawl the lanes of Little India. When the heat gets to you, hide away in the emporium of a million gifts - Mustapha. Before you know it, you could spend hours just browsing through its aisles and peering through the mind-boggling selection of goods it carries."
,,mini india,3.0,,"sometimes they offer decent deals at their supermarket, great for lover shoppers. and u have to double check their price for anything u want to buy, have great restaurant india"
,,Don't go on Sundays!!,3.0,,"One of the truly 'aunthentic' areas of Singapore, Little India has great food and stalls as well as temples and other sights to see.
However, on weekends, especially Sundays, it is fully occupied by the many male Indian foreign construction workers whose favourite pastime is sitting in public spaces drinking. Fair enough, but this can be quite uncomfortable especially for ladies."
,,"If You Want Character, Visit Little India",4.0,,"Little India has a lot of flavor and a character all it's own. A good place to start is along Race Course Road. There are a lot of great restaurants along this stretch, which feature cuisine from all over India. Another great place is Tekka Market. This is fun on a Saturday morning. Visit the wet market and see a great variety of meat, fish, vegetables and you can get banana leafs to eat on at home. The food court has a great Biryani shop... look for the long line. Also sample the teh tarek.
Work your way down the alleys to Sarangoon road. There are shops along there and on the roads that connect to Race Course that feature the latest Bollywood CDs and DVDs. You may spot a clothing mender in the vegetable shops. Mustafa is a unique shopping experience, and seems to be full and busy no matter what time of day. Note that weekends can get really crowded, particularly on Sundays, when Indian workers visit for a taste of home. Deepavali and the various Indian festivals bring in more color with lights and markets."
,,Nice food,4.0,,Great place just to wonder and see the various shops selling spices and other Indian gifts. Had a great curry in a small restaurant.
,,Black Sheep of Singapore :),3.0,,Huge contrast to Sinpapore's sparkling clean image and lives upto the reputation of the city's name - India. Extremely crowded but its a great place for budget shopping.
,,Even Better than KL's Little India,4.0,,"In my opinion, the Little India in Singapore is much more cool than Singapore's Chinatown (and even better than Little India in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia). Lots of beautiful ornaments on the street, colorful buildings, including a good green-mall, City Square Mall. The famous Mustafa Center is also located in this region too.
You can find many shops and places to eat here. One that I recommend is the food court at the Besar st. Although the place is not really net, the food are delicious and the price is very very cheap!"
,,The diversity of Singapore,5.0,,"One of the most common things people utter when stepping into Little India is, ""This isn't Singapore anymore!"" Which is silly since it's very much a part of Singapore. Just not the modern air-conditioned version of S'pore. The neighborhood is definitely worth a stroll and there are all kinds of delightful foods to sample as well as shops and pubs to check out. Dunlop Street has recently been turned into an enclave catering towards flashpackers and is a curious sight of new restaurants and bars mixing in with the old businesses of Little India."
,,Colourful,5.0,,A great place to visit on your trip to singapore. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the gold shops here.
,,The best of Singapore!,5.0,,It's full of culture and excellent food.The colourful surrounding adds a sceneric view of the whole part of Little India.
,,A Little Frozen India,3.0,,The streets give the impression of South India as it used to be about 50 years ago. The best part is you get all grocery and vegetables special for south Indian tastes. But slightly overpriced. You get most of the same stuff at cheaper price at Mustaffas. A rather run down look.
,,Great for electronics at a bargain,3.0,,"Be sure to check out the 24-hour Mustafa Centre, where you can get the best deals on electronics. Check them out at 3am and you'll be shocked to see that there are still people shopping there!"
,,"Great Place, Authentic",4.0,,"We were some of the few white people there, mostly Indians, Pakistani, going about their business. Food everywhere was amazing. Loved just walking around and poking in shops, temples, and getting lost on side streets. Some tourist trade, not at all like Chinatown which I didn't like at all. Difference was I was able to meet and chat some of the locals. What a treat"
,,Good place to exchange your dollars,3.0,,There are a lot of Inidan eatries but i tried a couple of them but didn't find anything impressive but then being an Indian i will have the bais. It is a good place for backpackers on budget and Mustafa market gives you a good rate for your dollars.
,,Nice experience,4.0,,This was our first little India experience.the shops were packed close together with a lot of fit traffic too.there are several temples there that was nice visiting.
,,A Taste of India in Singapore,4.0,,You can shop at anytime with Mustafa being open 24 hours a day.....loads of great food around as well
,,Our Favorite Place to eat and shop,5.0,,Take home a suitcase of spices to cook your favorite India dishes. Eat with the locals in the food court. 4th or 5th stall on left has the best butter chicken of our lifetime for bargain price. Tandoori chicken to melt in your mouth. Try a mango lassi too!
,,Fun,5.0,,"Visited Little India in what was supposed to be a half day trip, that ended up taking all day! So much to see and such friendly people. Cool buildings scattered through as well."
,,I love it!!,4.0,,Having travelled to India quite a bit I was thrilled to find Little India here. I wanted to show my hubby a taste of India as he has no desire to go there and he found it very interesting and authentic to the photos he had seen and tales I had told him. Shame there was a rain storm while we were there!!
,,"Good food, beautiful tamples, avoid saturday evenings",4.0,,"Fun to walk around, walk in at Moustafa shopping center as well. Have some indian food. On saturday evening and sunday during the day it's over-crowded with indian construction workers, you might want to avoid this, or if you like it, then is also a good time to really see what's happening in the community"
,,Great area to kill a couple of hours,4.0,,"Title says it all! Loved the eateries and shopping malls, down to earth with down to Earth prices."

,,Great area to kill a couple of hours,4.0,,"Title says it all! Loved the eateries and shopping malls, down to earth with down to Earth prices."
,,a wonderful cultural hub,4.0,,"Every so often you have to take a break from your sanitized Singaporean life and go to little India. Markets here sell everything you can imagine and if you're smart enough to carry cash, you can drive a hard bargain. Remember this is THE hottest part of the city on a sunny day. For some reason there's just no air flow at all so if it's hot out, choose to explore here at night."
,,Wander the streets and this is India sans the dust,4.0,,"Excellent ******food - especially vegetarian, great cheap deals on most things 5 watches for S$10, and a host of of other unbeleivables if you are from Oz or Europe. very friendly and just absorb and you will remember for ever"
,,Cheap(er) Tunics and Beauty Services,4.0,,"Tips & Itinerary:
1. Start at the junction of Serangoon Road and Buffalo Road, walking down the main Serangoon Road. Include the offshoots to the left and right of the road, but don't need to go too far down.
2. Avoid weekends if you can. Saturday mornings might still be fine, but definitely too crowded on Sundays.
3. Cheap(er) Tunics: i bought lovely cotton tunic tops with embroidery for less than prices charged elsewhere. S$15 and S$40 average prices. One shop had a tailor at the entrance and he did alterations on the spot for no extra charges!
4. On Serangoon/Kerbau Road/Belilos Lane, there are several beauty services shops. I went to Bali Spa (18 Kerbau Road) and had threading done for S$3 (upper lip) and S$8 (brows). A real bargain. nice environment.
5. On the main Serangoon Road, there are some signs showing shops upstairs, and it's worth a wander to go. Don't just look at the shops on the main road street entrance.
6. Some of the clothes/beauty shops require you to take off your shoes at the entrance, a very clean habit, as the shop itself is then very clean and easy to try clothes. So don't wear complicated sandals/shoes.
7. Regarding safety, I'm 5'2, female and went alone on a Saturday morning and it was perfectly fine for me.
8. Have masala tea. Most of the restaurants will serve this. Makes you realise that the Starbucks' Chai lattes/teas are overpriced poor imitations of proper spiced tea.
9. Mustafa Centre is very crowded, huge and head-ache inducing from the overly bright fluorescent lights. I would skip it unless you have something specific to buy. (eg. luggage, electronics, in which case just go straight to that department. don't try going floor by floor as you'll be there for a month)"
,,"Colour, smells and spices oh my!",4.0,,"The hottest curries, the most colourful shop houses and smells of incense...Little India. A must see when visiting Singapore. See women dressed in beautiful sari's - even get yourself a tailor made sari, shirt or dress whilst you are here! Visit the wet markets, the famous curry houses and find spices you never knew existed. Little India is so much fun and a completely different vibe and atmosphere to Chinatown and the CBD."
,,"if you like diferent cultures, go there",3.0,,"We made a walking tour with a guide and it was interessant, simple. What we liked more was to enter in an indian temple, very different and interesting !!!
If you like different cultures , go there, but it is not an imperdible site, go only if you have enough time. We saw also a small curry factory, with strong curry smell !!!"
,,"Food, shopping and bit of rough and ready",4.0,,"I had the opportunity to visit Little India again for my recent visit to Singapore.

This time we only paid a brief visit to Mustafa Centre and spent more time exploring other areas of Little India.

Its is still busy, it is still rough and ready and may not be suitable for all. Having read some recent reviews, if you are a person from certain far eastern countries who look down on Indians then you might as well stay away.

There are a variety of food places to eat, some more enticing than others. Take a look and you can find fresh sugar cane juice, you now need to look harder for internet cafes and mobile phone shops have multiplied.

We used to round our trip by going to a nearby mall for Swensen's ice cream before getting a MRT back to our hotel rather than waiting in the queue for a taxi."
,,Indians Should Visit,4.0,,"Little India as the name itself suggests is a small Indian setting within Singapore with Shops, Restaurants etc run mostly by Indians and serving Indian food.
There is Kailash Parbat and lot many vegetarian restaurants in Little India.

On Weekends avoid going there in the evening since the roads, restaurant are all over crowded and Taxi's are also difficult to find for return journey"
,,Interesting cultural corner of the city,4.0,,"Little India is much more interesting than Chinatown, it feels more authentic and has a few Hindu temples that you can visit. They aren't open all the time though, I missed several of them by coming at the wrong time."
,,Dirty Place,2.0,,"Very dirty and smelly, be careful where you eat and watch your bags..."
,,If you do anything go the the Mustapha Centre,4.0,,Mustapha Center is mind blowing so much crammed in. We went on a week day I cannot imagine what weekend's would be like.
,,Frightening experience for young female travellers,2.0,,"A friend and I arrived a few hours earlier than the other four guests in out group as a surprise for one of the other girls. We both loved Indian food so decided to give Little India a go. The taxi driver suggested going to the main food court there (I forget what it was called).

We both dressed conservatively (long dresses, something to cover shoulders) as we were aware of the culture. We both have light skin, particularly myself. She has long blonde hair and I have orange hair. From the moment that we stepped out of the taxi to the moment we left everyone was staring at us and some people were even following us and taking photos.

The food court smelled awful, and although the meals were delicious, I'm not so sure they were worth the nausea caused by the smell of the place (not to mention the lack of air conditioning).

Impossible to get a taxi out of the place. Police were very helpful and friendly and offered us directions. First hotel we went into to ask for help once we got lost the staff were incredibly rude and arrogant. The second hotel we went to for help the staff were lovely and even called us a taxi.

We were 20 ad 21 years old. It was an adventure and a half. We laugh about it... But it's not something we would do again on purpose!"
,,Just shopping,3.0,,"Well, its crowded place during weekends but only for shopping, would be fine. Nothing much."
,,The Spice of India,4.0,,"Eclectic, interesting and full of curios... use your 5 senses here!"
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"I think worth a visit. A little ethnic neighbourhood inside Downtown Singapore. Felt like I was in India, a few blocks on either side of Serangoon Road. There are many shops and places to get a great cheap authentic Indian meal."
,,Great authentic Indian food!,5.0,,"Wonderful restaurants and interesting shopping. We especially like the Kamala restaurant opposite the Temple. Mustapha's is good for Indian food to make at home, electrical goods and cheap clothes & shoes."
,,Interesting even for a local like me!,5.0,,"It is unlike anywhere in Singapore, go there during weekend and you will see the whole place is filled with mainly Indian workers who works in Singapore. You also gets some of the best and authentic Indian food here."
,,Nice food - Probably the most run down area of Singapore,3.0,,"If you can survive Mustafa center, you will get some cheap / unique items.... The banana leaf is good and has great food. YOu will sit with everyone. Perhaps not a must see place but if you have the time, why not."
,,like in the middle of Bombay but more clean and organized :),5.0,,"being here is really like in the middle of busy Bombay but with very clean environment and organized store and restaurant. many Indian spices and cuisine are offered here, they just so delicious and great value. the cuisine is sometime mixed between malay and Bangladesh cuisine which giving more rich taste! dont forget to try also sweet from the market! the gulab jamun is so tasty! in many corner offer moslem food with some kind of pancake eat with curry. all indian stuff you can buy here from cd's to flower. just a great experience being here!"
,,Arab Street,4.0,,Very different to the santised Singapore (nothing wrong with that however!). Good to see the diffenrence.
,,Good place for unique finds,3.0,,"Little India is where my husband and I went for the unique gifts we wanted to get our loved ones. When shopping in Little India, go for the unique and unusual items. If something looks common, it's most likely cheaper in Chinatown. We also tried their cuisine, however, Indian food isn't really for all so do be careful what you order."
,,Sophie,5.0,,"one of the authentic places in Singapore! Come on a sunday afternoon, around 7pm and you will enjoy the nice atmosphere, cheap and delicious food, friendly crowd... You will come back!"
,,Good food,4.0,,"If you like Indian food, this is the place to come. Can get a decent meal for a decent price."
,,Great to visit,4.0,,"Visited just a day before Diwali so lots to see, unfortunately it just rained for the whole afternoon, so it was't very good for shopping. I did get some mendhi (painting) on my hand which lasted for 2 weeks after we got home to NZ. Sadly not enough time to go back."
,,The aromas of spices and more,4.0,,"The streets are filled with the aroma of freshly ground spices. Little shops selling accessories, traditional indian clothes, and even old indian music in cassettes. B sure to walk through the little streets. Little India is no also home to chic boutique hotels and new bistros/ cafes. But if you are willing to try something more exotic, step into one of the local restaurants and knock yourself out with the crazy array of food."
,,Very authentic Indian experience,4.0,,Great place to explore walking amoungest the shops which sell very traditional Indian products. Try eating a meal with your fingers.
,,Little India - a place to explore,5.0,,Love the curry fish head from Apollo Banana Leaf. A lot of very nice restaurants along little India. A lot of cheap stuff from Mustafa centre which operates 24 hr. However the place is too crowded esp during weekends and public holidays
,,Old Singapore.... not India,4.0,,"Little India is not about coming out of the MRT station Little India or Farrer Park and being transported to the streets of Delhi or Mumbai. It is more a place to see ""old Singapore"" before it was bulldozed and converted into high rise buildings. There are heaps of small Indian restaurants serving an amazing variety of foods. IF you come on a Sunday (Foreign worker day off) then Little India is converted into something like India for a day. The streets are jammed with Tamils, Bengalis, Sri Lankans, and lots of other S. Asians. If you don't like crowds.... DON'T visit on a Sunday. If you want to see Little India at it's PEAK in the week, this is the day to do it. Even Singaporeans will tell you that Little India is much more like ""old Singapore"" than Chinatown (which has been highly commercialized). These are my observations as a long time, on again, off again, Singapore resident."
,,"OK, but nothing special",3.0,,"Guide books recommend a visit to Little India as a contrast to Chinatown etc. Easy to get to on the MRT but there is nothing really special to see. A few streets which are made up of shop fronts selling Indian flower garlands or tourist shops selling Pashmina shawls and other souvenir wares. The rest are working barber shops, restaurants or businesses. You may enjoy wandering around soaking up the atmosphere but it is very quiet and not well signposted with historical facts. If you only have a few days in Singapore there are more interesting ways to spend your time."
,,Average,3.0,,"Nothing much to see there... if you don't know anything about Indian streets (which i doubt as they exist through out the world) then you might be fascinated by the crowded roads, small stores, lots of indians, some low end food restaurants. This place is also littered by singapore standards.
If you know the indian way then you will not miss much..
In either case a 30 min walk would be enough to give you the feel."
,,"Sight, sound & scent",4.0,,"The colours of fabric, accessories, spices, is enough to make me stop at almost every shop. Love the multicolored bangles, the sari colours, style and fabric choices are oh... so divine! I can spend hours in a sari shop.

Love walking through Little India. Never bored as there's always some bollywood music being blasted on bad sound system from a shop somewhere along your little tour.

The frangrance of the spices from the warehouses along the narrow lanes all along Serangoon Road starting from Tekka Market takes you into spices haven. To buy directly here is so much more cheaper than the pre-packed ones in supermarkets. Also I believer the spices are fresher and I can get just the right amount for the curry or piella dish. Not forgetting the scent from restaurants along the way - light snack must have tissue prata or paper dosai. Main meal - fish head curry or murtabak with meat filling. There are also vegetarian restaurants aplenty. Loads of choices but where to start?

Finally must shopping haven would be Mustafa the only 24-hour shopping experience in Singapore. Get anything from cosmetics, frangrance, cloths, spices, dry goods, watches, etc under one roof. The prices are generally cheaper than that along Orchard Road.

Caution - avoid Sundays and public holidays it get very chaotic and busy. Most Indian/Bangra workers chill out during their break at Little India so if you want to enjoy leisurely, quieter browsing than choose a weekday afternoon."
,,Similar too India,4.0,,All Indians who visit Singapore should visit Little India... You get all kind of Indian foods... Rather that Calling it Little India we can Call that Little Tamil Nadu. More of Tamil oriented... As we visited soon after Diwali we found the whole of Little india is decorated for Diwali... Tried many Indian Hotels most of them are good...
,,Culture in a concrete jungle,4.0,,A little piece of Singapore with heart and soul. The majority of Singapore could be in any other first world country so it's nice to have a spot to wander around where you can have a little taste of Asia.
,,FLAVOUR OF LITTLE INDIA IN SINGAPORE,4.0,,"Little India offers a totally different experience in Singapore.

Singapore is a very unique country because it is made up of people from different cultures.

As such Little India contributed to this uniqueness to the flavour of Singapore.

It is a very good place for restaurants which they have many and a good shopping place if you are looking for something unique that is primarily of Indian articles such as Indian jewellery, sari, food, etc.

Yap, Little India is kind of like India but in concentrated dosage."
,,fun,4.0,,"Love the sights, smells and sounds of Little India, and the range of Indian delights to eat are wonderful, a good place for souvenir shopping and getting away from all the high rise modern buildings"
,,"Some many tastes, smells and colours!",5.0,,"If you wish to see something really special, you should go there. The shops are amazing - you can find from electrinics to cloth everything you could think of. Very exotic if you come from Europe like myself. I was impressed by the different smells all over this part of the town. A really nice alternatives to the big shopping malls with its more standard products. However please be aware that they sell a lot of ""copies"" there..."
,,Home Sweet Home,4.0,,"We all know that Singapore is home to many Tamil speaking people and the Tamil language is one of the offical languages of Singapore. It was inevitable that went looking for Little India during our recent holiday in Singapore.

The hotel we were staying in was a bit far away and we had to take a taxi to reach Little India. We walked around, did a bit of shopping including at the famous Mustafa Department Store and had some delicious south indian food.

Little India is an excellent refuge for homely food and atmosphere."
,,Wonderfully evocative ....,4.0,,"This is one of Singapore's not to be missed locations. The whole area offers a real flavour of India. Don't hesitate to go into the Hindu Temple, you will be welcome to wander round and witness the offerings being made to the dieties. I found the Temple to be very spiritual, even though there was much hubbub inside with singing, prays and so on constantly going on. The shops in Little India offer silk saris at astoundingly low prices (excellent for use as drapes and curtaining when you get home). There is also a food hall here, service a range of tasty curry dishes - sadly these are no longer served on banana leaves, but they are no less tasty for that."
,,India Yes!!!,3.0,,A lot like India. Infact missed the order of Singapore in the place! The Diwali Decorations were fantastic and almost 2 miles of the road was lit up with decorative lighted Gates 100 Mtrs from each other... Can go if you wanna see India in Singapore...
,,A land called India but not in India but its in Singapore?? Sounds Interesting,5.0,,"Indians were ever we go we want to find something that is connected to India. When I reached Singapore I found that the best attractions available. In my list at the top was Little India...And as I reached there from my hostel it seemed to me as if I was in India. Very near to the MRT station. As you enter the streets , you get the best of Indian clothing shops, groceries and for sure restaurants are in a huge number..Liked it alot...Highly Recommended."
,,India in a thimble...not just for tourists,5.0,,"In this part of Singapour you find all the colours, smells and flavours of India compressed into a few streets. You can access it easily via the North East Metro Line exiting ether at Little India station or Farrer Park. On Serangoon Road and several little side roads, you find small shops selling foods and spices, sareehs and all kinds of things. There are ""flying"" taylors and many kinds of repair shops and you can observe the cooks and bakers preparing food. It's definitely a place where the locals meet and buy with only the occasional tourist in between. Shop owners are friendly and definitely not agressive.
You also find a 24h hour mall (Mustafa ccentre) that has a surprisingly good selection of merchandise from all over the world all stuffed into minimal space. When I went there yesterday evening, the street was still beautifully illluminated and decorated for Deepawali, the Indian New Year.
Very worthwhile and interesting."
,,Beautiful Deepavali Light up,4.0,,"Going to Little India is one of the best attractions during Deepavali where serangoon streests are lit up with rainbow color lights. Going late night time will mean there is less crowd and traffic, cooler air and many of the shops are still open. Great bargains on accessories and miscellaneous staff."
,,Nice place to Shop,4.0,,"I have visited Little India Singapore and have nice Shopping place open 24 hours.
I like to shop whole night and the staff was nice at all shops security all the way very nice.
Indian food are available you will found lot many Indian surrounding this place"
,,Not bad - better than China Town,3.0,,"Cooler stuff than China Town, nicer experience as well."
,,The Food!,5.0,,Bustling Little India is a great place to visit while in Singapore. The sights and smells are not to be missed. Delicious food and great shopping. A good place to pick up those last minute souveneers too.
,,A Place Brimming with Indian Hotels and Shops.,4.0,,"Little India as it is known,is inhabited mostly by Indian Business Community and Hoteliers in Singapore.In fact, we had stayed in Hotel, almost on the outskirts of this place.We visited a couple of shops and restaurants located in little India.This place is where you get all Indian stuffs like vegetables,flowers,Indian garments,clothes,Sarees,groceries,Indian sweets,snacks etc.To my surprise,there some shops selling Indian jwellery also.This place is particularly thronged by the Indian tourists who used to strike an emotional chord with the local business community."
,,Loved the food and the atmosphere,5.0,,There's heaps of Indian shops and grocers selling all kinds of things. Plenty of clothes shops and tailors. Heaps of food stalls serving tasty food and refreshing juices.
,,Crazy but fun,4.0,,Lots to see and do in Little India especially during the month long festival of lights. It's a fun place to visit to see some local colour. Don't be shy to pop in to the local temples and have a look around.
,,Unimpressive,2.0,,We usually visit the Little India's across the world for authentic Indian food. Neither the food nor anything else was really impressive. Lacks good options for North Indian food. Too crowded and lacks a good representation from any other part of India other than southern India.
,,Worth a stroll but that's about all!,3.0,,"We stopped in little India for a quick stroll through the streets. This are is filled with cheap tourist souvenirs that you can find anywhere. We got there by the hop on/off bus which we under no circumstance recommend. Little India is filled with restaurants. We stopped in a pub called ""Prince of Wales"". Address is 101 Dunlop Street. They don't serve any food until 5pm on weekdays and noon on Saturday. It was well worth the stop. Beer was reasonably priced and great atmosphere. Would like to go back at night to the pub. Overall, little India was just okay for us nothing special just a lot of cheap junk to buy. We did find that this area was one of the most smelly and dirtiest places in Singapore with China town being top."
,,Don't miss this place.,5.0,,"Wow. I didn't think I'd like Little India. Loved the place.
From the giant emporium to the street-side stalls and shops.
Incredible food at unbelievable prices is available from street level diners. I had vegetarian.
If you are visiting Singapore, give this place a visit. You will love it."
,,Not very big and a little overbearing!,3.0,,"I was expecting a 'Little India' akin to that in Malaysia, as much as I enjoyed it, it was just a little too overpriced, and little breathing room for haggling, we didn't buy much (except in the 3 for $10 store where we got a bunch of gifts for people).

Also, the stall owners were very pushy, they wouldn't take 'no' for an answer, and, although I'm pretty good at withstanding sales pitches, it made me feel pretty uncomfortable when stall owners blocked your path and almost forced you to go into their shops. UGH.

It was colourful and there was lots to look at, we also had a delicious lunch at the Banana Leaf restaurant, but all of the streets were lined with little restaurants and delicious smells!!"
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"We enjoyed our visit to Little India in Singapore (we travelled there on the MRT), as it reminded us of a trip to the sub-continent a year earlier - the aroma of spices, the Indian music, etc. The only things missing were roaming cows. We went to a cafe for mango lassis and gulab jamin, but we had the impression that they weren't too happy that we didn't order more. We also picked up a package of jelabi from a sweet stall. It was a great opportunity to experience a few of the wonderful things of India and we will definitely be back on future visits to Singapore."
,,A world in itself,4.0,,"Little India in Singapore is located along Serangoon Rd. It is quite easily accessible by bus, MRT or taxi's and offers the discerning tourist a facinating view of singapore's Indian culture and shopping district. Goldsmiths, tailor's, restaurants and plenty of other shops abound this area. There are also Hindu temples located here. A must is a visit to Mustafa's , which is open 24 hours a day and renowned to sell anything that buy can buy. Truly a shoppers paradise. Lastly, dont forget the Indian cuisine - we went to the famous ""Muthu's curry"", a up-market airconditioned restuarant along racecourse road. A little overpriced but well worth it, for the food was most toothsome. Even our young kids (who had never had curry before) loved it. Highly recommened to any visitor to Singapore."
,,"Hot, very hot!",5.0,,"Such a wonderful place to visit, so many different shops, everyone so very friendly, very, very hot!"
,,Little India is indeed Little,3.0,,"This is certainly different to anything Ive seen in Singapore. Little India is indeed little, has no high rise buildings everything seems flat, theres a lot of color, and great food to try out. I happen to have visited it at Thaipusam festival so it was pretty crowded, and full of noise. Of course little India is something u should check out because its one of 3 largest culture in Singapore; your priority should still be Chinatown if u have limited days in Singapore.

I gave this place avg coz there is really nothing to do here than just seeing another side of Singapore, a little bit of shopping and eating here and there. There are more exciting place to see in Singapore."
,,Food is worth trying!!,3.0,,"It is nothing but a street, full of indian shops and restaurants. Nothing important to see but the indian food is worth trying it."
,,Different to anything I've experienced before,4.0,,"I have never been to India, so I cannot comment on the authentisity of this area, but it was certainly different to anything I have come across in my worldly travels and it is how I would imagine areas of India to be like.
We went there in the evening to walk around and I loved it. Yes its bright and garish, dirty smelly and crowded, but that's how I would imagine India to be. I was off everywhere down main avenues and seedy side streets.
Or at least I was until my wife called a halt and told me she wasn't comfortable. And the reason was, although crowded with lots of people in every doorway and alley way, standing or sitting around basically doing not a lot, it was all men and there were no women to be seen. Of course that was a point I had completely missed. But again I guess that's not so different from the real thing.
So at that point we had to find a restaurant and here I was disappointed. Perhaps I was expecting too much, and with regards to the fact that my London home has some of the best Indian restaurants outside India, and a curry is now number one English meal, the two places we tried would be average Indian restaurants in the UK.
But for me it was still a four star experience, although for the wife it would probably get one star."
,,Very tacky and nothing there to really visit.Food not wholly authentic.,1.0,,"Go there if you like but not worth the effort even by taxi.I am of indian decent & half english.Have lived in India and UK and many parts of Africa. The best Indian food still remains in ENGLAND....no need to travel far.A great pity,as things could have been very much improved with very little effort and supply.All ingredients are availablefrom India at
very little cost and postage.SORRY but a FACT"
,,Felt like I left Singapore and went to India.,3.0,,"Singapore fascinates me as its a melting pot of so many asian cultures and one of those is evident in Little India. I was interested in seeing this neighborhood and glad I did, its a different feel that I can only describe as I literally felt like I was in India. Its nice just to see but not much to do other than walk around, eat, or shop. So I recommend to see a different side of Singapore."
,,At least a quick stroll is essential,4.0,,"Just like Chinatown, a complete and totally different Singapore is over here. There are a lot of markets and stores with so many different items, the aroma and the surroundings are so different from the rest of the city. If you have the opportunity to eat over there don‚Äôt waste that experience."
,,Tekka Centre the only attraction,2.0,,"Based on a number of recommendations we visited here and the nearby Arab Quarter. It just doesnt seem that these types of areas (Little India/China etc) of cities are our thing and it was only the Tekka Centre, where we had a cheap but fantastic Mutton Biriyani, which we though had any character and atmosphere to it.
Considering the wonderful architecture around the city we felt the buildings did not have the same character and did not feel there was much to do there.
With all of the other attractions if you are going for a short trip we belive it is worth giving this a miss."
,,Must visit if u miss Idlis-Dosa and other Indian dishes,4.0,,We visited Little India everyday during our stay to have Indian food :)
,,Not worth the time,2.0,,Did not find much to do in Little India. the food was no better than the Geylang district. Essentially a bunch of cheap jewelery stores and gift shops. Not worth the time unless you enjoy browsing in dime store tourist shops.
,,Not our favourite place,3.0,,"The place is definately full of colours and smells, but not great smells at that. We found the place noisy, a little seedy and looked like it really needed an overall scrub. Really preferred Arabtown and Chinatown over Little India"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"I loved visiting Little India so much. This was my favourite place in Singapore. In this neighbourhood you definitely feel like you have been transported to another place. Like other reviews have said, it is a little seedy, but that is one of the things that makes it so unique. And to be honest, I never saw a single hint of inappropriate or illegal behaviour, so maybe the place has a bad reputation just because it is not as clean as other places in Singapore. Expect a little touting from shopkeepers, and definitely visit Mustafa - that place is amazing, especially for jewellery, watches, and Indian bangles.

We visited twice, the second time was on a Sunday night, and the place was packed with so many people that cars couldn't drive down the roads. If you hate crowds,don't go at this time, but if you don't mind crowds go for it, the atmosphere is amazing.

The only thing that I disliked about Little India was that everybody (but especially men) openly stared at me. But to be honest, I experienced this all over Singapore. I don't know why people found me so unusual, you'd think Westerners would be common place enough. In the end I decided it was because I looked so touristy with my map and backback etc."
,,love,5.0,,"excellent visit, friendly and genuine full of surprises and colors"
,,Been there - No wish to go back,3.0,,"Stopped off at Little India on a hop on/hop off bus tour. Worth a look but wouldn't go back again. As a previous review said, a little seedy, dirty and walking with our 18yr old daughter felt uncomfortable with all the stares. Stores selling cheap souvenirs so good place to pick up something to take home but prices differ so much from stall to stall.
Mustafa has everything but with all the noise and people there, we went in one door, out the other. It was the only place in Singapore we didnt like and felt unsafe. Its nice to see other cultures and experience their way of life and happy we have seen Little India but next time would stay on the bus."
,,Home away from Home,4.0,,"Have stayed in this neighbourhood the last twotimes that ive visited Singapore the last 3 months,

Being Indian,it is also nice to see Indians around as it becomes easier to communicate with them and share and exchange ideas and thoughts and tips and advise on the do and donts as well as some new friends and their experiences and history on how they got here and stayed there and retained their roots though becoming Singaporeans

Best place for Vegetrarian and Jain food, if u cant stay without it away from home....try Sagar Ratna ...opp Mustafa....as authentic and tstay as can be !!

Mustafa -the 24 hour shopping complex is in the vicinity and can get hold of any thing u need....besides it open 24 hours....so if u aint getting sleep.........go there...or early morning shopping in Mustafa...the exercise will drain u more calories than ur morning walk-trying to cover the entire Mustafa

Also,u get a good deal on the exchange rate there......almost 1.29 Sgd to a USD last week, compared to 1.21 at the airport

Loads of shops to buy junk stuff........1 for sgd 4....3 for 10 sgd..... decent and handy stuff....good for gifting......

Waslight up last week, with the coming of our Holy Festival 'Diwali'.........

if u like the noise and hustle bustle of a busy city...........Cant miss Little India.....
U will also find some small Indian bars, nightclubs and parlours in and around the area.......

so u arent too far from home, if u still want feel at home...Indians!"
,,Singapore Ghetto,2.0,,"Little India is the only ghettoised town of Singapore.

The saving grace of Little India is Al-Mustafa department store, which guarantees the lowest price for everything. It is a good place to buy electronic goods especially a camera. I bought a Sony digital camera from Al -Mustafa and also did my chocolate and grocery shopping there."
,,Visit during festival,4.0,,"Dont expect to see a whole of India in Little India. But its a must visit during festival. I was there during Thaipusam and the street was filled with devotees carrying ""kavadi"". It was great. Visit the temples nearly."
,,A slice of India but a bit seedy for me.,3.0,,"I was looking forward to visiting Little India but I was a bit disappointed. I felt it was a little bit seedy (even our cab driver warned us to hold onto our wallets and handbags) I was also shocked to find that it wasn't as pristine and clean as the rest of Singapore. I assumed Little India would be a clean version of the real India. But it was somewhat smelly and dirty compared to the rest of Singapore and I felt uncomfortable walking around the region,especially with my children."
,,A must do!,5.0,,I have looked for a cheap way to see much of Singapore and this is one place I visited. Cheaper than the rest of Singapore and just such a lovely place to wonder around. I stumbled upon a beautiful Hindi temple and had lots of fun getting lost and finding little hidden gems. A must do when you are visiting Singapore on a big or small budget!
,,"The atmosphere is electrifying, Enjoy great food at Amritsar Restaurant",5.0,,"Yes, we were in awe of the whole buzz of this part of the town. Grab your camcorders, you need to capture the whole trip. The streets were full of aroma and by the time our heels were aching, the hunger pangs started too. Being fond of Punjabi food closer to our Pakistani taste buds, the search ended at Amritsar Restaurant.
Oh boy ! what a treat it was.......Amaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing.
Must try it. The service was superb and they serve food from 110m to midnight.
Prices were reasonable average $ 5.00 to $ 6.00 per dish.
It was worth it."
,,Fun place to explore!,4.0,,"We stopped in Little India to experience some of the ethnic neighborhoods. The sights, sounds, and smells were very different from neighborhood to neighborhood. Since it was Sunday, we saw many of the locals out shopping in addition to the tourists. Little India is a definitely must! The sights, sounds, smells etc. all took me back to my last trip to Delhi. If you‚Äôve never been to India, it‚Äôs a great taste of what it is like. You‚Äôll find jewelry, saris, custom made clothing, intricate beading and needlework and the like. If you have the time, the prices for custom suits are very competitive and quality was top notch."
,,Best place to get some vegetarian food...,5.0,,"If you want to get a taste of India outside India, this is the place to be. This is as authentic as it gets.

I heard so much about the store Mustafa, it turned out to be a disappointment. Too cramped and too crowded.

There are a myriad of restaurants over there. We tried the Komala Vilas, which served awesome South Indian veggie food. Just Delish.... as Rachel Ray would put it...."
,,Everythings here,3.0,,"I never missed going to Little India whenever I go to Singapore. It's the place that I always go to when I want to exchange money. They have the best rate in town. I'm a fan of indian stuff so, I get all of those here from indian balm, oil, soap, spices, bollywood film and food. Ooopppss, but avoid going to Little India during sunday. This place is packed with indians, sri lankans and bangaldeshi workers. They hang around the stretch of Seranggoon Road. It's like you are in southern part of india once you are there. I love the indian restaurants here. They serve buttered chicken with naan (I forgot the name of the restaurant). Not that cheap but it's worth the money. Thosai and murtabak are nice as well. They're affordable and in big serving."
,,A little venture here will be worthwhile,4.0,,"Tourists are likely to venture into Little India to shop at the Mustafa Centre, but its an area to spend some time on its own right. This is a busy little place and on Sundays when the locals have the day off its heaving.

Firstly there is a wide choice of food with some nice Indian restaurants, cafes and takeaways. Some have authentic Indian food but like Hawker stalls a bit rough and ready. The food is cheap and good.

You can then spend some time to shop for Asian clothes, fabric, jewellery, music, films, electronics and beauty products. There are many small shops, market stalls where you just wander in and out of. You can barter or just plain window shop.

You can also get reasonably cheap internet access round here at the phonecall shops where you can also use to phone abroad.

If you wish to leave the clinical atmosphere and branded shops of Orchard St, then enter Little India for a taste of a little authenticity."
,,BargainShopping,5.0,,"If you enjoy hunting for bargains then Little India is the place to go. Walk down Serangoon Rd and the little laneways and go in and out of all the little shops. You will be amazed at what you find. As you walk along you will be greeted by the beautiful smells of incense and the music of India. Meet the locals, expect to bargain and you will have great fun.

From costume jewellery to women's and men's wear you will find it all here. Looking for some beautiful material - try the saree shops. They don't just have to be used as dresses. Hunt through the hanging rails to find beautiful embroidered, sequined women's tops or skirts, men's T-shirts and shorts. There are shops devoted to costume jewellery - beautiful bracelets and necklaces. Need a Bollywood movie or CD - just follow the sounds and you will find a shop.

The prices are cheap, approx. S$15 for beautiful sequined women's tops, men's T-shirts S$10."
,,24 hour shopping in Little India,5.0,,"The Mustafa Center in Little India is open 24 hours a day for shopping... it's a HUGE building, about 8 stories, and you can buy almost anything you want, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at great prices. Clothes, jewelry, fine jewelry, watches, electronics, toys, food, market items, full pharmacy, kitchen appliances, computers, gifts, household items, EVERYTHING. And the selection is huge. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It is adjacent to the New Park Hotel. I believe they have a website. Near the Ferrar MRT metro station.

Be aware there are two stores, the smaller one closes around 11 PM, the larger one is always open, entrance is on the smaller side street for the larger store. If you're short on time in Singapore, or can't sleep, this is a great place to spend time."
,,gory splendor,5.0,,"Tekka market and Little India are everything I hoped Asia would be and Singapore was not: chaotic, messy, colorful, and a total riot. Guys chopping fish heads, bins and bins of live crabs, clothing stalls in the mezzanine, offerings to the gods next to monster prawns. Flower-wreath-sellers for temple offerings and produce markets were everywhere on the street. You could barely squeeze by them in the covered sidewalks. Also, you have to buy some 22K gold while you're in Little India - it's the preferred grade in India (like 14K is here in the US), and it's just amazing. You buy it by the gram, although some of the women there appear to buy it by the pound! I got some dosa and sauces, but the guys at the dosa joint looked pretty uncomfortable to have me there (they were polite and all though) but I decided to find a place outside to eat my lunch. The dosa sauces were the best I've ever had in my life."
