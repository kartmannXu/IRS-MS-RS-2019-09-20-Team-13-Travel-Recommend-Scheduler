The layout is well-planned with many paths and sections to wander through. An amazing, restful and beautiful resource for the whole city to enjoy."
,,Ex colleaques lunch gathering at Taman Serasi Next to Botanical Garden,4.0,,"After our lunch gathering with colleaques at Taman Serasi ,we decided to walk down memory lane at Botanical Garden.Since I was trained as horticulture assistant in early 70s at this very place I was impressed with
the serenity and ambience of this garden.
The man made lake still there with concerts performances held throughout the year.With the world heritage status ,this garden is comparable with some world famous garden like Kew Garden in UK and in Dubai .I would certainly encourage fellow Singaporean to bisit this place to feel the beauty and serenity which is rare to be found."
,,Wonderful park,5.0,,"This park is huge. The distance from the nort-side to the south-side is 2km. The design, layout and green variation of the park is wonderful: from bonsai trees, bamboo forests, orchids, palm trees etc. There are plenty of places to relax, eat, drink or enjoy the serenity."
,,Nice place to enjoy the outdoors,5.0,,A lot of big shady trees and big open space. There are also playgrounds at the Children's gardens area for the kids.
,,Beautiful Rejuvenating Garden,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a very well kept place that exudes beauty at every corner. Spending time here alone, with family or friends, always bring a smile to my soul. Plus multiple visits will not bore you because there is almost always something new to surprise you. Free guided tours are available every Sat."
,,Wonderful and tranquil,5.0,,"I have been so many times in the botanic garden in Singapore during my 4 year stay. I have taken all my family and friends who came for a visit and everyone was impressed. It is idyllic, calming and so well kept. Love it!"
,,Tsum tsum,5.0,,Went to visit the character tsum tsum at the Gardens By the Bay with a friend who visited Singapore. Nice various flowers.
,,Trip to Our Botanical Garden,5.0,,I was suprised how established our botanical Garden is. I spent 1.5 hour and only completed half the garden. The main focus during the visit was the Ginger Plants. I am very proud of our garden. I planned to visit the Orchid Garden in another day.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Peaceful and refreshing. Great place to go for a walk and see beautiful gardens. Easy to park and the entrance is free.
,,A lovely place to wander and you can see monkeys too,5.0,,This is a lovely place to wander around and you will see monkeys if you look for them - we saw them near the water. The loos were not particularly nice though.
,,A place l like to visit since young.,5.0,,Noticed many upgrading done and additional features. Still an educational and relaxing place for youngsters too.
,,Excellent for walks!,5.0,,"Easily my favorite park in Singapore for its beauty and meticulous upkeep. The trees are old, the flora is varied, and there are many animals scurrying around freely! Choose from walking in the shade of ancient trees, or out in the open around small lakes or open fields. There is something for everyone, locals and tourists alike, here. Many choices of eating places too, or pack a picnic and enjoy sprawling out on the well kept lawns. I love it in the mornings when it is still cool enough for a brisk walk. Stick to the shadier parts in the heat of the afternoon sun. Lovely in the evenings again but do bring a mosquito repellent as the mozzies tend to appear at dusk. Too big to be enjoyed in one visit. Plan to visit it’s different parts over a few visits. It’s open and free to everyone."
,,"Peaceful, Tranquility and Restful",5.0,,A place to rest your feet with its greenery and quietness. An oasis among the concrete jungle. Nice café within the park.
,,Beautiful landscaping,4.0,,"A nice area to enjoy the outdoors away from all the high rises. We combined it with the orchid garden, which has a wide variety of beautiful orchids on display"
,,The old part of the garden looks better than the new part/area.,4.0,,"The newly made part not as great as the older side of the the garden . The newly made part looks so fake. The older part looks more natural even though I’m sure, some planning has been done , but it looks less put together , yet visually has more natural flow. The multiple swing area that they added more swings to the old part , is such a simple but genius idea. This part Of the garden & the lake is my favorite :)"
,,Favorite day,5.0,,"I am not a plant person but I really enjoyed my time in the garden. Many unique twists and turns! Although it was humid, we were not unbearably hot. The area is so large that we never felt crowded or pushed to hurry up. We spent several hours walking, exploring and immersing ourselves in this wonderful outdoor space."
,,Love flowers,5.0,,Can’t say a word this place remind me of botanical gardesn in vancouver canada. Worth the visit. Live to be back again in the future.
,,A tropical forest in a bustling city,5.0,,A place which you can escape from the city and have a healthy morning stroll with fresh air. Very clean and well maintained garden. It's a the best place for people who are interested in tropical plants and flowers.
,,Wonderful display,5.0,,One of the best visits we had while in Singapore beautiful display and information on display was well explained
,,Fun place for families,4.0,,Its a good place to spend a good time with the family. The kids zone is amazing and the kids love it. You can visit the orchids or just take your drone to have fun with the children. Picnic is also a good option
,,A beautiful old favourite,5.0,,"Recently spent a week in Singapore discovering all the sights, both natural and cleverly constructed. The botanic gardens was truly a favourite.

Wandering through the perfectly kept walkways there’s so much peace and greenery to be found. Even with the rains upon us we couldn’t help but enjoy the botanical delights that included natural covered arches and pathways, spectacular orchids, and ginger spiced ice cream and drinks from the botanist inspired restaurant Halia. Highly recommended."
,,Gorgeous gardens and ponds.,5.0,,Beautiful koi ponds and orchid gardens. Good for a family day stroll to relax and soak up the scenery. Very peaceful.
,,A lovely day spent here,5.0,,"Easy to access with MRT station next to entrance. Gorgeous gardens with many hidden pathways, which was a lot of fun to find with the kids. Bring water and a umbrella for shade, it gets very hot here. Visit the ginger gardens, they are a bit of a walk from the MRT station but worth it. Plenty of room for the kids to run around."
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"This visit is for all. Easy to get to by MRT or taxi, well worth a visit. The gardens are stunning and you could take a full day just wandering around and taking in the sights.
We visited the Orchid Garden within for $5 and it was simply stunning.
It’s very warm so take water but there are places to eat and toilets so easy to stop for a break."
,,a lovely way to spend a morning,5.0,,We loved our walking tour of the Botanic Gardens. My favorite was sitting in the shade by the koi pond and just taking it in. Also saw lots of other wildlife. Orchid Garden is incredible.
,,Amazing Free Attraction!,5.0,,"My family and I love going to the Botanic Gardens. It is a national park, is open from early morning to midnight, and is free (except the orchid garden). The landscaping is immaculate, and there are so many paths, that even on crowded days, there are places to walk and enjoy the sounds and sights of nature. We love the free concerts and movies on the weekend. The options for food in the gardens are limited, so can be very slow sometimes, so be sure to pack a picnic. Getting there is easy as it is right on the MRT."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Great to visit and see the love and attention of the staff. Many types of orchids. Love how they are kept under wide range of weather conditions. Good year round
,,Part of City Tour,5.0,,"This was part of our Half day city tour. Even though I am not a gardener, it was a beautiful place to visit."
,,A serene and green idyll in a busy city,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens of Singapore is a peaceful and beautiful place where visitors take second place to the magnificent gardens. The abundance of tropical plants makes this location relaxing but interesting to the eye. Keen photographers will have plenty to 'snap' in the heliconia gardens and the awe inspiring orchid garden.

I was fortunate enough to see a family of turtles swimming in the lake and then gathering on the edge of the gardens - a great photo opportunity. The wild roosters running free are a surprise but delightful nonetheless.

I caught the MRT in the late afternoon to visit the gardens; the trip was easy and the station stops at the Gardens so you can enter directly after exiting the station. Singaporean families were gathering for picnics and the atmosphere was fun and friendly - a scene repeated in many of the parks and gardens on the island.

A great location."
,,What a breath of fresh air,5.0,,What a breath of fresh air and so easy to do using public transport. Take the MRT to Botanic Gardens as you come out of the station just follow the signs. You walk straight into the entrance. Follow sign to information booth about 50m there you can get advice on all the things you can get to see in what might be the limited time you have. We had three hours and covered about 60% Make time for the Orchid garden what ever you do $5 entrance or $1 if you are over 60. This is the only charge in the gardens so don't be misled into thinking it's going to cost a fortune. There are plenty of places to eat with hood quality food and drink. Plenty of toilets and good access for the disabled. All in all one of the most inexpensive days out in Singapore
,,Choose morning time,5.0,,"Singapore can have really hot and humid weather, so choosing to walk the garden morning time is better. Free of charge, except for the orchids garden (senior price) you can take all day, at least 3 hours, I took 4 hours. Walking shoes are more comfortable, an umbrella if you can't stand the sun and most important: water. You can get directly by the MRT, exit Botanical Garden and get a map and informations at the welcome desk for your visit . I highly recommend a visit."
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,"We went here to fill the last morning of our stay before we flew to our next destination.
I wish we had spent longer there! It was incredible!
The gardens, which are free to enter, were amazing! So well tended, clean and tidy. The flowers, trees and shrubs were so pretty. We saw turtles in the lake and numerous monitor lizards in and out of the water! We also spotted a huge spider in a web high in the trees! It was a fascinating morning! The orchid gardens charged a very small fee but it was so worth going in- an outdoor area inundated with the most beautiful orchids I had ever seen. Even our teenage daughter was impressed!
If I was to do it again I would make a day if it, take a picnic and enjoy strolling around and taking in the beauty and wildlife."
,,Beautiful gardens with plenty to do,5.0,,"Beautiful garden with many species of plants from different terrains represented here. Our young kids enjoyed interacting and learning about the plants and animals so much that they didn't want to leave.

The garden is big..took us 2 hours with young kids and we have only managed to cover less than half of the space. We will be visiting the other half with the kids playground the next round ."
,,So beautiful!,4.0,,Amazing way to spend some time in Singapore! Walking through the various parts of the gardens was great - enjoyed seeing various gardens.

,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Singapore Botanical Gardens are among the most beautiful gardens I've seen. Good balance between “organized” and “natural”. Free entrance and free walking. Don't miss the beautiful orchids garden!
,,everything is green,5.0,,"yes everything is nicer than usual, you can see that there are so many high trees that give a nice and panoramic view to that stunning and adorable place . highly recommended"
,,World Heritage Site,5.0,,"I just had to visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens as it is World Heritage listed. With a world heritage site on my doorstep at home I love to visit other WHL sites. Beautiful gardens, well laid out, lots of facilities. Don't miss the National Orchid Garden. And easy access on the MRT."
,,Spent much longer here than anticipated,4.0,,"We went here on our last day in Singapore looking to fill some time and ended up staying here way longer than we thought. It is free admission and full of lots of different areas to wander around in a relaxing environment, although watch out for the large lizards!
It also very handily has it's own stop on the underground."
,,Nice place to have a walk,5.0,,"I have spend lots of time there exploring the garden. You can get a map from the entrance and just walk acording to the map and can cover most of the garden.
Don't miss the orchid garden which cost only 5SGD. Restaurants are also there when ever if you feel hungry and thirsty.
Taxi and shuttle bus service is available and Botanic Garden MRT station is also nearby."
,,You could get lost here for hours!,5.0,,Beautifully well maintained. There is so much to see. We was shocked at how big the area actually is!! We loved seeing the turtles in the pond!! If you have time then you should go here just to walk around and soak in the beauty!! It’s also a nice change from the hectic city.
,,Beautiful afternoon work,5.0,,Such a beautiful place in the middle of a busy city. Spent a few hours walking around here. Loved the rainforest area and the lake. Worth paying the $5 entry for orchid garden.
,,Beautiful park,5.0,,Very beautiful gardens and park Many things to explore Especially the orchids garden is worth a detour in this giant park The pars is free except the orchid garden where you pay a small fee
,,A beautiful and tranquil place in Singapore,5.0,,"On each of our many visits to Singapore, we have made a point of spending time at the splendid Singapore Botanic Gardens. We have found it to be an ideal place to go to escape the hustle and bustle of many parts of Singapore City.
The gardens are easily accessible by taxi, public transport or hop on, hop off bus tours.
Our most recent stay in Singapore again saw us visit the Botanic Gardens using the Singapore Airlines Hop on, Hop off bus as our means of access. We visited during the late morning on a Monday. Just like our previous visits, there were a few people there but it was not crowded by any means.
As it was approaching the hottest and most humid part of the day, it was important to stay in the shade as much as possible and to take things at a gentle pace. Staying in the shade was not a problem as there are plenty of shaded spots around the spacious gardens. Taking things at a gentle pace was a bit more of a challenge as there is much to see around Singapore and our time at the gardens was limited. A simple solution to this problem was to not try and cover everything in the gardens. Instead, we selected the area nearest the main entrance and explored that section of the gardens in depth.
All too soon, it was time to move on elsewhere. We did so, happy ion the knowledge that we had taken the time to again visit these beautiful, peaceful botanic gardens.
We look forward to going there again, the next time that we are in Singapore."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Step into the Flower Dome and stand in awe of nature. Spectacular and innovative, it is the largest glass greenhouse in the world as listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records! Be amazed by changing display of flowers and plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid regions.If you like flowers, it's a clear MUST-SEE!"
,,Magnificent and free!,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens were magnificent and magical. Beautifully maintained grounds, easy to get around with paved paths, and an all-around wonderful day of forest bathing."

,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Immense landscape. Healthy and enjoyable walk. Great for nature lovers. More than a century old trees can be found. Beautiful lake to rest and relax by its edge. Enjoy the cool, fresh and clean air. Some pockets of grown herbs area is set aside for visitors viewing."
,,Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Very beautiful place. There are so many beautiful types of plants and flowers arranged with wonderful walking pads. Entry to the gardens is free and is open to everyone be it, locals or tourists. The only fee for Orchard Garden Inside. The orchid gardens were amazing and the lily pond was breathtaking"
,,nice botanic garden with a rather ordinary restaurant,4.0,,the garden is very nice and worth the visit. It is not very large and a couple of hours are sufficient. The restaurant is very ordinary and no worth the stop
,,Tranquility Personified,5.0,,"I’ve been coming to Singapore of around 15 years and finally took the time to take a walk through the Botanical Gardens, that was on a Sunday and I have been going back every day since, the place is absolutely fantastic, quiet and relaxing with great walks, museums, a park an Ampi –Theater on a small lake and places to eat but all still very quiet and peaceful. Personally I love to walk through the rain forest, there is still so much to explore. If you’ve had a bad day at work and want to chill this is the place.

Love it."
,,A Must See in Singapore,5.0,,"A Great place to relax for the day.

This really is a beautiful garden, we went specifically for the National Orchid Garden which is a destination in it's own right and spectacularly beautiful, with more orchid in a relatively compact area than I have ever seen in my life before. The colours and variety are astounding.

But the botanic gardens are far more than just the Orchid Garden, I wish we had spent more time there, we only had about 5 hours and it just wasn't enough to do the gardens any justice at all."
,,Very nice to spent time and enjoy the flowers and cloud forest,5.0,,beautiful place to walk around . well build place where you can even go to higher levels with great view over the gardens and the city . you see everybody enjoys and taking thousand of pictures . For a few dollars entrance you have a great time
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A great place to wander around for hours. We only skimmed the surface but spent hours walking round. Swan Lake & the Rainforest walk are beautiful & its definitely worth paying the small entrance fee into the stunning orchid garden.
,,Not to miss on your trip to Singapore,5.0,,"This feels like a huge oasis in the middle of a busy, bustling city. You can walk (or run) around here for hours.

Check out the schedules of performances in the gardens as the symphony orchestra regularly has performances which are outstanding. Take a picnic and settle in for the evening and you will not regret it!"
,,Lots of WOW moments,5.0,,"There are a lot of things to see here. I would recommend someone to see it if they are in the area and like nature. I saw several animals there: two Lizards, butterflies, chickens, and even a family of Otters - so cute-"
,,Orchid garden,5.0,,The Orchid garden is outstanding. Although this was not our first visit to Singapore it was the first time we managed to get to the garden. Highly recommend to all.
,,Calm and Serene,5.0,,We visited this place on our last day in Singapore and it was worth the effort. Rain forest and Orchid garden section was very beautiful and eye soothing. Weather was quite humid on that day so that was only let down but can't complain about the place at all.
,,"Nice to see, but not even close",3.0,,"I think the garden is nice, especially orchid garden and the rain forest. However, if you are short on time I will definitely recommend that you go to gardens by the bay instead!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Many large cities like New York, Sydney and London have a city park, but the Singapore Botanical gardens beats them all. The gardens have been founded in 1859, but since the 1960's the development accelerated. The admission is free, but when you want to visit one of the specialty gardens like the Orchid or Ginger garden you need to pay a small fee. The gardens are extremely well maintained and contains a enormous variety of unique trees, flowers, birds and other animals. The park has many scenic photo opportunities and enough options to give your legs a rest. The Swan lake and the Orchid garden were our highlights. The gardens hosts over 4 million visitors a year but during a Sunday morning stroll it did not feel crowded at all. This is definitely a must see highlight of Singapore."
,,Huge and Historic Garden!,5.0,,"And it is all free except for one part - the National Orchid Garden. The Gardens were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015, and are still the only tropical botanic garden on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Indeed, it was the third garden on the List after Padua and Kew. There are specialist gardens dotted around the area (the Ginger Garden, the Fragrant Garden etc.) as well as sculptures and lakes, even a waterfall outside a cave/grotto!

Well worth a visit - you could spend hours looking around the 82 hectares - we certainly did!"
,,Worthwhile the visit,5.0,,"Well worth the visit. The orchid garden itself is fantastic but the rest of the area is great to take the time to walk around. Make sure you take some water with you as there are many paths and the humidity can take its toll. Again, well worth it."
,,Peaceful and Relaxing,5.0,,"My husband and I left the kids to do there thing at the hotel while we went here, we took the train and started our walk through the gardens, we got one of the recycled park brochures at the entrance to the park and walked in through the bamboo gardens and then through a foliage garden, there were so many different areas. We continued walking to a small lake within the gardens and watched as the turtles swan around, then as we were walking a massive water lizard (4-5 foot long) swan right by us as we walked along the path, it was incredible, we saw lizards walking and digging up insects along the path, and visited the Ginger Gardens and the Orchid Gardens, it was so hot we only spent about 3 hours there but could have happily walked all day"
,,Don’t miss this.,5.0,,Beautiful gardens truly don’t miss this. A wonderful way to spend half a day. Small restaurant/ bar good value for money and nice area to cool off.
,,Great place for a walk,5.0,,Beautiful gardens to walk around. Go early as it gets hot although there are plenty of shady places to rest.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Getting to the Botanical gardens is easy, using the MRT is pretty straight forward. No need for taxes, there is a station next door to the Botanical garden. Garden pathways are maintained very well, be warned it is a large garden, with some steep slopes. So take it slowly and enjoy the walk. Be sure to stop off at turtle pool, there’s a vending machine with have cold drinks for a few SD, also a vending machine for fish food. Which the children enjoyed feeding the fish as well as the turtles. We also saw Komodo dragons, just hanging out on the edge of the pool. Walking up to the Orchid garden was easy. The Orchid garden is well worth a visit. We spent a day there visit the Orchid garden and the Botanical garden and we only managed to see half of the garden. Food and drink is easily available and the bathrooms are clean."
,,Praceful,4.0,,"Not usually my thing, gardens. However, as part of my sight seeing tour we stopped off and walked aground for an hour. Beautifully maintained, colourful and peaceful. Will visit again if we return to Singapore."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,A most enjoyable time spent there. Hard to believe it is in the city such a wonderful layout and great signage
,,A hidden wonderland,5.0,,"We were surprised to see how big the botanic gardens were, given that land is scarce in Singapore. It was lovely to see families picnicking on the lawns and locals walking around and enjoying the scenery.

Gardens were well maintained, facilities clean and well sign posted."
,,A Kaleidoscope Of Gardens,5.0,,"Time needs to be taken here to really appreciate the mixture of gardens contains withing the greater Botanical gardens acreage. Here you will find amazing arrays of flora ranging from Rain Forests to Wild Fruit Tree areas; Evolutionary Gardens to Fragrant Gardens, the latter of which you cannot miss on approaching. Here you will also find an abundance of wildlife, which just seems to make the entire experience much more of an ecological magic experience."
,,Just go and see with your own eyes,5.0,,"It was so beautiful and really something Singapore here with this garden. Fresh air, amazing kinds of tree and yes!! so many beautiful photos I had taken here."
,,Don’t miss this oasis,5.0,,"This was one of our favorite stops in Singapore. There are so many beautiful types of plants and flowers arranged with wonderful walking pads. It is free entry into the botanic garden, with a small fee for the orchid garden inside, well worth it. Remember to bring hat, sunscreen, and bug spray with you. Come ready to enjoy some exercise and also peaceful relaxation."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Gorgeous collection of plants and an Ethnobotanic exhibit if you are into history/anthropology/need shelter from rain! Remember to get tickets for the Orchid Gardens before 6pm on relevant days!
,,Good for a morning walk,5.0,,"We are a pretty fit family so exercise is what we do. It is su h a lovely walk around this park, and for a few $$$ you can walk around the Orchard garden. Well worth the visit"
,,Big oasis away from the noise,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens impeccably maintained. Walk there with my dog at least once a month. new canopy walk if great, constantly being improved. would recommend any naturenlover to go take a wall there."
,,Lush & tropical,4.0,,"Such a beautiful garden, free to visit and easy to get to. It is vast and you need a few hours. To see the beautiful orchids you need to pay. Lots of wonderful sculptures. Enjoyed our afternoon there."
,,Orchids and more,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens are truly worthy of their UNESCO Heritage status and offer a fabulous range of plantings, walkways, unusual and endangered species. Don’t forget to pay the small extra for the Orchid garden and keep your eyes open for the “Dragons” foraging in the leaf litter"
,,Great things included but generally disappointing,3.0,,"There are some fantastic parts like chickens living there. They simply just walk around and are super friendly. Ponds and lakes had massive numbers of turtles and otter sightings were common for us. But when it came to the gardens I was expecting more. Don’t get me wrong, the gardens were lush and green and super enjoyable to walk around through but there weren’t many flowers and plants with more interesting features. There were heaps of facilities like grass areas, gazebos, cute undercover house type things, toilets, a restaurant and a kids section but something was missing. The kids area (that we did wander around in) made me feel like kids wouldn’t enjoy it. I mean, there’s a playground and fun little ponds but I can’t imagine kids being interested in anything but those few facilities. That’s just my opinion but the whole vibe is awesome and personally I thought it was average but definitely cool in its own way."
,,Favorite Botanic Garden in the World - The Orchid Garden is Spectacular,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden within the Botanic Garden is simply spectacular. I was there about 18 years ago, so I was excited to return on this visit to Singapore, and it did not disappoint. The entire garden is beautiful and far better than the Cloud Forest, which is very manufactured. Definitely plan to visit the botanic garden and spend about half a day - you will not regret it!"
,,Well manicured,5.0,,"Stunning city views, plenty to see, so many animals to look for. Great free morning out in Singapore. Well worth a morning out."
,,Personal Retreat,5.0,,"To many Singaporeans, we would all had been to The Botanic Garden at least once in our lives. It is a place that our parents took us there when we were growing up. When we became parents ourselves, we took our children there too. It is a place that you can go often and not be sick of it. It is a special place in our growing up memories. One of the thing that I enjoy doing, is to go there by myself in the morning and enjoy a walk by myself. You are alone but not completely. People smile and greet you ad they walk pass you. Being alone in this heritage garden is like somewhat having a brief personal retreat. You slow down to look at the flowers, different shapes of leaves and the changing colours. Oh yes, there are still swans in the ponds. One of the highlights for many. You still your mind and heart and just simply be at one with nature. A simple form of mindfulness, living and be appreciative for everything. Peaceful!"
,,A jewel in the city !,5.0,,So peaceful ! Gardens beautiful and the extra charge for Orchid garden is worth it The turtles are a hoot and you can get really close to very large lizards which appear to be used to humans Thoroughly recommend
,,Sherin Nafie,5.0,,"A beautiful park to visit. Take a morning or evening stroll, practice yoga or meditation or simply sit down, relax & enjoy the panoramic views. Watch the swans in the lake or smell the grass after the rain. A truly inspirational dose of positive energy. Admission is free & for just S$5 u can visit the National Orchid Gardens located inside the Botanic Gardens."
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,"Absolutely a must-see when in Singapore! Especially Orchid Garden and the rain forest are amazing experiences. So green, so colorful, so quiet...
Go early in the morning before the sun gets too strong, or late. Too hot during the middle of the day, even though there are plenty of shade under the huge trees."
,,Garden,5.0,,If you appreciate flora and enjoy a calming place in a busy city then you will just love the gardens. Take your time and explore to enjoy
,,Play date,5.0,,"Singapore Botanical Garden is an ideal place for both mummies and babies to have fun!

,,Lovely walk,5.0,,"Took a post lunch walk through the beautifully kept grounds of Singapore Botanic Gardens.
The placards and descriptions, placed discreetly in front of most of the trees and plants, was informative and interesting.

There was plenty of empty spaces and benches,for everyone to relax in. And shade for those who may want some respite from the heat.

Enjoyed the occasional sightings of animals and birds too.
Lovely way to spend 3 hours of your time."
,,A visit here is a must,5.0,,This is a truly beautiful garden split into different areas - I arrived mid afternoon & didn’t get to see it all - will leave it for my next visit
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,4.0,,The Orchid part of the gardens are stunning but the rest is nice but only average. The pond area was great but the highlight was the Orchid area was the best. Not sure how anyone in a wheelchair would get on as some parts of the gardens were only accessible by stairs.
,,Great UNESCO site,5.0,,Go early to avoid the heat and head for the orchid collection. On your way out check out the money tree and the living arch ways.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"The ancient Forrest, the orchid garden, and the rain Forrest’s along with ancient trees are amazing. Our favourite place to relax in Singapore."
,,Fantastic afternoon to put off the jetlag,5.0,,We visited here on the advice of our daughter. We spent a wonderful afternoon looking at the beautiful plants which are in this magnificent setting. The orchid gardens were amazing and the lily pond was breathtaking. The frangipani orchard smelled simply divine.

,,Best Botanic Gardens in South East Asia,5.0,,"Colonial Feel,Many Lakes and Cafes to relax and chill. Quite abit of heritage walks and information to digest as well. It is also located in the heart of the city and just 5 minutes away from Orchard."
,,Great spot to run,4.0,,"Loved running through the gardens - it is an oasis of shade and cool on a hot day. Careful, though, it's easy to get lost!"

,,Great place to hang out,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens offers a relaxing and pleasant experience that is good for friends, families and couples alike."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"This is a great walk, beautiful gardens, free with only a few dollars for the orchid section. Near an MRT too."

,,Huge,5.0,,Never seen such a large Botanical Gardens. It was very interesting the way it was designed. Very colorful and lots if books and crannies. Can recommend it.
,,Fabulous gardens -watch out for the Lizards :),5.0,,Breathtaking gardens beautifully arranged and so much to see. Allow yourself several hours so you can take it all in. Do be aware of the rather large monitor water lizards--one surprised me on one of the walk ways --and that scuffling you hear in the woods are lizards NOT squirrels :P
,,Would recommend,5.0,,This is a wonderful place to visit on your trip to Singapore.Some amazing flowers to see but requires lots of walking.Perfect day out while in Singapore.Would recommend you visit this amazing garden.
,,Enjoying life to the fullest,5.0,,"I strongly encourage visitors to Singapore to see the gardens. Prepare to spend half a day. It is worth it. Comfortable shoes, sunglasses, comfortable clothes. Prepare to smile uncontrollably. This is a beautiful place."
,,"A delightful walk, even if exhausting",5.0,,"We had half a day to kill in Singapore, so decided to explore the botanical gardens, catching the MRT to the Botanic Gardens station at one end and emerging at the Tanglin Gate, not far from Orchard Rd, at the other end a little after 1.00pm. With a 10 am start we might have left things a bit late as the heat and humidity soon took their toll. It was exhausting, and even then didn't get to see the acclaimed Orchid Garden. So, tip # 1 is go early, and tip # 2 take an umbrella or parasol. While there is a luxuriant coverage of trees throughout the gardens, much of the network of footpaths is very exposed to the midday sun. Probably my favourite section was the Rainforest (It was lovely and cool), while Swan Lake was also lovely. And at one point a very busy group of little squirrels also provided some entertainment; fortunately we had a shady spot from which to admire their antics."
,,Outdoors For Good Weather Only,3.0,,If you are up for a good walk in nature then this would be the place for you. But please ensure the weather is in your favour before heading there.
,,Super,5.0,,"This place is ideal if you want to relax. Here you can find every type of threes a super green meadow, little lake and the wonderful ginger and orchids garden."
,,Great for a nice stroll,5.0,,It is a beautiful park especially around sunset and it is quite cooling which makes a stroll here a very pleasant and enjoyable experience. It is also home to a plethora of flora and fauna so it might be an immersive experience for botanists and nature lovers alike.
,,A good walk,4.0,,"In spite of the sweltering heat, the walk is pretty comfortable as there are plenty of shade offered by the tree covers. Not a lot to see but the walk can take up to 2hrs at a leisurely pace.

We didn't pay to see the Orchid Gardens though as we were short of time and energy."
,,Sea of GREEN!,5.0,,"This is definitely for the nature lovers. Lot's of different trees, flowers, etc. can be found here. Free entrance. Don't forget to bring water and protection from the sun and heat. :) Can be easily accessed via subway (Botanic Gardens)."
,,Simply gorgeous garden,4.0,,One can find the transquility and varieties of tree in this beautiful garden. The restaurants serve good variety of food although a bit pricey.
,,Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"A beautiful place for a walk in the park. Although Singapore can get quite hot, during the day, you can still walk, under the shade of trees. It is wheelchair accessible."
,,Singapore Botanical Gardens,5.0,,These gardens contain some of the worlds best flower & fauna. See them at their best then have a good snack.
,,Amazing flowers and the orchid display is spectacular,5.0,,"If I keep it short , then my statement is : Stunding
If I make it a little bit longer , then my recommendation is : do not rush through, take the time and enjoy nature, the colors are unique and impressive. The trees are huge and the green is very special . Do not make it a tick in your tourist attraction list, make it a a moment to reflect , enjoy and let nature connect with you."
,,Great place for nature lovers,5.0,,We visited the garden and with friends and get to view the many plant species. My friends from Australia love the place
,,A National Treasure,5.0,,"I really feel that the Botanic Gardens is a great place to visit for the entire family. There are so many species of flora and fauna. It is in its natural glory in the most beautiful settings. Even the Orchid Gardens within is so beautiful and instagrammable without looking fake and this is the reason why I love it so much and highly recommend it. It is much more preferred than the Gardens By the Bay which I thought was a little too ""artificial and man-made""."
,,garden in the city,5.0,,"this is singapore botanic gardens, here you can jogging, walk and enjoy a very clean air. you can learn about ropical forest, plants etc. and guess what...it's no entry admission aka FREE, so just come and enjoy singapore botanic garden"

,,breezy air in the garden,5.0,,"recommend go to the garden in the early morning and after 5pmish. in the middle of day, it it too hot to enjoy the beautiful garden. A variety kinds of flowers bloom a year around so you are going to enjoy the greenery garden and colorful flower!

The botanical garden staff Miss Choon, She recommends an essential spot to visit. Much appreciated her kindness.

I highly recommend it, please visit when you are in lovely Singapore."
,,Evening stroll,3.0,,Dropped by for an evening stroll. Unfortunately singapore’s weather is too humid still in the evening to be pleasant. And too dark to see much. There’s a new section called the keppel discovery wetlands with a skybridge
,,Lovely Day Out!,5.0,,Spent two hours with my colleagues taking photos. Very hot but the diversity of flora and fauna is amazing. Good idea to grab a bite at Adam Road hawker centre either before or after your visit since it is only a 5-7 min walk away from the Bukit Timah gate.
,,Lovely calm place to walk around,5.0,,"We got a little lost walking here and ended up taking a train but well worth the effort. Fabulous gardens to walk around and a wonderful National Orchid House. Check out the little turtles in the lake too.

We also had lunch here - a fabulous prawn dish - service and value for money were good.

Getting away was harder as we don’t have a local taxi app. None turned up at the taxi ‘waiting area’ so we finally checked with the people at the welcome desk; took another 15 mins for one to arrive."
,,Unmissable for a myriad reasons,5.0,,"Where history was made (first cultivation of rubber), a UNESCO site, the occasional haunt of very fun-loving otters, the national orchid garden, great places to dine or snack, hornbills, racquet-tailed drongos... one of the reasons Singapore is truly a city in a garden. Best to go between 7.30 and 10am or 5 to 7pm... well-served by Botanic Gardens MRT, or buses to Tanglin"
,,Good vides in here,5.0,,"It’s very huge and need half day to explore this garden. Also it is for free, perfect to go with family and children. It was very beautiful and nice. Really need to go National Orchid Garden very worth it."
,,Peaceful place to go anytime,5.0,,"Rare to find a place so near to where you live that you can walk to everyday, allows you to breathe fresh air , and release the stress in absolute peace,Botanical gardens is the perfect place for a daily walk but with all the flowers especially the orchards the expanding landscape views it can be much more . So well maintained yet accessible nearly 24 hours Botanical gardens is truly an iconic place you must visit and enjoy"
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"The botanic gardens are located very close to the main shopping street of orchard road. Once in the gardens, you feel like a whole away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Wonderful gardens,5.0,,"Some of the best botanic gardens I have visited. Lots to see and do, a really peaceful place to spend the day."
,,Cannot believe this is free and still so clean and well maintained,5.0,,"Literally outside the botanic garden mrt station. The garden is divided into multiple sections and it is difficult to pick a favorite. No entry fee to enter the garden. A cove for plants, birds & insects alike. Be prepared to walk a lot if you want to cover the entire garden"
,,What a gem!,5.0,,"This place is big, we spent 4 hours here and barely touched the surface, there is so much to see, do and explore. A Very nice family experience, a must when visiting Singapore. Our son loved all the specially designed children’s gardens.

Some nice little shops and restaurants too if you wanted to stop for lunch."
,,Impressive gardens!,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are well worth a visit; well kept, varied (virgin rainforest, black swans, skywalk ...) and the Orchid Garden is amazing (even for a non-horticulture person)."
,,Brilliant Day Out,5.0,,Our second visit to the these gardens. We decided to venture out and visit the right hand side of the park. Very well looked after we where amazed at the wildlife roaming freely from the giant lizards to the water turtles to an amazing abundance of bird life. Not to mention all the greenery and foliage. As like many places in Singapore there is no charge for entry. We will be back.
,,Nice but can get lost,4.0,,"This is a really nice place to visit in Singapore. There is no admission fee (except the orchid garden). The structure of the park was confusing. If you have enough time to enjoy getting lost, I think this is a perfect place. If you have only a few hours to spend, you have to be careful. I got lost in the orchid garden...probably I didn't see the entire garden but I gave up."
,,Really worth a visit,5.0,,"Even if you are not a big fan of botanical gardens, you need to know that Singapore Botanic Garden is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Orchid garden has a small entrance fee that is worth paying, but the rest is FREE. It takes at least half a day to a whole day to visit, so be prepared to skip some parts. This is a wonderful garden, the plants are so big !
The Botanic Garden is very closed to a metro station called - make a guess - ""Botanic Gardens""."
,,Beautiful and relaxing,5.0,,"After having seen all of the highly recommended attractions in Singapore, we went to the Botanic Gardens (and National Orchid Gardens!!!), because they are free and we were kind of sick of the touristy stuff. Thus we found the fairest of them all. The gardens are stunningly beautiful and tranquil compared with the rest of Singapore. Highly recommended for those who are on a budget and enjoy beautiful things. Btw: the pizza place in the Visitor Centre is not too bad either."
,,Near Paradise,5.0,,"You wouldn't think you're in a huge metropole still, walking through those gardens. They shut out the buzz and sound of the city completely and you're just surrounded by plants. On the big artificial trees you can see over to the habour and the city, and that all for free. So if you have an afternoon free in Singapore and wanna relax this is the right place to go."
,,A great place to relax in busy Singapore,5.0,,A great place to relax in the hart of busy. Plenty to explore with your eyes nose and eyes Singapore
,,Stunning SBG,5.0,,"These gardens are over 160 years old and nestled on 82 hectares and are free to enter. With tranquil lakes, majestic trees and wildlife provide a kaleidoscope of color and perfumes for all senses.
These meticulously manicured gardens are a great oasis to relax and escape from the hustle of Singapore's CBD.
There are lots of interesting walkways around the gardens which are all in distinctive themes providing interest for all ages and are well signed.
There are also a number of sculptures sprinkled around the gardens. With so many hidden gems this makes for a photographers paradise.
You can spend as much time as you like or as little but comfy shoes is a must along with an umbrella.
Well worth time to viisit"
,,Lovely space to walk through,4.0,,Had limited time but was a lovely space to walk through. Orchid garden very nice and worth a visit. Easy to get to on mrt.
,,Oxygen paradise,5.0,,"I used to work in a restaurant in Orchard. During the split shift break, my bf and I always jog to this amazing garden to get fresh oxygen. Then walk back to work. Very well preserved plants. Toilets are very clean. There are drinking water stations, vending machines, dustbin around the garden."
,,A lovely walk,5.0,,The gardens are beautiful. Stunning plants and trees and the orchid garden is so colourful you feel like taking a photo of everyone of them. Make sure you take a supply of water with you as it is very humid and takes quite a while to walk through the whole garden.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The Botanical gardens is worth visiting if you have time in Singapore. Remember to take water, wear a hat and avoid this mid day heat (OK its always hot there).

The gardens are quite large and you can spend anywhere from 1 - 3 hours (or More) there.

The gardens wind around an gives you time to spend as much or as time time you have available. The highlight is the Orchard garden (only about $5 in). The colour and different species are great - certainly a highlight.

Fun for all and if you are a family you wont be disappointed."
,,Decent natural walk,5.0,,"I love this park so much and this was the second time I been there. Spent half to one hr walk in the park is relaxing and they have different sections. Lake, grassland, megatree etc. My son of 2 yr old love here as he could run freely"

,,Well worth the walk,5.0,,Orchids everywhere and even the ginger plants were interesting. A definite when you visit Singapore.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,You can’t go wrong with the botanical gardens. It’s beautifully manicured and maintained. There’s a lake with a couple of resident swans and many fish and tortises. While on your leisure walks you may spot the resident monitor lizards basking in the sun. Put on sunscreen and wear a hat when you go there.
,,Best place to take a walk and just sit on the grass.,5.0,,I love going to botanical gardens to take photos. It’s also a great place to just sit down and relax.
,,So many orchids!! Go on a run!!,4.0,,"Across the expansive grounds, you will be introduced to more orchids than you thought possible. There is also plenty of opportunities for birding and other wildlife. As Singapore is a ""foodie"" destination, it is a perfect occasion for tying on your sneakers and working off some of yesterdays culinary delights. A lovely afternoon."
,,Great day out.,5.0,,We had a few hours here while on holiday in Singapore. The gardens are free to enter. The only charge would be for the Orchid garden which is 5 Singapore dollars and that is worth paying. The Botanical gardens are very well kept. Thousands of different species of plant are growing here due to the ideal micro climate of the area. the gardens are laid out in different styles and areas. there are a few lakes and water features to see. Wild lizards and turtles are also about. Toucans can be seen in the trees . There are a few restaurants and a small shop located by the Orchid garden. There are warning signs about saying to be aware of sudden thunder storms and to be careful when in the gardens as you can get struck easily. A great day out .
,,Lovely Botanic Gardens and mostly FREE!,4.0,,"We had a lovely visit to the Botanic Gardens, a perfect place to wonder, wander and explore. Free entry, so it is great for budget travellers. You have to pay to enter the National Orchid Garden, but it is VERY cheap (S$5!). Easy to access via the MRT. If you want to eat at Halia, make a reservation! Not a large number of other food options. Really lovely gift shops."
,,A fabulous historic oasis that's always growing,5.0,,"A visit to Singapore's Botanic Gardens delivers both insights and delights! You can't fail to learn something fascinating about the economic and scientific history of plants in southeast Asia, but you may also find yourself lying back on a rope hammock watching the sunlight flitter through tropical leaves.

From the wonderful Jacob Ballas Children's Garden, which provides a safe space for toddlers to pre-teens, to fine dining and free concerts, the gardens are a unique shared pleasure for residents and visitors alike."
,,Perfect place to run in Singapore,5.0,,"Get some fresh air, feel the smells of trees and flowers, this is a Wonderful place to visit in Singapore.

Perfect place to run at, and so close to Orchard Road that you can easily run to the Botanical garden, take full lap inside, and return"
,,Top place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,This is more than a “garden”. It is a huge open park with a swan lake and open spaces and of course gorgeous botanicals. The highlight was the Orchid Garden - the admission to the botanical garden is free and the fee for the orchid garden is s$5. It is worth every penny. Breathtaking even though I am not a “flower” fanatic.
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,"Never seen any other garden like these in many other countries that I have visited. Simply wonderful! Extremely well maintained, very clean, no bugs. It is easy to walk and go around but the humidity is brutal, I lost about 5 lbs. in just one afternoon while drinking lots of water. However, it is worth it, on every step you take, you can discover something new, it is really an amazing place."
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,When in Singapore take a visit to the Singapore Botanical Gardens. It's very peaceful and the gardens are nice.
,,Stunningly beautiful gardens,5.0,,"We spent the day here as the gardens are just too beautiful to rush. We were blown away by how large they are and the variety of plants and wildlife we found.

Seeing all the different birds, reptiles and fish was a delight but the star of the show are definitely the orchids. We paid the $5 to enter the orchid gardens ($1 if you are over 60) and enjoyed every part of this collection.

This was definitely one of the most memorable and enjoyable days we spent in Singapore. I would highly recommend a visit here."
,,Simply the best!,4.0,,Simply the great place to visit and we really enjoyed there for something a bit different other than shopping. Everything in the garden was clean and well ordered. It is very nice and worth it.

,,nice gardens,5.0,,funny going to other places in world and seeing my plants as a tourist attraction... The native tropicals are much more beautiful but this was a switch.
,,Gorgeous and a must-see,5.0,,"We went on our own and it was very hot, but still, a highlight for the four of us. The gardens are free although there is a small fee for the Orchid Gardens. Both are well worth the visit. The (free) gardens are lovely and well-maintained. The orchids were amazing! There were so many varieties, one more beautiful than the other. If not for the heat, I could have stayed much longer than the 2.5 hours we did. I would absolutely come here again!!

On the day we visited there was a free tour in English, but we didn't arrive early enough. A private tour of the gardens would be something to consider if you are short on time. I know we didn't see nearly all the gardens had to offer, but we were very happy to see what we did.

We found this to be much more worthwhile than the domes at Gardens by the Bay.

There is also a nice gift shop if you're interested in that."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"This place is a must visit -especially if the hustle and bustle of Singapore is getting to you. Free to enter, you can just wander and enjoy the gardens. Which are amazing. There is a performance stage in one part of the garden - we were lucky enough to turn up when a concert was being staged so we just sat ourselves down in the grass amphitheater and waited for it to begin. We had the most amazing evening listening to a concert - all free. Thank you very much to the Danish Embassy, Finnair and the Botanic Gardens who arranged the concert a truly memorable evening."
,,Nice Jacob Ballas garden for kids,5.0,,I & my 3-yr old daughter cam in Mar. it's very nice place to go for kids. Should spend there around 2 hours from 5pm (to avoid hotness)
,,Can't Miss Singapore Experience,5.0,,"The orchids alone are well worth your visit. The gardens are beautiful and, much like the rest of Singapore, meticulously cared for. We went with a guide, but the gardens are easily accessible by mass transit & taxi. There are always shows & free entertainment activities going on throughout the year that attract local families and tourists, so be sure to check out the local events calendar. Great place to hang out on the evenings and weekend if you're looking to chill out."
,,You will see nice surprise everywhere!,4.0,,"All of us will have a fruitful and pleasant trip here especially if you are a nature lover. There are a variety of flowers, plants, herbs garden, cactus Garden, etc. We spotted unusual yellow mangosteen fruit. There is every gem in any corner and you are expected to greet with a different spectacular view if only you open our eyes widely. You may also want to track down the location of the real physical tree printed at the back of the Singapore Five Dollars Note. The long and short is I bet that everyone will bring back a little or more of what they want to see in Botanic Garden. So never miss this fabulous UNESCO place!"
,,Always Wonderful,5.0,,On the latest trip to Singapore my sister and I again went to the Botanic Gardens. It is always peaceful to return here and walk among the waterfalls and delightful ginger and other plants. We also enjoyed a break at the cafe near the Orchid Centre.
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,The Botanical Gardens were lovely place to visit. Lots of interesting walkways and places to sit and relax. Worth the time to visit. I took a hop on /hop off bus that stopped there making it easily accessible.

,,Absolutely Stunning,5.0,,"This was the highlight of our trip to Singapore this time. We visited here 30 years ago, and loved it….so had to revisit. We took the MRT; the station is right outside the entrance. Maps are available as well as excellent signposting main it easy to get around. The gardens are superb and like most of wonderful Singapore they meticulously planned and maintained. We arrived quite early; there were joggers and dog walkers around…cant think of a better place for them to be! The plants are amazing and so interesting - EG Toxic plants, medicinal plants…. Then we had to visit the Orchid gardens - a modest entry fee - so well worth it. These spectacular gardens offer magnificent specimens of so many superb orchids and again, the setting is outstanding. The gardens also have lakes (water lillies) , grassed areas, food outlets etc. But lots of shady areas if you need to get out of the sun. Would love to go back again sometime."
,,Waste of time.,2.0,,"UNESCO probably needed to designate a place in Singapore and chose this place but if you have travel to places in Central and South America, do not waste your time here, the only good thing is that it was free."

Many tropical plants are on display, including towering palms; at the other end of the size scale are beautiful little bonsai trees."

However there was not Car Park near the Shaw Performance Stage (Next to the Lake). My mother 81 years old, needed a Wheelchair, as the Car Drop off at Tyersall Road was about 350 metres away.
Next time we will come with a Wheelchair.
The other 2 Car Parks at Nassim Gate and at Napier Road end were even further from the stage."

If you are the types that likes to read about flora and fauna, you will love this place! Do spend some time appreciating the colors and the history of the place. If you are lucky, you would be in time for the Orchid festival. Nothing like a good dose of nature to kick start a beautiful day, replete with colors and a history that you are yet to experience!"

,,Forest bathing in the city,5.0,,"I did a lovely walk from the Entrance of the park at Cluny Road through the Botanical Gardens and coming out on Nassim .
The variety of trees and flowers was amazing . I saw monitor lizards in the pond, fish and ducks and walked under the canopy of some extremely old trees.
The walk was varied and interesting and most of all cool in the heat and humidity of this sticky climate!"
,,Botanical Gardens,4.0,,"Must see place . Advise to visit in the first half of the day , as it was very hot as we went in after 2pm."

A few months we went to a jazz music event there as well. It was hot but everyone love it.

We even found a monitor lizard there!"
,,Nature Therapy,5.0,,Really enjoyed my morning strolls there. Great way to release stress and relax. Won’t realise that there are so many hidden gems until you really explore the whole place over several visits. Nice eateries too.
,,Great to visit likely to get even better,5.0,,"Now on a scale of 1 to 10 I would not say I am an expert on orchid houses of gardens, but on my travels I have been to a bunch, from KL to Sri Lanka. I would say the orchid gardens here are just excellent. It was enhanced by the very humid day we had, but we loved the whole walk through the gardens from the extremely convenient MRT station next to the entrance, past the pond with the most amazing otters catching fish and on to the garden via some great restaurants.

Would I go again hell yes next time, would I recommend it of course."
,,Love Singapore,5.0,,"I loved Singapore, kind of Stepford Wife-ish.....let me explain that.
Meaning everything was orderly, clean, on time. Pedestrians waiting for the walk signal, never heard a siren or saw any police, no homeless people, no trash out of place. It was Disney World.

Very little traffic but that’s because not a lot of cars on the road because of the expense.
You buy a car and then pay 1.5 times the purchase price to register it for ten years. When your car reaches ten years old you must replace it! Singapore likes newer cars on their roads?
Taxis and trains were on time and very inexpensive.

I was only there for two days so didn’t get to do a lot.

Highlight of trip was Botanical
Gardens, especially Orchids."
,,A Must See,5.0,,"Easily accessible by public transport this is truly a beautiful Singapore landmark. We were lucky to visit the world famous Orchid Festival currently on show. In one word, Magnificent! To see everything, allow at least 4-5 hours. There are kiosks and cafes within the gardens, as well as a restaurant. We were advised to have breakfast there, but time did not allow. A photographer’s delight!"
,,Jogging,5.0,,"It's best to jog around 6am in the morning for both weekdays and weekends. The place is very suitable for families and elderly. You can do yoga, to body combat, and many others."

,,Gorgeous! Especially the orchid garden,5.0,,We spent a morning in the Botanic Gardens and found them magnificent. I was especially impressed by the orchid garden. Entry to the botanic gardens is free and there is a small entrance fee for the orchid garden. It is well worth the visit.
,,Beautiful and green,5.0,,Its a nice place to jog or stroll. Right outside thr LRT station as well. The orchid garden is beautiful. Worth a visit.
,,Beautiful plants,5.0,,A nice relaxing way to spend time while enjoying tropical beauty. Staff members were very informative. We had several good photographic opportunities.
,,Wonderful day,5.0,,I am not your typical garden visitor in fact I do not do this much at all but the stroll through from the Orchard MRT to the tanglin road e it is nothing short of spectacular. The orchid area was stunning.....ok it gets a little hot with the humidity but a short walk to orchard road and you get cool down and shop till you drop.....fab day highly recommended.
,,Singapore Botanic Garden,5.0,,Big Nature garden to roam Walk/Jog or picnic. It is free all day. Plenty of natives and non Natives plants and flowers for one to enjoy. Definitely a good place to visit when coming to Singapore.
,,Beautiful oasis,5.0,,"Not far from Orchard Road, the gardens are like entering a new world. Even tjough it is hot now, there are many shady areas. Nice walkng paths. Easy to get to by bus. Very large area. Would suggest splitting it into 2 visits dur to heat. Orchid were the highlight for us. Great signage regarding distances. One of the best things to do in Singapore!"
,,So many different areas to explore,5.0,,Loved it! Take an umbrella for rain or sun. I took a Grab to the entrance nearest to the Orchid garden and then walked my way to the opposite end by the MRT and took that back to my hotel.
,,A beautiful haven of peace & tranquility.,5.0,,"I took a stroll through the Botanic Gardens, starting early enough in the morning to avoid the worst of the heat & humidity, and, having read TripAdvisor reviews, knew to allow myself plenty of time to see everything on offer. That ambition was, frankly, impossible, as there's so much to see here. I spent three hours there and saw maybe a third of the entire place, but it was certainly worth the effort and should be on the list of ""must do"" for every visitor to Singapore."
,,A Gardener dream,5.0,,"One of best displays I have ever seen, done with pride and plenty of thought the display should be seen by everyone not only orchid lovers"
,,Fantastic but....,4.0,,"This is a great place to visit if you are interested in things botanical. The orchid gardens are really nice but it was only half open at time of visit. Which gives an excuse to go back, as if one was needed."
,,Just a getaway...,5.0,,"Take an hour or a 1/2 a day to visit this amazing botanical garden. It has to be one of the very best in the world. Much of it is free to roam around in for hours, have a meal, enjoy flowers, birds, landscapes, and, and brilliant bugs, so colorful they look like jewelry. But do take a turn (about an hour if you don’t stop to gaze at the amazing colors) around the orchid garden. For seniors it only costs a dollar...."
,,Beautiful tropical gardens,5.0,,"Absolutely incredible tropical gardens thanks to the hard work of all the horticultural workers toiling away in 30+ degree heat. Free entry for visitors (except for Orchid garden area), plenty of toilets and drinking fountains and benches to rest while walking in the heat. Cafes and kiosks are a rip-off so take your own drinks and snacks."
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"This was our third visit to the Botanical Gardens very easy to get here by public transport. This one of the rare places which is free but it does not lessen how amazing, beautiful and well kept this place is. The place is huge and there is a lot of walking involved so be prepared one advise I will give you is try going in the evening or when the weather is pleasant. A lot of people don't know but they have some amazing restaurants and cafes here too plus the Jacob Ballas Children garden which is a lot of fun for the little ones. My children love coming here because of they loads of room to run around play plus the views aren't bad either."
,,Best of the Best,5.0,,"Totally enjoyed the areas we visited in this Botanic Garden, Singapore should be proud on these gardens and their city"
,,Beautiful escape from big city,5.0,,"Sooo magical!!! It’s unreal that this place exists so close to downtown Singapore! Easy to get to via public transport (bus or transit). Highly recommend paying to see the orchid garden (they offer discounts for children, students, and seniors)."
,,Check it out,4.0,,"Singapore gardens is like many gardens found around the world, but it has a tranquillity, a real atmosphere of being a gardens for the people. When we were there kids were flying kites, a wedding party having their photos taken and an ongoing procession of school kids visiting for the day. It also has all the features of a botanical garden with unique plant life and ponds filled with fish and turtles. I would recommend a visit."
,,Morning walk,5.0,,"Recently listed as a world heritage site, it's gardens contain! Matured trees that are many years old. Some old trees are protected by lightning conductors otherwise they would be struck lightnings and destroyed."

 There is friendly n helpful staff at the main entrance if you need some advice."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"We spend a good half day here and would have loved to go back again if we have had the time, as I am sure we only saw about half of the gardens. Lovely to get away from the hussle and bussle of the city."
,,Beautiful Gardens capped off with the best display of Orchids you will ever see,5.0,,A must visit. There is a lot of walking so best to do it early in the morning before the heat hits. The orchid garden was fantastic. Really well laid out and they are currently adding on to the gardens.
,,A wonderful experience in this big city,5.0,,Spent 2 hours walking around to discover the rain forest the national orchid garden - stunning - and all places around. A must when in Singapore. A breathing place.

,,Stunning gardens - an oasis of calm and beauty,5.0,,"If I lived in Singapore the Botanic Gardens would definitely be one of my regular haunts.

,,First UNESCO heritage site for Singapore.,5.0,,"This garden is the first and only tropical botanical garden on the UNESCO’s World Heritage list. Not surprising given that the 160 year old park has come a long way in a young nation. And being the most developed country among its South East Asia neighbours, it really can lay claim to this title. Carefully manicured gardens, towering tropical trees and diverse plant species, water features with swans and other creatures, park benches, sculptures, cafes and restaurants, this park is a haven for the whole family.

,,Fabulous gardens,5.0,,Who knew Singapore housed some of the worlds most unusual plants in some of the most beautiful settings. Never miss this one.
,,Lovely Gardens,5.0,,"This was our second visit to these wonderful gardens, it is easily accessible MRT right at the entrance.
The gardens are free to enter and the orchid gardens are a small fee , well worth paying, when we visited in March there was still some renovations happening so parts were not open to the public, the notice did say it would be finished not long after we were there, so they was a little unfortunate, we would definitely visit again if we were ever in Singapore.
You can spend many hours looking and taking photos of all the beautiful flowers.
There’s refreshments available we just had ice lollies, wear a hat as obviously very hot while walking round.
The gift shop was very good with lots of lovely things to buy, we bought a book about the gardens which is lovely.
Definitely recommend visiting if you’re in Singapore."

,,Great exercise place,5.0,,Bontanical gardens has always been a beautiful park. It is such a lovely place to go for a run most of my mornings. It is great to always see the amazing wildlife.
,,Best gardens I've ever visited,5.0,,"What seems like 5 square kilometers of wildlife, water features and tropical vegetation. For free. You can pay 5 dollars to go into the orchid exhibit (which we did) but frankly it feels like you could wander round the main bit for a week and not see everything. A triumph."
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,"The Botantical Gardens are fantastic, lots of lovely plants and flowers. Easy to get to, just catch the train and walk out of the station and you are at an entrance to the Gardens. The paths are wide and very clean. We also visited the National Orchard Garden which was amazing, so many Orchids. They must have every Orchid there is, the colours and structure of the Orchids are just beautiful. A must visit if you are in Singapore."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Awesome place to see the trees and flowers. Take a long walk and enjoy the orchids. Try to avoid the hot periods and spray for insects.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Beautiful place to visit, we did it as part of a tour so probably didn't have enough time, you need at least half a day. If you want to enter the Orchid Garden this is separate and is an additional charge. Toilets and take away cafe also available."
,,Nice place to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"Singapore is one of only a few major cities that have a rain forest inside their city limits. The city has made the most of this with their Botanic Gardens, and Orchid Garden. It is the only tropical garden to be named a UNESCO site.

A must when in Singapore."
,,Utopian gardens,5.0,,Lovely landscaped gardens adorned with amazing trees and plants. Great to visit in the daytime and illuminated at nighttime.
,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,"A trip to the Singapore Botanic Gardens is well worth the effort. The gardens are fantastic, very large so take plenty of fluids as you will need to re-hydrate regularly. And no visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens would be complete if you did not include the National Orchid Garden as well. The orchid's on display were very beautiful and it was a pleasure to walk through this magic garden."
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"Each time we come to Singapore we make time to stroll around these fantastic gardens. The staff at the entrance are very helpful and give lots of friendly advice.

,,Nice and quiet.,4.0,,Really Nice place for a walk. The garden is very beautiful and it i Nice to Explore the plants and animals.
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,"There is so much to see here. Just one little area can be a world unto itself, for example the Foliage Garden. However, it can be quite confusing to figure out how to get to places even with the maps posted around. It would be helpful to take a few minutes before your visit to get familiar with the gardens and select your preferred areas. Definitely worth the visit."
,,Gorgeous oasis in the city,4.0,,"The gardens are simply stunning. The venue is spacious, lush and extremely well maintained and manicured. Although I can see this location getting quite busy there seemed to be quite a bit of space so you never felt crowded. When we visited it was extremely humid and other than an iceblock its hard to keep cool. Ensure you have water and maybe a fan for comfort."
,,An oasis in a busy city,4.0,,"A wonderful few hours spent wandering round the gardens. So much to see and most places have benches to stop and admire your surroundings for a while. Went to the Orchid garden. Fabulous display of orchids. However, due to building works of large greenhouses, a fair portion of the orchid gardens are blocked off and will be for at least a year. Still a great place to visit."
,,Breathtaking place,5.0,,"I'm in love with nature and trees, so this place was just a dream to me. I've almost cried, it's soooo magical. I recommend going early in the morning, less people, more spiritual time in the green."
,,So lush,5.0,,This place is huge and lush but unfortunately we couldn't really appreciate it with the humidity just too high.
,,World Heritage Garden,5.0,,"Botanical Gardens is a good place for family visits as well as couples. Big open places available for children and teens to have activities and plenty of plants and flowers to look at. Herbal gardens allow for learning of plants with medicinal properties. The Performance area host band and orchestra performances regularly and schedules are available on website.

There is a children's garden at one end of the Botanical Garden that houses different landscaping and lots of educational post about plants and nature.

The orchid garden is well worth a visit as it houses many types of beautiful and rare orchids with many named after famous pernalites who ahev visited Singapore.

Fans of the game Pokemon Go will love the many pokestops and gym and can be seen mixed with visitors, regular park users at different times of the day."
,,A Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"Really hard to know what to recommend to people who are heading to Singapore. We were lucky to be there for nearly two weeks and could do loads of things, but still not everything!!! You will find loads to do, but four recommendations, which we loved.

**1. Raffles Hotel Long Bar for Singapore Slings - we had three on our first visit, which wrote the rest of the day off. We did two on the second visit!!!! Expensive, but you can't do Singapore without one. Long Bar is the only thing open at the moment. Hotel re-opens in full, after renovations, in August.

**2. Chinatown lovely for a wander and food - we went daytime and lunchtime and we enjoyed as Food Stalls - cheap and wonderful food - S$8.00 for Duck set meal. Most of shops/stalls sell nonesense, but I got some shirts and it is worth hunting around. Couple of interesting Temples to visit.

**3. Little India for a wander and Food - we did this in the evening and it was a fun time, bustling place. Loads of places to eat and the amazing Mustafa Shopping Mall. It sells everything and is open 24-7. It seems it is where everyone {locals} shop. Check outs are as mad as Primark on speed!!!

**4. The Botanic Gardens - the original and BEST one, a short Metro ride out of City, but only a couple of stops. National Orchid Gardens, within the Botanic Gardens, are also a stunning place. S$5.00. Main Botanic Gardens are free!!!!!!

If time allows ……

5. Gardens by the Bay - the two Domes - Cloud Forest & Flower Dome are great. Floral Fantasy is a bit tacky, but if you buy an all inclusive ticket there is a 4D Show which is a bit of silly fun.

Other Tips ….

A. Tourist Metro/Bus Tickets can be bought for 1, 2 or 3 Days, from main Metro Stations, but not all. We got ours from Chinatown and City Hall. Metro is quick, clean and efficient. These are stations easy to find that have ticket offices.
Orchard
City Hall
Raffles Place
Bayfront
Harbourfront
Chinatown
There is a S$10.00 deposit for your Tourist Travel Card and 3 Days Travel was S$20.00. You hand in your card at the end of your stay and get S$10.00 back.

B. Wine is expensive in Hotels. We paid between S$53.00-$115.00, but in 7-11 Stores it is around S$22.00 for a decent bottle. So we sometimes bought a bottle for our Hotel Room if relaxing in the evening. Red Wine often comes chilled, but it worked for us.

C. Taxis are cheap for City trips, S$6.00-S$8.00, particularly between Hotels and main Metro Stations, which is easiest way to grab one. There are Hotels, major ones, everywhere.

D. I know people will find the Historical side of Singapore interesting. We didn’t do a lot of this. Fort Canning was having a facelift and we only did a little of the Colonial District. If on Sentosa, Fort Siliso is worth a visit for a little insight into Singapore during World War II"
,,Botanical garden,3.0,,"Nice place to visit. Lots of variety of plants, trees, shrub and many many more. Visiting here is perfectly fine in humid hot weather."
,,Amazing grounds and experience,5.0,,"We spent a wonderful day at the gardens. It is such a peaceful and calm place. The orchid garden is well worth the entry and just lovely to see. We had planned to stay for 3 hours, but ended up staying 5 hours, there is a lot of walking involved."
,,Beautiful classic gardens,5.0,,I live in SG and the botanic gardens is my go to place to chillax.. it’s a very traditional botanic garden focusing of natural landscapes vs the new wave Architecture/structural and man made structural elements of Marina Bay Gardens.. I like classic .. I find it to be more relaxing and with many more cool/low-temp places
,,Beautiful and serene,5.0,,"I visited the Botanic Gardens when I was a little girl. It was wonderful to go back. It felt very familiar and in many ways has not changed!

The gardens are gorgeous. Such a serene and peaceful place to visit. It’s a real oasis away from the city. Easy to get there and completely free!

The gardens are pretty vast and there are lots of places to explore. There are some quite defined trails to follow so it’s easy to work out what to explore and how.

The orchid gardens do have a fee to enter. It’s only SG$5 and well worth it. The orchids are stunningly beautiful.

Swan Lake is lovely and you can walk around and see the fish and turtles. And try and spot the otters!

Simply gorgeous. Definitely should be on the list when travelling to or through Singapore."
,,Glorious and a must do.,5.0,,"An oasis in the busy city, free to visit, a pleasure to wander round, places to sit and chill, get a coffee or watch nature. The National Orchid Gardens only cost $5 and were well worth the modest entrance charge. Easily reached by the MTR."

,,Review of Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"If you are crazy about flowers and gardens, as I am, an afternoon spent in the exquisite Singapore botanical gardens is an excellent way to spend a balmy afternoon. The garden is huge, spanning 5km, so we focused on seeing the orchard garden and the ginger garden. This is a world class spot, it would be easy to spend hours here picnicking and walking around. It is cool and shady throughout it but you will still need a hat and sunscreen.Don’t miss the waterfall cave outside the ginger garden."
,,A getaway from Singapore's cityscape!,5.0,,"A wonderful place for a picnic or simply to lounge about in the sounds and smells of the nature. From grass slopes, to a renown garden of orchid collection and eco-trails through the tropical rainforest...this UNESCO heritage site is also home to native wildlife such as plantain squirrels, monitor lizards, oriental pied hornbills and often visited by a group of smooth-coated otters! Do wear light and comfy clothings, the humidity in the Lion City is real!"

,,A most perfect garden,5.0,,"We visited in May. It was humid and 34 degrees. I have never been so astounded by gardens as these. We spent 4 hours there and only saw half. I was overwhelmed by the utterly beautiful sculptures. Absolutely stunning. The orchid garden was beautiful but the space and the trees astounding. The cafe was lovely and we had a delicious cardamon milk. The price was cheap and the service excellent.
In a busy hot city this is an oasis of calm and absolute beauty."
,,Definitely worth it,5.0,,"It will be hot and sticky and you’ll be damp in the forests but it’s such a magically magnificent place you have to visit. We did it all in about 2 to 3 hours with a 4yr old. Plenty of place to eat at on the way if walking from orchard road way. The gardens are beautiful and very peaceful- it’s definitely a spiritual place and you’ll feel the stresses of life melt away as you wander around. Some absolutely spectacular specimens of humongous old trees and the water features are like something out of a fairy book. Loads of fish, friendly wild chickens and chipmunk type things. They also had signs of beware of otters ... well there was a lot of fish!!"

,,Great experience,5.0,,"We loved the Bot gardens , on the day we visited there were very few people there and the varied plant areas and open space was wonderful The swan lake was scary but awesome with snapping fish and some sort of cruising creature. We then went to Dempsy just up the road and enjoyed local prawns for lunch. we taxied back to our hotel as we were flying out later in the day. to our surprise the taxi was cheaper and more enjoyable than the MRT. recommend"
,,Exploring Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Brilliant beautiful place with so many birds amidst the gardens. To see it all could take at least 5 days. Relaxing, safe, plenty of shelters to sit in and watch all around.
I wish there was a shop in the Gardens to purchase high quality Botanic Gardens-related goods...Polo shirts? T-shirts? Bird art? Plant art?"
,,Walk on the greenside,4.0,,"Always refreshing to get away from asphalt and concrete a little and go scooting through green nooks and crannies, contemplating some of the big old trees that have seen it all change around them..."

,,Singapore Botanic Garden,4.0,,Very nice place to visit and location was convenient which can be accessible by public transport and a Train station was nearby at the entrance. Suggest to have at least a half day tour to explore this unique heritage garden.
,,Stunning gardens - one of the best,5.0,,"Thsi is an absolute must for anyone that loves flowers, gardens or just some space to enjoy the beautiful surrounds that the Botanical gardens offer. It was hot so take a hat, sunscreen, water. Good walking shoes required too."
,,Ok Gardens,3.0,,"The Gardens were ok.
It was easy to get to with the MRT just go Botanic Gardens stop and it takes you to the park enterance. Sadley not a lot of food choices around the gardens. I went near lunch time and hoped there be shops in the street at the enterance there weren't many.
Theres a $5 entry fee for Orchard Gardens which I refused to pay.
The Garden's were nice and there were different areas with different themes.
With the humidity and heat and the amount of walking more water taps would have been beneficial. There are maps and customer service people around the park. Other wise well maintained gardens worth the visit."
,,Invigorating,5.0,,"Singapore Botanical Gardens is heritage site yet it is very easy to get to and situated near Orchard Road. It is versatile and vibrant with many different groups walking and practising tai ch Chi gong and yoga in different corners of the garden
The gardens and areas are maintained very well and it is always a pleasure to just hop onto the subway the bus or grab there for a quick invigorating visit"
,,Fantastic garden,5.0,,"Learned about the garden a few years back and finally got a chance to visit on an unexpected raining day! The garden is spacious with over 60,000 plants to make a nature lovers paradise. My friend and I were very lucky to accidentally met a staff as we first walked in that he is also from Taiwan. He gave us a breadth of history about this first UNESCO heritage site in the country and took us to the National Orchid Garden which you need to buy another ticket to get in. The garden is not big but got a plenty of beautiful orchids with variety."
,,Good vibe.,5.0,,"If you need to relax and maybe enjoy some interesting concert this is the place. All well managed and organised to allow a good vibe experience. Keep your time to enjoy the amazing botanical selection and check the date for the chance to complete the experience with a bit of live music. Highly recommended a mosquitoes repellent, possibly no chemical, a citronella based is good enough, and a snack refreshing basket for thee pic nic."
,,A wonderful garden of tranquility,5.0,,"A very beautiful garden superbly maintained with a calm and serene environment
Amazing trees and plants all clearly titled with lovely curated garden paths amidst lakes n water falls in the frindge of a bustling city.
Kudos to the Singapore government for maintaining this lovely and charming UNESCo site, a true tribute to the garden city."
,,Beautiful Place for a Morning Walk,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are special. It is a beautiful place for a great walk which I would recommend in the morning. The highlight location is the Orchid Gardens which has a small admission charge (the main Gardens are free). Hundreds of different flowers and orchids to enjoy and photograph. It is an easy Grab ride from your hotel and well worth a few hours of your trip.
,,Peaceful oasis,5.0,,Beautiful botanic gardens a short walk away from the shopping metropolis of orchard road. It is a large gardens with many sections. The best thing to do is bring a picnic and spend a few hours strolling around.
,,Unremarkable. Extremely hot during the day.,2.0,,I have seen LOTS of botanic gardens. They are generally lush and packed with vegetation. This place sparce by comparison. Its a big park. It was so hot we couldn't reach the orchid thing. We had to turn back and go inside the subway to cool off.
,,Nature on display,5.0,,"These gardens are vast and varied, including rainforest, bonsai, ethnobotany, healing, evolution, heritage gardens, and of course, the National Orchid Garden. We spent an entire day wandering through them. Well worth a visit."
,,UNESCO world heritage site gardens-highly recommended,5.0,,"These gardens were amazing. We could have easily spent all day here rather than 3 hours. They have their own MRT station so easily accessed. Admission is free which is great as Spingapore is a comparatively expensive city. The gardens are well laid out and informative with area dedicated to different topical species. On a Monday afternoon they were quiet and uncrowded with lots of shade. There would be lots to do with children as there are areas dedicated to learning about the rainforest wth elevated walkways as well as lots to explore. We only saw less than half the gardens on our visit. I would definitely visit again if I was in Singapore
There are cafes and restaurants and also lots of drinks dispensing machines which are not too overpriced."
,,"Lots of birds, lovely plants",5.0,,"Go when it is not a weekend or public holiday, plenty of birds around - which is what we were looking for"
,,Variety a plenty,4.0,,"We spent four hours here, in 33 degrees, so it was really too hot and sweaty to enjoy all that this special site has to offer. Nevertheless, it is a magnificent garden and you could easily spend many more hours here if conditions allowed and you're capable of walking 15+ kilometres."
,,The Garden of the Dream,5.0,,"I have visited this Garden way back in 2008 and again I visited in February 2019. I had all the good memories of this garden so I visited again. It is not possible to cover all the areas of the garden in a single visit but you should inquire about the best sight and cover it in your first visit. The must visit inside the Botanical Garden is the ""National Orchid Garden"". It has all the varieties of of Orchid very beautifully managed. There are lots of attraction like ginger garden, Symphony stage,golden bird cage etc. I found it very convenient to visit here in morning as I landed to the city in the morning and there some time before chek in to the hotel so we utilized our time in visiting this garden. And I think that is the best way to utilize your time if you visit this garden on first day of your visit. I would say this is the must visit place in Singapore if you are there for a week time."
,,Must visit,5.0,,The Botanical gardens are a great way to relax in Singapore. Always enjoy a nice walk at the park. Must visit...
,,Beautiful park,5.0,,"Entry to the park is free. Easily accessible by MRT. The grounds are very well maintained, wonderful to get away from the hustle and bustle of the City and take a leisurely walk and get back to nature. Plenty of places to grab a bite to eat, a coffee or a refreshing drink and relax. Very nicely decorated during Christmas time. If you are lucky, you can catch a free concert, the acoustics are stunning!"
,,Must visit,5.0,,The botanic gardens are huge and have many areas to see. Allow plenty of time. Worth paying extra to go through the Orchid Garden. Simply amazing. Well done.
,,A Horticulturist's Dream!,5.0,,"Walking around these mature and well organised mature gardens is a delightful way to spend a number of hours. Such a peaceful setting in the midst of this large busy city. A good number of information panels are around if you want to read more. The trees, lawns, flowers are lovely and a must if you are visiting this city. Free to enter and easy to get to by subway."
,,Most beautiful gardens,5.0,,"This garden is stunning, a must see in Singapore!!! The variety and color of orchids is beautiful. The garden is so beautifully manicured and not one piece of paper on the ground."
,,Botanic Gardens Singapore,5.0,,Wonderful expanse of trees and plants in a calm and tranquil setting. Take your time wandering through the sculptured paths admiring the exotic fauna.
,,An outstanding Botanic Garden,5.0,,You can easily spend a full day here slowly making your way around the gardens. With the Downtown line Botanic gardens right at one of the entrances it was easy to access. We also saw a concert at the Shaw stage in the grounds in the evening. If you are in Singapore and need to get the kids to let off steam this place has large perfectly manicured grassed areas for them to run around in. We visited on a Sunday and there were lots of people around but it didn't feel crowded. Lots of dog walkers too so it's a popular spot for locals and visitors.
,,"Incredible and amazing, its a must",5.0,,"If you visit Singapore, a beautiful city, incredible clean and nice, do not miss the botanic gardens, incredible experience, , most of all, if you do decide to visit an Asian country, visit Singapore, the best experience I've had, regarding everything, cleanliness, nice people, incredible malls, great food, great everything."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Such a beautiful place to visit, the lake is a treat watching all the turtles & dragon like creatures swimming around, the Symphony Stage is in a great setting & I can imagine being swept away sitting on the grass banks listening to a performance.

A must visit for any traveler regardless of how many botanical gardens you’ve been to, pay the extra $5 & go to the orchid enclosure, it’s enchanting, please note there is renovation work in this area so there is limited access but still worth seeing."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"A huge and botanically diverse park. Wonderful collections, including the orchid garden. Give yourself a day out. Loads of places to get refreshments and plenty of toilets. MRT station on the doorstep, although transport is difficult at the southern end."
,,Peace and quiet,5.0,,"If you wish to escape the stone jungle and shopping malls of Singapore for a while, the botanical garden is a wonderful oasis. Well designed, wonderful and well-marked paths, very diverse and interesting plants and vegetation. There is plenty of walking one can do, find peace and quiet and find lots of charming spots to sit down and relax. We loved it; beautiful parc."
,,Garden of Eden a great place to Jog,5.0,,"One of the best kept Garden in the world . That aside , it is a great place for a jog or a walk but do that in the morning or late afternoon. You could run/walk from 2 km to 10km within the Garden . I would suggest Gerri g off at the Botanical Bukit Timah station . You are literary at the entrance of the garden . Jog towards Tanglin Gate and back .. jogging thru shaded trees , orchid gardens , lakes and even a food court , where if you do wish , enjoy your breakfast before heading back . A lovely lovely experience :"
,,"Volunteer helpers at gate delightful - beautiful park, free entry",5.0,,"The standout for us was the lovely volunteers waiting to help arrivals at the main gate. A gentleman approached us and asked us if we wanted to see the Orchid Garden (as all foreigners presumably do). He told us how to get there and suggested a slightly longer path which would take us past a few garden highlights. In a city where few attraction staff seem happy with their jobs and do nothing to welcome visitors, these volunteers were a standout. We saw Wild Jungle Fowl (un-domesticated chickens), squirrels and a water monitor lizard while walking in the gardens. Only wish we had spent longer, these are magnificent gardens and worthy of four hours or more of your time.Only $5 for Orchid Garden, rest of this magnificent park is free."
,,A day adventure,5.0,,Beautifully manicured and superbly well kept. Extensive and varied walks and environments. From bonsai to rainforest. They are very extensive and in the two hours available to us we were unable to see more than half of the area yet thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Home to the magnificent Orchid Garden which at five dollars is a bargain and was absolutely superb and not to be missed.
,,Best outdoor gardens in the east,5.0,,Impeccably kept and maintained these gardens cover a very large area and provide an oasis in the city. Interesting contrast to the wonderful Gardens by the Bay. Some very old trees and a plethora of shrubs including water plants in beautifully located ponds. The winding pathways take you to lovely niches and large shady expanses suitable for picnics
,,Super gardens a must to visit,5.0,,What a super attraction breathtaking gardens with beautiful orchids of many different colours and sizes. A pleasure to walk through these wonderful gardens.
,,Quiet Sunday stroll,4.0,,Lovely way to spend a weekend afternoon away from the city. Mrt station at the main gate. Different landscapes within its grounds make for great picnic spots. Enjoy!
,,Garden in a City. A UNESCO site,5.0,,A UNESCO world heritage site located near to busy shopping belt at Orchard Road. Not to be missed if you are visiting Singapore. There are a variety of floral and fauna in this sprawling garden in the city fringes. The Orchid Garden is a must see if one is a flower enthusiast.
,,Little picnic 🧺,5.0,,"We visited Singapore botanic gardens and were mesmerised by its beauty. It’s a very huge botanic garden and there is lot to see but we decided to make a picnic out of this place. You can carry your drinks and some food and relax here in the middle of the nature.

You can see lot of lakes in the botanic garden as well as different variety of animals!
Enjoy your picnic here!"

The Orchid house is the best in the world , these delicate and beautiful plants so
Many varieties, the pretty colours and they all look so human with their individual patterns and markings .

Serene and peaceful , a beautiful lake with various birds .

The lily ponds are pretty .

,,Very Exotic Gardens - a must visit,4.0,,"We enjoyed our time at the Botanical Gardens it is one of the best we have been to. Very well kept and directions to get about are quite clear. There are good toilet and food and beverage services within the park. $5 to enter the Orchid Gardens , @1 for over 60s. If it is a rainy day better carry an umbrella, to fully utilise your time there. MRT station is just next to the Gardens."
,,An oasis of calm in the city.,4.0,,"A beautiful place to visit which allows you to glimpse the natural forest and plants of the area. Allow half a day and do go into the Orchid collection, there is a small charge for this , but entry into the main area is free."
,,An Oasis Within the City,5.0,,"Easily accessed via both MRT underground and buses, the UNESCO listed Botanic Gardens are a must see on any visitor’s list to Singapore. Its variety of plants and their maturity is stunning , as is the beauty of the way they are arranged throughout the Gardens. There are areas dedicated to orchids, bamboo, fruit and nut trees, as well as a ginger garden and a children’s garden and palm valley. The SBG also contains a Library of Botany and Horticulture and much more - it is well worth the visit and provides a wonderful break from the city."
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"The most beautiful garden ever, would recommend everyone to see the gardens during the day and night."
,,"Beautiful Gardens, Huge Place!",4.0,,"Me and my Mom, who was visiting Singapore for her first time, visited the Botanic Gardens in March. We took the Bus stopping outside Gleneagles Hospital at the South entrance of the Gardens and made our way up, trying to pass by as many of the Sights as possible. No bikes or scooters allowed, so you'll need to wear comfy shoes, especially if going from South to the North, as there was a bit of an uphill gradient. Bring your own water and snacks, or eat before you go, as all drinks and food at the restaurants inside are very overpriced. If you want an easier walk get the MRT in and walk North to South. Orchid Gardens are definitely worth the 5$! Loved the waterfall near the Ginger Garden too!!"
,,Not much of interest,3.0,,Kindly visit only if you plan or interested in some research and just roaming in the gardens. Nothing much to see.
,,Well Worth a Visit,5.0,,These gardens are well worth the visit. Beautifully laid out displays of many plants with an emphasis on orchids. Certainly worth a visit.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Loved the botanical gardens! The different subparts were awesome and very fluent. My favourites were the national orchad garden and the foliage garden.
,,Such large and lush gardens,4.0,,Families and groups of friends are seen lounging on the vast lawns with picnics. A large lake features swans and other birds. It's so large that you can easily get turned around so grab a map when you are entering. The gardens don't require an entrance fee but the Orchid Garden does charge a small entrance fee.
,,Healing energy,5.0,,"We honestly preferred these gardens to Gardens By the Bay. Much less contrived, more natural and expansive."
,,"I cannot believe it’s FREE!! Only 5 Singapore dollars for Orchid garden, a must see!!",5.0,,"I LOVED this place!!! I highly recommend a visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. I visited on my last day but if I had more time I would have gone back for sure. I spent about four hours leisurely strolling through the Orchid garden first because they are my favorite then wandered through some of the rest. I didn’t find it too crowded at all. I did come across a couple school groups and I thought it was quite hot and humid but it’s Singapore, and it’s outside! It was so lovely and peaceful to be strolling through lush foliage seeing waterfalls, roosters, sculptures and beautiful flowers everywhere. There are cafes strategically placed and convenient bathrooms that are very clean. The staff was very professional, helpful and friendly. I was able to get a cab back to my hotel no problem at all without a wait. I am hoping I am fortunate enough to return to Singapore one day in the future for a visit and if I do, Singapore Botanic Garden would be on top of my list to visit again."
,,"Best ""Attraction"" in Singapore",5.0,,"Singapore boasts of a variety of attractions for tourists, with most of them either completely (like Universal, sea aquarium, flyer) or partially (like Gardens By the Bay) ""built"". Botanic Gardens stands apart in this aspect, it feels very natural. A variety of trees of various species have been cultivated and maintained. This place offers respite from an otherwise bustling city.

When you enter the botanic gardens, the staff welcomes you and offer to provide all the information. While they do that, you can't help but notice their passion.

Top gardens (in the order in which I liked):
1. Rainforest
2. Orchid gardens
3. Evolution garden
4. Jacob Ballas children park
5. Learming forest

Please allow yourself at least 5 hours to completely cover the garden."
,,Amazing Orchids,5.0,,"Though we know well orchids, we were like seeing them for the very 1st time. A nice place, very well maintained with an amazing varietey of orchids and other tropical plants. We keep good memories of our visit."
,,Hot mornings but beautiful gardens,4.0,,"There is a lot of various flora and fauna to see here! Not to mention a lot of things have information printed in front of them so that you know what you're looking at and it's importance.

It was extremely hot the day I visited (I ended up walking from one end of the gardens to the other) so make sure to stay hydrated, bring a fan/hat, sunbrella and sunscreen!
Also take a map and don't be afraid to ask for directions!

I visited their orchids too but at the time it was midday and extremely hot and I did not want to be in the heat any longer so I didn't pay the admission ticket to go instead. Though since it was March holiday, Singapore residents and PRs got free admission which is pretty awesome way to promote the exhibit. Besides, there were a good amount of orchids on display in front of the ""National Orchid"" sign in front of the exhibit so I don't think I missed out on too much.

There's also an path (before the bonsai trees garden) that has a bunch of the Miss Joaquim flowers growing!"
,,Great day spent,4.0,,"Good day here despite the rain rattling down this afternoon. An excellent place to visit especially as it free entrance. They do ask for a donation if possible.

Good signage on the plants. Plenty to look at and lots of walking to be done. Some nice sculptures in the gardens too.

Didn't make the Orchids but what we did see we enjoyed very much.

Good cafes on site and a nice little souvenir shop.

We were disappointed that the healing garden is closed on a Tuesday so we didn't see that.

We noticed that there is some renovation going on and looks like there will be a new orchid house which will help especially when there is inclement weather."
,,The best Orchid Garden in the world?,5.0,,Really enjoyed my trip to the botanics and in particular the orchid garden which for $5 was well worth it.
,,Wonderful gardens,5.0,,"A beautiful place to visit....magnificent trees, interesting landscape and stunning orchids. A haven from the busy city which was a pleasure to explore."
,,Another Must See,4.0,,You might need to limit the areas you plan to visit because it is a large site and this could includ using the good quality catering on site
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The Singapore Botanical Gardens is one of the best gardens we have seen in our travels. It is huge with so many types of orchIds that are unbelievable. It is a must-see if you go to Singapore.
,,Free! Stroll leisurely !,5.0,,"One of my favorite recommendations to overseas friends. I love nature and plants. This place is just so awesome. You stroll at your own pace. Lots of space and greenery. I especially love the very old trees which can be a few hundred years old. There are also many varieties of orchids here. Some weekends, there are performances and concerts held here. You can bring picnic food and mat and enjoy the lovely evening on the lawn."
,,"""2nd Time Around""",5.0,,"This was our second visit to the beautiful Botanical gardens which allowed us to see things we miss the first time round. The lake, the tropical forest and the wonderful Orchid gardens are a must to see. Entry to the Orchid gardens for adults was $5.0 and for Seniors concession $1.00. The gardens offer a unique photo opportunity if you love nature and all it's fantastic collection of plants and flowers. Highly recommend."
,,Humid... but interesting,4.0,,"If you are a plant geek and usually enjoy a nice stroll through the botanical gardens, then these are certainly worth a visit, especially the reconstructed wetlands that have been built as an educational garden.
If you don’t like plants, don’t go, it’s too hot"
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"Visited while in Singapore this past week, and it was beautiful! It was a bit crowded, but we enjoyed all the plant varieties, and the view from the top. A must see for sure!"
,,"Beautiful Gardens, with free entry",5.0,,"These must be one of the best botanic gardens in the world (if not the best). Plenty of variety and whilst they do get many visitors they are large and you can find yourself away from others in many parts of the gardens. The addition of walkways, tower and other facilities plus toilets and somewhere to get a meal or drink are a major improvement."
,,Nice spot away from the hustle of town,4.0,,Located quite close to the CBD this is a great little spot to visit. Take mosquito repellant so you can go into the wetland area without any worry. A good hour to see it all
,,Orchid garden is a paradise,5.0,,"You can spend here full day, relaxing, walking surrounded with beautiful plants. Nice way to chill and disconnect from daily rush"
,,Beautiful place to see and walk through,5.0,,these gardens are laid out really nice and the walk ways are easy to navigate as well. I gave it a 5 even though I wish there were more markings to show what you are seeing.
,,A wonderful garden experience,5.0,,"Singapore’s Botanic Garden is an experience not to be missed. We visit every time we are in Singapore. It’s easy to get to on the MRT as there is a dedicated station on the north gate of the garden. Getting in is simple - walk through the gate. It’s free. There is also a gate (the main gate for the garden) on the south side of the garden on Napier Road. Either gate is a good place to start. Inside the garden is a self-contained orchid garden that has a dedicated entry building that also contains a well appointed gift shop. There is a small charge for the orchid garden. The orchid garden has hundreds of varieties of orchids. You should plan at least 30-45 minutes to see the orchids. Nearby the entry to the orchid garden is a restaurant and a small snack/drink shop. Finally, the garden includes several lakes inhabited by turtles, swans (including a few black swans from Australia) and some aquatic iguanas. Plan a visit."
,,Nature in the Midst of the City,4.0,,"We had a wonderful experience walking around the gardens on our trip to Singapore. It was so easy to get there on the train from our hotel area, and so worth it! We were there on a Monday, so the children's area was closed, but traveling as a couple, that wasn't much of a bother. We especially loved seeing the turtles and other wildlife that reside in the gardens. Each area is unique and interesting, well maintained and cared for. It's a large park, so there's a lot to see. Wear comfortable walking shoes, and a hat or sunglasses! Would highly recommend a visit!"
,,A World Heritage Site,5.0,,"I was so impressed to see that a gorgeous garden, Singapore Botanic Garden is a World Heritage Site. Well deserved. The orchid garden is outstanding. Nice walks within the huge park."
,,Signage and Maps,4.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens must be one of the best in the world. It has a very large variety of plants and trees in magnificent well maintained area. however, the maps supplied and the actual signage leave a lot to be desired. We had to ask maintenance staff frequently the way to reach an area we wished to see. Although, there are many sign posts, frequently we ended up not where we intended.

On the positive side, the gardens have some very good restaurants and access is reasonable priced by Taxi or MRT"
,,Amazing !,5.0,,"Well worth a visit - goose bump moments when you go to the evening light show - even enjoyed by my 8 and 13 year olds.

Great photo opportunity with the Marina Bay Sands in the background.

Tip- be prepared to queue for taxis afterwards it takes a while!"
,,Magic,5.0,,"Spent nearly 5 hours walking around Botanic Gardens and every minute was worth it.
This garden is more of a reunion of different gardens, from rain forest to educational gardens, not forgetting the Orchid garden, with different atmospheres and thousands of plants and amazing trees.
A very interesting and relaxing vist in the green.
A must see while in Singapore."
,,Close to nature,5.0,,"The gorgeous Garden offers a comfortable place to exercise, relax and enjoy the lush greenery. You can be close to nature at the tree top and forest trails or stroll around the ponds to admire the swans and other creatures. The orchid enclosure displays beautiful blooms all year round. The cafes have a simple but good variety of food and drinks. And you pets are welcome!"
,,As you exit the air conditioned Metro you are suddenly in this magnificent Garden.,5.0,,It is free to wander round this wonderful area. There are coffee shops and cafes occasionally but it’s the array of trees and plants. At home in UK we have most of these plants indoors and cosseted.
,,UNESCO site greenery,5.0,,"Singapore botanic garden has been around for a while. Only in recent years did she attain the Unesco status.

Many well maintained fauna and flora. There is even a swan lake concert zone area which does have some events once in a while.

Due to hot and humid weather all year round, the tall trees provide much needed shade. It’s suitable for family picnics and just sitting down. Public transport is very near the park and Orchard shopping area is just a few bustops away."
,,Tropical Paradise,4.0,,"These are very beautiful gardens, with well maintained wide pathways, where everything is very well maintained and lush. My only criticism would be the lack of anywhere decent to stop for a coffee or lunch, and this garden deserves the time it takes to explore it properly."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,One of my favorites among all the botanical gardens I have visited. This garden is definitely worth the price.
,,Unsuitable for wheelchairs,1.0,,"These gardens are beautiful but if you are pushing a wheelchair and want to visit the orchid garden, just forget it.

We followed the disabled signs painted on the ground and they led to steep stairs every time! I was so upset because we had to get my son out of his chair and get him down the stairs, and then come back for the chair. It was a nightmare. This happened 3 times with 3 different signs.

Also, there is a reduced fee for pensioners, for which I am grateful, but nothing for disabled people. This was also disappointing.

Somebody needs to sort out those signs so that no one else has the same problem that we had today."
,,Nice place to relax,5.0,,Beautiful gardens with so many different walks . Worth paying the small fee to go inside the orchid garden. Take water with you. Easy to get to via the MRT right to the entrance. Lovely areas for a picnic. Shops and restaurants around the gardens.
,,DON'T MISS THIS PLACE,5.0,,I often visit the Singapore botanic garden even during short stay in this city garden.. I've been doing it for over 35 years and its Always a renewed pleasure. A sample of tropical biodiversity.
,,A Huge Botanic Garden,4.0,,Prepare to spend at least 3-4 hours walking. It is a huge place...recommend that you also enter the orchids section.... It is probably the highlight of the botanic garden. It is a lovely place to bring your family to.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A lovely peaceful walk with lovely natural wild life and surroundings. Worth a trip only 15 minutes walk from the hotel in the city.
,,Simply beautiful and fulfilling if you come with some knowledge of botanics,5.0,,"I have visited the botanic gardens since a child and have been doing so on and off over the years. It started with the knowledge of the first rubber trees in the region were grown in SBG. So, I went in search of the rubber tree that was still standing there. That was many years ago. Most of my visits since then were for events organised in Botanic Gardens by various organisations or parties. Each time I visit, I discover something new. During my most recent visit, I have the privilege to be toured by my ex-student, now a horticulturist at the SBG. Armed with slightly more knowledge of local plants, the visit was more meaningful than any of my earlier visits. Only with some knowledge will one appreciate the effort the staff have put to grow some of these plants. If you are a resident, have sufficient spare time in your hands and love plants, get the handbook of local plants in the public library before you start exploring the botanic gardens. It is therapeutic. Lol.

I need to come back and visit the children's garden before my kids are too old or they won't let you in. Otherwise, I will have to borrow some kids from family and friends. ;)"
,,A must not missed walk when in Singapore.,4.0,,"One of my favourite places, for personal retreat or to bring friends visiting Singapore. It gets better everytime I visit. Not to be missed is the orchid enclosure and herbal garden. So many places to have beautiful photos, dont miss the iconic gazebo where families, couples must have in their photo albums. Check out for dates where orchestra performs, a lovely time to have a picnic before doing a cool walk in the evening."
,,My Favorite for an Early Morning Walk,5.0,,"Typically I try to stay in a hotel close to The Botanic Gardens because I love walking here in the early morning. Always plenty of flora and fauna to see, and this time took some amazing photos of red dragon-flys near one of the lakes. I also ventured along the Rain Forest Walk which I'd not previously visited ...cool and atmospheric. A little humid but still thoroughly enjoyable."

,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Great place to visit away from them in tourist spots but still gets busy. Fantastic Asian collection of plants and trees. The Orchid varieties are amazing. It's a very large garden so allow plenty of time.
,,A lovley peaceful place to visit and easily accessible by MRT,5.0,,"The botanical gardens is a must see for any visitor to Singapore, even for a local it is a lovely day out. The gardens are full of colour, birdlife and even a pond of turtles. There is a medicine garden for those that want to learn about early medicinal treatments. If you not an avid green finger the gardens are full of interesting history of early life in Singapore.
The orchid garden is a beautiful display of every imaginable orchid on the planet, I recommend the $10 entry fee to walk through this very large neverending display of orchids.

Take a picnic lunch or stop for a great coffee at one of the Cluny Court cafes opposite the Botanical Gardens MRT"
,,Morning Walk,4.0,,A nice place with lots of greens and open space in this tiny country for the kids to run around freely.
,,Wonderful park in the middle of the city,5.0,,"It’s beautiful and big, and right in the middle of the city. Think Central Park in Manhattan but in tropical weather (can be good or bad!)."

,,The orchids are magnificent.,5.0,,"A beautiful garden, which the locals are clearly in love with. Hours of pleasure. Thoroughly recommend a visit."
,,One of the Best garden,5.0,,Great place to walk at evening . Many trees and plants. Highly recommended . Must go when you are in singapore
,,Singapore Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Such a worthy place to be awarded UNESCO heritage. The place with so naturally planted tree and large and broad fields. Assortment of treea, mythical statues, colonial buildings, modern labs, nice restaurants,totally worth a visit if you like to close to nature in the vicinity of busy shopping district and large embassies.I visited the place many times during my stay in Sinagpore. You need to visit during cool day if you like to do a long walk."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"I love the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Very mature, very exotic, very lovely. Everyone should include them in a trip to Singapore."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Nice walks. Beautiful views. Unbelievable variations of plants and flowers. Just avoid the heavy sun hours as it may discourage you of walking every trail. Each one worth the day visit
,,Orchid-wow,5.0,,We were very impressed with the national orchid garden in Singapore. More varieties than sand on a beach. Beautiful flowers and amazing gardens well laid out.
,,SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDEN,5.0,,"My first impression with regards to a ""botanical garden"" is a place with collection of common flora and fauna. However, when I visited the Singapore Botanical Garden (after 4 times visit in SG), this botanical garden is exceptional. It's not just a garden, it's ""history"" of SG like that of an enclosed museum because every plant species (even the lake) has its own story (as they placed ""trivia"" infos). After you visit this garden, you will appreciate more the government (and the people) of SG how they value their culture, how they appreciate nature, and how they care Mother Earth. This garden is a MUST-VISIT most especially if you want a place to relax while seeing the beauty of nature."
,,Singapore’s Gorgeous Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"One of the world’s most beautiful and tranquil spots for a vigorous walk amid lush greenery. The drought that month had reduced the water in the lakes, which were still a feast for the eyes."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"I used to go as a child with my family as we lived near by.
I return to Singapore from England for Chinese New Year this February and made a point of visiting the gardens. It was my first in over 30 years. So glad I did.
A peaceful, charming place that is so well kept and the orchids garden is absolutely delightful.
I would recommend squeezing in a visit if you are on the island for a couple of days."
,,Global garden,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens has one of the numerous plant collection gathered from all over the world. It’s great place to visit and walk through the well maintained park to enjoy the outdoors, flora and fauna."
,,Gardens with many different landscapes,5.0,,We spent a few hours at the Botanical Gardens and had a great time. There’s no entrance fee except for the Orchid Garden which is a nominal fee. Very beautiful and colorful.
,,A walk in the park,4.0,,"Botanic Garden is an old park in the city, probably the only green lungs near the shopping belt. Think Central Park in NYC, but much smaller.

Just about every plant is well kept. But you know it's not natural. Still it's more pleasing to the eye than grey concrete outside the park boundaries.

Suitable for all ages."
,,Lovely Day,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed our day at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The weather was extremely hot and humid but there was plenty of shade and the grounds were beautiful. The Orchid garden is an additional fee but very reasonable and quite a discount for seniors. The orchids were magnificent. Every color imaginable. And so beautifully displayed. The staff was very helpful. Taxi was easily accessible. If only going to the orchid garden you can enter nearby. Nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city
,,A slice of heaven in city,5.0,,"Grew up enjoying this park and it’s still a gem .. gets better with age as the trees loom tall and large, foliage with all shades of green and the beautiful scented air of nature and flowers... a beautiful feeling. Try it at sunrise or sunset... magical!"
,,Very nice location,5.0,,"A lot of nice trees and flowers in a very nice place. And i recommend the Halia restaurant, good food and well placed."
,,Colourful display,5.0,,"The gardens are free to enter and the size of the gardens are huge. There is shade available off & on. The orchid display costs S$5.00 per person, however if 60 & over with a concession card the price is S$1.00 per person. The orchid gardens are large in size with huge variety displaying varied colour. There are a number of cafes to sit and rest in."
,,A Must Visit!,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a lovely, cool escape from the humidity. Entry is free and the gardens are immaculate with many different paths and areas to enjoy.

We walked here every morning and enjoyed seeing the locals doing Tai Chi, walking their dogs and enjoying the location."
,,"Great place to enjoy nature, and sometimes music",5.0,,"I love to visit Botanic Gardens casually anytime for walk, to bring children, to exercise, to have tea, and sometimes to listen to music.

Why music??
Botanic Gardens has got a big outside concert hall and a lot of musicians come to perform a free concert, including SSO who regularly has concert there.

It’s very nice to listen to live music, brink your own snack and drinks, just chill with your loved ones, in the nature outside!!!

Other than music, it’s a great place to go for jogging, bring children, and just enjoy.

The best part is that it’s free admission!!!"
,,Stunning gardens,5.0,,"We enjoyed a morning in the botanic gardens, the highlight of which was the National Orchid Garden (only $5 each for entry). We got a map from the visitor centre and enjoyed a few hours exploring the various gardens.

We took a taxi back to our hotel from the taxi stand here which was easy to do and we waited no longer than 15 minutes."
,,Orchid garden,5.0,,A visit to the botanic gardens is a must. The $5 it cost to see the orchids is so worth it as they really are amazing and beautiful.
,,A MUST VISIT WHILE IN SINGAPUR,4.0,,This garden was started over 150 years ago and it has been kept in impecable condition. Every plant has been planted in a special order and kept very clean
,,So Green a Place,3.0,,"Now a UNESCO Worlpd Heritage Site, SBG was set up in 1859 by Lawrence Niven, an Englishman. The Garden thus bears the style signature of an English garden.
Over the years SBG has grown in different directions and continued to be a Regional Center for Plant Science Research & Conservation in SE Asia. It's an excellent piece of Urban Jungle.
With over 4 million footfalls every year, SBG is one of the most popular Botanical Gardens in the World."
,,Green Heaven,5.0,,"Great spot to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city! People were doing yoga and chilling on the grass in the “Eco garden”, learning about our earth in the “evolution garden” and I found myself simply lost in paradise by it all. The rainforest was a personal highlight, as were all of the unexpected animals: Turtles, chickens, roosters, squirrels, large beaked birds, lizards, dragonflies and butterflies. All of the gardens show a great abundance of plants and are carfully planned out. Would go back any day!"
,,An Oasis worthy of a few hours!,5.0,,"We loved the orchid garden and wished our guide had allowed us time to visit more gardens. It is peaceful, stunning, and even offers some shade in always hot Singapore. The gift shops were nice and the experience laid back and lovely."
,,"Stunning gardens, a must visit",5.0,,"These gardens are located at the outer end of one of the bus routes (we went on the Big Red Bus), and are completely free to enter with the exception of the Orchid Garden.
Initially we walked around an area with lakes, a raised boardwalk, and a large variety of plant environments which were well signed and documented - and we encountered few people on these walks.
Later we went towards the Orchid Garden and its surrounding food facilities and were suddenly in a area buzzing with people. We paid to go into the Orchid Garden (just a few dollars each) and were staggered at the size of the garden and the range of plants here - well worth the entrance fee.
Beyond this there was a more open area and a rainforest walk,
A superb way to spend half a day, and amazing that it is almost free - this should be on everyone's visit list."
,,Beautiful peaceful gardens,5.0,,"We visited one evening and had a walk in twilight round areas of the gardens, by the lakes and more. The gardens were really big so we really only saw a fraction of them, what we did see was lovely. Just as we were leaving we even saw a large owl sat watching the grasses for a bit to eat."
,,Must do,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing the huge botanical garden. World heritage! You have to visit the orchid garden, absolutely amazing!"
,,BACK TO THE WOODS,5.0,,"A beautifully curated place with tall trees, beautiful flowers, brood of chicken family walking around, many types of birds and especially the pavement that was specially created into the woods. Love the learning forest, walking among the giants etc. In the midst of all the busyness of the city, this is really good cos it helps to destress. You can see photographers trying to take pic of the migrant birds."
,,Orchid Gardens,5.0,,Really nice botanic garden that is a UNESCO site. You could spend half a day here just strolling around the whole place. Orchid garden was the best and is 5 Singapore Dollars. The rest of the park is free with a lot to see.
,,relaxing vacation,5.0,,"The place is very relaxing, you can connect to nature & feel fresh and young while looking to the beautiful flowers of different colors & variations."
,,Superb for Plant and Tree Lovers,5.0,,This place is so large and varied that it will take you multiple sessions to see it all. Plus during the day its very hot and can get fatigued. One recommendation is to come early morning or in the evenings when there are less people and the temperature is right for browsing. A must see if you visit Singapore.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Went here on a city tour of Singapore, lovely place to visit, so much to see, highly recommend especially if you are a gardener."
,,Beautiful park,5.0,,Really large park with a large variety of flora! Once you enter it is clear to understand why it was declared a UNESCO heritage site!
,,Well designed and the orchid garden is a must,4.0,,Very large and extremely well maintained. As a tropical botanical garden it is excellent. The interesting thing though is that there is not many shady areas to sit and admire the garden and considering Singapore is extremely hot and humid we found that difficult for my elderly mother-in-law who joined us the the trip let alone for us.
,,a huge park,5.0,,"a very large park, signage not great though and in the heat it was difficult to do it justice. And we could see heavy rain approaching so we beat a hasty retreat."
,,Biggest and most beautiful city park I've ever seen,4.0,,"I've never been in a city park quite like this - it's clear to see why it is a world heritage site and why Singapore is called the Garden City.
We spent a few hours exploring the garden, and people watching. It is very relaxed here, though it's sad that there doesn't seem to be space for dogs to run around. The price you pay for the orderliness and beauty is that everything is very controlled."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"I imagine many will make the mistake of passing this over for the gardens by the bay, but I found this to be a much more relaxing experience and got sore feet from all the walking I did, enjoyed the huge trees in the rainforest area and saw lots of wildlife."
,,Beautiful (and free!),5.0,,"This place is amazing. Stunning, peaceful and spacious with plenty of resting spots in the heat. It is free to visit although it is definitely worth paying to go into the orchid gardens to complete your visit as they are really special."
,,Must See,5.0,,"I work in horticulture so I’m biased, but this is an amazing collection and free for most things, although the Orchid Collection is worth every penny of the £4 entrance fee.
Great plants, well labelled, beautifully maintained.
Much cheaper than Gardens By The Bay, but not air conditioned. Easy access on the MRT orange line.
Look out for the big lizard things."
,,Beautiful Garden - Lovely Orchid Display,5.0,,"This is a lovely garden, though I find because of the Singaporean heat, it is best to go after 4:00PM when things start to cool down. It actually becomes quite pleasant after the sun starts to fade. The first time my husband and I visited, we went in the late morning, and it was uncomfortably hot.

Note that the Orchid Garden area (It's beautiful!) closes about 7:00PM, but the remainder of the garden is open until 12:00PM.

You could probably spend several hours at this garden, but as my husband and I are living here, we go for short trips of about 1 to 1 1/2 hours at a time."
,,A must if visiting Singapore,5.0,,"The extensive gardens are a must if you are visiting Singapore with an extensive array of trees, open spaces and ponds, but the main attraction is the Orchid collection which is spectacular. We travelled to the gardens on the metro, using our day travel passes and the station is at the main entrance to the gardens. We only spent a couple of hours there because of the heat but we could have spent the day."
,,Good,5.0,,"Great views, nice spots to take pictures, have a long walk and enjoy It is free and it is a must in Singapore"
,,Serenity in the beautiful garden!,4.0,,"It's really recommended to visit the Botanic garden if you are a nature lover and like to chill in a peaceful environment for the weekends out of the hectic city. You can have picnic, some outdoor activities and/or even able to enjoy some live performance over the weekend nights at the Shaw Symphony Stage located inside. Of course, it is also recommended to have a tour in the Orchid Garden! You will not regret as a flower lover. :)"
,,Orchids are the highlight!,5.0,,Everyone said that the gardens were worth a visit and I agree. I spent most of my time at the special orchids area- small fee for entry. Some of the best orchid displays I’ve ever seen. The rest of the garden is equally impressive and you could easily spend a whole day exploring. It is a big place so make sure you wear comfortable shoes! Good facilities and food options in the park.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,Lots of interesting speciality gardens and a magnificent orchid collection. Give yourself time to explore the whole garden
,,Absolutely Stunning- and free!,5.0,,"Having decided to extend a ‘transit stop-over’ to a couple of nights to explore the city, and not bring ones to shop, we found ourselves attracted to this place.
Amazing gardens, immaculately kept, and the Orchid Gardens well worth the small entrance fee.
Loved every minute of the four or five hours we spent there, so much so we returned the next day for a fabulous breakfast at the Halli cafe next to the Orchid center.

Well worth a visit."
,,A wonderful place to spend a couple of hours,5.0,,"I love the Singapore Botanic Gardens and National Orchid Gardens. I have been here a few times over the years and enjoy it every time. The gardens are very peaceful and a great place to walk around. There is no entry fee for the Botanic Garden, but there is a small charge to enter the National Orchid Garden ($5 SGD for adult and $1 SGD for seniors). It is a great place to spend a couple of hours and see all the lovely flowers."
,,Worth Your Time and a Break from Touring,5.0,,"If you love plants and landscape you'll love this. Beautifully planned, maintained, and cared for. It is especially nice on a hot day when you want a shady, leisurely break from touring. Plan 2 hrs"
,,Awesome gardens,5.0,,Awesome gardens with trees over 200 years old. Magical flowers from different parts of the world. Garden was divided in many different sections. The Orchids garden is a must see . Swan lake was very nice as well. You could easily spend half a day there. The only thing is that since it is outdoors watch out for the humidity
,,Lush,4.0,,"Free to enter, a visit to Singapore Botanic Gardens provides a welcome escape from the hustle and bustle of the downtown area. There are also a number of places to eat on site, or just to sit and watch the world go by with an ice cream. There is a small change ($4) to enter the Orchid Gard, but other areas like the Ginger Garden are free of charge. Beautiful range of flowers, plants, shrubs and trees from all over the world."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,Immaculate gardens. Lots of things to see and do. Nice eateries and rest rooms. Free to access all areas except the Orchid Gardens. Only costs $5 or $1 for seniors to enter the Orchid Gardens and it is so worth the entry fee. We went on a Sunday evening and it was really busy as there was an open air concert. There were lots of volunteers to help you if you wanted to go to a certain place. Went back early one morning to go to the Orchid Garden. A plant lovers paradise.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful and mostly free. The Orchid garden was definately Worth the small entrance fee. Lots of water holes, even some lizards!"

,,An excellent Botanic Collection.,5.0,,"The Gardens are beautifully laid out, and full of interesting species, architecture and general structures! There is a LOT to see and do, since the Gardens are fairly large, with specific areas devoted to specific plant groups (such as e.g. the Gingers, and their famous Orchid Collection!) Entrance is free (though entry to the Orchid Collection does have a charge for this exhibit). Expect to stay there for a large part of the day, and in the evening the illumination is very spectacular too."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"You could spend a whole day just wandering around these gardens, having refreshments and just sitting taking in the beautiful surroundings. It is easy walking and we'll sign posted. Pick up a map at the kiosk as you enter. The gardens are free and the orchid garden 5 dollars or 1 dollar for seniors. These are amazing, such a wonderful display of different orchids. Just stunning. Also in the gardens you will find lakes, one with small turtles and bridges to meander over. A must visit if you are interested in flowers and plants."
,,beautiful flowers but not the easiest to in a wheelchair,4.0,,We were informed the Orchid Gardens were wheelchair accessible. It is true the walkways are paved but some are very steep! Pushing a wheelchair up some of the paths was strenuous. The flowers were beautiful.

,,A beautiful garden,5.0,,"Best of all its free!
The easiest mrt to take is the blue line. Then walk down to the opposite gate. If you catch the 174 bus by Gleneagles Hospital it takes you to Orchard road. From there back to were you came from.
Dogs are allowed on a leash.
Opposite the Mrt station is a Cold Storage supermarket, there you can buy cold water cheap."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,We really enjoyed the botanic gardens the orchard garden which you pay $5 to enter was the highlight. Definitely deserves a visit.
,,A beautiful day spent with my mum,5.0,,"This garden was everything I expected, beautiful. I was with my mum in Singapore and she loves gardens so I really wanted to her to be able to take her. It was Stunning.
I do advise going early as it gets very hot in Singapore. We went early and spent the morning walking around and taking it all in."

Weather is bit humid and hot, but what can I expect from Singapore. It is a tropical country."
,,Beautiful gardens and fantastic Orchids,5.0,,"Free to enter botanic gardens. Large public area in a City without many open spaces.

,,My weekend place to be!,5.0,,"Gardens are great, especially in the early morning. Not packed at all, free entrance. Grab yourself a cold sugar cane juice from the food hall close to the visitor center (middle of the park) and just enjoy! Realistic time: 1 - 3 hours."

So many lovely gardens, trees, plants to look at and explore. The swings were a hit for us, squeaky and fun and a must do. A couple of shops to grab a bite to eat or a drink and plenty of touristy trinkets to purchase. A must do to get a real feel of the beautiful gardens of Singapore."
,,Walk the shaded paths and feel like the city is miles away,4.0,,Beautifully done! A nice place to stroll and take in nature. Some of the trees are species I have not encountered before and they provide info on these. There are also small lakes where you will see swans and turtles as well as fish.

,,Free day out,5.0,,"A wonderful open space. There are some facinating trees, with explainations of them.

,,"Lush, well maintained gardens with delightful surprises around many corners.",5.0,,There is always something new that you will see in the gardens. I'm sure even if you walked every morning there would still be lovely surprises presenting themselves. We even found a cafe with good coffee for the end of our walk.
,,Recommended for travellers on a budget,5.0,,"So the garden is big so big that you can wonder around in it for one full day if you are into nature.

The best part is that if you stay clear of the orchid garden there is no admission fee and you can make it good outing totally free. Even if you don’t go into the gardens that require fee you have lots to look at.

Well worth a visit."
,,Just magnificent,5.0,,"These gardens are a paradise amidst a vibrant city. Yes, it’s planned by man but nature does the hard work to bringing such beauty to life. The staff clearly care as they give nature a helping hand.
Stroll past trees that have witnessed, Singapore’s history unfold, be cooled by waterfalls, relax by water features and enjoy the colours of the flowers.
This is a large Botanical Gardens, offering a quiet walk or some good exercise, depends on mood and fitness levels.
Entry is free, but to enter the orchard centre there is a $5sg cost or if over 60 or disabled it is $1sg. Good value either way as you see over 300 varieties of stunning orchids.
There are nice cafes in the grounds, so the whole experience is made for comfort and to enjoy at your own pace.

I had a great day, you will too, young or old, they were all there."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Love the orchid garden very much. Beautiful place to spend few hours wondering around. Can use hop on hop off bus to get there .
,,Such beautiful gardens,5.0,,"I spent 2 hours wanderimg around the gardens enjoying the big variety of plants and occasionally surprising animals. There are some buses that go there (including the Hop On, Hop Off buses), and the Botanic Gardens station for the MRT. There are chairs scattered around the various gardens great for sitting and having some time to relax and enjoy, some being under cover in case it rains.
My favourite was the Healing Garden, a showcase of plants that have been known for their healing properties.
Good idea to know where the toilets are and use before needed, as it can be a long walk to find them if needed in a hurry.
I had the surprise of a little green tree snake dropping down on the path from a tree above me giving me a fright. I had planned to sit on the grass and read, but after that I used the benches."
,,excellent,5.0,,gorgeous gardens. we have been to many and can judge. certainly amongst the best if not the best. the orchid garden was spectacular. pretty good for birdwatching as well
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,Walk here and relax from the big city! Lots of flowers and areas where you can find rest and peace. You find some restaurants here for food or just for a beer.
,,Fabulous place for a stroll,5.0,,Spent our last afternoon here walking in the beautiful gardens. Be sure to go in the morning or late afternoon when it's not so steamy and hot.
,,Great place to be among trees!,5.0,,"Good pathways, good lighting, very well maintained garden. Went there for a run twice and was great.Lot of people use it for their group exercise as well. Overall you feel fresh.Given its singapore its humid!"
,,"Amazng place, well worth a visit",5.0,,"We were so pleased we visited the gardens, well laid out, very interesting and beautiful, so many interesting things to see and take photos of."

,,Amazing,5.0,,"What a great garden

Ive seen many many gardens all over the world but this is just stunning

Ive never seen such diversity of plants and species of ferns, outstanding

Its a vast garden so give yourself a full day to see what you can, (i would if i had the time several days to see it all)

The orchid garden alone is several hours to explore, the foliage garden is just breath taking

If you want to see a garden to inspire you then make the time"
,,A real Oasis in the center of the town and wonderful place to enjoy the beauty of nature,5.0,,"Since my first visit to this Botanic garden which took place more than 20 years ago, I was fallen love with this wonderful place. I frequently visit here alone or sometimes with friends. Spacious garden with various shades of green simply charms me in a quite serene atmosphere in spite of located in the midst of the busiest area of Singapore. My preference is visiting there early morning or before 10 am as the weather here in Singapore is quite hot during day. I have never ventured here at night or evening.
The garden presents many plants from the huge trees to very tiny lovely flowers of different kinds. The garden authority has improved this place a lot for the last two decades though recently some people feels the open area of Symphony stage has become smaller and losing its old charm. I have also noticed for quite some time there are quite interesting statues among the trees and plants which are nicely blended into the scenery. This place is a must for those who love nature. There is a must-visit beautiful Orchid Garden too."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"We spent the morning here prior to a late onward flight. Had a lovely breakfast at the cafe near the visitor centre, then wandered around beautiful gardens all with a different theme. All free, except for the Orchid collection which was worth going to see. Lots of locals jogging, running ,doing Tai Chi, dogs being walked, children entertained - just like a local park but warm (35C) and with the most amazing specimen trees and shrubs. Super clean and tidy and easily accessible from MRT Botanic Gardens."
,,Easy way to spend at least 5hrs,4.0,,"Don’t be fooled into thinking you can do this in just a few hours (if you want to relax & enjoy it). We took the train to the Botanic Gardens station & began our journey through the amazing diverse gardens. So much to see, plenty of space to wander around, fun areas for kids or just take a ball or frisbee & enjoy. Park food is on the more expensive side so pack a bite to eat. Great day out enjoying the many areas of this massive gardens. Orchid garden is at a cost but also well worth wandering through."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Enjoyed our walk through the gardens. Beautiful planting, well worth the visit. Also enjoyed the air con in the restaurant!"
,,💐 Beautiful,5.0,,Such a stunning visit. The Botanical Gardens are wonderful and the Orchid displays have to be among the best in the world. It is a really great place to visit. Highly recommended.
,,Great day in the garden,5.0,,It is fantastic to walk around in this big Unesco garden. Orcid garden is the master piece of the garden so be shure to have plenty battery and space on your camera/phone before entering the garden. I was there at sunday but it was plenty space and not to much peopel there.
,,Pretty but smeltering,1.0,,This would have been great on a cooler day. It was so hot I thought I was melting. Lots of people picnicking and very lush.
,,Amazing,5.0,,You don’t believe you are in the centre of Singapore. So many wonderful things to see . The otters even came out to play on our visit.
,,If you like everything green,4.0,,"You might need a taxi to get to it but Superb outdoor garden, would tske a good 2-3 hours to walk around it properly. Great day when were were there and plenty of places to fill your water bottles. Plenty of nice photo opportunities too. You have to pay to get into the Lily gardens but free if you bring your student card!"
,,Oasis in the city,4.0,,"Great place to hang out when visit Singapore. There a lot of attraction to go around here. Amazed with the tree tower located around the entrance area. Lots of tourist, so come early."
,,Lovely garden with amazing plants,5.0,,"Singapore Botanical Gardens is an Oasis of calm and peace in a hectic city. As someone who comes from colder Northern climes it was fascinating to see a wide range of exotic tropical plants, flowers and fruit that I've never seen before. Garden is large but not so large you can't walk round the whole thing in a single day.

Travel light and take water, it's a bit hilly and like everywhere in Singapore, incredibly hot, however, unlike everywhere else in Singapore there is nowhere to get away from the heat.

My day was made even better by the fact that I saw a Hornbill within 10 minutes of entering the park (a wild one, not a captive one), something I'm very unlikely to ever see again.

To top it all it's completely free to enter ($5 for the Orchid exhibition which is well worth it). Thoroughly recommended."
,,Wonderful Gardens (not to be missed),5.0,,"It’s fair ride from the city, we took a taxi there and a taxi back, there is a taxi rank outside the garden entrance, offering a good service back to the city.
The Gardens are beautiful, the walk has some shaded places, just in case it’s hot, plenty rest areas offering food and drinks across the Garden.
The Park is free except the Orchid Garden, which is only a couple of Singapore $, this is the best part of the Garden."
,,An early morning walk in the Botanical Gardens,5.0,,A beautiful green calm area away from the maddening crowd. Wonderful selection of plants and trees alll very well cared for. Go in the morning before the heat builds. Short distance from Orchard Road and easy to go on the bus.
,,Morning Exercise,4.0,,Great place to get some exercise in. Fresh air and cool. View of th greenary and sun coming up is truly wonderful
,,Superb way to while away a few hours,5.0,,"Tranquil beauty amid the business of Singapore. We saw a wealth of beautiful plants, including the orchid garden. Lovingly maintained and relaxing. Highly recommended."
,,Beautiful Extensive Gardens,4.0,,"Lovely gardens, very extensive. You could spend many hours here, so likely need to narrow down your areas of interest and focus on those. The Orchid Garden is a must-see."
,,Awakening of senses!!,5.0,,"Botanic Gardens is a definite must go! Get enthralled by the beautiful nature, flowers and swans!! Away from the hustle and bustle, this is a great place to relax and appreciate the beauty of nature all around you! An educational trip too!"
,,Beautiful stunning gardens,5.0,,"These gardens are well worth a visit if you visit Singapore. They are free and absolutely stunning. From beautiful trees, flowers, birds, you don’t even feel you are in a city. One of the best gardens I’ve ever visited."
,,Nice as always,4.0,,Its always nice to see how Singapore has created such a wonderful green space and garden though in the heat its a little difficult to cover to much
,,One of the prettiest Botanic gardens,5.0,,Singapore botanic gardens are extensive but each part is exquisite and really nice to talk a walk through. I particularly enjoyed the Orchird park as it has a magnificent variety of these beautiful flowers.
,,Vacation,5.0,,"I will go again. So much to see in one visit. So many different plants you wish you were a botanist to truly appreciate them all, however, you don’t need to know the names to appreciate the beauty."
,,A must visit for nature and garden lovers.,5.0,,This is the most comprehensive botanical garden ever visited. One day is not enough. Ensure that you go early for the heat and rather come back every day for an hour or three. No entrance fee and right next to the MRT station. Do yourself a favour and visit the orchid garden. However you need to pay entrance fees. They are busy to upgrade it and will just be better and better. A real jewel. All kinds of gardens. I did the firest walk twice. Will never forget it and visit it again. If you have small children also visit this garden. Entrance free and security. I was not allowed to enter without children.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Free to walk around the gardens except the orchid garden but an absolute joy to walk around - where comfortable shoes though!
,,A real tropical garden treats,5.0,,"Unlike Garden by the bay which is a fine balance between man made and nature's gift to mankind, Singapore Botanic Garden is a truly tropical garden at it's finest. It is how a real tropical garden is supposed to feel like. The tranquility of the garden amidst the chirping of the birds and those humidity and the occasional flies as one stroll through nature is a true blessing and enjoyment of the finest gift from nature. It is as if you own the entire garden behind your own backyard, with the garden meticulously taken care of by the finest green fingers. This is Singapore's answer to those who think we're none other than just shopping malls nation. We're a true garden city."
,,Botanical Gardens of relaxation,5.0,,Wondeful relaxing place. Amazing flores and plants. Superbly laid out and the orchids were out of this world. So many. Lots of different levels to walk on/through. If you want peace and tranquility please visit there. Not very expensive and easy walk around.
,,Wonderful garden,5.0,,"Another not to be missed Singapore attraction. Firstly, it's massive. You could spend many days here and not see it all. Secondly, it contains the National Orchid Garden which is amazing. Thirdly, it's free (small charge for National Orchid Garden of around 5$)."
,,Reminiscing after 50 years,4.0,,"Stunning, beautiful and so rewarding. Calm and clean it was a wonderful trip around the gardens. The orchid garden takes your breath away with awesome settings abound with so many different orchids. Reflection from the past? Well it has lost its rugged and natural wonder with wildlife abound. Now clean and ordered. It has lost a little of its soul but nevertheless a place to visit."
,,An Oasis of Calm,5.0,,"A place of cultivated beauty and calm away from the bustle, tourist attractions and shopping of this great island state. Britain established botanic garden across it’s empire but this is probably the best kept and most interesting of all. It is also large and quite with a few excellent restaurants. The Orchid Garden is probably the most famous location but tends to be the only crowded spot in the garden. More interesting is the Medicinal Garden by the University. Be prepared to find out how many plants were used in the fight against sexually transmitted diseases."
,,Peaceful and Relaxful,5.0,,"If you need to have peace and quiet while having a stroll, the Botanical Gardens is the place for you."
,,Beautiful pre dinner stroll .,4.0,,Beautiful grounds and no entrance fee ! I would suggest an early evening walk as very hot during the day . Lots of different entrances and exits along with a great restaurant and caffe .
,,Such a beautiful place,5.0,,"You wouldn't believe that these gardens are in the middle of the city. Beautifully maintained.Split into zones, and gardens..fragrant, evolution, healing; lots of space to walk or sit. Could easily spend one full day exploring these gardens. Plenty of cafe choices. MRT Botanic gardens stops outside the gates, lots of parking available."
,,Oh my God what a beautiful place,5.0,,"What an extrodinary place ! So beautiful! We were there with our friends from Singapur who took us to this garden! Just brilliant! so many flowers, co clean and tidy! if every botanical garden was run like this!"
,,Beauty and serenity,5.0,,"A UNESCO world heritage site that is natural, beautiful and peaceful. We often go there as a couple for a good walk and exercise, or with our children to learn about flora and fauna or even for meeting up with friends for a slow walk and chat. The Jacob Ballas Children's garden is wonderful for kids, and the Orchid Garden is fantastic for photography. The best part is that it is free for all visitors! We love the free concerts at the gardens where we can picnic and enjoy music in the beauty of nature!"
,,Beautiful Garden in the City,5.0,,It's a great escape from the bustling city. There are many different sections to this garden. Plants and trees are labelled and makes a great educational trip for students too.
,,Another must see,5.0,,You must visit the orchid garden. The gardens in general are excellent. Start at one gate arriving by bus or metro and walk to the other.
,,Very Tranquil,5.0,,"Lush green, good place for picnic. May not be easy to get a place during weekends. A respite from the concrete jungle."
,,A well groomed garden with interesting and educational tours,4.0,,I was at the Singapore Botanic Gardens on 2nd March and was impressed by the way the garden is well groomed and maintained over the years. The conducted tour on Healing Garden is well worth it although the weather was a bit hot that day. Very educational and entertaining especially with a guide who understands the healing herbs and spices well. The tropical plants and its herbal benefits and history are worth knowing and perhaps the tour should be a made a compulsory school education tour to provide in depth to our students
,,"A very beautify garden, and a large tropical park",5.0,,"Singapore's National Parks operates this wonderful garden & park. Inside are some eating options for families and individuals, and also a fabulous orchid garden (extra fee). The symphony often plays in the soundshell and there are beautiful ponds with waterbirds. Great place for a wonderful morning or evening stroll. It's a large park, so you can visit a few times or spend a long time there. Remember, though: prepare for the tropical weather! Sunscreen, hat, water, umbrella, etc."
,,Been a Long Time,5.0,,"I lost my dad in 1980 and on 1 May 1981, my mum ,my sis and myself went to Botanic Gardens and thats when God send Mr Bill Hook who became our stepdad. On 9 March 2019, we had our family gathering there and wow comparing to 39 years ago, I would say not much changes but more eateries, taxi stand with shelter, wheelchair accessible, that is good. We really enjoyed Fusion Spoon, near the entrance of the botanic gardens ( tanglin gate ), price is reasonable and good aircon. They also serve hotpot ( HALAL ) , very reasonable price."
,,Reunion At the Ginger Garden,5.0,,"Last week, I had a reunion with two of my secondary school teachers who taught me more than 40 years ago. One is now living in Sweden and the other in New Zealand, literally a world apart. They have come back home and I was privileged to arrange for a reunion. I decided to meet at The Halia at the Ginger Garden in the Botanic Garden. The reunion amidst lush greenery and rustic setting was beautiful. This is a beautiful place for beautiful people to meet."
,,Great place t,5.0,,"To take a long woalk, get some quality exercise, see a bit of Singapore histroy and have rounb with nature. The Orchid Gardens are also most gorgeous as well."
,,A not to miss Singapore attraction,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a nice respite from the rest of the city's concrete building blocks. It's a place to take it down and have a relaxing stroll. I highly recommend paying to get into the National Orchard Garden while you're there. It's well worth getting a proper dose of color infusion and to also see and learn about the varieties they work so hard to maintain.
,,Morning Walk,5.0,,Brought my family there during weekend for morning walk followed by breakfast. My kids love running around the garden and chasing chickens! LOL
,,Great jogging track for business folks staying in the area,3.0,,"It is definitely one of the oldest garden Singapore have created. The running track is mix of hills, slopes and flat surface.

Rich with many beautiful trees and plants that has been maintain well by town council. For avid Yoga or TRX practitioner, you have few concrete gazebo overlooking beautiful scenery for you to do these activities.

The only dampener, is after sunset, this whole garden is quite poorly lit and the signage in and out of the garden can be confusing.

I’m giving 3 star, because they have a beautiful small pond at the edge of this garden but quite poorly maintained. That’s the only negative point. Rest are perfect for city folks after office hour or business travelers in the area to sweat out and have fun.

Foreign guests would be pleasantly surprised on how Singapore maintains such a dense and lush garden at the start of famous Orchard Belt."
,,Awesome place for nature lovers,4.0,,"Nice place and atmosphere, kids enjoyed open place and the nature. Keep yourself hydrated and use comfortable clothes/footwear"
,,What a treat,5.0,,"I walked from the Hilton Singapore to the Singapore Botanic Gardens one morning this week, and it was delightful. Most of the gardens are open at all hours, so I went early in the morning to avoid the heat. My favorite part was visiting the Rain Forest, where I saw some exotic birds and rare trees and plants. There was no charge, but since ther is no lighting, you cannot enter the Rain Forest at night.
I also visited the Fragrent gardens and the Healing Gardens, among others. All in all, a delightful experience."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Wonderful very well-curated gardens.
UNESCO heritage site.
Metro station “Botanic Gardens” just by the entrance.
Free admission (except the Orchid garden).
Visitor centers with WCs, souvenir shops and drink machines.
Logical pathways and plenty of signs where to proceed.
Very vast territory, green and with exotic flower scents.
Interesting and educational experience."
,,Definitely Worth Repeat Visits,5.0,,"I started visiting the Gardens every Sunday morning since 1 month ago. The walk in the gardens is very invigorating, and the air is fresh and cool when I start my walks at 6.15am.

The Gardens are quite big in land area and has an immense variety of plants, trees etc. My favorites are the walk through the Rainforest area as well as the Orchid Gardens. There are still many areas that I need to explore.

There are also some 2-3 restaurants for you to have your breakfast or a snack. I have yet to try them, but the menus look interesting.

The best time to enjoy the Gardens is during early mornings when it is cooler. You can also enjoy the sunrise and take some pretty awesome photos of the huge trees that they have."
,,A city get away,5.0,,"Botanic garden is right in the city center of Singapore. And is very accessible by mrt, botanic gardens station. It’s a great place to hang out with friends or have a picnic. There are restaurants there but it’s on the more expensive side."
,,Great way to spend a morning,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is an amazing treasure to be explored. There are so many different areas to wander through and soak up the green goodness of Singapore. I especially enjoyed the Rain Forest and the Healing Gardens (closed on Tuesday and public holidays). I learned so many names and characteristics for plants and trees by reading the signs and plaques. It is wonderful that it is free and easy to access. I have not been to the Orchid Gardens yet but plan to visit there soon. As well, the children’s garden is fabulous and a favorite place for my 8 year old daughter."
,,A garden with history & heritage listed in UNESCO,5.0,,"A huge Beautiful garden with many interesting discovery. It is not only educational but a place for self reflection and getting inspiration. Live the beautiful trees and the therapeutic feel u get strolling the garden. Check out the bandstand & the swans great for taking pics and the green gallery and heritage museum. U can spend hours there and immerse in the greenery and it’s free! Prepare a hat and water cause it can be very hot in the afternoon. Amazing garden with rich history, No wonder it is listed in UNESCO! Awesome!!!"
,,Singapore Botanical Garden,5.0,,"Full of diverse flora in one place. From time to time the Rafflesia Arnoldi flower will bloom and give off a rotting flesh stench that will attract many insects. If you are lucky you might be able to see this rare n unique flower. The garden is accessible via taxi or the MRT with several gates n access points. On several occasions on the weekend evenings, they will have concerts playing classical music or production plays, which are free to attend. Do check their schedule of events. Don't forget your sun hat, sun screen n mineral water as it can get hot in the afternoons."
,,Perfect place for a picnic,5.0,,"Whether you are with family, kids or with friends it’s a great place to catch up, be surrounded by nature! The park has something to offer to all, and with the periodic musical performances , it’s a must visit a few times every year ! There is an orchid garden inside the park for all the orchid lovers- definitely worth a visit."
,,Plants and their habitats - guide was Teck Chye,5.0,,"My daughter’s science tutor highlighted this little 1 hour tour to us. It is target at kids from 5-6 years onwards. Our guide, teck Chye took a lot of care to explain more about the different plants in the garden. We went to visit the marsh and the dessert areas to understand more about the plants. He let us touch and feel samples of the plant to give the kids a better understanding of plants as we all live in a predominantly concrete jungle. It was very interactive and teck Chye gave us more than an hour’s worth of his time.

It is truly worth signing up. Opens the kids eyes to the plants around us. We even saw mudskippers and a Komodo dragon on the tree."
,,Good place to go,5.0,,One of the good selection to visit as well taking care off by the local authority . Very ‘green’ and the track is well planned .
,,Great botanic garden,4.0,,"Just a quick walk away from busy Orchard road. Nice park , some peace in the city centre. Nice collections of tropical plants"
,,Fascinating Visit,5.0,,"Well worth visiting it was a peaceful and although it was humid to walk round it was worth visiting, we also did the orchid garden at the same time. The exhibits were labelled and you could take your own time walking round, well worth seeing"
,,Will I revisit?,3.0,,"Unless necessary, I probably would not go again. Just a huge ass garden for people to have picnic at, chill and play with their kids. Well, it can be suitable for photoshoot as well. Just remember to bring you own food or grab your meal at the cafes/eateries nearby (Very limited selection). Nothing much to see there if you are looking for interesting/fun things."
,,A relaxing stroll,4.0,,"This is the largest botanic gardens I have ever been in and I would say is a Botanists dream come true. My kids ages 4,10 and 11 didn't really appreciate the area (""Dad, it's a plant"") but still somewhat enjoyed this place."
,,Peaceful haven...The Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"I took a taxi early in the morning to the Botanical Gardens & gradually made my way through the magnificent flowering plants & greenery to the Orchid Gardens & then slowily down to the train station at the southern end. I’m so glad I went at this time as there were very few people and it was peaceful. I enjoyed watching many locals walking their dogs through the gardens. You don’t see that in Australia!
I highly recommend a visit due to it not only being free admission but great exercise."
,,Peace walk,5.0,,My wife suggested we go to the Botanical Gardens while Singapore and I was skeptical. However upon arriving I found it to be interesting and peaceful. We walked around and saw all types of plants and paid extra to enter the orchid exhibit. It was amazing and I never knew there were so many types of orchids. It’s an easy walk but you’ll be surprised how big the whole place is. Worth going to.
,,A feast for your eyes,5.0,,"What a lovely place to go. We chose a Saturday lunch time and were amazed.

As you would expect it was spotlessly clean, really chatty security staff that explained lots about the place, very knowledgable indeed.

Some beautiful trees in a beautiful setting, robotic mowers hidden away, a classical concert for free which was great in the band stand by the lake.

Plenty of signs that showed you what was what, how to get around, and some history of the place and the trees, some of which are 150ft tall.

Well worth a visit, just for a potter around, run or bike."
,,Extensive beautiful gardens,5.0,,"The gardens cover a significant area and have lots of interesting sections, from rain forest to bamboo, orchids and lakes.
Wildlife is all around. Remember to take water as the humidity is really high. There are refreshments in the gardens.
Keep an eye out for the lizards!"
,,Orchids in their habitat,4.0,,"Fabulous - a must see. Beautiful, well maintained gardens - a joy to behold. To see the most beautiful orchids in their natural habitat was extraordinary."
,,Enchanting,5.0,,"When you are strolling through the beautiful trails, it's very easy to forget you are in the middle of a big noisy city."
,,Lovely day out,5.0,,"This place is like a giant Eden project in Cornwall but 3 times as big. There are waterfalls, flowers galore and lovely sculptures to see"
,,Stunning,5.0,,An absolute gem. Couldn't believe these gardens were free. We only paid for the orchid garden and even that was at a reduced rate. Beautiful flowers and saw a variety of birds. Enjoyed the evolution garden.
,,A very serene place,5.0,,I heard about Botanical garden is a great place to visit from friends. We went in February and the kids of my boyfriend. They realized there are so many interesting plants and trees around this region. It is very lovely and quiet place when we could sit down on the grass patch to chill under shade. I am happy that we managed to visit this wonderful place in our list.
,,a big park and a wide range of orchids to view,4.0,,always like to walk around Botanic Gardens early in the morning as the air is great and the weather is cool. Love the gardens because lots of interesting trees and plants etc to view. The most interesting part is the orchid garden which has lots of different types of orchid that is being named after all the famous people around the world.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Gardens wonderful, orchid garden fantastic. If you are visiting Singapore don't miss these immaculate gardens."
,,Very pretty,5.0,,"Huge gardens with different sections which are all signposted. Lots of shady areas to sit to escape the heat. There are statues all over the gardens and also wildlife roaming free. We saw squirrels, lizards, swans, birds and insects to name but a few. Toilets and eating areas are plentiful too. A lovely place to spend anything from a few hours to a full day."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Living in Singapore, I regularly go speed walking in the Botanic. It is always lovely.
But what I prefer: to do a romantic picnic at night by one of the ponds or in a secret place (that I will not disclose as it is a secret).
No wonder why it is part of UNESCO heritage place."
,,A full day is needed,5.0,,There is so much to see that you should plan to spend a day here. There is no fee to enter although if you want to visit the beautiful orchid garden you there is (5 dollars or 1 dollar for pensioners!) There are plenty of paths to choose from to take you through the gardens which were established about 40 years ago. There are several restaurants and a shop selling sandwiches and drinks. A must visit
,,Great escape from the city,5.0,,"Spend as much time as you would like here, just a few minutes or a whole day. The gardens are beautiful and spacious so while there are a lot of people it doesn’t feel crowded. Great way to get away from the city while still being in the city."
,,Orchid heaven,5.0,,"Fantastic orchid garden within the main garden. Areas dedicated to many species. Plan on at least an hour for the orchids along, the whole park would take hours to see"
,,Botanic Gardens,4.0,,I went there with my family and family of a close friend of mine. Nice place to go with family. Can take nice pics.
,,Prepare to spend here the best part of the day,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Garden is so extensive and with surprising showings of plants and trees, that you must be prepared to spend here the best part of the day. From a jungle path, where on a specific spot your attention will drawn to a giant historic Meranti tree, to a beautiful Orchid garden (entrance for a fee, the rest of the Botanic Garden has free entrance) and almost everything botanic in between. Although Singapore has a good public transport system, the best plan is to take a taxi to one of the entrances. There are taxi stands at the gates of the Botanic Garden, convenient when you can tear yourself away at last. A must visit."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Lovely place to visit worth going for a wander around really relaxing there were also animals there to.
,,A must-see spot in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a super great and must-see place when visiting Singapore. I love the way they set the location, even though located in the heart of the city, but the senses of nature is sensibly clear. My favorite is the National Orchids Gardens!"
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,Spent several hours here between finishing cruise and flight home and it's free. Animals as well as plants to see
,,Walking,3.0,,Enjoyed the ride to get to the botanical gardens but once of the figeler the walking is mostly hill climbing or down hill but the trees and all carefully named amazing agapathanis and yucca in full bloom and other plants now play ground for children is so wonderful .It is the heat and humidity that is a problem . Best to choose the correct time of day to explore the gardens .
,,Nice place to hang out far from the hustle and bustle of the city,4.0,,"Nice place to have a walk far from the hustle and bustle of the city. We only regretted that there were so few signs to know more about the trees and flowers. It's not a 'pedagogic' botanic garden at all but still it's a nice place to go to. We much peered the cloud forest. National orchid garden is nice but from the MRT station, be prepared for a 2.3 km walk until you reach the orchid garden. The rainforest path, starting just across orchid garden, is nice."
,,Don't forget to explore the history of the gardens,5.0,,"An UNESCO World Heritage Site, for history lovers, make sure you visit the Heritage Museum near the Southern corner of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. This outlines the fascinating history of the Gardens and well worth a visit (and the air-conditioning is amazing if you are tired of the humidity!)"
,,day visit,5.0,,These gardens need a full day ++ They are excellent & we will recommend the 20 minute audio tour at $8 pp. The night light show was OK as the sound didn't work the night we attended???
,,Great,5.0,,We loved the calm atmosphere and the beautiful plants. If you go there don't forget to also visit the orchid garden
,,A must visit when in SG,4.0,,Been here many times but i still find it amazing. Wearing a comfy shoes is a must if you want to explore the whole place. If you want to visit the Orchid garden you have to pay 5sgd (if I remember it correctly) but yeah why not especially if you love flowers. Don't miss this out if you're going to visit Singapore.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We visited the Gardens and we were very impressed with the display of flowers and orchids. The gardens are set on lots of acres of shrubs and lakes with swans and is magnificent. We enjoyed our time there and spent hours there. The grounds are well kept by lots of workers who keep in pristine condition.
,,Green and cold,5.0,,"The park is so amazing, green and we can get a fresh air. I think u must try to go to here just for jogging maybe."
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,"Best visited in the morning, both from the point of view of the heat and the smaller number of people. Stunningly beautiful plantings with quite spectacular special displays. Very spacious, lush, carefully tended. Excellent gift shop. Beautiful satin silk scarves. A Singapore must see."
,,Botanic gardens were lovely,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, but very hot recommend carrying water around. Trees and shrubs along with the garden design was unique."
,,Forest in the city,4.0,,"If you like plants and want to enjoy the nature, this is the place for you. Surrounded by trees and grasses, you can chill, have a picnic or even play with your pets. It’s rare to see such a big “garden“ in a city, where birds and roosters walk beside you."
,,Another beautiful Botanical Garden,4.0,,Unfortunately most of the plants were showing signs of heat stress and were not at their best. Its free to wander around and good to fill in some hours
,,Wonderful Gardens,5.0,,"We visited at 11am, which in March was too late due to the temperature and high humidity. However it was a wonderful visit. Unlike RHS Kew, all the trees and plants are identified by both their Latin and English names and there was plenty of information on the various species and how local people used them. Entry to the gardens is free, which must make it one of the best value attractions in Singapore. Entry to the orchid gardens is charged, but a visit is well worth it.
Tip - go to the gardens by the MRT and have great coffee and croissants at Da Paolo’s Gastronomia opposite the station.
2nd Tip - the gardens open at 5am - go as soon as it’s light to avoid high humidity."
,,Really Stunning,5.0,,"The Botanical gardens are stunning, we could spent so much more time there, but I guess as a tourist time is always precious.
We went in the middle of the day and it was really too hot, our fault, try and go at the end of the afternoon.
We stayed in the Marina Bay Sands hotel, don’t bother it was not good with the exception of our awesome view of the botanical gardens and the night time light show, it was excellent."
,,Probably the best Botanical Garden in the world,5.0,,"I've been coming to Singapore Botanical Garden regularly since the early 1980s for 3 reasons: morning or afternoon walk, enjoy beautiful scenery, and education (see/learn about different species of plants). And every time, this UNESCO World Heritage site just keeps evolving for the better. The trees and plants varieties are incredible. I particularly like the Evolution garden, the Ginger garden, and the Rain Forest. And there are symphony orchestras playing at the lake. I think on special occasions only. Very entertaining.
I would recommend everyone to visit this remarkable garden while in Singapore."
,,Delightful oasis so close to the city,5.0,,Highly recommend a visit here if you are in Singapore. So close to the city and yet a world away. We wandered around in relative peace and quiet for a couple of hours and still didn’t see everything.
,,The best things in life are free !,5.0,,Fantastic day wondering and exploring... definitely recommend this is on your to do list ! Enjoy we did !
,,Nature oasis in the city,5.0,,"Our first visit and loved it but even with half a day we didn’t it all. The orchid collection is great and the layout of the park is pretty easy to follow. There are staff at the entrance that can answer any questions and direct you to highlights if time is tight.
Of course it’s warm, but it’s open early if you want to avoid the hottest part of the day. There are casual food options and it’s all run very efficiently with friendly people. Good bus service from center of city."
,,"Lovely, peaceful place in the heart of the city",5.0,,"Can’t get over that this is a free attraction to visit. (Kew Gardens could take a leaf out of this book, excuse the pun!).
Wonderful peaceful place where you can take as long or as little time as suits and you will still enjoy its charm and beauty.
We paid to also go in to the Orchid Gardens, this was 5SGD, about £2.50, so nothing to break the bank and its worth every penny. The most amazing sights and beautiful colours, with such a vast array of different Orchids amoungst other pretty foliage. Its a must see during your visit to Singapore, so glad we went.
Get a taxi, they are so cheap and most of the drivers are like having your very own tour guide."
,,A beautiful place to escape the buzz of the city and immerse yourself in stunning gardens and nature,5.0,,"Excellent way to spend a morning strolling around the lush gardens, paying $5 to enjoy the beautiful orchid gardens and just relax in stunning gardens."
,,Great day out amongst the flora and fauna,5.0,,"I feel this place is overlooked when compared to Gardens by the bay, but if you can do both, make the time to visit here!

Far less crowds, all outdoors and beautiful displays of flowers and fauna.

Entry is $5 too (free for Singapore residents) so a great bargain for a nice day out."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Just as good as garden by the sea and more colourful. Easy access by Singapore day tour bus and cheap to visit. Has food and drinks
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Fantastic gardens with a huge diversity of planting. Despite the humidity it is a great place to wander and relax as well as learn about plants and trees
,,"Great, but .......",4.0,,"We visited the gardens early in our visit to Singapore and thought they were great - they are well kept with a massive variety of tropical plants, trees and flowers.
The paths are well marked and follow through the gardens with plenty of shade and resting places!
HOWEVER - if time is limited we would very much recommend Gardens by the Bay instead - even though the botanic gardens are free to enter and the main attractions at Gardens by the Bay have to be paid for both of us would recommend Gardens by the Bay over the Botanic Gardens - sorry!"
,,Trip through SEA,5.0,,Really stunning and a fantastic range of flowers. Gardens are a heavenly retreat from the busy Singapore streets and collection of orchids is particularly impressive.
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"Vast area of gardens in zones. Only difficulty is to work out a suitable route to walk through, often gets confusing wondering which way to go!"
,,Peaceful Oasis in the Middle of Singapore,1.0,,"Whether you are visiting Singapore or you live here, the Botanic Gardens are not to be missed. The gardens are a perfectly manicured masterpiece of tropical plants, trees and flowers. They have meandering paths throughout the gardens and plenty of shade to stay cool on a hot summer day. Though I haven't been yet, apparently the Orchid Garden is well worth seeing. We went with some friends and their kids to the SPH Walk of Giants and were pleasantly surprised by this fun little 'playground' for kids and adults. We've also done a lot of running around the gardens and love taking all of the meandering paths. Take a morning or afternoon and just wander around the park and then end up at the Botanic Gardens MRT Station where you can find some cool restaurants to quench your thirst and rest your weary legs."
,,Brilliant spot,5.0,,"Beautiful setting of lakes, wonderful vegetation including rare plants and orchids, koi, reptiles and more!

We spent a few hours there and it was well worth a trip. Entry is free with a small S$5 charge for the Orchids section which is superb.

The gardens are close to Orchard Rd and there are a number of taxi stands at entries to the gardens.

Definitely recommend!"
,,Best day ever,5.0,,Had a great time walking around ...enjoyed the weather and the way everything was presented... Enjoyed taking loads of pics.
,,Komodo dragon swimming by the edge!,5.0,,"Swan lake near the entrance was a treat. We even saw the komodo dragon swimming by the edge searching for dinner. This garden is huge and its free. The only place where you pay is the Orchid Garden in the middlle of the park. Bring some hat or umbrella when you visit,it's hot when we visited."
,,Awesome sights,5.0,,"Great variety and abundance of tropical plants. Very nice walking paths, easy to navigate, huge area to tour. Access is free except the orchid garden"
,,Pleasant Place to visit.,4.0,,Paths are wide and accessible. Bes visited in the early part of the day when the temperature is cooler. A very large variety of plants to see.
,,Lovely to spend time walking around the different areas.,5.0,,Easy to get to by public transport. Spent a few hours just walking around and taking in the serenity. Free admission
,,Well looked after gardens,4.0,,"Enjoyed walking through the UNESCO World Heritage Site. There’s turtles in one of the ponds; an orchid garden ($5SD entry fee and partly closed when we visited, but still worth the money); swan lake was a bit disappointing (only one real swan). Can spend a few hours wandering around the gardens. Highly recommend getting a visitor map so you can find your way around."
,,Marvellous Place!,5.0,,"This is a place that must be visited in Singapore. It is a UNESCO Heritage site, and if any place anywhere deserves this designation, this is it.

I suggest not to rush through, but to arrive early in the morning and take it slow, allowing the place with its giant trees and magnificent lakes and grounds to soak into one. Enjoy bird songs in the relative silence of the place. It is quite big, so if in Singapore for several days, better to come back through a different gate and enjoy it a second time rather than rush to see it all."
,,SOOOO BEAUTIFUL !!!,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a 158-year-old tropical garden which was founded in 1859 consisting of more than 10,000 species of flora. The Botanic Gardens gets about 4.5 million visitors annually.
The National Orchid Garden, within Singapore Botanic Gardens, is a leader of orchid studies and a pioneer in the cultivation of hybrids, making the country as a major exporter of cut orchids. National Orchid Garden has a collection of more than 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids of orchids.
There is no admission fee for Singapore Botanic Gardens but the National Orchid Garden within the main gardens charges $5 entrance fee. There are several landmarks in the Garden.
1- The Bandstand was built in 1930 and is a gazebo that adorned the many gardens of Tanglin Gate. After it was made, the place soon became a famous spot for military bands to perform. Nowadays, the beautiful gazebo surrounded by a ring of Yellow Rain Trees is a most celebrated place by photographers - especially for wedding shoots.
2- Prisoner-of-War Brick Steps which are made by the prisoners of war during the Japanese occupation, 1942-1945. As a sign of defiance, the PoWs engraved arrows on the bricks to indicate that they were imprisoned which are still visible.
3-Tanglin Gate is the main gate to the Garden and is a cast iron gate that is very striking and gorgeous.
Other attractions in the Garden include a Fernery, Sundial, Ginger Garden, Bonsai Garden, Rainforest, the Palm Valley, Waterfall, Library of Botany and Horticulture. The National Biodiversity Centre, is also located within the grounds of the gardens. The Botanic Gardens has three lakes: Symphony Lake, Eco-Lake and Swan Lake. The Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage on Symphony Lake sometimes has free concerts on weekends. South of Symphony Lake, you can see a statue of Frédéric Chopin. There are 10 restaurants/cafes, 3 gift shops and many drinking fountains. Great service at the entrance and they give you lost of info. There are chickens in the garden. You can spend the whole day visiting the Botanic Gardens but also it can be done in half a day if you skip some parts. The National Orchid Garden can be visited in one hour."
,,Botanic gardens,4.0,,Very big and beautiful. Nice place for outing. Looks like uk Hyde Park. Would love to go there for jogging or picnic.
,,Falling in love with this place,5.0,,An amazing morning spent looking at so many different gardens and the orchid house was amazingly beautiful with so many different blooms. My partner took hundreds of amazing photos
,,Free to visit. Easy by MRT,5.0,,Excellent place to spend half a day. Some shade whist walking around. Worth paying to see orchid garden within main garden. Plenty of places for coffee or lunch.
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,4.0,,"THe Gardens are excellent with some wnderful displays, particularly the orchids. There is a fair bit of walking and there is no 'hop on, hop off' service to make it easier. Also the sign posting is not always as clear as it could be, so be prepared to walk.
Some great photo opportunities for the dedicated photographer as well as the 'selfie' taker.
We spent 4 or 5 hours there and probably saw about half of the main features."
,,"A World Unesco site - Walk, relax or picnic in beautiful gardens, and totally free",4.0,,"Opportunity to see many of Singapore's native plants, trees and a wonderful array of Orchids in the National Orchid Garden. Take a leisurely stroll trhough the woodlands or enjoy familiy activities in the extensive open spaces. Find a quiet spot for a picnic or enjoy refreshments at one of the outlets/cafes. Extensive trails criss cross the area. Other things to visit include a Children's Garden and Ginger Garden. This year is the 160th anniversary of the Gardens and they are well worth a visit"
,,Simply the best!,5.0,,"When space is at such a premium in Singapore it takes a huge devotion to the natural world to dedicate such a large area to the best botanic gardens we've ever seen. Even if you only have one day in Singapore, spend half of it here."
,,absolutely beautiful,5.0,,we loved this peaceful beautiful place with the most gorgeous flowers & trees we have ever seen. The colors & endless orchids in the gardens were wonderful to view.
,,It’s always a joy to visit the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,We visit the Botanic Gardens regularly and every visit is a joy. This time we walked into the forest near the entrance which led us to the orchid gardens. It was a very enjoyable stroll. :D
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens were easy to get to, and a treat to experience. It seemed like we walked forever, and still did not see the entire park. The pond had numerous turtles basking in the sun on the shore, and they did not mind posing for closeups! With all of the trees and tall bamboo and shelters, there never seemed to be enough shade. Being North American had something to do with it I'm sure, but I wilted there after a couple of hours. Definitely an early morning destination."
,,Huge Oasis,5.0,,"This garden was a nice escape from hustle and bustle of Singapore. It was easy to get there by bus or MRT. Besides the biggest draw of the the National Orchid Garden, there were many other areas worth seeing.

Close to the orchid garden was the collection of different palm trees (Palm Valley) which according to the sign needed a significantly larger plot of land as to accommodate the large number of varieties and sizes. They provided some shade on the large lawn area in front of the stage. Nearby there also were small stalls selling hot food items, drinks and orchid plants.

The rainforest section was quite a bit darker (even the posted signs warned about this) and cooler as we walked on a raised walkway throughout. Here we able see a lot more wildlife in the underbrush of which the lumbering lizard probably garnered the most attention by the visitors.

Evolution Garden showcased how plants have evolved over millions of years.

It was a nice and relaxing experience. Also the day was not too hot or humid so I could better enjoy exploring. Unfortunately I ran out of time but definitely I will be back."
,,Unless you are visiting the Orchid Gardens not a great place to go,3.0,,There are not many sheltered areas away from the sun here and unless you are combining this visit with a trip to the Orchid Gardens there is not a great deal of things to interest most people.
,,Must not miss and free to enter.,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens that are lovingly tended with good facilities and, best of all, free to enter (you have to pay a small fee to enter the orchid garden). These gardens are extensive and, if you have the time and stamina, try spending most of the day there."
,,Must be the best in the world,5.0,,"Not much to add if you have read all the other reviews other than
If you love stunning gardens then this is must visit place to go to in Singapore
The orchid garden is stunning and did not realise some of these were named after visiting dignitaries
Found orchids named Queen Elizabeth and Prince William and Kate
Managed to walk around in 3 hours"
,,ORCHIDS,5.0,,You will never believe how many different orchids there are due to the gardens' experts at hybridization. See the orchids named after British royalty and some Asian leaders. Stop by the gift shop and buy a gold plated orchid pendant....MDSPOCK
,,Great botenical garden,5.0,,We were here as a part of the Hop-on-Hop-off-Bus-Tour and it was really amazing. We were at a lot of different botenical gardens but that one in Singapore is really great and worth a visit.
,,Beautiful Tropical trees and flowers,5.0,,"This place has many varieties of trees, flowering ginger plants, many sculptures will well worth a visit. The Garden is free and easy walk with easy access for people with disability"
,,Huge and amazing,5.0,,"About the best we have seen anywhere in the world. Lots of benchs and quite a bit of shade, which was welcome in the Singapore heat. Don’t miss the little history museum near the Taiglin (sp?) gate. (Wish they had a bench in front of the slide show.). Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Having said all that, I will note that food inside is pricy and the only place we found in the whole park with a drinking fountain or place to refill a water bottle was in the Orchid garden exit area.
One other problem for the first time visitor is finding things. Although they give you a map, the paths are not signposted so you cannot match the name of the path on the map with the paths as you walk around. We tried to find the healing garden from the visitors center and had given up after walking a long way. We only found it because a kind employee walked us there; there was no sign where we should have turned off onto the red brick path. We tried to find the Corner restaurant but never could."
,,SBG attachment,5.0,,The gardens are fantastic and the level of presentation is world class The staff are very friendly and Willing to help with plant questions and directions I will be back
,,Beautiful and peaceful,4.0,,Head there for an evening picnic (if the weather permits!) or just a leisurely stroll. A good break to spend a relaxed few hours.
,,My favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,One of the best places to just get a refreshing and peaceful walk. Evenings are indeed pleasant and if you are lucky it will be nice and breezy as well.
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,"Wonderful botanic gardens, beautiful fauna, trees and wildlife. Well laid out, plenty of information available, the rainforest section is just one of many highlights. An escape from the traffic and urban jungle, plenty of tranquil places in the gardens to sit and reflect.

Although the gardens themselves are free, you do pay to go into the orchid gardens section. This was very busy with the selfie crowd, but the compensation is that the orchids themselves are simply gorgeous.

Plenty of birds and wildlife e.g. lizards, terrapins etc, look out for the frolicking otters in Swan Lake, helping themselves to the ornamental fish!

Well worth a visit for a few hours at least. Take plenty of water, it's very steamy."
,,Beautiful tropical garden within the city,5.0,,"After living in Singapore for 2 years, this was the one place we wanted to revisit on our return 2 years later. Its like stepping into another world within the city. Escape from the bustle of the traffic to this serene island of calm and nature. See some amazing trees, flowers, birds and animals. A place to stroll, take in the sights, sounds and smells.
The national Orchid Garden is impressive. Go to the restaurant by the Nassim gate (Casa Verde) for breakfast, lunch or coffee - freshly-cooked food and local dishes as well and International favourites."

,,Singapore Well-done!,5.0,,"We did our own tour visiting all places in Botanical Gardens. The places is so big, beautiful and super informative. It was like 5 hours around by foot. Tired but worth it. My most favorite is orchid garden. You guys should put this is your to-do list in Singapore. I prefer it so much more than Garden by the Bay. From Vietnam with Love!"
,,Great green lungs of Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is famous for its great gardens and green patchs all around, but this one trumps all. This place was a dump in the early sixties and now a thriving nature reserve kinda place. Go their with family and great walks. Good for sunday picnics. They have a MRT station right next door."
,,"Beautiful, Always Something New to See",5.0,,Great place to visit with family especially little ones. Always something new to see and explore. The park also arranges several events and international and local concerts. Well worth checking the Singapore National Parks website to time your visits.

As for my niece who is 5 yrs old, she loved the colourful flowers especially the orchids.

,,Excellent well kept gardens,5.0,,"We enjoyed a Sunday morning stroll through the gardens, which are really impressive, clean, neatly-crafted and well kept. A really idyllic spot close to the city.

Easy to reach by bus, and there is also an MRT station.

The gardens boast of their UNESCO World Heritage Site status, and I was sceptical because too many places seem to parade that badge of honour. But actually, they were worth it.

There are several cafes / places to buy drinks. There are also water fountains. And you’ll need refreshments as it was absolutely baking hot!"

,,A calm escape. Stop for tea!,4.0,,"The Botanic Garden is a bit out of the way compared with the Marina Bay area, but it’s well worth it. The Orchids are beautiful and Swan Lake is worth a stroll.

Cheers!
Me & my Dog"

,,Worth a visit for plant lovers,4.0,,"I went to about two thirds of the total area of the gardens on a Saturday afternoon and spent about 4 hours.

I found the areas between the visitor center and Orchard Road the most picturesque but also the most crowded.
The rain forest and gardens on the MTR side were more about botany enthusiasm and education. I liked how they were grouped by theme and learned a lot.

The size is absolutely massive and most of it is free. You can choose to visit just part of it if you have less time, though.

Overall a great place for photos and educational though not the most relaxing, due to loud fellow visitors and renovation throughout the gardens."

,,A little disappointing,3.0,,We tried to make it here to capture some photos. Was very disappointed because half was closed for renovations but we still had to pay the full price. It was a very uninspiring garden with hardly any color. Also the garden workers couldn't stop staring at my girlfriend. They were all looking at her and watching her without any self control. I know she pretty but is super unprofessional!

,,Hours of enjoyment,5.0,,"Try to arrive fairly early in the morning so that you can stroll around before it gets too hot or rains! Suggestion would be to start at the top of the gardens at the Botanical Gardens MRT station entrance and walk through the gardens to the Tanglin Road Gate. Obviously a visit to the National Orchid Gardens en route is a must. The grounds of the Gardens are beautifully laid out with a special section for children. Plenty of facilities and kiosks/cafes, and the majority of the paths are suitable for wheelchairs. Apart from the MRT, buses run to the top entrance from the City/Orchard road area - just ask your hotel concierge - and from just outside the Tanglin Gate."
,,An oasis of calm and green and beauty....,5.0,,"Don’t miss going here - it’s fantastic- easily one
of the best botanical gardens I have visited - a jade coloured sanctuary with the most incredulous orchid gardens. Unsurprisingly the place is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There is a tree the Malayan Terminalia or Jelawi that is at 47m one of the tallest in Singapore- standing next to it one feels a bit like an ant! Spend the day if you can and just wander and wonder at nature’s beauty. When requiring some sustenance - there are a few good places to eat as well!"

,,Do not miss this outstanding attraction!!!,5.0,,"Do not miss this UNESCO World Heritage attraction. In my opinion the most interesting spots are the ""Rain Forest"" with a tree top walk and the orchid garden. We have seen lizards and a tucan.

Enjoy a beautful relaxing time at Singapore Botanic Garden.Do not forget to take a free guiding map at the entrance."
,,A Great Place for Morning/Evening Jog/Walk in Singapore,5.0,,"I love my morning jogs to Botanic Garden every weekend. It's green, clean, quiet and the epitome of Singapore as the garden city. I am not a big fan of heat so I wouldn't recommend walking in the afternoon. You will get to see lots of fauna and flora typical in Asia as well as the beautiful orchids. There are a few super nice restaurants inside Botanic Garden too so don't forget to check that out! (Feeback: Hope they will turn on the cooler for the water dispensers around Botanic Garden! It'll be so nice to sip cold water after a long run/walk in this hot humid condition!!)"
,,Nice and quiet but stay away from tall trees during storm.,4.0,,Everything is nice except carpark charges. Should be a very minimal sum to have families outing more often.
,,Huge Garden,5.0,,"What a lovely way to spend an afternoon in Singapore. We took the MRT Circle Line to the Botanic Garden stop. This stop is at the far north gate Burkit Timah. From here it's a 40 minute walk to the south gate. But there is plenty to see around the north gate - foliage, medical fragance, ethnobotany and evolution gardens. All are really well set out but there is a lack of plant signs. Watch for the big lizards. There were many locals, joggers, families enjoying the gardens on that Sunday afternoon. There are bathrooms and food places in the garden, or bring a packed lunch in ."
,,Lovely garden oasis in the heart of a bustling city,4.0,,"This is a nice place to visit for some tranquility in an otherwise bustling Asian metropolis. Definitely worth a visit if you like nature, plants and wildlife. Be sure to pay the extra few dollars to see the orchid garden."

The gardens are easy to access by the MRT, free to visit and full of lovely flowers, plants and trees. There are numerous places to stop for a snack and hot/cold drinks or an ice cream. We also saw several colourful birds and a few monitor lizards. In all we spent 4 hours enjoying a relaxing time in these lovely gardens."
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Only had time to visit Fragrant and healing gardens. Wonderful perfumes from fragrant garden. Interesting reading how plants are used in traditional medicine for curing various ailments. Had lunch tasth but expensive. Staff helpful and friendly

,,A very beautiful spot to spend some time,5.0,,"Recently spent about 5 hours at the Botanic gardens and would be very happy to go again. It’s very easy to get to. There’s actually an MRT station named Botanic Gardens about 20 metres from the garden gates. We walked through the gardens to the other end and caught a bus back near Orchard Rd MRT station.
There is so much green canopy to walk under, you don’t notice the heat or humidity at all. There are also enough snack stalls to get a drink or icy pole too. A set or restaurants occupy the central part of the gardens and we chose Halia. It had excellent food choices in a beautiful setting. Just be aware, depending on how busy the gardens are, you may need a booking. We managed a walk-up spot mid-week.
Probably the highlight is the National Orchid Gardens. I never knew there were so many difference varieties and colours.
I can highly recommend the gardens for a few house of leisurely strolling and perhaps a picnic on the lawns too."
,,A calm and soothing place,5.0,,Singapore Botanical garden is quite big and has an amazing variety of flora and fauna. Be prepared to get tired while covering the entire garden.

,,Very beautiful but best to go in the morning,3.0,,"This was a beautiful attraction and had many varieties of vegetation.

However, like many attractions in Singapore, there is a lot of walking required, and some of the paths are a bit steep, the later the day the more uncomfortable this becomes.

Several sections of the garden last are pretty much just a park and not very note worthy."
,,Really lovely,5.0,,Although quite warm and humid this is a fabulous place to go. There are some nice restuarants and gift shop around where you can take a break and easy walking with some spectacular planting. Loved it
,,Absolutely Beautiful,5.0,,"I had a long layover in Singapore and decided to go out and see the botanic gardens. I was interested after seeing the famous plant arch picture always being tagged on Instagram, so I wanted to see for myself. The gardens is so much more beautiful than I could've imagined. I went in the morning and ppl were out for their morning walks/jogs. People were relaxing by the lake and just enjoying their time there. It is so much to see, it's impeccably clean and I'm glad that I went. I definitely think it's worth a trip if you are in Singapore."
,,Gardens,5.0,,"One of the best places to visit in Singapore. Beautiful and relaxing! Tropical gardens and flowers. Especially the Natioanl Orchid Garden is to visit absolutely: you wil pay a couple of dollars for the entrance, but it worth it!"

,,"Fantastic Orchids, be prepared for a very long wait to get a taxi outbound",5.0,,"Vast and beautiful botanic garden, the orchids a must, nominal admission charge for seniors, but if you are in a hurry to leave, figure out how to book a taxi to pick you up. We waited an hour for one at the ""taxi stand""."
,,Nice nature,4.0,,"Beautiful place to visit, but not like a must visit given you have so many options to visit in singapore"
,,Nice Nature Expose,5.0,,It feels so invigorating to be up close to the wide variety of plant species. This is highly recommended especially those who are stressed in life. Nature de-stresses.
,,Natural beauty spot free entry,4.0,,"This is a pleasant garden and free to all. It is on a fairly small scale so can be enjoyed in about 2-3 hours at a leisurely pace. Plenty of rest areas throughout and wc points. Some drinking water fountains can be found but take a bottle and top up as you find them. Catering is okay, but not quite for my palette. There is plenty of shade but I recommend you wear a hat or take an umbrella. Don’t miss the Orchard Garden 5$ to enter £2 or 2$ for over 60s. It’s a beautiful garden and worth a trip."
,,wonderful site in the middle of the city,5.0,,"the (free) gardens are pristine and serene. the orchidee visit was spectacular and worth the entry fee. you can get there with big bus, although schedule can be variable at best."

An area of the Orchid Garden was being upgraded when we visited but this did not spoil our visit. Exceptionally good value on a minimal entrance fee."
,,"BEAUTIFUL, PEACEFUL GARDENS IN BUSTLING SINGAPORE",5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are full of surprises ! The orchid gardens provide splashes of colour, there is a significant variety of plants, the tropical trees are spectacular, there are cool, quiet spaces within the hustle and bustle of a busy city and wildlife is active. The gardens are close to other attractions and public transport. Some research before you travel will enhance your visit."
,,Amazing gardens amazing value,5.0,,Compared to other Botanical gardens in Singapore or elsewhere in the world this place is the best and certainly the best value for money. Truly worth spending over half a day here.
,,Orchid garden a must,4.0,,WE have visited many Botanic Gardens around the world. These are good but the outstanding feature is he Orchid garden. It is paid entry ($5 for seniors) and is well worth the cost as the landscaping alone is worth viewing. When we were there a large section was under reconstruction so better is coming. Of course there were many orchids in flower and many fully labelled though not all. The golden arches are just delightful. The main body of the gardens offer many walking tracks. The day we were there was quite hot (it is Singapore). Ther are cooler ares and the main food court was much cooler. We found the rain forest walk very pleasant and it had some educational material which pointed out some very different features which were fascinating. For anyone interested in orchids this is a high priority.
,,Best Thing to Do in Singapore!!,5.0,,"This was our best activity in Singapore. Big place, magnificent grounds, varieties of plants, flowers and trees. Excellent food options. Easy to get to via SMRT. Good 3 hours of walking around, lots to see, and bring sun tan lotion and hats."

wonderful collection of tropical trees. The garden is also teaching the need of conservation of our forests and flora. Full of birds and squirrels. Surprisingly it is so close to Singapore's main shopping district Orchard. The garden is very well connected by public transport. Has public restrooms (very clean) and several restaurants and coffee shops. Very friendly and highly professional staff. Do not miss the Shop of Singapore Botanic garden"
,,Many things to do there,5.0,,It is one of our top 3 favourite places in Singapore. Always well maintained and you’ll be amazed by the varieties of plants. The swan lake keeps the kids entertained since they are babies. Bring your picnic mat and have a relaxing time with family and friends.

,,"Beautiful, Gorgeous, Botanic Gardens- an ""Optical Feast""!",5.0,,"This very large Park (206 acres) was founded in this same site, 160 years ago-- and has more visitors than any other Botanic Gardens in Asia!!

,,If you love Orchids - This is the Place,4.0,,Taxi does not come around here often if you are a tourist with no transport.Ask the reception/concierge at the exit to call a taxi for you as dont try hailing as it will take you long. If youhave Grab it works too. Its a nice garden full of orchids thats it.
,,Beautiful Manicured Flower Garden,5.0,,So far this is the most beautiful and best managed flower gardens that I had the pleasure to visit. We were there at 12 noon and the weather was very humid.

,,MUST VISIT UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDENS,5.0,,"Visitors to Singapore must include a visit to Unesco World Heritage Singspore Botanic Gardens (SBG). Established in 1859 SBG is said to be the most visited botanic gardens in the world.
Do not miss Swan Lake, National Orchid Garden, Rain forest and the learning forest.
This is the urban jungle locals, foreign residents and visitors go for morning and evening walks. In the morning, you will see many exercise groups,lead by a volunteer, going through their standard routines. On weekends it is the ""go to""place for simple
outdoor meals and activities.
Occasionally, free concerts are held on the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage. The
concerts have always been well attended.
Casa Verde is a favourite restaurant within SBG for breakfeast. For dinner go for Halia restaurant"
,,Botanic Excellence,5.0,,"What a great well designed garden . The trips inside it by shuttled meant you can see soo much. the fantastic sky gardens and easy walking inclines mean every age group can see it with out major effort .It is also easy to get to from hotels and circuit buses. A must see. No Graffiti, no cigarette butts, chewing gum or rubbish. An absolute pleasure to visit.
The number of plants and species was exceeded by the way they were dis played in a un natural environment but in turn as they would be found in habitat . the trick then is to have them so they can be viewed. plants that grow way above the forest floor in other plants could be viewed at eye level . unbelievable"
,,Tropical Garden,5.0,,An amazing tropical garden with native plants and also from the migrants countries such as China and India. The roads and pavement are well maintained. The medicinal garden is must to see. OnE can definitely feel the aroma of flowers in the air and it is an enthralling feeling. It would take minimum 2 hours to do a complete round.
,,"Superbly maintained, beautiful place to visit",5.0,,"These are beautiful gardens, a real must visit when in Singapore. There is so much to see and enjoy in these well designed and constantly developing gardens and no entrance fee - amazing. Give yourself 3 to 4 hours to cover the gardens well."
,,Fantastic park!! Must see when in Singapore.. !,5.0,,"Huge and perfectly maintained botanic garden. New themes every few years. Some real good restaurants inside the park. Long opening hours and the best of all: no matter when you are there and with how many, you always feel (AND ARE) perfectly safe to enjoy the park,s richness. And finally: the subway stops in the park"
,,Nice green area,5.0,,"One of my favourite places in Singapore is the Botanic Garden.
Going around January/February is also the best season as it is a bit cool with a nice breeze.
The garden is very spacious so you rarely feel that it is crowded even though there are a lot of tourists.
It is very enjoyable to take a walk and even have a picnic on the grass.
The best part is it doesn’t charge an entrance fee except for one specific garden.

If you have half a few hours to spare, I would definitely recommend this place. Avoid going around noon as it may get really hot."
,,A Magical Corner of Singapore,5.0,,"I remember being taken to the Botanic Gardens as a little boy and being scared by Kitty the huge turtle in the lake I went back at the age of 68 and Kitty or one of her daughters was still there! The Botanic Gardens at Singapore must be one of the most beautiful, and fascinating of all World Gardens Go and say hello to Kitty!"
,,Back to the Botanic Gardens,4.0,,"We came back to the Botanic Gardens for another visit today, together with the kids. Although scooters aren't allowed for adults, they don't seem to mind young kids using them and this certainly helps to avoid complaints about being tired with walking. Plenty to interest adults and children alike with the various plants and animals to see."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,Great oasis in the middle of the urban scenery. Only advice is to pre book a taxi or use the grab app. Taxis at the main entrance can avg up to 30min to wait for.

,,"Beautiful place, heritage Gardens !!!",5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is over 150 year old tropical garden. It is located very close to the famous Orchard Road shopping district. It is the only tropical garden that is honored as UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has won several other awards over the years.

The Gardens were founded in 1859 and played a critical role in the region's rubber trade boom in the early twentieth century, when its first scientific director Henry Nicholas Ridley, headed research into the plant's cultivation. At its peak in 1920s, the Malayan peninsula had control of over half of the global latex production.

The National Orchid Garden is situated within the main gardens. It houses the largest orchid collection of 1,200 species and 2,000 hybrids.

Singapore's botanic gardens is the only one in the world that opens from 5 a.m. to 12 midnight every day of the year. More than 10,000 species of flora is spread over its huge area. It is said that more than 4.5 million visitors annually.

There are several areas inside the garden which show the variety of trees and plants and their use. Must visit place in Singapore and needs atleast half a day to enjoy the place in true sense."
,,Original and surely best,5.0,,"Everyone seems to flock to Gardens by the bay, buying an expensive ticket when the bulk of the much older Botanic Gardens is free. Inside, the Orchid Garden is $5 (with concessions). It is truly wonderful even with its own original rainforest and boardwalks, not planted but there from before the garden was created.

Don't miss it just because it doesn't make as much noise as its newer rival."
,,amaizing experience,5.0,,"a must visit, but need time to appreciate the beauty and make time to rest in peace. great facilities and an oportunity to aquire knowledge on the well placed information."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"A great place to visit. The orchid garden is superb. Never tire of visiting here. Small admission fee to see orchids, park is free"
,,Day out,5.0,,"If you want to get away from it all this is the place for you. Be warned I doubt you will see it all in one day, big tip because your out in the open and the rain pours down in monsoons bring a good compact umbrella just in case. The park areas are used by local keep fit groups.
It has all the modern amenities food, toilets, exhibitions and displays. Speciality area is the orchard part.
You have easy access to all inside and car parking outside with contacts for taxis.
This park is astoundingly beautiful a camera is essential. No.payment needed for the general access but there is for the specialist areas such as the orchid area."
,,I loved every walkway,5.0,,"This is truly a special place in an over built concrete city, even though it appears very green, it is still lots of buildings. The garden has an amazing orchid garden, rainforest, ginger garden, etc.. every section was beautiful. There are birds, butterflies and dragonflies loving in this oasis. The cost is free but please donate to keep this place going."
,,Morning walk,5.0,,Beautiful scenery and a very peaceful location. Spent a few hours wandering around. Worth a visit even if it is really hot as plenty of shade.
,,Nice place to meet unspoiled and non-artificial Singapore Nature,5.0,,"One can spent several hours in this nice garden, and of course - the adjacent Orchid Garden. Everything is well - maintained, kept, designed. There are most of all asphalt tracks,but also some wooden pathways through the ""city jungle"". In march 2018 no mosquitoes, so no need to take precautions. There are some ponds, or even lakes, with swans and other fowl, and some wandering cocks in the ""jungle"". Different trees from different parts of the world, arranged in groups and thematically."
,,The Botanical Garden Singapore,5.0,,"For all plant lovers. If you are visiting Singapore, the Botanical Gardens are a must. My favorite part was the orchid garden with an array of colourful blooms from so many different varieties. It made my heart smile."
,,Free and enjoyable.,5.0,,"It is always a joy to visit this botanic garden. Free of charge to get in, but the place provides one with peace and tranquility. My favorite place to walk with my spouse."
,,Terrific place to visit,5.0,,Very extensive planting with lots of different types of areas giving hours of enjoyment. The orchid garden is within the area at a small charge but worth doing. Food and facilities are accessible and paths are wide to accommodate numbers of visitors. Look out for part of the original jungle which is surely a must to visit. Easy to get too and from by taxi
,,Amazing Botanical Garden!,5.0,,"I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful and spectacular this botanical garden is. This is a huge park that one can easily spend an entire day wondering thru. However, if you only have a few hours, then you definitely do not want to miss the Orchid Garden, which is a UNESCO world heritage site and easily worth the 5 S$D admission. I've never seen so many varieties and large blooms of orchids in my life. Everything is beautifully laid out along the well designed walking paths that highlight each species of orchid. This is something not to be missed when visiting the botanical garden. We will definitely return again next time we visit Singapore."
,,Great Even if you Aren;t a Plant Person,4.0,,"Personnally this was not my first choice, especially in the heat but a very nice leisurely stroll through the park offers opportunities not to be found anywhere else in the world."
,,Large,5.0,,We went expecting to spend a couple of hours here but could happily have been there all day but torrential rain all afternoon made us retreat. Will be our first priority if we go back to Singapore. Mixture of relaxing walking through various habitats and well presented and interesting information boards. The sculptures dotted around were also good.
,,Heavenly,5.0,,"I’m not a gardener but I do love them. This place is fantastic and so worth a visit. Choose a less hot day, cos there’s so much to see."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Really well laid out and beautiful gardens.with a vast range of plants.The orchid gardens are fantastic and the celebrity orchid garden is beautiful.There is so much to see allow at least two hours.
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"The Gardens are gorgeous and well worth a visit. But you need to plan. It’s hot and humid so early morning is best, especially to avoid the crowds in the orchid area. The orchids are beautiful but there are renovation works going on and it’s not as big as previously but it should be fabulous when finished.

The gardens r huge and there are several entries and exits. The shop near the orchid gardens are ridiculously busy as people enjoy the air con. It’s much better to visit the shop at the main gate away from the orchids - more choice, quiet no jostling or screaming kids!

You can get a taxi at the gates near the orchids easily - maybe a 5-10 min wait.

Well worth the visit!"
,,Most beautiful place in Singapore,5.0,,I shot my wedding pre-shoot here. It's so beautiful and great place to spend your leisure time. Will definitely visit again.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"It was very hot the day we walked around the botanic gardens, It would be terrific if there was more than one place you could buy a cold drink. Make sure up put at least 4 hours aside to do this walk its well worth the time but take plenty of water with you and don't be in a hurry"
,,Beautiful walk through the gardens,5.0,,We caught the MRT to Botanic Gardens stop and walked the 2.5km to the Orchard exit. We stopped for brunch at one of the restaurants. Great way to spend a morning and mingle among the locals exercising and relaxing.

,,Did you know banana is a type of ginger?,5.0,,"This is a great day out. Pack a picnic and come to enjoy this free attraction. There are loads of different gardens laid out in different styles, interspersed with lakes, water features and covered areas providing shade or shelter. Toilets and water fountains are plentiful and clean.
There is plenty of information about the plants and displays. Our favourite was the ginger garden where we discovered bananas were s ‘type’ of ginger. A great day out for all the family come rain or shine."
,,Beautiful! don't miss the orchids,5.0,,"I think we only saw a very small part of the gardens during a hop on hop off stop, but it's beautiful.

The gardens are free, with a 5 SGD add for the orchid garden which is definitely worth the cost.

On the Yellow line, Hippo bus."
,,Huge!,5.0,,Really beautiful place. I spent hours walking around and loved every minute. Well manicured and and peaceful. I highly recommend a visit plus it's free when most places like this are not.
,,A must visit,5.0,,"I throughly enjoyed walking around this beautiful park. It’s very relaxing and extremely well looked after. The best thing is it’s free!! You do have to pay for the orchid garden if you want to go in, it’s also worth it."

,,Botanic gardens worth visiting,5.0,,Specially don’t miss the Orchid gardens. We had a long hike late in the afternoon. It was hot even in December!
,,Really beautiful,4.0,,"We went there for the famed orchid garden, but got there just in time for buckets of rain to unleash from the sky. So we returned the next day and took the beautiful trek to the orchid garden (entrance fee $5 each). It's a bit of a hike but lush and awesome nonetheless.

We saw squirrels, turtles in the pond and a a black swan which you're not supposed to feed but we saw some ladies feeding the swan. So if a swan died, in the last two weeks, I suspect I know the culprits."
,,Green oasis,5.0,,"Early morning or late afternoon/evening paradise. Huge trees, tiny orchids, lovely lake, open space for concerts, jungle walk, and so many interesting varieties of plants and trees make this a garden of delights. I especially love the historical signs showing photos of when trees were first planted in the 1800s.
It's bigger area now , and a World Heritage Site.
Easy to get to by bus or MRT."
,,Just wonderful!!,5.0,,"All I can say is wow!

What a way to spend some quality time in beautiful Singapore.

Could easily have spent the whole day there, it's a credit to the city and no wonder they are a UNESCO world heritage site.

Take a visit and see for yourselves, you won't be disappointed!"
,,Lovely to run there in the morning,5.0,,"Regularly good running around 6am there. It is all free, open, well lit, and fragrant. The best way to start the morning. A full round run from Nassim gate to Botanic Gardens mrt and back down is abt 5km."
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"What a beautiful place, and free (orchard garden $1.00@ if over 60). The orchid gardens were beautiful, and if you look closely yout will see each is planted individually. Even the general gardens are beautiful, but the orchids are worth the trip by themselves"
,,Totally worth going to. Such beautiful gardens.,5.0,,"Free for most of the gardens. $5 for orchid garden section but SO worth it. Huge beautiful gardens. You'll love it if you like gardens, gardening, botany, flowers, or a nice walk in the park. You'll see plants you won't find in most parts of the world."

,,HOT but worth it,5.0,,"If you're gonna go, go during early morning or late evening because I made the mistake of going midday and it wasn't such a good experience sweating through my clothing, multiple times. The garden is exceptionally beautiful and so many good photo ops! There's a few areas where it's enclosed and do offer some reprieve to the humidity/heat."
,,Fun Times!,5.0,,We visited the new parts of the Jacob Ballas Children's Park and like on previous trips had a wonderful time. A great balance of lights exercise for the grown ups and fun activities for the kids.
,,"Luscious, tropical garden",5.0,,"Best explored in the cooler morning, the Singapore Botanical Gardens are lush, expansive and bright. Beyond the obvious show pony of the orchid garden are interesting corners to explore, revealing exotic flowers, canopies and sculptures. We spotted frogs, monitor lizards, dragon flies and bright orioles and sunbirds. For those who like photography, there are probably two mornings worth of things to see."
,,Singapore,5.0,,What a beautiful afternoon we had visiting this place. It is free unless you add the Orchid Garden. It is worth the small fee. Lots of places for photo ops! You can even have a picnic on the grounds in these beautiful surroundings!

,,One of few ways great ways to experience nature in Singapore,5.0,,"The botanical gardens is vast enough to experience woods in Singapore. Although fairly close to city center, you feel isolated inside and can experience different aspects. It's very quiet so it was pretty good for a peace of mind and good walk with fresh air."

,,Comparing the botanical garden I visit before,3.0,,"I have visited a few botanical garden before namely Penang Botanical Garden, Melbourne botanical garden and Perth Botanical Garden. Comparing the SG botanical garden with the rest of the botanical garden I visited before, the size is as big as the one in Melbourne. However, the trees and the flowers are quite distant apart from each others as compared to the one in Melbourne. That's also mean that some areas in the garden don't have any plants that worth to see. There is a lake inside the garden with a swan in it. There are plenty of picnic area in the garden as compared to other botanical gardens."
,,Botanical Gardens Deluxe!,5.0,,"You just have to visit these gardens if in Singapore. Easiest is to take the MRT to the station at the northern end of the gardens, where, the entrance is right next to you as you emerge from underground. Then you should walk the length of the gardens, coming out at the Tanglin Road entrance. From here it is a short walk to Orchard Street, down which you can walk until too hot, and take a taxi home! During the walk, the highlight for me on every visit is the Orchid garden, where one is always amazed at these most beautiful flowers. The gardens are also a great place to contemplate life, take it easy, chill, and reflect."
,,Wonderful gardens,5.0,,Orchid area stunning and well worth the small entry fee and the rest is well laid out and has the bonus of red squirrels and birds such as toucans

The place has an aura and aroma of fresh leaves/flowers/fruits, specially after a shower. Such gardens will be away from hustle & bustle. While this is true, reaching SBG is easy - just walking distance from Tanglin Mall or beginning of Orchard road. Park boasts of Plant varieties that are Majestic, long enduring & unique. Orchids are in plenty. Added to these are water based scenery. Overall 5/5 comparing this to Similar places WW."

,,Huge gardens and amazing variety,5.0,,Loved the gardens and the money paid for the orchid garden was worth every cent. It took my breath away. It is a lot of walking but the train stops at the gate. You could easily spend a full day and not see it all.
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,"We spent half a day walking around these gorgeous gardens. The jewel in the crown being the orchid garden.

Free entry & discounted price entry to the orchid gardens for seniors, was surprising.
It could be challenging, especially as some of the pathways were steep. Around every corner were more & more picturesque settings. Pristine everywhere. I think the most beautiful Botanical Gardens I have personally visited.

A wonderful day."

,,Changing landscape of Botanic Garden,4.0,,"It is amazing how Botanic Garden had so many beautiful changes in the last few years and is still an ongoing process as I write. It gives different flavours all in one garden. I frequent a lot as it is conveniently near my home. My husband teased that I have a wonderful big garden and I do not need one at home, all tendered nicely with loving care. It is also a place where I meet friends for a quick catch up. The weekend events also spiked up the activities with pleasant music filling the air
."
,,Overwhelming Unless You Pre-Plan,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens are wonderful, but cannot be digested in a single visual-and-intellectual feast, particularly if you plan on taking photos of anything beautiful, colourful, or spectacular. Both the garden’s sheer size and Singapore’s heat will work against you, I do have two recommendations to alleviate that issue, which I’ll make at the end of this review.

Tropical botanical gardens are always worth seeing. I’ve reviewed two others for TA: their similarities to the Singapore gardens are striking, but their differences are far more so: reflecting their different climates, locations, and collections. The Jardim Botanico in Rio de Janeiro (23 degrees S), the oldest of the three and a king’s private garden, focuses on Brazilian and Caribbean plants. Fairchild in Miami (26 degrees N) is the unluckiest: it’s collection was thoroughly devastated by major hurricanes twice, and its primary focus runs on plants from Bermuda to the Amazon. Singapore, on the other hand, is within 75 miles of the Equator, was an imperial city under the Raj, and is of course located on the opposite side of the globe. Singapore is not only (knock on wood) virtually typhoon-proof, but has reliable monsoons and abundant rainfall. Consequently, the look, feel, and flora on display of the Singapore Botanical Gardens is radically different from the other two, or any other tropical gardens.

You can discover quite a few reminders of the links to Old Blighty. Some areas of the gardens have carefully-maintained lawns (see Lawn photo) that with a bit of imagination, might remind you of Kensington Gardens, with Swan Lake taking the place of The Long Waters. Swan Lake also has a remarkable gazebo: British-made of cast iron around the time of the Sepoy Mutiny, and shipped off to the Old Admiralty House in the early decades of Queen Victoria’s reign. The gazebo is not only photogenic itself, but provides a splendid view of Swan Lake (see Gazebo 1 and Gazebo 2 photos). I should, however, warn you that both I and my charming companion were quite disappointed with Swan Lake: we didn’t see a single ballerina.

On the other hand, we were both delighted with Cave Falls; after looking in at it from the outside, we scurried around and looked out at it from the inside, which was blessedly cool and refreshing, a rare commodity out-of-doors in Singapore (see Cave Falls photo).

There are grimmer reminders of history in the garden. During the Japanese occupation, Japanese administrators took over control of the gardens, renamed them Shogon Gardens, and put British and Commonwealth POWs to work building brick steps (you can still see them just a bit northeast of the Frangipani Collection).

SBG has dozens of sub-gardens: healing gardens, ginger gardens, gardens focusing on traditionally important Malayan plants, and so on. The amount of information you could obtain—if you only had enough time—is overwhelming. I was quite surprised to learn that tumeric is not only a member of the ginger family, but the most valuable one in world trade; and, having once heard somewhere that tumeric had been used as a traditional dye for bright yellow Buddhist robes and other fabrics, I was intrigued to see a live tumeric plant, which was of course full of chlorophyll and bright green: the “tumeric yellow” bit comes from its underground rhizome (see Tumeric photo). There’s lots of remarkable tropical foliage to be seen, of course, (see Tropical Foliage photo), and impressive tropical flora from other continents, including a mahogany tree planted 40 years ago by Prime Minister Lee in his drive to make Singapore a city in a garden (see African Mahogany Tree photo). And you’ll see human ingenuity at work: fountains backed by artistically-arranged flora (see Fountain photo), an Elizabethan garden, and, of course, new, unique orchids invented right here. (TripAdvisor rightly considers the National Orchid Garden a separate attraction, and I’ll review it separately.)

However, even without the Orchid Garden, unless you’re an ardent gardener or professional botanist, your mind will numb over and legs give out long before you could possibly absorb everything here. I can think of two ways to overcome that challenge, depending on your schedule:

First: the garden is free, and open from 0500 to 2400 daily: nineteen hours a day. If you’ll be in Singapore for an extended period of time, you could revisit the Botanical Gardens often, wandering in around dawn or a hour before sunset, from either Tanglin Road or Bukit Timah, and focusing on one or two specific gardens. Repeat visits don’t cost you anything, and in the long term your rambles would be more pleasant and more informative.

Or two: if your schedule restricts you to one visit, perhaps only for three or four hours total, I’d recommend that you connect to the Singapore Botanical Gardens website before you even arrive in Singapore. Download the map and check out the guides, and then game out in advance a walking itinerary of the garden areas you’d most like to see within the time you can afford.

Disappointing as it is not to be able to do a comprehensive tour in a single visit, don’t miss this one! Go see as much as you can of this tropical paradise, particularly if you’re on holiday from someplace like Munich, Moscow, Minnesota or Manitoba."
,,Very quiet and relaxing,5.0,,"If you want a quiet walk and relax in the park this place is it. It's 6 acres of garden. Clean toilets are available at different areas in the park, together with a small restaurant. It's a shame the Orchid garden is not free but I guess they need money to maintain the place."
,,Was joy to come back here !,4.0,,Loved coming here for morning walks ! Love this place. Wish we could have come few more times. Will definitely miss it.
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"The most beautiful botanic garden that we ever visited, with a wonderful orchid garden, with a real rainy forest, parks, lakes...it's a must do in Singapore."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"This sprawling botanic garden is highlighted by the National Orchid garden which, for a flower lover, is a must. I recommend that you take a hat and bring water as the stroll through the gardens can be taxing for those who are not used to the heat or the humidity. There are plenty of shops and a couple of restaurants for those who will need a break. Apart from the gardens themselves, the highlight for us was, on this Sunday morning, was watching the local family groups enjoying time together by playing games and having picnics."
,,Picnic with friends,5.0,,"Outside the downtown a garden with enough space to have and spend enjoying and funny time with friends.
The orchids garden section is always a pleasure to visit at any time of the year (i never miss it!!)
Peaceful place compare to ""garden by the bay""."
,,Absolute must to visit,5.0,,"What a fabulous and well laid out place. We wandered through the whole park enjoying the bonsai and other gardens as well as the exceptional orchid garden. Interesting facts are available on individual trees and plants.

There is a small fee for the orchid garden(tiny for seniors) and is worth every penny. Beautiful and well kept with excellent informative signs. We loved it"
,,Wow gardens,5.0,,"If you like parks and gardens, then you'll love this. They have all different kinds of walks to enjoy."
,,Lovely orchids and slice of greenery in a highrise country.,5.0,,"These gardens are used by locals and a nice visit for tourists. There are kids school visits, picnics, walkers, etc... There are roosters, fish in ponds and lots of flowers, plants and trees."
,,Magnificent gardens,5.0,,I have been there many times the gardens are very well kept and the orchids are absolutely amazing. They also have a lovely restaurant in the gardens and the food is superb.
,,So much to see!,5.0,,"You really do need a few hours here to enjoy walking around these beautiful gardens. There is so much to see, excellent for all ages. We spotted squirrels and lizards as we wondered round. There are clearly marked paths and signage, lots of places to grab a bite to eat or drink and benches to rest your weary legs everywhere. Make sure you have a map of the gardens with you to navigate. Good walking shoes a must as they are quite big and you end up walking all over so you don’t miss anything. Photo op: as you enter on the right hand side of the path you’ll see a little waterfall, you can walk carefully behind this in a little cave and get someone to take a picture of you - something a little different!"
,,Magical,5.0,,"These gardens are just beautiful especially at twilight. A great way to unwind from a long trip of destress from a busy schedule. They are designed for walking and quiet contemplation, include some nice bits of history and of course, for the gardeners among us, there is a lot to learn from the labels on the different plantings. You can have lunch or dinner in one of several nice little restaurants where the food is quite good and the relaxation complete."
,,Awesomely beautiful orchid garden,5.0,,"We had an enjoyable, relaxing walk through the 24-hectare beautiful tropical gardens. Singapore Botanic Gardens tropical park comprised of three gardens was originally formed in 1859. It is home to the National Orchid Garden, Rainforest, and Ginger Garden. The orchid garden is home to over 1,000 species and twice that number of hybrids. Some of the rainforest trees predate the formation of the gardens and were part of the jungle that existed over 160 years ago. There are walking trails throughout the gardens, and on Saturdays (other than the fifth Saturday of any month), free guided tours are conducted by volunteers. Creatures/reptiles we saw on our walk included fish, turtles, geckos, snakes, frogs, colourful birds (including crimson sunbirds, waterhens, kingfishers, swans, pink-necked green pigeons, cuckoos and many more), squirrels, otters, and more. There are statues (including a statue of Chopin at a piano) and pieces of art spread around the gardens. Some plant areas are caged in, I assume for protection from birds and other creatures."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"Beautiful botanic garden, peaceful, well maintained, lush! Gorgeous orchids.
The ginger garden is also very interesting; so many different species. There’s a lot of walking, but so much worth it. Not sure if it’s ok for disabled people though. Saw a huge huge lizard, almost like a Komodo dragon crossing a path."
,,A lovely walk in a lovely place,5.0,,"A must do while in the area, really beautiful and well manicured gardens and a very beautiful setting, really enjoyed the whole atmosphere and experience."
,,Nature Park,4.0,,"Singapore is the city of gardens. Nature lovers enjoy Singapore only because of gardens like Gardens of the Bay and especially Singapore Botanical Garden. Tourists double decker buses are the best way to visit Singapore's major attractions. Before entering on Orchard Road, tourist bus stop at Botanical Garden and it attracts the visitors by it's beauty."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This is free to enter and is serviced by hop on and hop off buses and taxis as it’s a distance from the city centre. There are beautiful places to see with explanations, plus places to eat. It’s very hot so early morning is the best time to be outside."
,,Very nice garden!,4.0,,"This is a very nice botanical garden with many species of trees and plants. If you want to get away from the noise, crowd, and the ritz and razmatazz of Singapore, this is a nice place to head to. You can spend several hours of peace and quiet. Of course, you really need to get to the centre of the botanic gardens to escape the hum of traffic.
This World heritage Site is definitely worth visiting"
,,Relaxing,4.0,,Very tranquil and relaxing place after the hustle and bustle of the city. The gardens are very well cared for and worth a visit.
,,So charming,4.0,,"Singapore is hot and humid, detracting many to visit. But it's very homely. Amazing for the nature lovers : frogs, monitors, fowl, birds, even dogs. Pleased to have braved the elements."
,,Fantastic Free Place to Visit for Families,5.0,,We loved the Botanic Gardens. The childrens gardens in particular was a lot of fun and best of all....its free to visit. The gardens are beautifully maintained and one of the best I've ever seen.
,,Beautiful Orchid garden,5.0,,"Wow, what a beautiful place, just in the middle of the city.
It's impressive that you can find such a beautiful park in a big city.
inside the park its really quiet and you don't notice the busy road that leads to Orchid road....

Worth to notice is the rainforest that's in the middle of the garden, this is an original piece of rainforest that has been saved, highly recommended!

You can walk around the park and go wherever you want to, there are multiple entrances.
The turtle lake in the middle of the park is beautiful, the amount of turtles is insane :-)

This botanic garden is highly recommended as crowds are really minimal and the park is large."
,,Exquisite orchids a major feature,5.0,,"Take a leisurely walk around this magnificent garden. However, do not miss the unique orchid feature garden. See flowers you can only imagine. Worth finding the tree that features on the $5 note....this adventure takes you on an interesting walk past statues and makes it all worth while."
,,Lovely Gardens,5.0,,Do this in the morning before it gets too hot. Lovely gardens to wander around. You can spend from a few hours to all day if you wish
,,Beautiful especially in the morning,5.0,,"In the morning we went for a walk through the gardens that was busy with locals exercising, walking dogs and doing Tai chi . It’s beautiful and worth a visit"
,,National Heritage,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is the first UNESCO Heritage Site in Singapore. Opening Hours are 5 am to 12 midnight daily and admission is free. Ethnobotany garden has about 300 kind of plants. Its orchid garden has about 1000 species. There is a children garden for adventure and play. Other Attractions include Library of Botany and Horticulture , Heritage Museum , and Healing Garden . A very good pass time."
,,A pleasant place to visit,4.0,,"A peaceful place blended with nature, plants, flowers, forest, lake and many mores. This garden consists of orchid garden, ginger garden, children garden, rain forest etc. Except for the orchid garden (entrance fees of $5/person) other areas are free to public. The attraction is also a part of world heritage site and have places to eat and drink with a good visitors center, caring of visitors. Loved this and highly recommended to visit."
,,Beautiful serene landscape,5.0,,"The place is peace haven in an otherwise busy city. The greens, the landscape, the aura of the gardens is majestic. One cant miss spending a few hours in the quiet of the gardens when visiting."
,,Couple of hours to kill,3.0,,"We spent a couple of hours wandering around the gardens on a hot Monday Morning- killing time before our flight back to London .
We just went with the flow and ended up at the lovely Orchid Garden - which had a small entrance fee of 5 dollars.
We’ve been to Singapore on many occasions but never visited the gardens as to be honest it was pretty low on our list of things to do - however we are glad to have now experienced it .

Would recommend- but there are other attractions much more interesting - Gardens by the Bay !
Do if you have a spare couple of hours and go with low expectations - it’s not Kew Gardens ."
,,Lovely! We see something new each time,5.0,,"The gardens are close to where we live and we thoroughly enjoy visiting. We always see new things - birds, flowers, views etc and we are not tired yet!

That said, beware the Swan Lake. It is extremely deep. We know this because this morning a German tourist accidentally tipped a pram, his backpack and consequently himself, into the pond. And my Husband plus another passer-by had to haul him out. No harm done, I hope, but we did learn no showers in the gardens!"
,,Brilliant peaceful oasis in the heart of the city,5.0,,We loved this wonderful oasis of peace and calm on the doorstep of the overwhelming city of Singapore
,,Pleasant but KEEP OFF THE GRASS,1.0,,"Heard so much about it that the family decided to go for a picnic in a week day. The kids, 14 & 9 started playing badminton for fun on the grass with a shuttlecock and rackets (no net) and nobody around. We could see old pensioners spying on them (apparently there are lots of them in the park working as spy's to report to the park security force). Sure enough a buggy of park state troopers arrived and told us to get off the grass as playing was not allowed. Back's up Singapore as being a ""no"" land: no playing, no going on the grass, no having fun.

Kinds of defeats part of the object of going to the park!"
,,Pleasantly surprised!,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit! Better than Gardens by the Bay in the Cloud forest and flower Dome! Cheaper and beautiful.
,,Beautiful and worth paying to see the Orchids,4.0,,"The gardens are beautiful and so well kept. You could spend so much time here!

The Orchid garden is amazing, so well laid out and so well looked after. Part of it is currently closed for renovations so we had to miss some bits but it should be great when it’s finished."
,,AMAZING!!! :),5.0,,"We went on our last full day as we’d had enough of the endless shopping malls and tourist stuff - and wow what a treat!

The botanic gardens are stunning and really interesting - lots of different sections and themes, such as: medicine plants, ceremonial plants, foliage (which felt like you’re in Jurassic Park!), a fragipani garden, palm tree valley, and so on. And of course in the middle is the very beautiful orchid garden.

It’s absolutely stunning both during the day and at night - go and heal your soul in the middle of a big city!

The gardens in general are free - one only has to pay SGD$5 to enter the Orchid Gardens - which is definitely worth it! This was the cheapest thing we did in Singapore and it was also the best By Far!!!

Start at the end where the MRT station is (handily located at the entrance of the garden) and work your way down to the Orchard Road end where you can exit / enter via Tanglin Gate. There’s so much to see, and guides handing out free maps - you won’t regret it! :)

We also stopped for a quick bit at The Bees Knees cafe inside the gardens which was also great! :)

Next time we will come here again on the first day - not the last."
,,An oasis of tranquility in a bustling city,5.0,,"These gardens are architectural masterpieces. They offer a lot of information about plants and trees from all over the world and - what surprised us - some very nice places to rest surrounded by nature. Families and teenagers take picnic there and enjoy the tropical climate. My wife and I liked, beside the Swan Lake area, the Healing Garden and the Orchid Garden. The gardens are easily accessible by MRT or bus and the entrance is free, except the Orchid Garden which is also worthwhile to visit."
,,hacteres of beautiful planst and flowers,5.0,,"a great place to visit, with a large Orgid garden with very much nice Orgids. The garden is not only large but also beautifull designed with plants and trees from all over the world."
,,Free to visit and away from the madding crowd!,5.0,,"It's an oasis in a concrete jungle. Please visit if you want some respite and breathing room. Best of all, it's completely free if you bring a picnic mat and a couple of drinks and sandwiches.

Lovely green lung of Singapore, and a nice romantic walk if you love trees and nature. Please be kind, pick up your trash though. Pro tip: Check the weather forecast first, because we only have 2 types of it - hot and/or wet."
,,Outstanding collection of orchids growing outdoors,5.0,,"Easy to access and price of entry is very cheap for such an attraction, where world class orchids are seen growing naturally outside. Photos are a must to record the quality of plants seen."
,,Lovely,4.0,,"The Botanical Gardens in Singapore is a place to spend several hours. Lots of food options, beautiful resting places, relaxed and tranquil. You can pay extra to visit various extra zones but it’s quite lovely even without the extra add-ons. The highlight for us was seeing a water monitor basking in the sunshine and eating alongside the water’s edge. Beautiful fauna and flora ensuring a relaxed few hours."
,,Little piece of paradise,5.0,,"A lovely respite from the concrete jungle. A great place for a walk, exercise or just to take in some serenity. Highly recommended."
,,Beautiful and easily walkable,4.0,,"Beautiful greenery and a nice walk. The walk is quite easy and looks further on the map than it actually is! Very comfortable trails. Beautiful bridges and boardwalks. Quite far out of the city centre. Don’t expect anything particularly spectacular - just a beautiful, relaxing, scenic walk"
,,Sunday outing,5.0,,Enjoyed the beauty of different flowers and looks like a paradise to us.. But due to bad weather (heavy rain) we didnt enjoy much our visit!
,,Walk on Week end,5.0,,"Spending a weekend in this park with family, it turned out to be fun. This park is very beautiful with a variety of plants in it. We only need to pay to see orchid, and then it's free. A very large park, and we spent half a day here."
,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,I am not into gardening and I was impressed by this place. Stunning and beautiful a great place to go for a walk. If you are into plants then an absolute must do. If your not still worth going
,,Very peaceful walk,4.0,,"Lots of green with a variety of plants. You can easily spend half a day there. The National Orchard Garden is within, but is a $5 sgd admission fee. It is worth it."
,,Another great half day,5.0,,An excellently landscaped garden with a huge variety of plants grouped usefully eg. bamboos together. It's a full 4h to get around it all but there are alternative shorter loops. Best seen just after rain but I found it too humid to do all.
,,Disappointing visit,3.0,,"This was the one place friends recommended. Although nice and pleasant to walk round was disappointed by poor (and in the main) labelling of plants and trees.most labelling that did exist was rather old and often just the Latin name. The Evolution garden particularly disappointing. We went in at the wrong end, which could have been avoided with better signage. There's a general timeline at the entrance plus a couple of descriptive boards later, but that's it. Definitely not a description of how the evolutionary process worked, could have been so much better.
Good if you like Orchids but again a but more description of how the grew in their natural habitat would have added to the experience"
,,A brilliant excursion,5.0,,These gardens are so pretty. You have to pay for the orchid garden but the rest is free. A must for a trip to Singapore.
,,Tremendous Walks,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful grounds with lots of different areas with individual foci (orchids, evolution, ginger, spices and herbs , etc.) Clean, open and immaculately maintained. Free and right off the metro!"
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens and Orchid center was a wonderful place to visit. It is probably better done on its own instead of on a tour to give one more time to see much of it.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,What a fantastic way to walk off some of the excesses of Singaporean cuisine. Park staff super helpful and friendly. Gardens beautiful especially the orchid garden which was worth the small entry fee. Could spend a full day here wondering - the rain forest walk around was especially good.
,,Best place for a Long walk,4.0,,"We are so fortunate to have these beautiful gardens to walk in no matter what time of day as the trees and vegetation provide shade even at noon when other spots llike Gardens by the Bay would be humid and scorching. Here the trellis garden for instance provides a natural leafy overhang while the tropical rain forest with its gigantic banyan and meranti trees construct a canopy. The soft twittering of birds is soothing while a chance sighting of a magnificent cockerel pecking at the undergrowth is most welcome.
Signage is good, you’ll never get lost, and the botanical features are explained in some detail as you walk past interesting species.
Particularly love the helicon, so bright and luscious, slim bamboo groves and banana trees, so tropical while the lake has some little statues like the little boy holding a turtle, cute. Then, you might come across a couple of black swans waddling up from their swim!
Cafes are quite over priced, Casa Verde and Halia, for instance, and we’re not even talking about the gourmet Corner House which is very fine dining. Best to bring your own picnic or take the MRT to Serangoon, Paya Lebar or Chinatown for less exorbitant and more varied fare. The water fountain near the entrance is appreciated though as are the well-designed toilets which suit the open-air environment."
,,gardens are gardens,3.0,,"Seen one botanical garden yourve seen the all, there are lots of runners and yapping dogs when we walked around so it wasn’t pleasant, the gardens are nice but not much else to see or do, so of the flowers were nice PS watch where you step"
,,Love love love the Botanic and Orchid Garden,5.0,,"We have visited the Botanic many times and it never disappoints, for me it’s the No 1 attraction and its free... Each time you go there is something new to discover. This time we also visited the Orchid Garden which is partly under renovation. Still worth your time, free for residents and only 5$ for tourists. We picked a sunny day and the blue skies were just phenomenal. The many Orchid varieties are just stunning."
,,Must See gardens,5.0,,These are beautifully prepared gardens on the edge of Singapore and easily reached using the Hop-on/Off bus. A nice tranquil walk which can take minutes or hours. Recommended for relaxation.
,,Amazing experience in the Park,5.0,,"The Botanic Garden is Huge, you can spend easily half day there. If you are like with the weather condition, it s so nice to have a walk around, have some break in the bar inside and continue the journey in this wonderful place."
,,So peaceful,5.0,,"Came early one morning so peaceful . Do not miss Orchid House it amazing so beautiful .
The gardens are free and so big .
Had lovely breakfast in wooden building with squirrels just in the trees near by.
All trees plants have names on very interesting you could spend hours here.
Loved it ."
,,A garden treasure!,5.0,,"Huge expanse of gardens, well set out & organised into areas such as healing, rainforest etc. Don't miss the National Orchid Garden... it is just stunning."
,,One of the best!,5.0,,"Living in Singapore, I visit the Botanical Gardens at least one a month. Mainly for getting in a bit of exercise and to take in the spectular surroundings. A truly beautiful place that is very well maintained and sign posted. If you are lucky, you may also come upon an Iguana during your visit. Definitely in the top 3 things to do in Singapore. If visiting on a weekend, get there early as it does get packed!!"
,,Space of tranquility,5.0,,"Very Calm and so nicely designed, Go to the National Orchid Garden when you are here. Take your time and dont stress."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"We visited this place on a Sunday afternoon. It is gorgeous! There were 2 different couples having their wedding pictures taken there. The best part is that there is no fee to enter this garden, and you can spend a long time there. There were some families having picnics on the grass. It was easy to reach by public transportation. I recommend this place."
,,Stunning Gardens...and free!!!,5.0,,"We had such a amazing walk around this large park...for free!!! The MRT ( subway) is literally at the entrance to the park. There are little eateries and cafes along the way ( to get out of the heat for a while). I would recommend paying the $5 to see the Orchid Gardens. Absolutely breathtaking. So many to see, so many varieties and colours."
,,Gardeners paradise,5.0,,Superb gardens. Lots to see plenty of places to sit and a couple of nice cafes. Very interesting plants and trees.
,,Beautiful flowers and cool wildlife,5.0,,"The gardens are very large with a variety of different plants. They have spices, healing gardens, ponds and orchid gardens. The orchid gardens were beautiful and when walking past the lakes we saw otters playing in the lake and a large group of terrapin turtles which were quite funny. There were also some cool water monitor lizards hiding round in the bushes. Only downside was that we didn't go at the right time of the year and so some of the flowers we wanted to see weren't in bloom. But that's nothing to do with the gardens. I would also strongly suggest wearing proper shoes as their is a lot of walking involved. But definitely a nice activity."
,,Beautiful and free,5.0,,"My husband is in horticulture so our visits to a new place usually includes a botanical garden. Beautifully done and it’s free. The only admission is for the orchid gardens if you want to go in. But it’s not necessary there’s plenty to see if you wish to not go in. Peaceful. Lots of information. We really enjoyed it. Highly recommend. And it’s on the transit line. Just get on the train and off at
That station. For $3.60 two people return."
,,If you love plants and flowers this is the place for you!,5.0,,What a great place to spend your hours strolling around the beautiful Botanic gardens. Free to enter and easy to get to. It is a must for a Singapore visit.
,,beautiful gardens,5.0,,"The gardens are beautiful, not crowded at all, and have nice restaurants for lunch or dinner. Parking is convenient."
,,Orchid Garden is Special,5.0,,Great stroll around a tropical oasis. 15 mins to wander round and enjoy. A must on your visit to Singapore
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,The orchid gardens are particularly worthwhile. They are well kept and provide easy access for those less able.
,,Orchid garden is beautiful,4.0,,We literally took a half hour stop here from our hop on/hop off tour to see the Orchid garden as we’re not really the “garden types” but could still appreciate the work that goes to maintaining such a beautiful space. Wish the teens complained less about the heat/humidity to spend more time there
,,World class botanic garden !,5.0,,"My hubby and I took the circle line on the SMRT to Botanic Gardens, went up the escalators and the entrance to the gardens was right there.
I loved the people exercising doing tai chi, aerobics, running and walking.
It was truly an incredible few hours.
The gardens are free and cannot be missed."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Lovely green space in the middle of the glitz and glamour of Singapore. We went there for a nice walk in the morning. Very easy access from the car park, great ambience and overall a lovely experience. The orchid garden was truly mesmerising. It is an easy walk and we also had a nice breakfast at the restaurant."
,,Wonderful gardens,4.0,,What a wonderful collection of gardens and plants. We enjoyed our visit here after the singapore zoo. Would recommend to plant lovers.
,,Always a blast !,5.0,,Must see ! I always stop by when in Singapore ! So nice and peacefull ! And must go to the National Orchid Garden located inside !!!
,,Just lovely gardens.,5.0,,These gardens were much more impressive than my research led me to believe. The attached National Orchid Gardens are spectacular--don't miss. This very extensive garden is a great outdoor place to walk through after a long international flight--getting outdoors in daylight really helps jet lag!
,,Not be be missed,5.0,,"What a lovely, relaxed day we experienced with the MRT station Botanic Gardens the way to go there. We were also lucky enough to see a wedding & see the national flower of Singapore - Vanda Miss Joaquim. Plenty of shade to sit in the cool when the legs need a rest too. Gift shop not to be missed for a souvenir of your Singaporean holiday & simply, just a great day out."
,,The Most Amazing Flowers...,5.0,,"One of the great things about Singapore's climate is that you can grow just about anything all year. Here you can see the gorgeous flowers from the title... as well as trees, and several plants this desert girl would describe as exotic! This is a MUST SEE in Singapore!"
,,An Oasis for Humanity,5.0,,"This UNESCO Cultural Heritage Site made us feel like we were in a slice of Paradise on earth . Here Nature and Man co- exist in harmony . A place for family picnics , bonding , or just a me time for those who are seeking for serenity . This is said to be Asia’s Best Urban Jungle . No admission fee except for the orchid garden."
,,Beautiful well attended gardens,5.0,,"To try and beat the heat of the day we arrived at the Botanic Gardens by 8:30 am via the SMRT, even at this time of day it is warm and very humid and visitors already appear hot and sweaty. From the moment we walked through the lovely gates of the gardens we knew we were in for a real treat of nature and beautiful gardens, inside the gates are a collection of information boards and a map of the gardens. The gardens cover over 82 hectares including lakes and showcase over ten thousand different varieties of plant types and an array of themed gardens: Trellis Garden, Foliage Garden, Healing Gardens and more. Scattered throughout the gardens are a number of beautiful garden art installations and statues. From the entrance of the garden near the Botanic Gardens SMRT station it is over 1.3 kilometres to the National Orchid garden, easily walkable at a slow pace to avoid getting too sweaty. I am very pleased that we were able to squeeze into our itinerary a visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens which I much preferred to the Gardens by the Bay."
,,A walk in the heavenly park,5.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens been inscribed as an UNESCO heritage site and it's definitelt not to be missed when visiting Singapore. It's large garden features many trees and plants which were the results of over 100 years of hard work. It was founded in 1859 and definitely has alot to offer in terms showcasing some of the regions trees and plants.
,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,Botanical gardens are beautiful. Pay a few Singapore dollars extra for entry into the stunning orchid gardens. You won't be disappointed.
,,Nature at its best,5.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens is a UNESCO heritage site. Its spread over a large area with a vast variety of flora. Its a must viist place for nature lovers and people who want to go for long walks in the lap of nature. The orchid gardens displays the rare orchids.
,,The stunning gardens.,5.0,,"An absolute must see for anyone who loves flora or nature.
The gardens are kept to a spectacular standard, and the colours are a sight to behold. There is a small charge to visit the orchards, but so worth it for their sheer beauty and amazing variety. Wear comfortable shoes as plenty of walking is involved. A truly wonderful world heritage site."
,,UNESCO World Heritage Gem,5.0,,"This place is easily worth a half to full day. If you are there in December, you might get stuck in an incredible afternoon downpour (monsoon rains). The gardens are incredibly well maintained and lush. The variety of species of flora are just stunning. You will marvel at this lovely garden. Pure joy!"
,,Good for walking,5.0,,"We enjoyed Orchid, Concert, light food, and forest in this garden. We enjoyed walking and we found many dogs in the morning time, they also enjoyed walking in the garden."
,,A must-visit venue for all ages,5.0,,"I have visited this botanic park solo for a jog, as a couple, with younger kids, as a family with teenagers, for work reason, etc.
It is a very versatile park that is only 8mins from Orchard Road. Less if the traffic flows faster during non-peak hours.
NParks team of gardeners are constantly coming up with new themes for tourists, so even for those who have visited will find other reasons to visit aside from the regular attraction of Orchid Gardens or Bonsai collection etc.
The park is huge and not possible for a family to cover all areas in one day, unless actively jogging around. Also, the humidity would force a family to stop for drinks and rests.
Would recommend each petson carries an umbrella to shield from the sun, or rains.
To truly experience the two main quadrants of the park, and admire the squirrels, lizards and birds of the park on close encounter, I would recommend at least 4-5hrs for each quadrant especially if prefer to do it at a leisurely pace with stops for drinks at cafe and toilet stops to freshen up because if you are not sweating from the humidity, then either it is a cool/rainy day or you have faulty sweat glands!! :p
Have fun!!"

The different habitats the garden were all amazing an contrasted each other, We were amazed by the number of different types of Palm trees, rhododendrons, the cactus garden was interesting too. There is a busy road on one side of the garden, but we hardly heard the noise from the traffic, the garden is a peaceful jewel in a busy city.

We did visit the orchid gardens which was well worth the S$5 admission fee. There were plenty of places to sit and admire the orchids and many shelters to rest from the sun or shelter from the rain.

We saw many local people jogging, taking children for a walk, it was nice to see locals using the gardens like a local lark.

There were several information areas through out the park and several shops with a good variety botanical themed gifts. There were also several restaurants and cafes with meals to suit all budgets.

The gardens are professionally manicured and maintained well despite the hot humid weather. We were lucky to have picked a cloudy, cool day to wander around the gardens. The foot paths around the gardens are wide enough that gave a sense of spaciousness despite the number of visitors present that particular morning. Beautiful surprises within the gardens that were worth the couple of hours spent there. Drink plenty of fluids and umbrellas came in handy to provide shade from the sun and shelter from the rain."
,,Lovely place to get over jetlag,5.0,,"We landed at Changi at 0640 in the morning from Europe. Hotel room wasn’t ready til 1pm so we walked the 2km to the Botanic Gardens.

See separate review of the Orchid Garden which is inside the park."

The width of the teunk and the height of the trees. Large fish in swan lake although there were only 2 swans. The orchid garden was the main attraction. As we approached the orchid garden, it started rain hard so we sought shelter in halia cafe where our very attentive waiter Allan suggested some refreshing and unusual drink concoctions. Prepare a lot of memory for the pictures of the orchid garden. U must see it for yourself. Words cant describe it."
,,Amazing experience and beautifully looked after,5.0,,"This was a really great experience.
It covers a bigger area than we anticipated so pack some chilled water.
The piece de resistance is the Orchid Garden which is the only paying part of the experience (food, drinks apart!).
But at $5 for an adult it’s extremely good value.
They also have a special rate for Seniors.
There’s lots to see outside the Orchids and is a really beautiful place to visit.
If you like Orchids then this is the place to go especially as they are the National flower of Singapore as well.
There are rest rooms available plus plus you can get something to eat and drink there."
,,Nice stroll through quiet place,5.0,,"I can imagine gardens to be quite crowded on usual day, however when we visited, it was raining lightly so there were not that many people around. That and light reflection on wet leaves and blossoms gave gardens whole new look and feel. It was my second visit and as it happened during different part of the year gardens looked and felt very different too. If I could recommend, come as early in the morning as you can. Temperature is best and there’s fewer people."
,,Just Stunning!,5.0,,"This has to be one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. I can see why these gardens are World Heritage listed! Seriously, if you are visiting Singapore take the short (and cheap) taxi ride out to these wonderful gardens for a very different Singaporean experience. You can take the MRT to the gardens but there is a short walk (about 1-2 km) to the gardens and it is hot and humid. I found it best getting a taxi straight to the gate that gives you the closest access (i.e. the gate next to) the National Orchid gardens. The Nation Orchid Gardens (within the property) are like a fairyland with over 6000 different species of orchid. The Ginger garden next to this orchid garden is also stunning. If you have time, check out the rest of the gardens. I found the healing garden fascinating. I went back to the gardens the next day. The second time, I went just after it rained and it was much cooler. There place is relatively flat and so is easy for the elderly to get around and people with young children in strollers/prams. There are also easily accessible toilets and cafes. The staff at the information desks at each gate are extremely helpful. These gardens are 'zen' and spectacular in equal measure!"
,,Highly recommend,5.0,,This was recommended to us to make sure we visit and we are glad we did. We had so much fun and there is so much to see. A must see.
,,Stunning as ever,5.0,,"Third visit over several years, and always fantastic. Words cannot really describe the beauty of this attraction. Beware of the heat when planning a visit. A must visit when in Singapore."
,,Blooms are amazing,5.0,,The flowers and blooms change according to the season. Its a very popular place for joggers throughout the day. There is also a new wing that I much prefer than the bandstand area.
,,Interesting,3.0,,"We visited as it was close by to our hotel and it is a world heritage sight. We decided to walk around in the heat of the day, maximum humidity but the gardens are lovely, lots of places to walk and lots of things to see if you like parks. I was uncomfortable with the heat/ humidity but on a cooler day, it would have been a lovely place to walk and chillax. Well worth a visit."
,,Walk in Nature,4.0,,"The Botanical Gardens is always a special place for me. The gardens are large and you can spend some hours strolling with this nature sanctuary for the senses. On the other hand, its a great place for a run or even a bit of Tai Chi practice. Tranquil surroundings. Beautiful calming nature at its best."
,,Beautiful gardens - and free!,5.0,,"Unlike most botanic gardens, there is no entry fee here - it's a huge public park. Beautifully maintained, tidy and spotlessly clean. Plants and treet are labelled and there are enough information boards to explain the different areas and help find your way around. The National Orchid Gardens within the park (for which there's a fee, but only $5) are stunning. Some nice cafes for a meal or a drink too."
,,A nice place to spend couple of hours,4.0,,"I think its one of the least crowded place in Singapore and we liked. Start at Botanic garden MRT station entry and walk way up to the Orchid Garden. Its around 1.4 Km walk. Its humid out there but we didn't get much tired. Its no extravagant but just a nicely maintained park with lake, turtles and lot of plant species. There is a children garden too but we found it to be closed on Monday. The Orchid garden is just awesome, with every place so picture perfect."
,,Amazing Gardens,5.0,,"This is an amazing well planned and maintained gardens. It’s vey large and free to enter, approx 2.7km long.
If you arrive by taxi or a city tour bus you will ideally land in the centre and by careful planning you can take a route to see a lot in 3 to 4 hours and migrate down towards the MTR station located at the south end.
The rain forest and Orchid gardens are central and you only need to buy a ticket to see the amazing orchid gardens at $5 or for Sr’s $1.
Truely a must do when visiting Singapore."
,,Very relaxing to walk through the gardens,4.0,,A great place to see native and some non native species of plants in Singapore. Have been back twice as it is free and a great place to walk around.
,,Weekend trip,5.0,,"It is nice and beautiful, there are many types of Orchids. The air inside the park is so fresh. It will be a very nice visit during the early morning. Great gardens."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Took the kid here on our first day in Singapore. The dense canopy and sounds from the living creatures make it a surreal experience in the city center. The walk through the garden is so peaceful!
There are several vending machines to make sure one stays hydrated.and there are several restrooms as well.
Jacob's playground has innovative play structures that kept the kid occupied for well over 3 hours.
Enjoy a stroll rain or shine."
,,Amazing Orchids! Do not miss!,5.0,,We spent most of our time at the orchid gardens which blew us away. The flowers were incredible and breathtaking. Do not miss!
,,Beautiful !,5.0,,"If you are planning to come, be prepared to walk a lot and it is hot, so bring mineral water. We came from bukit timah mrt(if im not mistaken) and we walk to national orchird garden. Our purpose is to go into the orchird garden, which cost abt 5sgd per entry, however, we didnt realize tht it is actually nearer if u enter through the orchard gate. But the walk is enjoyable tho, took lots of instagram worthy picss hehehe the garden itself is pretty, if you’re a fan of orchird or u like flowers then its worth going in. Otherwise, the outside is already super duper pretty and serene to me"
,,Boring,3.0,,very boring place.Do not recommend to come here if you are a tourist.Instead go to East coast park which has more things to do such as renting a bicycle/seeing ships being docked/good hawker food
,,"Great Gardens, Great Variety",5.0,,"The main things that struck me about the Botanic Gardens was the size of the place and the variety. We wandered through park areas with people relaxing in the sun, groves of trees with swing seats, dense rainforest vegetation paths, and paused to watch birds and lizards at the lake. The orchid garden was a location all of its own (although the one part of the gardens with paid entry). We spent a day wandering around happily and still didn't see everything. Plenty of options for drinks, for shade, for rain shelter, and for rest. Only downside is expect to pay handsomely for any refreshments (but not dissimilar to any National Trust or other attraction in England). Will revisit next time we're in Singapore."
,,A walk in the park!,5.0,,Well worth the walk tho hot and humid! The Orchid display was beautiful and as always immaculately clean and well sign posted.
,,A pleasant escape from the noise,5.0,,"I am not an expert in Gardens but I did enjoy walking through here, if just to have some calm from the hustle and bustle of the city. It was a 20 minute walk from Orchid Rd, past some impressive homes, which was an interesting insight into life in Singapore. The gardens are free, so that is also a bonus. We didn't see much wildlife or birds, just a few roosters and hens."
,,Well worth the stroll,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Garden is well worth the hours spent. Tranquil ponds and lush gardens. It is an excellent choice for picnics or dates. Do visit the Orchid Garden for a complete experience. It has an amazing array of orchids that are painstakingly researched and grown. Entry ticket is 5SGD but students are free (local and foreigner).

The Rainforest is also lovely with several critically endangered species found in it. However, it was rather humid inside and sweat pours out easily.

Remember to bring lots of water, insect repellent and sunscreen. A spare set of clothes will be ideal as well."
,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens the Best I have Seen Anywhere in the World,5.0,,"I have visited botanical gardens in many countries throughout the world, but these are the best I have ever seen. The Orchid Garden within requires an entrance fee, but it is worth it. The entire area (and it is huge) is so well maintained and so lush and verdant and relaxing - I cannot recommend it highly enough. When in Singapore, it is a must visit."
,,Nice gardens to stroll about,4.0,,"We went with friends in the evening, great place to walk, feed the fish, look at the tress and plants, etc"
,,A great place to have a relaxing stroll or picnic,5.0,,"A large beautiful area near one end of Orchard Rd. We caught the MRT here, again very convenient. Fortunately for us it was a cloudy drizzly day which kept things relatively cooler. Lots of people having picnics too.

The gardens are a great place to just walk and relax, or if you feel the need, to have a run.

The Orchid Gardens are a highlight. Have to pay to get in but it is worth it if you like colour and flowers. So many orchids, some of which we have never seen before.

There is a restaurant in the middle of the gardens, Casa Verde. It is quite expensive but has a good range of western and Asian food. Ate here because a large storm came across so was an excellent place to stop!

We walked to the exit near Orchard Rd then a short walk to the bus stop which took us back to our hotel."
,,"Must See, Outstanding Beauty, Exceptional Gardens.",5.0,,"These gardens are a must see attraction in Singapore. We couldn’t believe that there was no admission charge, the only charge was access to the The Orchid Garden which were absolutely amazing. Our only regret was that we didn’t have time to walk and see the entire gardens, but certainly what we did see was really beautiful."
,,Stunning well kept gardens,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing area which we visited during a deluge but this did not stop our enjoyment. Have breakfast at Casa verde buy yourself a poncho and get on with it. Orchid garden is just a delight, I am not really a flower fan tbh but it is just fantastic, free entry and $5 dollar entry for orchid collection. Superb."
,,Always worth a visit,4.0,,"The botanical gardens are one of the few free jobs of Singapore, and luckily one of the Best too. The place is well kept, enjoyable and always beautiful! Be aware of the rains, and make sure you leave before it gets Dark, taxis Can ve diffucult to get at Night!"
,,Oasis in the City,5.0,,"This is one of the most beautiful free gardens I have visited, a little like stepping back to Kew Gardens at home in England. With its Victorian street lights and undulating paths, very well sign-posted. Great for wheelchair access, lots of places to have picnics, chill-out with friends and enjoy the breathtaking scenery, plants and take in this oasis in the middle of this great city!"
,,Nice garden for a picnic,4.0,,I had a picnic nearby the Swan Lake with some friends. It was a very ideal location. The garden is very well looked after.
,,Whole day Visit to the garden,4.0,,"I stayed in Jurong East. Took a Green line MRT and transfer @ Bouna Vista and reached Garden thru Yellowline MRT. I have entered the Bukit Timah Gate. Its a wonderful place to visit and I spent whole day here. Drinking water is available everywhere, carry a water bottle. You can visit Foliage Garden, Eco-Lake, Healing Garden, Fragrant Garden, Evolution Garden (Unique, Must try), Rain forest and so many things to visit. Good for Solo and Family as well. The area is huge, so visit this place at slow pace, you will enjoy for sure and do not rush."
,,Fantastic orchid flowers all year around,5.0,,It is a must to go there. It is just wonderful but avoid week-ends when it usually is very crowded.The orchid flowers are blooming almost all year around.
,,Grass Pokemon Galore,4.0,,"Keeping up with the Pokemon GO craze, my date and I spent sometime together in this beautiful park catching pokemon. Caught a couple ""rare"" ones. Good for the family."
,,More natural than the Bay Gardens,4.0,,"The Botanic gardens are less impressive in the sheer sights that they offer, but are a much more natural-looking, relaxed and even serene place. Partially, due to the absence of such a large number of visitors. If you enjoy quiet of the gardens higher than the visuals, you'd actually find Botanic Gardens more to your liking. I personally really enjoyed both. And, by the way, since Orchard gardens are, in my opinion, a nigh mandatory place to visit, you'll have the opprotunity to experience Botanic Gardens anyway and find if you like them in their own right."
,,Quiet and amazing escape,4.0,,"Definitely a place not to miss when in Singapore
Access is for free, except at the entrance of the Orchidee garden's section (which is near the end of the botanical gardens).
The place is AMAZING with lots of trees and different gardens. There is a beautiful lake with turtles on the grass.
A place to visit when the temperature is below 30, or else, you should wear shorts and t-shirts to prevent the heat.
Water bottles are a little bit more expensive to buy at a restaurant in the middle of the gardens than from any supermarket. It is recommended to bring water before entering the gardens."
,,Serenity!,4.0,,"Off-peak, it's actually a pretty tranquil place to walk through and spend quality time with good company! Beautiful gardens with pretty plants and a pleasant atmosphere always makes for a relaxing break from the hustle and bustle of city life!"
,,Oasis in the middle of singapore,5.0,,A beautiful garden in the middle of a concrete jungle. Worth a visit to the orchid garden within. Only a short cab ride from Wherever you are staying in Singapore.
,,Back to nature!!,5.0,,"This is not just a garden. This place is a piece of heaven on earth. And I'm not even exaggerating! The relaxation and relief this place can provide is much more than any urban place can give. I'm very lucky to have visited this place. It's very beautiful, so many trees and plants, and flowing water, and sound of animals. It's like being in a different place. The garden is also well kept and maintained, loved to say the least. A great place for family and friends to build bonds and memories, and even if you are alone it is still one of the best place to visit for all possible reasons lol. I felt like I aged backwards five years! I'll definitely visit again. Just wow."
,,Worth a trip,5.0,,"Greeted by a delightful elderly lady who is also the security guard, we were told all about the gardens and where was best to go. I can see why it’s a wold heritage site. The gardens are immaculate and diverse. And it’s all free!"
,,More than just gardens,5.0,,"Well received when you arrive , very pleasant and helpful staff , well kept Gardens beautiful plants and trees , amazing variety, lovely feel about it , you can spend as much or as little time as you like , they have a good restaurant and a little shop which sells snacks and a gift shop. A visit into the orchid gardens is a must and well worth paying the entrance fee .The lake is well stocked with fish and we even got to see some water lizards .the whole experience is very relaxing and calming to take a break from the city tours."
,,A great place for family and friends outing or picnic,4.0,,It’s great outdoor place to chill ou t on a off day and have a picnic or a family outing. Just avoid it completely on a rainy day. It has unesco heritage site too that I would shout about too much but overall it’s a nice green place to get away from the concrete and all teh modernisation for a while.
,,Lovely,5.0,,It’s pretty much like every other botanical garden. However the orchid garden is beautiful and well worth the trip.
,,Wow! Amazing selection of plants,5.0,,"This was an incredibly place to walk around in. Plan for an entire day. You'll be very tired at the end, with all the walking you do. There are several restaurants inside the botanical gardens. Cafe Verde was amazing and is highly recommeded. The park is free, but to see the orchid collection you have to pay $5 (Singapore). Totally worth it. What in incredible selection of orchids!"
,,Hot and Humid but beautiful,5.0,,"Everything but the Orchid Garden (worth the $5) is free. More than you can see in a day, especially with the heat and humidity. Lovely displays, beautiful plantings, long walks. Think about where you'll finish up because the subway entrance might be so far away. Supposedly Orchard Road is nearby, by that subway looked far too."
,,Singapore and Malaysia,3.0,,Nice place to visit. Went as part of resort/ cruise. Spent 3 days in Singapore and then cruise to Thailand and Malaysia returned 7 days later. Quite hectic but worth it
,,"Natural Gardens, Serene Atmosphere",5.0,,"Had a wonderful time in Singapore Botanic gardens. Visited the Botanic Gardens twice during my vacation in Singapore. You can see many morning walkers with their pet dogs walking energetically in the walkways of the gardens. As tourists, we had a wonderful time there, at the various lakes, the National Orchid Garden, the Marsh Garden, etc.

Must visit while being in Singapore. Very different from Gardens by the Bay."
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"As a resident of Singapore, I have been to the Botanical gardens numerous times since relocating here.

It is well laid out, stunningly beautiful, has a wide variety of things to do and never gets over crowded, even on a Sunday or public holiday.

Highly, highly recommended."
,,Relaxing picnic destination,5.0,,Great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Great waterpark for kids. The concerts they put on in the green are perfect for a family picnic out. The restaurant options aren't plentiful. But Singapore sure knows how to do gardens.
,,The highlight of Singapore,5.0,,The gardens are beautiful. However the National Orchid Garden is breathtaking. Even my significant other enjoyed the uniqueness of the gardens. This must be at the top of your list when visiting Singapore!
,,A stunning garden,5.0,,"My wife and I visited the gardens and had a great walk through the various parts of the garden. All for free!! We also had a very nice meal at one of the cafes. This is a must see attraction in Singapore, and"
,,Good,5.0,,"Nice place to Jog and relax. There is a turtle, fish, and otter there. you better go to the information to get the map and the information about the garden. They will explain you the details about the garden"
,,"Beautiful, serene and good activities",5.0,,"We visited with our 2.5 year old and spent half a day. He fed the fish, ran around the park, spotted an otter, played in the childrens playground. All in a fun family outing. A great place for tourists. The Orchid garden is beautiful too."
,,Gorgeous serenity within Singapore,5.0,,"We made a short trip to Singapore, and given this place’s designation as a World Heritage Site, we put in on our list of “must sees”. VERY glad we did. It was one of our favorite sites in Singapore. Beautiful, grand, and peaceful right in the middle of an enormous city. Impressive, like everything else in Singapore!"
,,Impressive!,5.0,,Definitely a must see! Underground takes you right to the gates. Top 3 out of 23 in the world. Worth over awesome 300 pics
,,Worth a day out!,5.0,,Just beautiful even if you love exercise a really good walk. There are cafe. Toilets are very clean. The space to sit is so relaxing near the pond. If your not into walking and plants then I wouldn't recommend going.
,,Incredible Gardens,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are like no other. If you like gardens you can't afford to miss this. One warning, it get's very hot in Singapore. If you have the time, plan to go on multiple mornings rather than spending the day. By afternoon it is really hot!"
,,Don’t miss this,5.0,,"Everyone goes to gardens by the bay which is fabulous but don’t miss the bontanic gardens, a wonderful place with a stunning orchid garden. Really worth visiting."
,,Botanic Garden,5.0,,"it is worth to see, the place is so magnificent and looked after,it is a change view from the hustle and bustle of the city, the fauna is wonderful, the orchids were magnificent and it is like walking into a forest with all its wonder! it is also a good walk
I recommend visitors to see it!"
,,Breathtakingly beautiful,5.0,,"We spent good few hours walking and taking in the beautiful Asian flora around the Botanic Gardens of Singapore. It is an amazing place and you could spend an entire afternoon there if you have so much time to spare in the city. It’s very easy to get there, the MRT stops right at the entrance of the Gardens. The entry is free, you only have to pay 5 S. Dollars to enter the National Orchid Garden. It’s a spectacular place full of exotic plants. A definite must see when visiting Singapore."
,,Quiet and well paved for nature walk,5.0,,"Highly recommending for those who love nature, walking and running, Orchid park is a must visit place with many photo shots!"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,The gardens are a great spot and immaculately maintained. They are a great way to get outdoors while still being close to downtown.
,,Out of this world,5.0,,"It is one of the world's gems when it comes to Botanic Gardens. For me, Singapore Botanics leads the way!"
,,Okay,3.0,,Visited the gardens. Was expecting something spectacular and it wasn’t. Just like a park with more exotic plants and trees. Lots of walking. Great for a picnic.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Wonderful kept gardens . Great specimens Great to spend a few hours just wondering around,if you can stand the heat and humidity"
,,Beautiful Tropical Oasis,5.0,,"I loved my visit to these gardens and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves nature! It was nice to see locals jogging, walking their dogs & enjoying picnics! The highlight was the national orchid garden (only $5 entry fee) it had many different varieties of orchids, all beautifully displayed & lots of photo opportunities. I was also lucky to spot 2 Singaporean otters at Swan lake! I sat there for around 30-40 mins and just as I was about to leave I saw their heads pop up from the water :) I also saw lots of birds, some squirrels & large lizards! Try and go early to avoid the midday heat, take water, & wear suncream/insect repellent!"
,,Mr & Mrs Gray,4.0,,"Beautiful garden especially the orchids garden different type of breed of orchids & smells of the aroma while walking along the path smell of perfumed & cool with spraying water . Good space for walking and jogging, scenery is nice seeing so much trees & flowers from different part of the world , especially if you love walking or jogging , not too good for disabled. I think should put more benches along the walk for senior citizens or disabled person to seat & watch the scenery & also more public toilets.
It's took us 3 hrs to walk from Bukit Timah entrance end up to Napier Rd entrance not far to Orchard Road . Good for young people to keep fit . For seniors citizens & disabled people is too much , we were so tired after that walk as a senior citizens never the less we enjoyed that walking & very shady with trees around ."
,,Delightful peaceful place to spend an afternoon,5.0,,If you are interested in trees and shrubs is well worth a visit. If you love orchids then is a must. The gardens cover a large area so you need to be reasonably mobile.
,,Singapore stop over,5.0,,Wonderful to visit and enjoy the well kept vegetation. Great for the people that love their gardens and walking.
,,Well organized Botanic Garden with some very unique features,5.0,,"Singapore's Botanic Garden is one of the must see attractions for several reasons:
1. It is very well maintained and organized into different sections such as the Orchids area; the ginger plants area; the children's area; the rain forest is impressive;and so on.
2. Entry is free; although a small fee is charged for some special segments.
3. Several cafes provide reasonable food and drinks.
4. The flowers have to be seen to be believed.
5. The Orchids section is really impressive. Some have been specially cultivated and grown in dedication to some famous people.
Well worth a trip."
,,crazy nice,5.0,,This place are green and nice to go and play and alot people and very hot and not that really hot some times hot sometimes cold
,,One of the best botanical gardens in the world,5.0,,"The gardens open at 5am, and they are wonderful for a relaxing walk. They are a sharp contrast compared to the rest of the busy cite, a welcome respite."
,,"Excellent arrangement, impressive part of rainforest, plenty of interesting migratory birds",5.0,,"A nice place for everybody, for all nature lovers. You can enjoy walking, exercising, bird watching or even participate in a concert. The remnants of rainforest in the middle of the city are impressive, orchid garden really unique and beautiful. The garden is professionally managed, the maintenance is well performed."
,,Like the way it is,5.0,,It is very smart idea to make this modern city with natural feel garden. Efforts worth to have it here so it is a plus for singapore
,,Stay close to the MRT for the best part,5.0,,"The park is really beautiful and we enjoyed strolling around in the different areas. The best part was definitely the gardens closer to the MRT station. The actual botanical garden starts right south of it and was just ok.

The signage could be a lot better, since it was not always clear on where you have to go. There are many maps and sign posts around, but it was at times confusing since they never put all of the major points in the garden on the signs."
,,A Green Oasis,5.0,,"If you have the time and stamina and want to see most of the gardens, it could be an idea do what we did. We got off the MRT at one end of the gardens and slowly made our way through to the far end near Orchard Road where we got a bus back down into the city. Besides stopping to admire the sheer variety of plants and open spaces, if you walk right through the gardens, then there is a cafe part way along the route where you can stop in the shade and enjoy a refreshing drink. What struck us was that in the centre of such a built-up city, you’d never think that all the high-rise blocks were only a short walk away when you’re right in the centre of the gardens. As you get near the Orchard Road side of the gardens there is, of course, the orchid garden to visit. Although the botanic gardens themselves don’t have an entrance fee, you have to pay to get into the orchid garden but it’s well worth the small amounts charged. At this point there is also a shop and another chance to buy an ice cream if you feel you need one! We came across a really helpful person (I think she was a volunteer) at the Orchard Road end of the garden who directed us to the bus stop and told us what number bus to get to go back down Orchard Road into the city centre."
,,gardens by the bay without the fuss,4.0,,"enjoy a slow walk in this colonial garden, best enjoyed early in the morning or late afternoon. For family with kids, can try to visit Jacob Ballas garden, and make sure you bring a change of clothes for after the fun water play!"
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"As stated in the orchid review, this place is a must to visit, gardens are lovely, easy place to walk around for all age groups."
,,Paradise,5.0,,"I had a chance to visit botanic gardens as a break from business meetings and couldn't dream of a better option for switching the daily business mode off. It's a peaceful, beautiful place where not only can you relax but really appreciate and enjoy the nature"
,,Worth the visit again and again,5.0,,You will b immerse with e orchid gardens tat has all the different types of orchid flowers in display. As u walk along the whole garden esp early mornings you will b enchanted by the rain forest n the tanquility along the way. A good exercise for your mind and your body. Worth the go again and again...
,,Magical,5.0,,"What lovely massive magnificent gardens to leisurely stroll around for a few hours. Great sections showcasing different plants and trees around Malaysia. Also if your lucky you can stumble across monitor lizards, terrapins and other wildlife"
,,Delightful gardens,5.0,,"Large spacious gardens. Lots of tropical plants to see. Excellent orchids and heliconias. Easy to reach via MRT or bus. The shop is great to buy locally made scarves, canvas bags, etc. and reasonably priced."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Just stroll, without being in a hurry. Many paths to take in the garden splendour surrounding you with a lot of foliage covering and resting places."
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,"A little humid (so brace yourself) but worth having a wonder through, plus it's free!! Some nice little restaurants and bars inside too"
,,Relaxing walk/hike,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens has many paths for adventure-seekers. It is not too crowded usually, and sometimes there are even musical performances at the Shaw Foundation Stage. It is kept very clean and a very good walk to take your mind off things for awhile."
,,EXCELLENT,5.0,,"This park is one of the best in the country, and perhaps in the world. The workers maintain is daily with excellence. To be enjoyed alone, with your family, or for a romantic walk with a loved one."
,,Best place to relax amid the lush tropical flora,5.0,,"If you want a place to walk and breathe some clean air, there is a huge pocket of it here at the Botanical Gardens. Great food, Great shade and a history of Botanical wonder that is unbridled."
,,Worthwhile despite the woeful weather,4.0,,"The Botanic Garden are a must in Singapore and easily reached by MRT. Our visit coincided with a long lasting downpour on a Sunday when many locals were out to enjoy their day off. The rain drove many to seek shelter in a location that has very few covered areas. That experience proved most uncomfortable for us so we chose to purchase umbrellas and press on in our journey. As a result we discovered magic glistening gardens all to our own. This place is a joy and should be on every tourist's agenda, just as it is for locals."
,,Nice walk in the greenery,4.0,,"Nice nature walk, good walk from Bukit Timah to Orchard while appreciating the green scenery. Nice surprise to see art sculptures during the journey."
,,One of the best botanic gardens ion the world,5.0,,"The gardens were started by the Brits and are absolutely world class. I've visited them several times during both day and night (they are open 24/7). In fact, one of the best times to visit is at about 5 am when it is (relatively) cool. Locals will be jogging, doing their exercises or just walking. Don't miss the small rainforest section or the orchid collection (one of the largest in the world). For birders, there are kingfishers and herons on the pond, owls and a ton of small flower pecking species. The cafes are excellent. I prefer SGBT to the hotter, newer Gardens on the Bay."
,,Zen Journey,5.0,,It was a peaceful and tranquil journey with morning breeze and sense of silence. You will see a lot of morning joggers and tai chi sessions in different corners. An excellent place for free and easy walk anytime of the day.
,,"A place to keep kids further from myopia, closer to the nature and music.",4.0,,"We visit Botanic Garden once a while when the weather is good or the concert is coming. Walking or Taiji for the elderly, running for the kids and dogs are perfect pastimes. The park gives the best backdrop for a family or wedding photo, we always see new couples there. Be prepared for the mosquitos though, especially for the kids."
,,Singapore botanical gardens,5.0,,Excellent collection of orchid.worth seeing the neatness and ambience. Place to relax.wonderful experience

The gardens are beautifully kept and have the most amazing variety of plants I have seen anywhere. I particularly love the orchid garden and on this visit enjoyed the frangipani garden with the swing seats.
,,A great escape right at your doorstep,5.0,,A very nice peaceful and quite escape from the daily grind to enjoy nature and it’s various views - fun for a jog or a leisurely walk or at times enjoy the musical concerts in the green grassy slopes in front of the shell stage - the mini treetop walk and the rainforest experience are welcome additions - the orchid garden is very nice
,,Singapore Botanic Garden,5.0,,"This is oldest garden in Singapore with more than 150 years of history. It has been listed as the UNESCO historical site recently and is another popular site where Singaporean and tourist go. It has many tropical plants, orchids garden, small lake and restaurants.

,,An orchid delight,5.0,,"This was hands down my favourite thing in Singapore. I did this on the last day of my trip and was so happy I went. The botanic gardens are a delight and the orchid garden just mesmerising. The orchid garden was a 1.3 km leisurely stroll from the botanic garden MRT, lots of shade to keep you cool and out of the sun and there are a few food stops if you’re peckish. The cheeky squirrels also added a bit of fun so look out for them among the trees! This is an absolute must if you are visiting Singapore."

Luckily, we had our umbrella's which saved us from heat and rain during our visit. I suggest to visit this place in the morning. We started our journey at the back of the garden heading to the main entrance. I also suggest taking the bus so that you'll arrive at the main entrance. We left the place and took the bus at that time since train is at the other side of the garden. Visit this place if you want to be relaxed before going home. :)"
,,Interesting gardens with lots to see and learn about tropical plants,4.0,,"Well worth a visit to see the orchid garden particularly and the ginger plant family area at least.

,,Worthwhile Outing.,5.0,,"We came here at around 6am when it was still dark, after arriving to Singapore at 4.30am. It was cool at that time and as our room wasn't going to be ready for a good few hours, it was the perfect thing to fight the jet lag.
We spent about 3.5 hours here but could have spent a lot more. We didn't see the National Orchid Garden but I think we saw almost everything else. We particularly enjoyed the area that showed plants used for medicinal benefits. The grounds are immaculate and well planned. We recommend coming here for sure."
,,A wonderful place to spend an hour or two in Singapore,5.0,,"I had a free afternoon and chose to visit the Botanic Gardens

,,A must do,5.0,,The gardens are a must tour. Take your leisurely time to stroll through the many pathways. If you really want to explore there is some walking involved to see the whole garden.

,,Orchid gardens Oldie but a goodie.,4.0,,These gardens are totally dedicated to displaying orchids and has been done with care and planning. If you go in the summer take sunshade as it’s hot and only small areas of shaded areas. The flowers are beautiful and it has many rare types of orchids too. You can spend about an hour here and then get something to eat at several dining options. Take the walk back to MRT and enjoy the tropical open space of the rest of these gardens.
,,Amazing gardens and Orchids,5.0,,"We visited his on a hot humid day and there was a lot of walking. However, it was worth it. There are several small areas within the whole with different themes. The Orchid Garden was the highlight but the Learning Forest is also very good. We ate at the cafe near the information centre and my wife and I had different local dishes which were really good and inexpensive.
A great day out."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"This was our second visit to Singapore as we missed out on the Botanical Gardens the first time due to so many things we wanted to do. This is yet another excellent venue to go to and spend many hours enjoying it. It's easy to get to on the MRT, clean, inexpensive and full of a variety of plants and orchids.
A must when in Singapore."
,,One of the best botanic gardens worlwide,5.0,,"This is a must do location to visit. Apart from being free of charge, this is amazingly rich in plans and trees, very clean and easy to access by metro."
,,My wife and plants,5.0,,My wife is a fan of plants I cannot say I am. But the botanical gardens are well worth a visit. There is much to see and even for me it was interesting
,,STUNNING,5.0,,We visited on a Sunday morning - loved seeing all the locals walking or running with their dogs and families. What a stunning place - easy to see how this became a world heritage site. Take your time and explore- there is so much to see. We paid to go into the Orchid Gardens and that was very worth it. The displays were beautiful and very very well maintained. There are clear signs of care and pride in the gardens as a whole. We spent about 3 hours just wandering and enjoying the fresh air. A must do
,,Great place to walk,5.0,,"Wonderful place to recharge your batteries. The gardens offer so many different things. Families can relax on the lawn with their picnic baskets, children can scoot around on their scooters, feed the turtles and fish, play with their balls and chase one another around. Couples can enjoy each other's company while taking a walk or relaxing on a bench, enjoying the art and indulge in a meal at one of the restaurants. Fitness enthusiasts can join a boot camp or attend a tai chi class. The well-maintained gardens are always changing so there is always something new to see - the orchid garden is a must see."
,,a must see and do,5.0,,"The best time to go is early morning (or late afternoon) so that it is not too hot and there is so much to see. The Gardens have changed a great deal in only a couple of short years since my last visit. Boardwalks and bridges ensure safety and great viewing of the plants and animals - swans, ducks, tortoises and monitor lizards to name a few. A must see is the Orchid Garden and although parts are being renovated there is still plenty to see. I will be going back to see all the new parts on my next visit. Love it!"
,,A natural delight in Singapore,4.0,,"One of my favourite places to spend time in Singapore, the Botanic Gardens has some of the most incredible varieties of trees and foliage in the region. I couldn't finish the count of unique trees and species. Stay away from the lake amphitheater in summer though, too many mosquitoes!"
,,Beautiful Rainforest in midst of City,4.0,,"This is a great break from urban exploring, although still outdoors the temps were cooler here. We rode the Hop On/Off and then enjoyed an hour just looking at the flora and fauna. There is an excellent map of the area available at the visitor desk and the area is super clean. If you want a break from the city but still be in the city this is the place. So many interesting facts...really enjoyed it! But take your own bottled water especially if it hot outside."
,,Orchids simphony,5.0,,"Don't dare to miss them! The Botanical Garden is peaceful, beautiful place but the orchids exposition worth any panny."
,,Beautifully designed botanical gardens,4.0,,"The gardens has a good blend of fossilized section, colonial buildings, lakes and trees landscaped to give the visitors a very quiet experience in the park. Car parking rates can be made more reasonable though as users will need to be there for a couple of hours."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"What a beautiful place to visit!! The best time to visit is in the morning, I visited this place at around 10am and stayed there for 2 full hours I only managed to see half of the botanical gardens and the orchid gardens as it was quite hot and humid around lunchtime. If you wish to see the whole botanical gardens you need about 4 hours all up."
,,Nice big park,5.0,,"This botanic garden is basicly a big public park with a few lakes and differently themed parts of the park. In the middle of it there is also a National orchid park. If you fo there during the weekend, you will see locals having picnics and playing pokemon go :) (didnt know people still play this). All in all a nice place for a walk and “escape” from the city."
,,lovely place,5.0,,having great experience here. the city never sleep and shopping mall great discounts and branded. wish come to here again with my son.
,,Amazing,4.0,,One thing I can say ; is Singapore horticulturists are specialists of the botanic art. Truly amazing place; must visit
,,Our Escape,5.0,,"Each time we visit Singapore we make sure we have a few hours to walk around the Botanical Gardens, we enjoy strolling around through the different gardens, but still have not been there to see the Frangipani trees flowering, the Secret garden was quiet and Swan Lake is our favourite place to sit and this time we were lucky enough to see Otters catching fish and a large Monitor swimming around in the lake.
I'm not the fittest person but I managed to stroll around for a few hours."
,,Magnificent Gardens,5.0,,An enormous space in central Singapore. This Unesco world heritage site is not to be missed when visiting Singapore. The grounds are immense and plan to spend the better part of a day here. Beautiful trails and flora from around the world including the largest collection of orchids on the planet.
,,Garden in an urban jungle,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens, a UNESCO site is a must visit when in the Lion City. An easy ride on the Downtown MRT line will bring you direct to the Gardens. Be prepared to spend at least half a day enjoying the various flora and fauna and the various themed gardens. The Healing Gardens which showcases over 400 varieties of medicinal plants was unfortunately closed when we visited on a Tuesday. The canopy of the trees and plants provide a shady walkway from the heat.
Not to be missed even if you have only 2 days in Singapore"
,,UNESCO Heritage site of Singapore,5.0,,"Entry is free. You can jog around the garden. It is vast with many themed gardens and a children's garden. Some gardens are open everyday while some other are closed for a day.It is a must visit place if you love nature. Spectacular displays of different types of gardens. If you want to know and study different types of plant species, this is the place to be!"
,,Orchid Gardens probably second to none,5.0,,"Take time to explore this very large expanse of gardens, with the orchid garden the stunning centre piece. Exotic flowers in abundance. Well worth a visit, but don't just limit it to the Orchid Gardens"
,,UNESCO World Heritage Site - Worth a Visit,4.0,,"On our second day of visit/vacation to Singapore, we decided to take MRT to Singapore Botanic Garden. We didn't have a huge expectation, as we've been to various botanic gardens during our lifetime. However, I would put Singapore Botanic Garden a must visit. It's super convenient via MRT (at the garden is literally right outside the MRT station). Though it's free to get on the botanic garden's ground, you will have to pay $5 Singapore Dollars to view/enter the Orchids Garden. I strongly encourage you to stroll 900 meters to the Orchids Garden and pay to visit. I've included a few pictures, and I/we are definitely glad that we decide to visit."
,,Loved this place,5.0,,"Loved this place especially the Orchid garden, visited late afternoon and then visited the restaurant on site which is a hidden gem , the gardens are a photographers dream , thank you"
,,A Delightful quiet Garden,4.0,,"A very nice place , good place for couples for photo shoot , kids friendly a lot of open place , nice to have a family picnic.When I have visited it was not crowded.

There was a specific area where a band was performing and kids were playing.

It's kind of a free attraction in Singapore where you can reach easily by using MRT/Bus.Orchid garden is separate from this and to visit that you need to pay. Though they are in same premise.

It's near to orchard Road so after visiting garden you can go there.

If you are tourist in Singapore so I would recommend to keep it in last activities when you have enough time."
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,"A beautiful day out....stroll through the park from the MRT station. This is not just a gardeners paradise but for anyone who loves nature. The orchid garden is situated within the park so be prepared with good shoes, sun cream, hats and even an umbrella. The heat of the day can be unbearable and exhausting, there is some shade in the form of huts and foliage. You have to pay S$5 to enter but it’s a small price for the amazing and immaculately kept gardens. This was my favourite day out."
,,Amazing range of gardens,4.0,,wow this spot is free and has such a huge range of garden types.A lovely relaxing walk.The herb and medicine garden is well set out and informative and the perfume garden smells great and then all the little paths through trees and gardens are a lovely stroll and pleasure to the senses.
,,Wonderful place for people interested in botany,4.0,,Very well maintained gardens and a very tranquil place. Sighted a lot of rare birds. But not in the top 5 places to see in Singapore.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We spent a full day here and still have more to see. Parts have changed since i was here over a year ago, and i was still noticing things i had missed last time, which hadnt changed. The amount of work put into this place is incredible, and it shows. The souvenir shops are overpriced but that is not uncommon. The food places are also but not so bad. And the friendly staff will guide you to the best food places outside the gardens if you prefer."
,,Lovely and peaceful,5.0,,We had a really lovely day here while on holiday. We travelled to the park by MRT which was very easy. We were pleasantly surprised that entrance was free. We walked extensively despite the rain and had a very pleasant and reasonably priced lunch at one of the. self service restaurants. There seemed to be a really good selection of eating places. We went midweek to avoid the crowds. We paid to go into the Orchid Garden which was absolutely beautiful. There seems to be some ongoing work in that area presumably to improve existing facilities but it didn’t cause us any problems. There was also a nice shop with good quality souvenirs. Would highly recommend.
,,Awesome garden!!!,5.0,,"Went here 2nd day of stay in singapore just DIY trip and its easy to locate.
The place is realy relaxing.. Its not crowded compare to other sights to see in SG.
Its nice to spend lots of time here..
Early morning would be nice so its not that hot.
Picture perfect location ."
,,Ambience was great,5.0,,The park was well Maintened. Pretty crowded but was not that bad. Tickets were only sgd 5 for entrance. Definitely recommended for some quality time either with family or just a day trip alone too.
,,So beautiful,5.0,,"This place is DEFINITELY worth visiting! It's so stunning! As soon as we stepped out of the MRT a beautiful butterfly fluttered past our faces as if to welcome us! My mum and I are huge plant/nature lovers so we really enjoyed it. It's quite big so wear appropriate shoes for walking, worth visiting the Orchid garden too."
,,A manicured garden on display for all,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens were on our list of could do. I was not fussed whether we attended or not. How wrong was I? It is spectacular with the exhibits, the flowers, the plants and the oasis in the middle of Singapore.

It is an experience without comparison. A must see in Singapore!"
,,Very pretty,5.0,,"Despite the heat and humidity we had a lovely stroll through these gardens. We saw lots of wildlife aswell as all the beautiful flowers. It's worth a small detour to take time to visit the orchid garden, just stunning."
,,Beautiful city park,5.0,,"Fantastic park in the city. Great for s run, for a walk and to enjoy your coffee. Great collections of trees and plants. You will not be disappointed! Worth to visit!"
,,Glorious!,5.0,,"I'm not a great garden visit person but my wife is. However, this place is fabulous and great first stop on our tour. Lost 5 hours just strolling around and soaking up the Singapore climate. Delicious milkshakes at the Bees Knees and it's not everyday you see dragons in the undergrowth!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,A trip to Singapore should include a long walk throughout the Botanic Gardens. It's a visual feast and the smell of the plants as you walk through is amazing. Even better when it's raining so bring an umbrella.
,,Glorious Park,4.0,,"A wonderful 'Free' attraction. Good footpaths lead around the park with signage, although I feel this could be improved. A few cafes available and information centres/shops.There are various themed areas throughout...... ginger garden, healing garden, a learning forest, evolution garden and more. It is well spread out and you could probably spend a leisurely day here quite easily. Also included within the garden are a number of lakes with large catfish in them. Not forgetting the National Orchid Garden for which there is a small charge. Definiteley worth a visit."
,,An absolute gem,5.0,,"I admittedly hadn't done much research in advance, but I was extremely impressed. This garden is much bigger than I had expected. Signs give good directions to the various attractions. It was very refreshing to walk around and see how people took this old colonial left-over into practical use. The city had arranged concerts which were to start as I had to leave.
There is no entrance fee, but I had to pay to visit the Orchid Garden, but it was well worth it."
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,Went for a walk early morning before it got to hot. Very cooling and enjoyable. Many locals go for their morning exercise.
,,Don’t miss this attraction,5.0,,Another must see for the gardeners amongst you takes a full day and make sure you visit the Orchid Garden you will be amazed by the varieties and colours on display. Swan lake with a kingfisher at work was a highlight as were the enormous catfish patrolling the waters.
,,F1 weekend,5.0,,When to fill in some time but wish I could of stay all day. Great walks around the park all well keep Would highly recommend this place but take all day
,,A must visit,5.0,,"After 7 weeks of constant travel this place was pure natural medication. We both were very weary and suffering from head colds. This park was just what the doctor ordered. We had a few hours to kill before our flight home and after a short taxi ride we arrived in paradise.
It's free! Except for the ""Orchid Garden"".
- Tropical forest trees of all varieties and they are big (some just 40 years old others much older)
- a walk thru waterfall.
- lakes with fish & swans with tropical islands.
- lush areas of lawn.
- the ""ginger"" garden was fascinating. All sorts of varieties.
- ponds with floating lily pads.
- the ""Orchid"" garden ($S5 entry fee per pax) is just fabulous.
- the ""Palm"" valley (one of the largest in the world) is fantastic. Don't use the footpath but walk amongst the palms is a must. Lizards lurcking around just adds to the ambience.
The gardens are ""Super"" clean. Friendly (as all Singaporeans are!), helpful staff. Carefully spaced facilities for refreshments and transport (taxis/hop on/off buses etc.).
We saw a fraction of the park but what we saw was just beautiful. The walk itself is very easy. Flat to undulating. Easily spend a leisurely day here. Not to be missed. A great way to chill out and get back to nature and away from the hassle and bustle of city life which ironically literally surrounds this beautiful place."
,,Plenty to see here,4.0,,Covers a lot of ground so you have to be prepared to walk and it's not always easy to work out where you are. Lots of distinct areas and plenty to see at any time
,,"Back to Nature, Forget the Glam! This Garden Rocks!",5.0,,"Forget the Glam and go back to Nature with Plants in solid soil for a change. A lovely huge garden near the CBD that is well maintained and beautifully designed. It is well worth the effort of walking around in the humidity of Singapore. Wear comfortable shoes and bring a bottle of water as you can easily dehydrate in the heat. Walking in the shade helps and there are lots of gigantic trees to give you cover. The orchid gardens is a MUST see and worth the entry fee as you cannot view the extensive displays otherwise. Ground staff and those offering assistance are ever so charming and friendly. The gift shop has an array of specialised gifts which the nature theme.Beware the giant lizards/ iguanas as they runback on the footpath, someone nearly trod on one while texting on his mobile. Visit the historical buildings that also offer the history of the Garden."
,,So beautiful,5.0,,We actually went at night. It was beautiful. I went with friends but I seen a lot of romance taking place! Nevertheless very kid & family friendly
,,"Excitement, beauty and tranquility",5.0,,"A visit to the Botanic Gardens is a must. The Gardens are thoughtfully and beautifully laid out, they are tended and cared for lovingly, proving a paradise within a busy world.
The orchid garden is spectacular and you can simply wander slowly from one setting to another getting lost, but at every turn having stunning close up views of orchids - what better!"
,,Superb and Very Well maintained,5.0,,Botanical Garden was very walkable to my Hotel room so whenever i found time i used to visit there. They have maintained very well and they have very good collection of plants and trees from all over the world at one place. They have displayed the plant/tree name and the family it belongs and the location from where it's origin found more informative. There is a pond inside garden with dozens of swan. Really a good place to spend some healthy time.
,,Very impressive gardens,5.0,,Beautiful grounds and the flowers and shrubbery are outstanding. This was well worth the time. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Bring an umbrella to protect you from the sun.
,,Tranquility,4.0,,"The MRT takes you to the entrance, and you can stroll around the various gardens, using a map, for as long as you like.
I really liked the lake, it’s very soothing. There are apparently otters in it. Also, for me, the Bamboos, never having seen any before. There’s something for everyone, and they are very well tended."
,,Gorgeous orchids.,5.0,,"The whole of the botanic gardens is gorgeous but the particular gem and bit you have to visit is the orchid garden. There is a bit of ongoing renovation currently but this had no real impact on how much we enjoyed it.

The in laws are both over 60 and it only cost $1 to get into the orchid bit. It cost my wife and I $5.

Well worth a visit."
,,relaxing ...,5.0,,always worth to stay a few hours and walk through the rain forest for a perfect impression. the royal orchid garden is a super attraction.
,,Free and great,5.0,,"The gardens are large with plenty of open space to relax and enjoy. There a couple of lakes to break up the greenery along with speciality areas. Get off at Botanical Garden MRT (Circle Line) and you are there.
Allow plenty of time to relax you will need it.
I highly recommend this attraction."
,,Orchid Display a must see.,5.0,,MRT ride to Botanical Gardens front entrance. About a kilometre walk to Orchid Display. Wear a hat or use an umbrella in walking there. AUD$5 entrance fee. Lots and lots of colours and varieties all coping in the Singapore heat.
,,A park with nothing much to mention!,3.0,,"Just an ordinary pretty park where people come to relax on weekends, where some pre-wedding photoshoots are taken. Won’t give you a new experience as it is just a park! can skip if you r short on time!"
,,Lovely gardens - go early or later in the day,5.0,,"We slept in and went to the gardens around 11am. This was pretty warm!! Even though it is lovely, I think it would’ve been much more pleasant to go early or later in the day so we weren’t sweating so much! A great place to go for all ages. It’s free but you can pay to go into the Orchid Garden which was nice but probably only if you are into your flowers"
,,Worth your time,5.0,,"Actually went here on accident, thought we were going to the domes and the Grab (Uber) took us here. Glad it happened. Really cool park with LOTS to see. If you really want to do it right give yourself 2-3 hours min. We did the rain forest and the learning forest before it started raining really hard. Would have loved to explore more."
,,Beautiful green space in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"Beautiful green space, although Singapore does an amazing job at that. It contains the National Orchid Garden which is a must see. It also has beautiful lakes, a rainforest, trails and anything nature related. Peolle exercising, families spending time, couples on romantic walks, you see it all. A must see for everyone. Staff eager to guide you with a map and recommend a path or section to see depending on time. Easily accessible by taxi. Restaurant also available there."
,,One of the best,5.0,,We spent a few hours here there are so many different areas and wildlife from birds such as Kingfishers to huge Monitor Lizards. It’s a really usable space with people doing yoga and line dancing. Not the stuffy museum of a place you might expect. This is a living breathing space being enjoyed by locals and tourists. It’s fantastic and it’s free. Though there is a small fee for the orchid collection.
,,"Beautiful, authentic and free",5.0,,What’s not to like ? The gardens are a super place to depressurise from the pace and materialism that abounds. Super well tended. Lots of different zones to explore. You could take a picnic or there are lots of food and beverage outlets. Highly recommended
,,Beautiful gardens so close to the city,5.0,,I took the MRT to the gardens. Botanic Gardens stop on the circle line. This got me at the east end of the large gardens. It was nearly a 2km walk to the National Orchid Garden ($5) which is the only part with a fee. Over 1000 well maintained orchards with plenty of photo opportunities. If you don't have time to go into the orchid garden they can still be seen in other parts of the grounds. I especially enjoyed the Ginger garden with its beautiful waterfall. There is a gift shop and a few restaurants/cafes. The ethnobotanist garden had an indoor learning section which was a good place to get out of the heat. Near the Eco garden there was a lovely pathway made with stones that helped massage my sore feet. Expect to do a lot of walking.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,We loved this beautiful garden. So many lovely plants and the tropical weather so suits so many plants. If you love gardening then this is for you.
,,Picturesque gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens, lots of different types of gardens all got their own individual charm.

Thoroughly enjoyed a pleasant stroll around these beautiful manicured gardens. Little statues & ponds & lakes infiltrate all areas of the Gardens.

Very spacious, can take a few hours if you wish to explore all areas. The large pond / lake is a must see, great central statue is swans flying with otters & turtles happily swimming in the water.

Take a break at the cafeteria & watch the world go by.

The Gardens are free entry apart from the Orchid Garden which looked great from the outside but we ran out of available time.

All in all a must see visit while in Singapore."
,,Beautiful gardens with a myriad of plants,5.0,,A fantastic place containing thousands of plants and trees. The garden is well kept and maintained by a devited staff team. We also visited the National Orchid Garden and were impressed by the variety of orchids on display. Well worth a visit.

Nice restaurant options are available..

A four to six hour spend is recommended.."

,,Just Beautiful !,5.0,,Its really worth a trip to visit the botanical gardens i particularly loved the orchid garden.There are lots of places to eat and drink and great palces to rest whilst you wlak around. Plan at least half a day to take it all in.
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,The garden is wonderful. It’s massive well maintained. There are multiple entries to the garden. Do check which one suits you . Orchid garden is like no other place in earth. It costs only 5 dollars (rest of the garden is free ) and has massive collection is flowers. It’s a great place to take colourful photos and never crowded like the other gardens.

If you’re in Singapore don’t miss this treasure.
The granite ball floats on a skin of water so you can change the direction with you finger"
,,Another must for those that enjoy gardens,5.0,,The botanical gardens are easy to reach via the MRT. They are well laid out with a variety of walking paths. The gardens provide a respite from the city. The facilities in the gardens are good. There were not too many people about so the gardens could be enjoyed.
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"We stopped off at the botanical gardens for a couple of hours. The gardens are beautiful, we particularly enjoyed the rain forest area. There are a number of signposts pointing to various areas, but I think there could be a few more. We stopped at the café for a drink and sandwich which was ok, nothing special. Restrooms were clean as they have been everywhere in Singapore. We didn't go into the orchid garden as we didn't have time but from what we could see it looked stunning. Quite a bit of walking involved so make sure you wear suitable footwear and take water as it is so hot and humid."
,,Great park,5.0,,"Worth a visit, great open park and free entry. Easily loose a couple of hours but remember to take some water"
,,Escape the city,5.0,,"It is a bit like going to central park, the city at hand but still surrounded by nature. Beautiful flowers and an easy canopy walk."

,,World Class,5.0,,"This is arguably the best botanic gardens we have visited in six continents. It is beautifully laid out with wonderful vistas and interesting routeways. The use of different levels is particularly imaginative. The plant collection reflects the location near the Equator.
The restaurant is a real asset, with good local cuisine at fair prices. Access to the gardens is easy if you use the Hop-on buses - they are a good buy anyway - but not walkable from the city centre for oldies like us."
,,Green and green and some more,5.0,,The place is an island of tranquility in the middle of the city. It is remarkable how you will completely feel in a different world when you walk here. Great to spend quality time with oneself.
,,Magnificent Gardens,5.0,,These gardens are beautiful. There are places to view and places to relax and sit on a bench. The canopies created by the trees in certain areas create cool spaces. We loved the orchid gardens and the swan lake.
,,Very Pretty,4.0,,"We were on a tour here ,so a bit rushed,The Orchid Garden was very pretty,so many different colours and types,would be better to see on your own to takes your time but what we saw was worth it"
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"The botanical garden is quite big and so you can spend a full day visiting it.
We visited some part but not everything.
The entry it's free excepted for the orchid garden where you need a ticket.
Anyway, as we had already visited a lot we didn't pay a visit at the orchid garden even though it should be very beautiful."
,,A garden in the city,4.0,,"If you want to indulge to nature while in the midst of the city, go visit this place. Find exotic plants and flowers. Best place to relax and engage in a friendly conversation (if you're travelling in groups) or with other tourists who relax just like you while you sit and eat in the restaurant, or sit on a bench under the trees. Birds are all around, not really afraid to people. Time is slow in this place. Souvenir and gift shops is also available.
Note: careful with some snakes, and other animals, or insects the forest is really dense."
,,Marvelous garden,5.0,,The botanic garden of Singapore should not be missed when you visit the city. There is so much to see there and it is so quiet! Unfortunately the orchid garden is being renovated and it will fully reopen again in mid 2019. But there are other marvels in this garden that are worth a visit!
,,Orchid Gardens,5.0,,Beautiful gardens. Very tranquil. Recommend a trip here even if you don't have time to visit the entire botanical garden - it is quite large.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"This orchid garden has a vast selection of stunning specimens, a must see. Also it has delicious homemade icecreams-just Devine!"
,,Pleasant way to spend an afternoon,5.0,,"The gardens are massive and beautiful. They're a great way to spend a quiet afternoon, though it can get very warm so carry water. On weekends they'll be full of Singaporeans having picnics too."
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,Spent a bit of time here while on Holiday a lot of attention and hard work as gone into it its best to go in the evening when all lit up most enjoyable would recommend.
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,Loved the gardens although the Orchard Garden was the best. A peaceful place that is free of charge on the main.
,,Oasis in the city,4.0,,"The botanical gardens are a beautiful oasis inside the side, escaping from the hustle and bustle of city life. You can easily take the subway here and spend the day wandering. There is a cafe with food inside the groups or bring your own picnic. I particularly enjoyed the rainforest portion of the gardens which is a preserved section of traditional Malay land, basically what Singapore was before it was developed. The rainforest was filled with beautifully colored wild roosters!"
,,A restful and beautiful place,4.0,,"Easy to reach using the MRT and a very restful place. Look out for the chickens and lizards, and the turtles around the lake."
,,Very Cozy,4.0,,My wife and I visited Botanic Garden by Grab. There are cafes at the entrance and it is quite clean and well organized. I think it is good place to relax. Go Picnic with family also recommended.
,,Spent a whole day and only saw half!,5.0,,"Free, but priceless experience. A `must-do' for visitors in my opinion. Easy access around the gardens and a wide variety of plants and ideas for displays of your own."
,,Free park,4.0,,"You can walk though this park, picnic, yoga, read a book, etc for free. It’s open to the public. There are bathrooms and a few places to buy food and drinks. It’s separated into different areas. Like a desert area, bonsai tree, lake section, and they’re all a little different. You can access the orchid gardens too. We say fish, swans, giant lizards. We even saw one eat and kill a small bird that fell into the water. Nature’s kingdom. It was nice to grab a bench next to the lake and eat a snack. It’s something to do outdoors and enjoy."
,,A walk of beauty,5.0,,Spent a day walking around the wonderful Singapore Botanic gardens; a real wonderland of colour and great landscaping. The orchid garden is a must but so are a lot of the other areas. Beautiful vistas and aspects that could be from a picture book. Great experience.
,,"Gorgeous for plant lovers; a pause on hot, humid weather for other people",4.0,,"If you are crazy about plants, trees, flowers, you can spend an all day reading all the information, in Flower Dome; staring at some astonishing works of adaptation of nature, as succulents plants, carnivore plants (in the Cloud Forrest ""buiding""),and so on;
If you don’t much care to much about the vegetal world, take the opportunity to breathe normally and forget the hot, humid weather outside the enormous glass roofed structure.
There are some restaurants inside, but walked to Satay by the Bay (see zone E, in the picture) to eat local food."
,,Botanical wonderland in the city,5.0,,"I decided to Hop Off at the Botanical Gardens to stretch my legs after being on the Hop On bus for 1.5 hr. Best decision. Walking through the Ginger Garden, water features, Orchid pavilion, lake and rainforest was refreshing and relaxing after seeing all the skyscraper scenes and modern hustle bustle traffic in the city. If you like garden scenes, having a lite lunch listening to water fall, relaxing on a scenic lawn overlooking a lake or the smell of a rainforest this is a must stop. There is also a learning garden and several lakes. Allow at least 2 hrs of relaxed walking and sitting to gaze at nature. I liken it to Central Park NYC - nature surrounded by The City."
,,"Wonderful place to visit, botanic beauty.",5.0,,An extensive area of well sign posted paths take you through a range of environments and themes. The National Orchid Garden has a small charge but certainly value for money if you like the stunning orchid flowers on display. A final view of these is also available at Changi Airport just as you leave Singapore.
,,Just a park,3.0,,"I must admit, I was a bit disappointed with the Botanic Gardens. Having read that it was one of the must visit places in Singapore, my wife and made sure it was on our list of places to visit. It was nice to walk around the park, but I was expecting it to be more spectacular. The Orchid Gardens was very pretty, but I would not rush to visit again."
,,Eden Garden,5.0,,One can almost think that you have discover the secret Eden garden. Each single steps in the garden brings you to discover new flowers and floral composition. It is certainly a must see when you travel to Singapore.
,,Excellent walk,5.0,,"Excellent park and well maintained, as you walk around and visit the different gardens on display. Staff are very nice and always smiling, really good place to visit might come across some turtles in a small lake. Have a great time"

,,Beautiful Botanic Gardens,4.0,,"After countless trips to Singapore I wanted to visit the UNESCO listed gardens. In true Singaporean style, everything here is beautifully cared for and tidy. It appears to be a popular spot for locals and tourists. The cafes in the grounds are a lovely stop for brunch"
,,Beautiful and free Botanic Gardens.,4.0,,Beautiful gardens to stroll around. You could easily spend a day here if you factored in lunch. We took half a day and just took water & bought ice lollies. Lots of great opportunities to take photographs especially around the lakes and the Orchid Garden was stunning ( which was 5$entry).
,,Best to visit once.,4.0,,"This is another attraction in the Marina Bay area. It is just adjacent to the Gardens by the Bay and this attraction is best visited before dusk when the light shows go on. Entrance is free, just walk in and enjoy the lights and sounds."
,,Best garden in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore Botanical Gardens has a long history that takes you back all the way to the Japanese Occupation era. If you really want to experience stepping on the footsteps of the Japanese soldiers and enjoying the flora of the garden, I will highly recommend you to come to this fascinating place. You take around 3 hours to cover the whole garden. Honestly, I would choose this place over Gardens By The Bay as there are spots in Singapore Botanical Gardens to rest and relax privately, and get away from the heavy crowds. I feel that it's best going in the evening as it will not be hot then."
,,"Beautiful gardens, fascinating displays in an oasis of peace and quiet. But a pity so many plants lack labels",5.0,,"Don’t miss the opportunity to visit, the gardens are beautiful with a fascinating array of very informative displays, some of the best we’ve seen anywhere in the world. We learnt a lot in our day exploring the garden and a visit to it library and botany centre. All the staff we met were friendly, helpful and obviously well informed and keen to promote the garden’s conservation agenda. The place is well maintained, manicured even, where appropriate. We look forward to a return visit soon. Our one disappointment was that not more plants bore labels, though we appreciate that this is huge and almost endless task. But please, garden staff, don’t be discouraged, you’re doing a great job! That entrance is free was a great surprise and welcome contrast to many other world class botanic gardens."
,,Beautiful and free,5.0,,These grounds are really fantastic and the lakes have huge fish in so bring some fish food. There is so much to see here and you get a map on entry to work out where to go. Enjoy.
,,Good to go in different event time,5.0,,"Although Singapore has no seasons like Japan, this place is highly recommended to visit at because they are presenting different type of flowers or plants by Each event like orchid festival, Halloween etc... Good for family to spend half for trip."

,,Stunning.,5.0,,"Being an orchid lover this was on the top of my list for our visit to Singapore and I wasn't disappointed, I was blown away. Even if you don't like orchids, go and have a look, it could just change your mind. They are doing renovations at the moment, with what they have planned, lets just say it's going to be spectacular and I can't wait to see it in a couple of years time when it will be open."
,,wow,5.0,,so close to the city yet so quiet and peacefull. A must go when in singapore . also a nice view in the normal life with all the park users
,,Peaceful walk through lovely gardens - for free.,5.0,,"Just a short bus ride from Orchard Central. Bus stops near one of the entrances to the Botanic Gardens. Beautifully manicured grounds, well signposted and various pathways. The SMRT Station is also near the entrance we came in so caught the train to Raffles. Lovely relaxing morning."
,,Relax for the day,5.0,,Most Singapore attractions don't start until 10am. Be an early riser and walk through the gardens at first light. Magical. Spend the hottest part of the day under cover and see the National Orchid garden ($5) in the late afternoon.
,,Stunning Orchid Garden,5.0,,"What a beautiful Garden. Easy to get to with the SMRT. The Botanical Gardens is lovely. The Orchids Garden is definitely a highlight. This is a must to see.

,,The most diverse orchid garden,5.0,,"The botanical gardens of Singapore are a gem in the city state. I mainly spent time in the orchid area, which you need to pay extra to enter. The collection of orchids is beyond amazing. It takes at least half a day to go through it. The rest of the gardens are well manicured as expected in Singapore. This is definitely a must go place."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Wow, this place is huge. You always see the high rises and bay area when looking at Singapore online, but this Garden went on for miles and had so much beautiful plant life and open space. My wife and I truly enjoyed the Walk of Giants along the bridges and in the tree lines. We were lucky enough to make it during a local orchestra performance at a concert hall hidden in the middle of the park. They have a ginger and orchid garden that do cost extra for access, but well worth it."

,,Delightful open space,4.0,,"I hadn't visited the Botanical Gardens for over a decade. The addition of an MRT station some years ago is pure genious as you can walk all the way through the Gardens to the top end of Orchard Street for access to another station, or some shopping. The Gardens are an oasis of calm in this busy city state, offering various paths through stunning foliage and whimsical rock forms. Spend some time by the lake with the otters as their synchronised diving is something to rival olympians. But please respect the turtles as they sleep on the lawns edging the lakes, not every turtle wants to be your selfie buddy."
,,Amazing gardens!,5.0,,For sure the best orchid garden I have ever seen! I could have spent all day here. A must see if you are in the city!
,,Absolutely recommended,5.0,,"Probably the best Botanic Gardens I've ever been to. Free admission and they are absolutely immaculate and very well maintained. So many paths and different areas.

At times there wil be orchestras showcasing their ensemble at a stage in the middle of the lake in the garden."
,,Beautiful space,5.0,,We took a couple of hours to walk around the Botanical Gardens. It is a beautiful space with lots of places to sit and reflect on life or on the lovely selection of tropical flora. There were people walking and others running through the grounds. A great place for families. This is clearly the Central Park of Singapore.
,,"Relaxing, amazing and beautiful",5.0,,"Even from my childhood days, the place has always relax me with its calmness, big enormous tree, beautiful swans in the lake and amazing types of beautiful flowers. Then, I had my wedding ceremony and dinner at the Burkill Hall, with wonderful unforgettable memories.

,,A place just to take your mind off the busyness of life,5.0,,Just wandering through the gardens is enough to help you get a sense of calm. If you are lucky you might even see a squirrel close up which is what we saw at the SPH walk of giants.

A great place in a wonderful city."
,,Singapore Botanical gardens.,5.0,,"A must see when in Singapore, especially the Orchid gardens, so make sure that you take your camera. It is quite easy to get to as has the MRT stops right outside the front gate.
Also take plenty of fluids with you as the humidity can be overwhelming, although there a number of cafes providing cool drinks and snacks."
,,A serenic walk,5.0,,"With a busy and noisy city, finding a quiet place close to nature, Botanic Gardens has done that. It provides you with the experience you need to find yourself and be with.

It is a rich experience and would suggest if anyone enjoys such places, this is one you cannot miss."
,,Lovely Gardens,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens are extensive, so have your walking shoes on! In a City like Singapore it is lovely to see so much greenery. Whilst walking around we saw 2 large monitor lizards which was fantastic. Probably best to visit early in the morning as it gets quite hot!

,,Beautifully Well Maintained Gardens,5.0,,"I have been to many inner city botanic gardens and this is now one of my favourites. Full of colourful plants, flowers and trees as well as many species of birds and insects which create melodious music as you walk round the grounds. The orchid gardens is a must for a small fee of $5 for adults and free for children 12 and under.

There are plenty of benches throughout to rest on in the hot humid weather. The gardens are large so allow plenty of time. Best to go in the morning before it gets too hot. I would take water but there are water fountains (not chilled) and places to buy cold beverages.

Great outdoor activity while in Singapore."
,,Pictures taken at Botanic Garden,4.0,,"This is another attraction place besides Toa Payoh Garden. We went there to take our wedding photos in Jan 1988.

,,Wonderful,5.0,,"We came across this by accident, while on the hop on/off bus tour. We decided to give it a try to get away from the busy city. It was well worth it, the place takes your breath away. Plus there is lots of wildlife to see including lizards and otters. Plus the on site café is excellent valve for money."
,,Peaceful retreat,5.0,,"I would definitely recommend this free park or should I say botanical gardens. You will need around three days to explore it all though as there is so much to see and take in. I loved everything, especially the double swings that they had near the bandstand, towards the middle of the park. Watch for alligator type animals in the Swan Lake and otters, although we didn't see those, unfortunately, but if you are quiet and still, they appear. Just sit on many of the benches, to soak up the atmosphere and smell the floral aromer. Well worth a visit and it is one of the places in Singapore that is free."
,,Always a Relaxing Place,5.0,,"Tend to come here every visit, and just spend some relaxing time after travelling to chill out and enjoy what nature has to offer. The gardens are neat, clean and offer a variety of spaces.

This time, saw otters in the Swan Lake, and large lizards swimming there too.

There was a free concert by the University orchestra, and they offered free ice cream too. Great Sunday afternoon, and a fabulous way to start my trip. Thanks Singapore!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Oh, these gardens are so beautiful. Relaxing, plenty of space to be peaceful and so much to see. The orchid collection costs $1 to go in if you are over 60. Beautiful beautiful collection. Could have taken 100 photos. Highlight of our stay."
,,UNESCO World Heritage site,5.0,,This is Singapore's only UNESCO World Heritage site. It is simply stunning and there is a very good reason is the first and only tropical botanic garden on the UNESCO's World Heritage list.
,,Quick visit,5.0,,Flowers are beautiful we had quick visit on a coach trip to kill time waiting for flight. There’s only so much I can say about flower beds
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"As we expected, the botanical gardens were stunning. 1 of only 3 botanical gardens in the world honoured as a UNESCO world heritage site. We didn't have as much time here as I would have liked but you could easily spend a good half day here. Great for all ages."
,,Stunning,5.0,,We had a fantastic time wandering around these beautiful gardens in light rain . They are beautifully set out and easy to stroll around. To see everything you need at least half a day.We were very lucky to see the orchids all out in full bloom. Would definitely go back again
,,Must visit !!!,5.0,,"Great place for everyone who loves nature, one of the best botanic gardens I have come across. Fully green as expected, several varieties of plants with clear description. A lake The place is maintained very clean"
,,A Relaxed Morning,4.0,,A lovely walk and lots of learning as you go through the Botanical Gardens. Enough places to rest and refresh yourself. Truly visitor friendly and easily accessible by MRT and Bus Services. A must visit in your Singapore itinerary - whether you are a plant lover or not!
,,Orchids a-plenty,5.0,,A return trip to the Botanic Garden was worth the wait. So peaceful and serene. A shame they were working at the Orchidarium but nevertheless the rest of the gardens are so worth a visit. Lovely places to have a snack and a drink and good disabled access too.
,,Just gorgeous,5.0,,Wonderful start to the day with my daughter. Had a lovely walk through the gardens. The orchid garden is stunning & worth a visit. We finished off with breakfast at Halia and it was just perfect.
,,Great for photography and relaxing time,5.0,,I took a macro lens to the garden and took a leisurely walk. There is much to photograph if you have the time. Spotlessly clean and well managed.
,,Nice gardens,5.0,,We visited these botanical gardens about 8 years ago and decided to return.It is a pleasant break from the normal Singapore city attractions. My wife definitely enjoyed the orchid garden.
,,Peaceful,4.0,,"You can get out there on the hop on hop off bus or catch a train. A place to just walk around and relax. The turtles and iguana type creatures were interesting to watch in the lake. There’s a bit of local wildlife to be seen in parts, but mainly us lovely gardens and grasses areas. There are places to eat too as well as toilets."
,,Quiet time to myself,5.0,,Really well-kept gardens. Great for group outing and solo. Be prepared for long walks. peaceful and beautiful. Nature's bounty well presented!
,,Explorer,5.0,,"Beautiful garden, youh need to see all, half a day to spend. There are food and beverage counters everywhere. You won't need to carry much, except comfortable shoes, fully charge camera and your wanderlust. The Orchid garden is a must."
,,Magical Garden in the Middle of the Metropolitan,5.0,,It is one of the most unique gardens that I’ve ever visited. A must see if you are in Singapore. I visited it during the day but I was told that it’s pretty magical at night. I did actually see what it looks like from a distance at night from a roof top bar and it was an amazing sight. Highly recommend it!
,,Family outing,5.0,,"Singapore oldest garden and maybe the most beautiful one . Great for family outing and picnic, children elderly all are welcome. Dog must be on leash all the time .

You get to see oaters , fish , swan and more animals . Lot of nature and greens"
,,"Huge gardens, well maintained.",5.0,,"We love coming here! It's huge so allow time to wander around. Lots of different exhibits and nature. Love the Terrapins in the lake, lovely gift shop and cafe."
,,My favourite place every time with kids,5.0,,"singapore is not just known for its shopping and food. there is botanical garden. its a UNICEF heritage site. Set beautifully. FREE. Hot humid are no barriers to certain type of tourists. Hats, suncreams, decent physical condition, water are all you need to explore the vast area. Swan lake with its real friendly swans, we saw gigantic catfishes. Lizards, squirrels, tropical birds. kids of any age will have fun exploring learning. grown ups can do some real immediate calorie burning and weight loss but strolling around rainforest. orchid garden, keppel wetlands were picturesque. lots of shaded rest areas with toilets and drinkable water spots. you can spend the half a day by cruising along the east part of garden till MRT stop, or do full day full lap out thru Napier exit (straight for gleneagles hospital for IV hydration)"
,,A quiet weekday walk,5.0,,"The garden has many heritage trees, very well kept and serene. Weekdays are great for a quiet walk. Avoid weekends if you want peace. Weekends crowd will see families, couples, and the usual foreign workers and domestic helpers having their picnics. The Botanic Gardens has two entrances. One entrance is by Cluny road, not far from Gleneagles Hospital and the other one at Bukit Timah Road. If you are around Orchard Road shopping area, the Cluny Road entrance would be nearer but you got to take a bus there. I found the most convenient is to take the train via the Downtown line to Botanic Garden station (DT9/CC19) or via Circle line at Bukit Timah road, and from there walk through the garden to the Cluny Road entrance. Good to stroll around late afternoon to evening, and have dinner around Orchard road area. The other way is also great. Stroll from Cluny road entrance and ending at the Bukit Timah entrance, Then take the train to Beauty World station where there are many eateries around the station. The Beauty World station - the surroundings are typical of the local Singaporeans way of life, with affordable local foods, not the touristy belt of Orchard road. With the Downtown line and the Circle line, most places are conviently within reach."
,,City tour stop,4.0,,Fairly brief visit to these very pleasant gardens as part of a wider city tour. Amazing plants to see. Over-priced shop though.
,,Absolutely Beautiful,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens were beautiful. Lots of space for a picnic and plenty plenty of shade to walk in. Train station right at the gate makes it easy to get to. Maps at entry to assist in planning your walk. The gardens have free entry to main garden. A must see when you visit a city that takes so much pride in its gardens everywhere
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We walked from our hotel on orchard road to the gardens, not that far actually, so depending how your feeling you can do this or get a taxi, easy to get to either way, you’ll love the gardens as it’s just so relaxing to walk around, we paid to go into the orchid gardens, I’ll talk about this in another post, so after a few kilometres we decided to grab a taxi back to the hotel and go for something* to eat as you do in Singapore"
,,Gorgeous gardens!,5.0,,Beautiful gardens and free too! There was so much to see. We spent the whole morning here. The highlights are the orchid garden where they display the different species of orchids they've created. Many of the gardens are picturesque and great spots for photos or just a nice walk. The only thing I could ask for is signs and directions for the bonzai garden.
,,"5 Star Garden, 1 Star for...",1.0,,"Firstly we are locals and this is one of our favourite places to relax and wander around in Singapore. Definitely recommend a visit, especially in the evenings when it's cooler. Nature never disappoints, it's usually the few humans in it that do.

We were there at around 10pm - 1030pm one evening. We came across a wide wooden foot bridge across a little pond. We decided to lie down, at the edge of the bridge to enjoy the moonlight.
Only about 7 people passed us whilst we were there for about an hour and a half.
Firstly, we would like to point out that this bridge is more than wide enough for one to two 4-seater golf carts to drive through.

2 staff members drives up in their cart, telling us that we were not allowed to lie down on that bridge. We were completely dumb-founded.
It was near the middle of the night, there was no one about by then, we were not blocking anyone, we were not yelling loudly, we were not fishing, just 2 friends, (fully dressed by the way) lying quietly enjoying the nite. Frankly speaking, we do not see what the problem was. We were not causing any inconvenience to anyone, or any plant at the moment.

For a place that is suppose to offer relaxation and calm, it is far from that in this instance. Very sad that this type of blinkered attutude and lack of discretion as to when to enforce ""Rules and Reguations"" appropriately is not taken into consideration.

But of course, we are in a society that bans the sale of Rum and Raisin ice-cream after 1030pm just because there is an alcohol ban in general. What more can we expect?

Other than that, great garden ~ relax and enjoy if you can but you better check where you can or cannot lie down, whilst you are at it, maybe even check on where you are allowed to stand or sit."
,,Hard to take in all of the sights in one day!,5.0,,"Great place to go for a jog. The terrain is pretty flat and jogging is a good way to see everything, but it gets too crowded on weekends and certain other times to jog. The wooden deck trail through the rain forest feature seems to be a bit less crowded than some of the other trails."
,,SG Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"A nice relaxing visit, even when busy you do not feel over crowded. Easy to navigate around the site lots of exotic displays."
,,Gorgeous orchids!,5.0,,Loved this garden. We visited the orchid garden. Really beautiful. The best part is that the whole thing is free except select areas. The orchids are worth it!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The gardens were so beautiful and very easy to access via the mrt. The orchard garden had a small entrance fee attached which was definitely worth it with great photo opportunities.
,,Outing with a stroll at no cost,5.0,,"A lovely, spacious and wonderful garden to walk around in this small city. A lot of spots to enjoy without the hustle and bustle. Flora and fauna are quite a handful and nice to jog too. Please go and enjoy yourself with a relaxing mind if a have a spare time of a couple of hours to spend."
,,Amazing array of plants and scenery,5.0,,I am not particularly into gardens but the botanical gardens were beautiful. They were tranquil and had an incredible variety of plants and trees. They were free and not over crowded and I could happily have spent a whole day there.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,Beautiful green space very calm and lots of interesting areas to visit. The gardens are free and close to the MRT For a small charge you can visit the Orchid Gardens well worth the cost. Lovely restuarant in the middle for coffee or a meal.
,,A fantastic escape to nature.,5.0,,I spent a lovely afternoon strolling through the gardens of Singapore's Botanic Gardens. It's a nice way to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and it exposes one to the wide variety of flora associated with Asia and elsewhere. There are nature walks through natural habitats as well as well-tended English-style gardens. I thoroughly enjoyed the time that I spent there and would have devoted time to visiting the National Orchid Garden had I time to do so. I understand that it is well worth seeing. I didn't do so because I wanted to cover more of the sights along the Hop-on bus route.
,,well worth seeing and spending some time here!,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Garden is divided into three sections, each with its own identity featuring gazebos, pavilions and bandstands.The grounds contain a large lake, a dazzling array of flowers and shrubs, and many tree species. There is also a rain forest. Locals as well as tourists come here to relax and you can see many people jogging, feeding the wildlife, and enjoying the quiet that the garden provides. it is easily accessible with either the MRT [subway line] or if you do the hop on hop off bus, there is also a stop. There is no entry fee. There is a charge, however, for the Orchid Garden. Wear a hat, bring an umbrella and make sure you have bottled water-it can get hot."
,,Serene experience.,5.0,,The botanical gardens are stunning. They are immaculately maintained and the orchid area is easily worth the small entrance fee. We had a long quiet walk through the park and enjoyed every moment.
,,Amazing Orchid Displays,4.0,,"As far as National Botanical Gardens go, I would probably rate 3 - 31/2 stars, but the Orchid Display pushed the rating up.

Great place for a stroll and relax or if more inclined then do the local thing and pack a lunch basket and enjoy the surrounds. Like anything else in Singapore, if plan is to be outdoors make sure you are prepared for the obligatory afternoon storms"
,,Lovely gardens even better that it's free!,5.0,,"Spent a lovely few hours here but we could have spent more time here as they are huge! We took the MRT to the Botanic gardens stop which is right outside one of the entrances. The entry is free. This place is huge and there are plenty of gardens and lakes to walk round.

We walked back to Orchard Road which only took us about 15 minutes.
Would recommend it here."
,,Love the place!,4.0,,"We love everything these gardens have to offer.
Firstly, entry & the information desk is free. (The Orchid Gardens within the main Gardens cost S$5.00 per adult-Kids? & are well worth entry)
Everywhere is extremely well kept & clean. The Gardens are big/small enough, for a couple of hours of easy walking & a few good hours of just lazing about enjoying the views.
There's plenty of tree shade cover to blank out the sun & even a waterfall to make you feel like Tarzan (if you remember that series.
The only negative, is the fitness gurus & joggers sharing the place. It detracts from the slow pace & finds you dodging the odd sweaty oncomer. A bit of jackhammer construction also found its way onto my home video audio background.
Our 4th visit & favour it over the new Gardens by the Sea tourist trap."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A must for any visitors. Its a jaw dropping experience. Just beautiful the staff are obviously proud of there efforts in producing a world class garden.
,,A Great Morning Walk,5.0,,"I was traveling on business and had a morning to spare for some personal time. So I just randomly decided to visit the Botanic Gardens since my hotel was offering a free shuttle ride. Thank God, I did. I had the most amazing time strolling through the garden. I am not a very romantic or poetic person and generally natural setting does not keep me hooked for long. But this one has been a pleasant surprise. I spent nearly 3 hours in the garden (incl. the Orchid Garden inside) and felt my flight fatigue washed away. The park is really well maintained, offers a great natural environment and probably because it's Singapore, the crowd (mostly joggers, a few tourist and school kids on excursion) was awesome as well.

The access to the whole park is free and you will need to pay a nominal entry fee only for the Orchid Garden."
,,A Hidden Gem of Singapore.,5.0,,This is such an amazing extra ordinary garden that it must be one of the topmost Singapore attractions. A place you can fall in love with especially if you are an enthusiastic Gardner!
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens are magnificent,5.0,,"Take a metro train to the gardens and you will be at the front door of the park. Allow for a min of 2 hours to walk around it. Probably need 3 hours if you don't mind getting lost. The gardens are in perfect condition and the variety of plants is very extensive.

Bad cat of Brissy"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,If you love nature and want to spend some good time with family. Go and visit Botanic Gardens at Singapore. You will love the air and
,,Lovely way to spend a day- but take plenty of water and a hat!,4.0,,"On a hot and humid day you'll need plenty of water. There are some drinks machines around the gardens, and some of the gardens are shady."
,,Lovely place to stroll,4.0,,"So many paths in here! If you followed them all, I feel it would take a few hours. We only spent an hour here, and it was very pleasant. Loved seeing the wild chickens and especially the turtles in the lake!"
,,Relaxing settings in the centre of Singapore,4.0,,"The botanical gardens in Singapore are both beautiful and provide you with a really nice place to escape and relax a bit from the big city.

Really convenient place for both a walk, a run, general relaxing or just sightseeing since it is a really beautiful place with a lot of different places to visit."
,,"Love, love nature",5.0,,"I love nature, and this one's a welcome retreat within the heart of a bustling city. I'm keen on walking along the Gardens just to have some peace of mind."
,,Garden of Eden,5.0,,Right in the middle of Singapore lies this gem! One can spend an idyllic afternoon reading a book and feeding the swan or come for a quick power jog in the morning. The orchid garden is just staggeringly awesome... just a tad too well manicured!
,,Must see place,5.0,,"Really one of the main attractions in Singapore.
We loved the walks around . It was a different place an temple of harmony and balance.
We would be sorry if we have missed this garden - it is a must. Our favourite part was the orchid garden make sure you find it."
,,Must visit the Orchid Garden within the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Great gardens covering large area. You must visit the Orchid Gardens, they are truly outstanding and quite remarkable. MRT Botanic Gardens and walk through. Pick a cooler time of day."
,,A week in Singapore,5.0,,Breathtakingly beautiful gardens. We love visiting botanic gardens wherever we travel. And this garden delivered that promise for us. I had the greatest time in the National Orchid Garden. It is my most favourite type of flower. I was amazed at how many different types there are. I could not stop taking pictures coz each spot commanded just that!
,,"Gorgeous gardens, best place to visit",5.0,,"Such a peaceful place in the middle of bustling Singapore! Lovely walk around the park, if you're lucky you might spot some rare birds and lizards. Plenty of families were having a picnic in the fields so that might be an idea!"
,,Beautiful place to visit,4.0,,"The botanic gardens are wonderful, full of lots of different display gardens and plants. Plenty of wildlife too. You need at least half a day here so bring a lunch or there is a cafe on sight. Easy to get there on the hippo hop on hop off buses."
,,Just Beautiful!,5.0,,"We recently visited these gardens as we stayed nearby at the Jen Tanglin Hotel which is only a few minutes walk away. The flowers and gardens are breathtakingly beautiful, especially the wonderful displays of orchids. A must do when visiting Singapore!"

,,Fantastic,5.0,,Beaitifil place with a very varied mis of flora. Well manicured lots of eating and resting places. Heavenly
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Jungle in a city, the gardens were beautiful, refreshing and interesting. Felt and sounded like we were in a jungle even though in a sprawling city. The orchid garden was worth paying for and if you are in Singapore definitely a must see."
,,A day of painting,5.0,,"I come to Singapore often and have been to the Botanics many times with friends, but wanted to treat myself to a day of painting alone and to be able to go where I wanted, when I wanted and for as long as needed.
The park in general is free. there is a small charge for the Orchid Garden, which I strongly recommend a visit to.
It was a hot day but there are many places to shelter from the midday sun. I chose to spend quite a bit of time in the Ginger Gardens as it was cool with numerous seats and lots of wildlife! Just be aware of biting insects.
You can walk miles on easy smooth paved walkways. There is quite a bit of reconstruction going on, so parts of the park can be noisy, but most places are peaceful especially on a weekday. There are a few places to eat, but again there is some renovation going on in the main area. I had a great full day."
,,Amazing flowers and plants,5.0,,We spent 4 hours at the Botanic Gardens and the Orchid Gardens. It wasn't enough. We were able to explore at our own pace and had some great encounters with monitor lizards!
,,A good place to visit with convenient transport,5.0,,"Do visit this place during the early part of the morning ... to experience the fresh air and beautiful natural surrounding and lush greenery & lesser crowd. There are lots of different tropical plants (trees, shrubs etc) in this garden, with detailed information for your reading, or just to have a leisurely stroll away from the city. The MRT is located near Adams Rd Entrance ... and there is Adams Road Hawker center nearby; besides the eateries within the garden, that conveniently located near the MRT after a day of walking. If you want to go local."
,,Just fabulous,5.0,,A must see need your walking shoes on and cool comfy clothes. So much to see worth paying to see orchid garden its beautiful
,,An oasis,5.0,,We spent a full morning here. The gardens are beautiful and the orchid displays are astounding. This is a oasis in a very busy city. You can walk up from the main shopping area. We really enjoyed our trip. Recommended.
,,A bit disappointed ........,3.0,,"We had a nice walk through the gardens, but really it didn't seem that special. A lot of the gardens are in an open area. The Orchid Gardens were very good, and I've left a separate review for them."
,,At one with nature,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens are massive and full of various themed gardens, amazing flowers and local wildlife.
Spend a whole day here experiencing various plants species in a selection of gardens - the evolution garden, bonsai garden and orchid garden are a must see. You will have to pay $5 to enter the orchid garden, but all else is free.

There are multiple facilities and eateries on site or plenty of space for a picnic.

You may even be lucky enough to see some of Singapore's native wildlife. I managed to see monkeys, monitor lizards, turtles, otters, squirrels and various bird and insect species.

It is a good day out or just for a stroll.

You can easily get there via the Downtown or Circle MRT lines, with stations on site."
,,stunning,5.0,,What a lovely place to visit very lovely colours of orchids and all types of shrubs and plants. Lovely shaded areas and lots of goodies in the gift shop
,,A different image of Singapore,4.0,,If I didn’t visit this place I wouldn’t believe this exists in Singapore! Singapore is famous for architectural beauty and this place has added a feather to Singapore’s beauty. Enjoyed my time strolling around this place. Recommended.
,,An oasis of plant life beauty and nature,4.0,,Always wanted to visit this historic UNESCO attraction mainly to see the National Orchid Garden. I must admit the garden and meandering paths are very pleasant and the main house with rare orchids on display with information on the plant itself was fascinating as well as breathtaking. The information on the pollination process and how the orchids get their different colours was an education. Not the spectacle I imagined but the displays and the attention to detail are impressive. It didn’t take too long to walk around but is a lovely place nonetheless. I did not have time to visit the other gardens and wish I had. Worth planning a lot more time here although if you have done the Bay Gardens you might feel that was enough.
,,So peaceful,5.0,,Such a peaceful and happy garden. Was visiting it because my friend was getting married inside and it was one of the most beautiful weddings I'd seen.
,,Tropical Gardens,4.0,,"We went to the Botanical Gardrns when in Singapore last, having been years earlier. We did the gardens as part of the Hop On Hop Off bus tour. You would probably need three hours to see everything the gardens has to offer including the orchard gardens. As the weather is humid it does take time. I would highly recommend the gardens as a must see when in Singapore."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Caught the MRT to botanic gardens. Has its own station, so easy to get to. There is a map as you walk in, so easy to plan which direction you’d like to walk in. Also well signed along the way. Free entry to main gardens.
Nicely spread out gardens. Green and lush all around. Costs $5SGD per person to enter National Orchid Garden. We felt it was money well spent. Beautifully maintained."
,,Must see while in Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of the most beautiful gardens I have ever been in. It's well worth taking time out of your calendar, especially if you're in SG for more than a couple of days. It feels like you have left the concrete jungle to the nature."
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,"Do not miss this! Spectacular and beautiful. Even with little time, it is worth a short (or longer) walk around!"
,,Nice green n beautiful garden,4.0,,"Meet up with friends at the cafe inside the garden, n walk around after brunch, my little round at 7 months n he loves looking around, nice place to have some walk, sunny but breezing...
must check weather before go n few entrance to get into the garden so must tell specific location for meet up..."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"Be sure you give yourself enough time to really walk around and enjoy this natural beauty! The Orchids are of course magnificent, but the ponds and gardens and unique trees are all equally spectacular. You will see friends on power walks on the cool, shaded trails and couples enjoying a peaceful moment watching the turtles swim by in the lakes. I've never seen such large Lily Pads and such interesting tree configurations. Truly a unique display of the incredible beauty found in nature-and its right in the heart of the city!"
,,Great way to spend an afternoon in Singapore,4.0,,If you love the outdoors and have a few hours to kill in Singapore then this is a great place to visit. I'm not a garden lover per say but enjoyed the time I spent here as it gets you away from the concrete and shopping of downtown Singapore.
,,Stunning gardens,5.0,,"We're on the last leg of a grand tour of Australasia, and this is our third botanic garden, and by far the best. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Sight for good reason- it’s extensive, lush, beautifully maintained and free! We did add on a visit to the Orchid gardens, which were fantastic, and the cost was a very reasonable S$5."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A lovely sanctuary after the hustle and bustle of the city. Extremely well laid out and cared for. The staff were very friendly and helpful too.
,,Green forest,4.0,,"The place is nice, refreshing, natural, when you visit Singapore! Visit the botanical graden. you will appreciate the beauty of natureball though it's man made attraction. And You'll love it."
,,Paradise must be like this!,5.0,,"A nice, refreshing, natural, must do stop in your visit to Singapore! Splendid gardens. You'll love it."
,,Greenery in the heart of town!,5.0,,Lots of different gardens and areas to explore / chill / picnic / dine! Kid friendly. Great outdoors for this little red (cosmopolitan) dot!
,,A beautiful dogs friendly park.,4.0,,"There are many parks in Singapore, however not all of them are dog friendly. We used to brought our fur-kid there for a walk and enjoy the fresh air. It is a great place for picnic, and sometimes the park organised free performance during the weekend.
It is a great place to visit."
,,Day trip,5.0,,"It was a particularly hot and cloudless day the day we visited here. Bring. A hat with you and plenty to drink. We arrived on one of the hop on hop off buses. The chap at reception was very helpful, asking if there was anything specific we wanted to see, then marking them on a map and pointing us in the right direction.

We’d pre booked tickets for the Orchid Garden via Groupon. You’ve to pay for this but but entry to the rest of the Gardens is free. For me this was the best bit (the rest of the gardens are great, don’t get me wrong, but the Orchid Garden is sensational). The beauty and colour of the flowers takes your breath away. A must see attraction."
,,It's Free!,4.0,,There is nothing better than spending an afternoon walking around the botanic gardens with the family. It gives the kids a bit of fresh air and everyone gets a bit of well needed exercise. And the best part about it all is that it's free!
,,The best freebie!,5.0,,"We spent around 5 hours here, it was absolutely fantastic. I loved it all, the gardens with their plants & colourful flowers, the lakes, & wildlife, the cave with the waterfall where you can walk through to cool off, & those swinging chairs were amazing. We had the most delicious Fanta grape drink at Casa Verde on the way in & out, & lunched on Caesar Salad with a wonderful black garlic sauce at Halia Restaurant. What a day!"
,,A Walk Through Mother Nature At Her Best,5.0,,If you want a breath of fresh air whilst being immersed in a kaleidoscope of natures finest floral display then this is worth a visit. There are great photo opportunities although it can sometimes be a bit too crowded with tourists. It's still nevertheless worth a visit.
,,wonderful experience,5.0,,"this botanic garden is now over shadowed by the garden by the bay but if you have time, don't miss it. It is free entry and worth the walk. the swan lake has monitor lizard, otter. we were lucky enough to spot 2 otter in that lake and they were having their freshly catch fish. so amazing to find wild animals in their natural surrounding in busy Singapore."
,,Tranquility!,5.0,,"What a well maintained gem this is! Take time to wonder through the most magnificant gardens, wade through the orchids, sit at swan lake and stare into heaven! This is a must visit that one needs at least 4-5 hours for! The shrubs, the trees, the layout, there simply is no way to adequately describe this treasure chest. One simply needs to experience it firsthand!"
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,Very large gardens including a number of specialist areas such as the Ginger garden. Has an outdoor theatre and a couple of cafe/ restaurants at least. A stunning orchid collection although was $5 extra when I went. Served by.an mrt station and I saw disabled access for many areas. A must for the tourist.
,,Relaxing space where you can forget you are in a bustling city!,5.0,,"These gardens are wonderful - plenty of space to wander round and relax. Very old trees, park area, lakes, ginger garden, orchid garden, rainforest area, and so much more that I didn't have time for! You could spend hours in here!

It is a great place to catch your breath yet at the same time have all the senses heightened. Lots to see, touch, smell and a number of eating places - Halia had some intriguing healthy drinks such as Turmeric & Cucumber & a range of food.

The Orchid Garden was well worth the $5 - so many shapes, colours, sizes - incredible work done by all the garden teams. Thank you!"
,,Peaceful and free,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a haven of peace. Entrance is free. But you have to pay if you want to see the National Orchid Garden set within the Botanic Gardens.

You should plan a whole day to see the Gardens. I would recommend taking snacks and liquid refreshment with you.

Entrance was at the Tanglin Gate end. We strolled through the beautifully maintained gardens. There was a small lake - Swan Lake - which had beautiful swans. There was a lovely sculpture in the middle of the lake.
The trees are labelled - as are the plants. There were many beautiful exotic flowers in various colours.

The Lily pond was amazing. Some of the lilies were quite large.

The National Orchid Garden has an admission fee - and is a must visit garden. I have written a separate review of this.

There is also a Bonsai tree centre and a Ginger garden.

The water features have been thoughtfully created.

The Singapore Botanic Gardens are definitely wiorh a visit."

Lovely to take a walk through all the well maintained gardens, just to get away from the hustle & bustle of the busy shopping centres. We woke to thundery showers, but this cools everything down, so it made it so pleasant to exercise and stay shaded amongst all the trees. The Orchid Garden is well worth a visit, as the orchids were all in full bloom. You can enjoy a meal at the restaurant, but as we had already had breakfast, opted for a very nice coffee."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"A must visit to anyone going to Singapore! I am a garden lover but for anyone, this is a great place to visit. Be prepared to walk and take an umbrella of course! The gardens are superb; lush, tropical and beautifully manicured. The facilities are good - we went to the cafe at the visitor centre and it was just a lovely setting. The orchid garden is spectacular - no other word for it: I am not ordinarily an orchid lover. However, in this setting which is just made for orchids, the variety and displays are truly incredible.
There is also a children's garden which has some wins: mainly the zip wire. The water fountains were unfortunately not on when we visited."
,,Monitor lizard eating a turtle!,5.0,,"I love Botanic gardens and always make a point of visiting new ones when I travel. SIngapore was great but really really hot to walk around! The ladies at the gate were super friendly and helpful and the gardens had beautiful old trees, lake and flowers and interesting wild life - we stumbled upon a 1 1/2m long lizard eating a turtle in the undergrowth which was rather exciting, all of the smaller lizards in the neighbourhood were converging on him too so after a heap of photos were carried on to the Orchid Gardens which weren't all that exciting... they were nice but not as full on as I had expected. This may have been a seasonal thing though so take my review with a grain of salt and go there if you get the chance!"

Last time it was the rainforest that sits almost in the middle of this extensive garden. Also, the heliconia walk & the ginger garden are special spots in the oasis of green in the heart of bustling Singapore. And birding is possible as the photo of the somewhat shy Red-legged Crake shows. Admission is free except for the Orchid Garden that has a minimal entry and is well worth it. There's a subway stop steps away from the park."

The gardens are huge and peaceful and broken up into zones where you can learn and experience such as medicinal plants. There is shade but also huge humidity, especially in the rain forest.
Once you have had your fix of peace and tranquility, you can easily walk from the 'other' end of the gardens to Orchard Road and shopping mall madness..."

On weekends and public holidays, the garden can be quite crowded. Parking at the various parking lots are quite expensive. So it is best to take the downtown line 3 early in the morning and spend the early morning roaming over the place. My favourite is still the orchid enclosure after all these years. There are a few restaurants scattered around the garden. The ginger garden is a must visit. The Halia Restaurant would be a nice place to hold reception."

,,Amazing!,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the gardens.!!

So beautiful!

Spent almost all morning in the gardens.
Wonderful!!

Visited the Orchid Gardens (5sgd per person-the rest of the garden is free). Since singapore as so much green and flowers and orchids almost everywhere, we felt that the money spent in tge orchid gardens was not worth it ( we moked that we have seen more orchids in an interior garden at the airport than on the orchid gardens). You do see several orchids at the garden and they are really beautiful.
Besides what I've said, I think you should visit the orchid garden just manage your expectations."
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,"Free entry, easy to get to by MRT. Make sure you go to the National orchid garden ($5 to get into) but worth it. Spent several hours here just strolling around looking as the plants etc. a really cheap day out"

My family loved it here - so much so we spent 7 hours here! I would give a lot to see a concert here. Oh and you can hire a wheel chair at the entrances or in the centre for free but it is first come first served."
,,Very Enjoyable,4.0,,A must see in this City even when sweltering hot. Only criticism is that lots of the signposts don’t actually point to the destination they show and the distances not very accurate. All part of the charm but wearing after a while. It is free though.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"The gardens are beautiful for just walking around or enjoying some free time. I also enjoyed the small specialty gardens throughout and that there was a good amount of information to read about the plants, which were well identified. Very interesting. The orchid gardens are a must see and worth the price of admission. Even though a lot of flowers were not blooming in the park, the orchids were all in full bloom and gorgeous."
,,Wonderful relaxing and pretty place,5.0,,"It's a large park and the flowers on display are very wonderful indeed, took so many photos, very nice walking around here in the morning"
,,Excellent,5.0,,We spent a whole day here & still had to go back a second to see everything. There is just so much to see & its all free. Just make sure you wear comfortable shoes as there is miles of walking to do
,,Using the Mrt to get there,4.0,,"Trying out the Mrt route to the Unesco-listed Gardens and found it efficient. Not very fast on the Downtown Line from Expo, about an hour before it gets to the Bukit Timah gate but you are right there and can make your way through the Trellis Garden which seemed a fairly new installation, very nice with creeping plants that form arbors and overhangs. About 1 km to reach the central spot where the Gift Shop and Cafe Verde is. The 2 black swans are a delightful sight on the lake and they even come up and glide among the trees as are the colorful cockerell and hens who are endearing residents of the lovely gardens. Signage is excellent and there is plenty of information on the equatorial forest, palms, heliconia, local herbs like ginger, hence the halia garden and the rather expensive restaurant next to it, of the same name. A delightful 2 hour ramble. Unfortunately after reaching Nassim Gate at the Orchard Road side, you'll have to double back to the Nassim Road Gate for the Mrt. Fine for a reason fit person."
,,Amazing tropical garden,5.0,,"It is Singapore’s version of Central Park of New York! An amazing park with more than 150 years of history. UNESCO has declared the park as a UNESCO world heritage sight. The huge park at the heart of the city is conveniently located next to the Botanic Garden MRT and also served by a fleet of public buses. There are beautifully landscaped gardens, several lakes and water bodies, a man made waterfall and other picturesque areas to relax. There is an amphitheater surrounded by a pond filled with water lily, where I have seen regular concerts being hosted on weekends. Not to forget about the very unique and colourful national orchid garden, which is inside the park. I must also mention about the restaurants and eateries within the premises, which just adds to our experience whenever we visit the botanic garden"

,,Just lovely,5.0,,We walked around the gardens for a couple of hours and they were gorgeous. Lots of little side routes to take. If you have the time certainly worth a visit.

,,UNESCO Heritage Site in Singapore!,5.0,,The Gardens are comparable to those found in grounds of castles and stately mansions in England and France.

,,Morning run in Singapore Botanical Gardens,4.0,,A great place to run in the morning but ideally start at or just after dawn before it gets too hot. It’s a short run from most of the Orchard Rd hotels and a great way to start the day. However leave plenty of time for a swim or shower to cool down

A vast place, well organized and very well maintained with a great variety of plants and flowers and also with great artistic staff of fountains and statues. The entrance is free, but it's highly recommended to spend a few dollars to enter the National Orchid Garden, you shouldn't miss it. I had a great, maybe 4 hours wandering through the place, even when it was heavily raining in September, it even gave a more delicious taste for a wonderful tropical garden.

,,A walk in nature,4.0,,"A must visit place if you have a couple of hours to spare and you're looking for a nice walk in nature in the middle of a concrete jungle. You can do more of course like having a picnic, honing your photography skills, and broadening your knowledge of exotic orchids. Considering that it gets quite hot and humid even in this green haven, it's best to visit in the early morning or in the evening. Getting there is no problem as the MRT takes you right to the doorstep. And admission is free!"
,,A very special place in Singapore's urban jungle,5.0,,"As world travelers who have been in the tropics for many years, we love visiting the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It is a beautifully landscaped 82-hectare botanic garden with towering trees, meandering footpaths and whimsical sculptures. Admittedly, our ultimate destination is always the National Orchid Gardens (located inside the Botanic gardens) where we spend hours (in spite of the humidity) ... we're hoping the extensive 'enhancement' work will be completed soon as we miss the Mist House. We always try to go early in the day (alternatively late) when it is cooler and less chaotic."

I got there just after a shower so a little humid but the rain drops on the flowers was fantastic.
Lonely trees, and lawns but main reason to visit was the orchid garden, sensational. So many growing there various colours and sizes.

These concerts can range from Jazz to Classical or even contemporary music. You can sit back and relax with a bottle of wine and a picnic. Fabulous. Go and chill out there.

,,Even my 4-year old was engaged,5.0,,"I took my 4-year old daughter here for a couple of happy hours on a Monday afternoon in July.

Be warned! Mondays = CLOSED for a lot of stuff in SGP, including the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden, which was a shame as it looked very promising, but even with that being the case, we still had a delightful time.

We visited the Herb Garden (small but lovely), the Ethnobotany Garden (slightly over her head but interesting for grown ups), the Foliage Garden (unexpectedly captivating, walking along a raised walkway and being surrounded by literally every type of leaf you could imagine), and the Evolution Garden (the highlight of the visit, even though we accidentally did it backwards i.e. Rainforest back to Jurassic).

We saw free range cockerels, tiny hummingbird-type birds and mighty black swans.

It is simply stunning and awe inspiring, assuming you are moved by plants in any way.

We are considering returning later on in our holiday to check out the Children's Garden. I think she would love it."

Clean, Beautiful and soothing."

Tourists who goes there during the day and evenings will probably say ""beautiful gardens or the foliage is awesome"" but what they don't know is; the place is bustling with activities from 6am. Yes, 6am to 8.30 is where people from all walks will go there for their ""wellness and recharge their sanity"". You can join Tai Chi classes with very proficient master from China, or even huddle up with a yogi from India if you are lucky enough to bump into them. These are ""ordinary"" people like you and me, just going their for morning exercises. If you like, you may jog or simply walk around the gardens. These activities are all free of charge and you may even bump into Singapore's who's, who. Best part! All these are Free !"
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,It's quite a big garden with different zones for different types of plants. It's a quite place compared to the other tourist spots in Singapore.
,,Beauty,5.0,,Beauty abounds - well planned gardens which are spectacular. Take an umbrella for the sun or rain and enjoy.
,,Unmissable (that and the whole area),5.0,,"I am Italian, totally trustworthy and well travelled.
Well, this review is quite unuseful, since if you go there, the gardens are a must-see, as well as everything in the area.
Just a few cheap tips: if you use the subway to go there, don’t get the electic minibus that you find at the counters, just walk since it’s close and nice (the path). Check the schedule of the few things that happen at a certain time in the area: the mist and the sounds and lights show. Maybe also mixing it with the sounds and lights show at the bay.
In this way you can build up your best time to visit the gardens, without missing the other things running in the area."
,,Beautiful place.,5.0,,"So much to see here. You could easily lose yourself for 2 - 3 hours. We've visited before but never tire of it, it's just so beautiful."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"If you only have time to do one thing in Singapore, this should be it. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site with good reason. The immense garden is free with only a charge of one Singapore dollar for the National Orchid Garden - not to be missed. Together they comprise one of the world’s great gardens. Don’t miss the Ethnobotany exhibit and museum which is a new installation in the garden. You can happily spend the better part of a day experiencing a quiet respite from the bustle of the surrounding city."

Get there by the speedy and efficient MRT (both downtown and Circle line will take you there – however a distance from the Orchid Garden. If this is your priority I suggest a bus to Tanglin Gate (buses 7, 75, 77, 105, 106, 123 and 174)"
,,An island in the city,5.0,,"For me the most impressing place in Singapore. Apart from the orchid garden, there is no entrance fee - but the orchid garden is definitely worth the 5 SG$. Beautiful and fully grown park, clean, nice people- and even on Sundays you find places to be on your own."

,,Got caught in a strom for our second visit and I still love it!,5.0,,"Although a bit outside the city, I strongly recommend a visit to the Botanic Gardens. In my honest opnion, much better than the Flower Dome (at Gardens by the Bay).

This is a place you can just get lost in and enjoy every single path. My favourite bit on the last visit was the scent in the fragrant garden right after a heavy rain fall. The whole area smelled intoxicatingly delightful!"
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,"This is a great place to walk around and see plenty of different trees, plants and the like. If you stop long enough you'll also catch some glimpses of snakes, monitor lizards and other wild life rummaging around the trees.

The park is well organized and maintained with excellent exhibits of plants from Asia and around the world. The best part was the National Orchid Garden where we saw tons of orchids in bloom that were the most beautiful flow displays we have ever seen, and we have been to many botanical parks.

There are several restaurant options in the park for lunch. Overall this is a not to miss attraction in Singapore, plan to stay several hours to take it all in."

,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Perhaps a bit out of the way. Nevertheless, well worth a visit, if only to see the fantastic orchid display."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"By far the most interesting and beautiful botanic gardens I have ever visited. You could spend a whole day there and still not see everything. It is so extensive that you always feel secluded and peaceful, away from the hubbub of the city. We particularly enjoyed the evolutionary section and the rainforest walk, and of course the orchid gardens - these are worth the small entrance fee which is even smaller ($1) for seniors. The staff are extremely helpful, and there is a small cafe in the centre."

Its a great escape from the heat of the city and the calm quiet natural environment is enough to level the mind once again. The orchid garden needs to be seen to be believed, simply stunning! If you are lucky youll see a big lizard or two basking in the sun and squirrels are running around the place, birds are plentiful... Well worth the visit."
,,Botanical Beauty,5.0,,"The gardens have been certified by the UN as World heritage. We raced through there in about 2.5 hours, as the humidity got to us, but if we had started earlier at dawn it would have been more comfortable. The presentation an variety of plants is fantastic.The staff at information are fantastic helpful people. Yes , well worth a visit- allow some time to check it all out. look out for the sqirrels and the swans in the lakes."
,,Beautiful relaxing space,4.0,,"Walked with a friend around the botanical gardens and loved them. I think that if you enjoy a relaxing walk and can soak in the atmosphere of the outdoors and nature this is a lovely place to be. I cannot give full stars as I only managed to see half of the gardens but hopefully when I next return I can see the other part! (It was cool when we visited and drizzling and im glad we saw it in that weather)

As I said earlier, i missed out some parts due to lack of time, I believe we got there at 11 and left at 3-3.30 and that gave us time to walk around at least half the garden, stop for a cuppa and some food and head back to a Taxi collection point...we also paid to go and see the Orchid Garden which, in my opinion is worth it, the Botanical Gardens are free to enter.

This is a beautiful Botanical Garden with a variety of plants, water features, arches and other things to see if you enjoy gardens and nature, its a very relaxing space and nice if you fancy a nice stroll to switch off perhaps after some busy shopping!!"

,,Beautiful and peaceful,5.0,,"Went here as our first activity stop after arriving in Singapore. Travelled here using the MRT system which was simple. Entrance to the gardens is free and this is well used by locals, you can see plenty of people walking through on their way home from work, jogging or dog walking. We intended to spend a few hours walking around the gardens, however once we found a nice spot on a sloped hill by the lake (black swans and terrapins!), we ended up just laying down and chilling for a couple of hours. It is a really peaceful and well-kept garden and we couldn't believe we were in the middle of busy cosmopolitan Singapore. It was just what we needed after a half day of travel and it was a perfect place to relax."
,,Indulge with nature in a real garden city,5.0,,"Travellers can spend half day in the garden. Many different plants, trees and bushes from all over the world.

,,truly botanic and tropical !,4.0,,"Truly deserving of its world class heritage status

If i was to recommend more welcome features, it would be to have some air con kiosks for visitors to have a respite from tropical heat in the afternoon . otherwise a walk in the morning or evening would be best ."
,,Well planned and payed out garden.,5.0,,"One of the best city gardens I have visited, well layed out, easy walking and enjoyable to be part of.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,Time to wander and enjoy peace .. swan lake was lovely and we paid extra to go into the orchid garden which was well worth it...

,,Great Walk!,5.0,,"This was a great way to spend the afternoon - overall, it took about 4 to 5 hours, including a visit to the Orchid Garden. Wonderful walk through very well maintained garden, and most of it is free (except for the Orchid Garden for foreigners).

,,"Beautiful Botanic Gardens, easy to get to + free!",5.0,,"One of the highlights of our trip to Singapore was visiting the beautiful Botanic Gardens. The gardens were easy to get to on the MRT, the MRT station is literally at the entrance of the gardens so you can't get too lost!

The Gardens are set over a sprawling area, probably not an ideal place to visit if you have mobility issues. However for ourselves this was a huge advantage as there were no issues with over crowding, that we found at other Singapore attractions.

The Gardens themselves are very well maintained, there is a huge selection of flowers/trees & animals within the Botanic Gardens... monitor lizards, Hornbills & many more that bring the place to life.

The main park is free to enter, with additional cost to visit the Orchard area of the park. Unfortunately when we visited one of the areas we wanted to see the 'Healing Garden' was closed. (Oct' 17)"
,,Suggested duration 1/2 hours all day I think,5.0,,As per the title you will need most of the day due to the heat and the fact that there is so so much to see. Great for all the family and all abilities. There are the odd up and down steps but there are buggy slopes provided. There are toilet stops all the way around and food and drink stops mentioned on the reusable maps at the start if the gardens. There is good sign posting and information provided on the plants and the various special areas. The orchid garden is 5 dollar extra but it's very much worth it. The amount of effort time and money that goes into this place is phenomenal! A real gem. Do be prepared for blazing sunshine though. It does gets extremely hot but if you plan well you can follow quite a lot of paths in the shade.
,,A convenient garden,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens is not paradise but when you yearn for space among grand stately old trees ( when you can actually greet them by name ) , beautiful plants and flowers , miniature man-made lakes and water features , to relax or work-out , SBG is surely the place to go . The quietness , in spite of the presence of walking enthusiasts , informal tai chi get-togethers , dogs and their walking partners, is sweet!

And it's all in the heart of central Singapore ."
,,"Great park, lots to see",4.0,,"If you are looking for a nice area to walk that a s bit industrial this is your spot. It's an enormous park that has organized a number if different types if botanicals throughout the park. The majority of this place is outside so make sure you have umbrellas it light rain wear if a downpour happens.. it if you want a little shade. There's a small plaza in the middle that has a few places to eat or get a snack and if you are into orchids a paid section ( it's super cheap) displays one of the world's largest collection of orchids.

It's a really nice place to spend a day if you want to break up a string of urban destinations."
,,Beautiful and well maintained,4.0,,One of the tranquil place in singapore where the park is properly maintained and quiet. Hopefully to see more festival and events happening at this venue.
,,Well worth a visit and its FREE!!,5.0,,"Find time to unwind in these lovely well kept gardens, makes a nice contrast to the hussle bussle of Singapore!"
,,Perfect oasis,5.0,,Almost in the middle of the city there is this amazing Botanic Garden with a huge rainforest and a fantastic orchid garden. The whole area is free except the orchid garden.

,,highlight in Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore botanic garden is a highly educational place for children to teach them about biodiversity and make them appreciate the world of plants.

The plants and trees are signposted and the garden is divided into different thematic sections. The rainforest trails are particularly exciting for children and young teenagers. There are volunteers (mainly retirees) in the park to give directions and explain various parts.

The entrance is best reached by taxi and entry is free - only the orchid garden requires a fee."
,,Beautiful Orchids and Garden of paradise,5.0,,"Must visit the orchid garden, many beautiful orchids. The park also offers a nice walk to experience the rainforest in Singapore. Try having tea at the ginger cafe."
,,Beautiful Botanic Gardens,5.0,,This was my second visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens and it didn't disappoint. There were some new additions - one being a walk amongst tropical trees via a winding footpath taking you higher and higher into the trees. When you get to the top there is an amazing view. It was very hot and humid the day we visited but it was worth it.
,,One of the must be seen in Singapore,5.0,,One of the greatest hidden treasures is the orchid garden inside the botanical gardens in Singapore. Over 5000 varieties of Orchids set in a small section of the gardens. If you want to find tranquility this is the place to go. Singapore is an amazing city and these gardens do it proud.
,,"green,green everywhere!",5.0,,"so peaceful to look at the greenery . Orchid garden is outstanding, I was thrilled to learn about so many ginger plant varieties.More than the garden. After walking around the garden, it was indeed very refreshing to sit down, rest and relax at the restaurants inside the garden. We tried the bees knees for the afternoon lunch. It was packed, still the food served was so tasty especially the ice cream. For the evening cocktail hour, our son took us to Botanico. The hidden bar was amazing.I did not find any for the strict vegetarians, can't remember what they made for us. This experience inside a beautiful garden with wood rafters, and cool breeze is what would take me back to the gardens when i visit Singapore again."
,,Love the botanics,5.0,,"Great botanical gardens - love walking through or even better a run and never tire of the trails, my dog loves it too.

,,Great place for family,5.0,,This place has a garden for kids and my toddler loves it. Also organize free concerts every now and then.
,,Green oasis in modern city,5.0,,"My recent ""boom"" is the Botanic Garden. I live in Singapore for many years but didn't visit the botanic garden so after before. But once l realized the beauty of all the tropical plants and flowers, l can spend many hours admiring the variety of different pieces. Singapore has the tropical weather all year around, so the park is covered with greenery any time you visit. Yet we have new discoveries each visit as the plants and flowers show us different faces each day and each morning and afternoon.

The highlight is the Orchid Garden. It only costs 5 dollars to enter and can enjoy many kinds of Orchids with many photo spots.

My personal favorite is Ginger Garden. You cannot believe how many different species of ginger group exist in the southeast Asia, and many of them bloom uniquely beautiful flowers in the vivid tropical colors. Some look like a colorful bird. Their leaves are also shiny and beautiful. Currently there is an exhibition of sketches and paintings of gingers and the garden by the local artist, which inspired me of the art of drawing the nature. This is really worth viewing.

The garden also has many historical sites and monuments which l enjoy. I want to join a free tour next time to learn more about that tropical oasis in the middle of modern city, which has the long history."
,,Free Entry into Unesco Gardens,5.0,,"Absolutely brilliant gardens to explore. Try to go during the early mornings before 10am or in the evenings after 5-6pm to escape the tropical heat.

There are swans you can feed in the lake, lots of trails, a special children's section and even a bandstand where they have concerts! If you have time, check out the orchid garden (you need to purchase tickets for this part) which is really worth a visit if you haven't seen it yet."
,,Beautiful place for flower lovers,4.0,,"Peaceful nature, green environment, flowers are well maintain For rainy days, they don't have many places to take shelter Landscape is heavenly nice"
,,Lovely just to wander,4.0,,"Very easy to access by rail or bus, and worth spending much of a day just wandering. The orchid garden is spectacular, and the unobtrusive shelters very welcome during a tropical shower!"
,,A relaxing beautiful place,5.0,,"Botanic Garden is a must see park in Singapore. having different themes, you can experience a calm relaxing walk while hearing birds' calls. (If you are lucky with the weather, of course.) It's almost impossible to imagine such a relaxing place in the middle of vibrant city of Singapore. If it's the first time you are going there, do not forget to have a map. It's easy to loose your sense of direction over there. Do not forget to take umbrella (to protect you from either rain or sun). Although there are some potable water taps and also restaurants (next to the Orchid Garden), it's wise to have a bottle of water too. Visit and explore this beautiful place."
,,A heritage garden..,5.0,,It's always a nice place to be at Singapore Botanic Gardens becos since young i was brought to this place for our family gathering and etc... A childhood memory that i won't forget and now they have many cafes and new attractions to make us wanna go back for more! It is now a weekend place to go with my pet corgi!
,,Love running in this park,5.0,,"I love coming to this garden after work to run and walk. There are other runners, families walking about, people having picnics. It's a great environment to causally stroll or walk your pup. there are wild chickens and roosters about, and also Water and Cloud monitors all over the gardens.

,,Calm and Peaceful,4.0,,"Came up here via The Hop On Hop Off bus and decided to visit as it was somewhere my husband parents brought him in the 50's and 60's when they where stationed here with the RAF. It was a time to reflect and see how it had developed in all those years but other half couldn't remember!

It was very peaceful going around the gardens as we took in The Learning Forest, Swan Lake , The Lawn and The Dell to name but a few. We also visited The National Orchid Garden which there was a fee to go into.

Being a Sunday when we went it was very busy with locals who were out and about with their dogs, children and families. The gardens are used quite a lot by joggers and when we were there , there was a parent and child race going on around Swan Lake.

It was lovely to see all the flora and fauna and to see how lovely it was maintained was a treat!"

,,"Neat, well laid out gardens",5.0,,"A well maintained, well kept and well planned natural attraction. One can spend a full day here to enjoy the wonders of nature.

Loads of green spaces for picnics, family games and, simply to relax."
,,What a spectacular place!,5.0,,The Orchid Gallery within the gardens has an amazing display of so many different varieties that around each bend there was something more beautiful to be stunned by.

A wander around the rest of the gardens is also recommended.
,,Lovely green space for relaxing,4.0,,"Got to the Botanic Gardens via the hop on hop off bus. Gardens well maintained, quite a lot under maintenance on our visit. Nice water features as well as plenty of green area to relax. Can be hot and steamy walking around but there are some stops for refreshments. The staff at the entrance gates fantastic when we realised we left our camera on the bus, they phoned the bus company and asked for it to be left at Suntec stop for when we returned.

You can feel a leisurely time for recharging away from the city center. Even entrance fee is free! There is no reason not to go."
,,Very good place for joggers and young kids,4.0,,"It’s been many years since I came back to botanic garden for a leisure walk with my toddler and hubby. This time there’s more people visiting the park maybe due to the reputation of being a UNESCO world heritage site. In all senses, the place is easily accessible now thru mrt and the pavement is just so well maintained and broad making it a perfect place for pets, joggers and kids or strollers to access. It’s orchid garden is legendary and filled with all kinds of orchid. My fav. Is actually kind of old school.. which is the national flower of Singapore. I saw some families picnic there but really singapore is a very humid and warm place to think of doing it. Anyway it’s a nice place to visit since it’s free and provide a nice exercise ground away from the city’s hustle and bustle."
,,FLA SG H2 18,5.0,,"We had dinner there the food were so luxurious and delicious. They provide halal food and drinks so It’s suitable for all of us specially my mosleem associates.
This place is consider as a expensive place to have dinner, but the place is breathtaking.
We arrived in the afternoon where we can see the site, surrounded with forest and lots of birds chirping.
Bit scare at night for someone who afraid of the dark.
But bit trouble to find transportation on the way back to hotel. We waited for taxi quite along time."
,,Huge beautiful garden,4.0,,"The botanical garden of Singapore is massive, we walked around this place for hours looking at all the fun exotic plants and I don’t even think we saw everything there was. At the time my friends and I went they had their national orchid garden that cost 1 or 2 SGD for students and I would definitely recommend as it is full with the most gorgeous exhibits. There are a couple of shops and restaurants within here also, we were able to get brunch, a bit pricey but a nice view!

This is a great place to really learn about the different species of plants, flowers, and trees that exits all over Southeast Asia. We were even able to see some different kinds of wildlife like lizards and birds that you wouldn’t normally see around he city. This was a great place just to wonder around for the day or even go for a morning run. I especially enjoyed the bonsai tree exhibit there were so many different types! Also the garden had a couple of ponds and statues located all throughout!"
,,🇸🇬 Singapore botanic gardens just a delight our 16 year old girl loved today,5.0,,"Our 16 year old is hard to entertain - it takes a lot to impress her amazingly she loved today seeing all the wildlife & watching the turtles which you can feed too.

Easy to get to on the MRT underground train which is easy to use if your that end of town why not pop and see the marina bay sands hotel too."

,,Great for Flower Lovers,4.0,,"This space has plants from every continent but Antartica. Its climate controlled, but the amount of people got in the way of really enjoying the space."
,,Beauty in heart of city,4.0,,"What a welcome oasis from hustle and bustle of the shops etc. Well signposted, many areas to sit and enjoy nature. Birds abound. Particularly enjoyed the orchids but were disappointed that a large area of orchid garden is being renovated. It will be amazing once finished in 2019. Need to have time, comfortable shoes and take water!! Restaurants in area. Highly recommended"
,,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"We had a lovely visit to the Botanical Gardens.....a lovely day, weather was perfect....I have been before and always enjoy walking around...but this time due to not being able to walk very far we only saw the Orchids....but they were a site to behold....the colours and varieties are out of this world.....makes me come home intending to take better care of mine, but they will never match the ones in the Orchid garden.....I must see on anyones bucket list...."
,,"Nature, educational, peaceful spot in a busy city",5.0,,"A UNESCO World Heritage Site. Plenty to see. Many theme gardens like Herbs & Spices, Foliage, Fragrant, Healing, Evolution, Heritage and many more. Many grassy lawns, ponds (turtles and many types of fish) and don’t miss walking through the rainforest. Drop in at the Visitor Centre or one of the restaurants or cafes. Nature, culture, horticulture, educational and much more. Keep an eye out for the busy squirrels. The National Orchid Garden, with the largest display of orchid species and hybrids is well worth the small entry fee."

,,Stunning,5.0,,This one has been on my annual Singapore trip to do list and I finally got there. Such beautiful gardens and a rare treat that it costs nothing to wander through. A small fee applies for the Orchid Garden but absolutely worth it. You can spend as much or as little time as you like in this beautiful oasis. Do yourself a favour!
,,Spectacular swath of beauty in urban Singapore,5.0,,"This beautifully maintained garden has a huge variety of spots to enjoy Singapore's natural beauty. It's an easy trip from downtown -- about 12 minutes on MRT, which lets out right at the gate. There are lakes, gardens and patch of rainforest that evokes the Singapura of 200 years ago. The highlight is, of course the orchid garden, which was partially closed when I visited, but was, even so, worth the $5 price of admission. Other than the orchid garden, the park is free. You'll see yoga classes and elderly folks practicing Tai Chi. There are restaurants and snack bars throughout. There's also a children's park."
,,Loving it!,5.0,,"Clean, enjoyable garden for all ages. Sometimes there are free programmes, orchestra where u can bring along a picnic mat and spend time with loved ones. Trails are not hard to walk even for the elders. Totally love the landscape and peaceful greenery. Kids are able to purchase fish food in the garden to feed the fishes and tortoises. Very nice brunch at bee's knees , alfresco and good service! Been there many times and still loving it!"
,,Fun (& free)!,5.0,,"Despite the heavy rain, it did not dampen our enthusiastic mood. We signed up for the Rainforest Tour, and though it was limited to indoors due to safety precautions (the rain was very heavy), we enjoyed our time with our knowledgeable guide. For those keen, you can check out the tour timing on their website. In the evening, we were lucky to catch the orchestra performances by several schools, junior colleges and university."
,,Nice view,5.0,,Quite relaxing walk you can have there. I walked from mrt station until orchid garden only due to limited time. But the experience was great. I saw a red ear slider turtle walking on the path in the garden as well. Fun
,,Lovely heritage site,5.0,,"Brought my 13 month old here for his first experience in a giant garden and was very pleased with the experience. Lots of fresh air and well planned paths. We drove over and got a lot around 2pm at the open carpark. Lots of chickens roaming around, beautiful plumage. It was also a treat to visit the National Orchid garden for free this season.

Overall a wonderful experience and would love to visit again for the fresh air! Finally a place with no smokers ruining the air."
,,Singapore Botonic Garden,5.0,,Singapore Botanic garden just shows Singapore can do everything. it is very beautifually crafted and designed.
,,Beautiful gardens for a walk with nature,5.0,,"We have just spent half a day in the gardens and it is a very special place.
The rain Forrest in the heart of the gardens is shady and takes the sting out of the midday sun.
The random paths that meander through the grounds are criss crossed by small streams with quiet, shady spots to sit.
Be sure to spend the $5 entry to the National Orchid garden, the various colours and sizes are spectacular"
,,Take a stroll,5.0,,Clean and quiet garden Well maintained and it’s somewhere you can go and spend quality time with family (FOC is a plus point :0 )

,,Beautiful Fauna & Flora,4.0,,Been here many times & it’s always a pleasant experience. Lovely fauna & flora set up in these gardens for all to admire. I recommend to anyone who likes outdoor activities & who may want to see the beautiful orchids on display. I suggest going before 12pm as it gets very warm after that on a sunny day.
,,Lovely way to spend an afternoon,5.0,,"This is a wonderful park, free and easily accessible by the Botanical Garden MRT station on the Circle line.

You will find tourists, joggers, parents with kicks, couples dating, music performance, etc... It is a lovely garden you can enjoy and see new things year round.

Singapore is hot and humid so bring a bottle of water and a towel if you plan to spend more than an hour exploring. You can easily spend 2 - 4 hours here."
,,"Gardens are good, Orchard Garden is better!",4.0,,"My wife loves to walk through Botanic Gardens, though they leave me a bit boared. this one is more of a park. However the orchard Gardens are definatley worth a visit."
,,Excellent place,5.0,,Went for stroll after dinner and this place is awesome. Well lit in the night and felt very safe. As usual it was spotlessly clean as per singapore standards. Well connected via botanical gardens mrt (subway). There are yoga classes there in morning. Pleasant place.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We visited Singapore in April 2017 as part of our honeymoon and would highly recommend the Botanic Gardens to anyone travelling to Singapore.
Such a beautiful, tranquil place with amazing plants and trees.
The tree's shade offers a welcome break from the sun and is especially nice in the morning when it is slightly cooler.
It is so big that we actually made two separate trips to the gardens and still didn't quite manage to make our way around all of it.
Would definitely pay it another visit the next time we are in Singapore!"
,,Relax place,5.0,,Taking a stroll around the garden helps one to unwind inorder to rewind. Highly recommend to go the orchid garden. Wear light casual. T shirt and track pants or Bermuda will do.
,,Probably one of the best botanic gardens in the world,5.0,,"We came to the gardens 10 years ago and loved it then. It's even better now, as it now it's own MRT station, which makes it so easily accessible. This beautiful place is free to enter, except if you want to visit the marvellous orchid gardens, which is a very reasonable SGD 5.00 or only SGD 1.00 for the over 60's. However, it was extremely busy being the Lunar Chinese New Year's Day. It must be one of the most popular places to visit that day. I had to laugh though. One man was stretched out asleep on a bench. Must have had a heavy night!"
,,"Beautiful Orchids, plenty of photo opportunities",5.0,,There is nearly 1 kilometer walk from the main entrance to the Orchid garden but the walk is pleasurable with greenery and water bodies on both sides. It would have been helpful had there been a buggy for elderly people. The orchids are magnificent. There is a exhibition of orchids dedicated to world leaders and their family members.
,,Fantastic gardens. Such a 'green' gem in Singapore,5.0,,We visited the gardens during the rain. Everything was vibrant and lush. The orchid garden whilst not in full bloom was fantastic and should not be missed . All aspects of the gardens was extraordinary. A leasurly walk through the park is highly recommended.

,,"Big place, can't explore in one day fully",5.0,,"Got there by Mass transit to one end of gardens, 1.5km across so be prepared for some walking, very nice gardens, well laid out and peaceful. Next time were in Singapore we will take a picnic, free entry and recommended if your fit and like walking. If you don't walk back to tube then only way back to town is by bus down Orchard road, no problem getting help with that."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"spent an afternoon sweating our butts off on a lovely walk through the gardens, highly recommend getting there early before the huge heat wave hits and spend a good hour and half walking and enjoying the peacefulness"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Very large parkland with beautiful plants and trees. Large open spaces, heritage trees and a lake. The best part is the orchid garden, with hundreds of verities of orchids. Could have spent a whole day just in the orchid garden. The ginger garden next to orchid garden is well worth visiting too, beautiful laid out and interesting varieties of ginger."
,,A Beautiful Garden,4.0,,It is by far the most beautiful 'garden' in Singapore. I frequent this place on weekends with my family for picnics. it is an oasis in this city state. There is no entrance fee & you can soak yourselves in the tranquility from sunrise all the way pass sunset!
,,"A big place, give enogh time to see and rest",3.0,,"After walking around garden by the bay, i was totally exhausted. So it may not be fair to give a review for this garden. But parts of pay gardens(S＄5) was closed & the orchid garden that i was so keen to see was not as impressive as i thought it would be. Wear a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen. There are cafes & benches. Give yourself time to rest a lot."

,,Must goto place,5.0,,The garden is amazing and very accessible.you shouldn't miss the light show in the evenings at weekends.
,,Be Closer to Nature in Legoland,5.0,,"The gardens is a lovely retreat in a city full of concrete buildings. Although it's still partially man-made, as most attractions in SG are built by man, you don't get that claustrophobic feeling. They even have a short strip of rainforest within. Obviously when you're living in Singapore you will discover right away that's there's nothing much to do except work and shop. Here's a closer option if you do not have time or resources to go to neighbouring countries that have more to offer in terms of natural wonders. It has it's own MRT station so it's easy to get there."
,,Run in the morning,4.0,,"If you stay close enough, go for a run, enjoy the lush green and cooling air. There are many entry points. Check the map online. It does not have shower facilities though."
,,Good place for chilling in the evening,4.0,,Good place to be when looking for some fresh air in a central location. Best to visit in the evening. Too much construction going on in the Bukit Timah side at the moment though.
,,A real treat,5.0,,"We visited prior to a lunch in a gardens restaurant and really enjoyed it.

It is superbly set out with lots of information about the elements and the individual trees and plants and it is a real joy to wander through it and wonder at how such a small island had been able to preserve a wonderful green space of this size.

Of particular joy is the Orchid Garden – the largest in the world and dazzling in terms of the range of orchids and their colours. Every step reveals another photo opportunity – if you really need it.

Not to be missed."
,,Wonderful enchanted garden,5.0,,"This is my second visit to the gardens. Apart from the orchid garden, which is incredible, the attraction is totally free. The gardens are huge and impeccably maintained. It is a true gem. It’s a huge place and a total refuge in a large concrete city. Well worth a visit if you have time. It easy to get to and the vast acreage ensures a quiet and memorable visit."
,,Heavenly spot,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are spectacular! The beautiful vegetation, tree lined walking paths, ponds, wildlife, and ease of walking makes this an everyday adventure. The orchid garden is worth paying the small fee to visit within the gardens. If you think it’s too far to visit, rethink it as uber or a taxi ride are easily accessible as well as the buses."
,,Peace in the city,4.0,,The gardens are actively maintained and have a wide variety of flora labeled for your viewing and learning. There are black swans on the pond as well. There are casual dining options within the gardens. You can get the feeling that you are away from the city while you stroll the walk ways.
,,Lovely heritage listed gatden,4.0,,"It is an expansive old garden in a small island state. Lots of old trees, plants, etc. Easily reached by MRT.

We walked the whole length and back during hot and humid June weather, and it was stunning. All the different plants, the jungle section, and the orchids were beautiful. In a city that is very modern and busy, it is a great escape. Was easy to get to via MRT and had plenty of places to stop, take photos, and rest. We also appreciated the birds and some wildlife in the water."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It was hot and humid but the beauty of the gardens and the walks with some large building and AC available for a periodic cooling off was great.

,,My personal command centre for tranquility and inner peace..,5.0,,"For many years, I was an avid fan of the Botanic Gardens, even before it went through upgrading and expansion works. I from 2006-2007, I visited the park 4 times a week to practise my rope skipping and burn much calories while enjoying the beautiful views of the gardens.

I usually start off by doing a walk-jog around the gardens past the 2 swan lakes for about 20 minutes before stretching my body and getting to jump rope for another 90 minutes. There is something magical about the Botanic Gardens.

I love the coping walk where you can see the open field and watch families and friends have a great time playing or just enjoying the fresh air. I love the concerts that are arranged there on some weekends and listening to music in the park.

Exercising in the Botanic Gardens is one of my go-to places. I love the restaurants with amazing fine dining or casual meals (healthy too!) and the visitors shop has some quirky things to purchase and Tak home too. The carpark is very accessible from the main entrance and the energy and vibe there is very different from the other parks.

I used to also hold my bootcamps with clients there for a few years. Abundance of space for all to share. Now with more features and walking trails, this park is definitely a place one MUST explore. Local and international cuisine options nearby and plenty of choices to choose from.

I cannot wait to go back and visit again. I want to relive my experiences there all over again. Botanic Gardens, you have never failed to make my day whenever I come and visit you, rain or shine."

,,A Breath Of Fresh Air,4.0,,"A beautiful heritage garden in the centre of the bustling metropolis of Singapore...most beautiful if you go early in the morning when the air is cool, the park is quiet and you will see quite a collection of wildlife including otters, large monitor lizards and turtles. It is free to enter, except for the Orchid Garden, Which is nice, but not really necessary, there are plenty of other parts to enjoy. There are some food and drink outlets near the reception hub, not too expensive, but not exactly cheap either. One suggestion, avoid Sunday afternoons if you want a quiet peaceful time.

Many people run, jog or walk the paths. There are benches along the walkways to sit and enjoy the many gardens and the lake with plenty of turtles and fish.

We happened to go during school holidays and used our local I/C’s to enter the special National Orchid Garden which otherwise would have cost SGD 1/pax; our visiting friends paid SGD 5 to enter.

I love how beautiful the gardens are and totally love that most of it is free!"

The gardens are huge and bit of walk but it's beautiful also they have good eating places inside the gardens."
,,Might just be the best tropical botanic gardens in the world,5.0,,"I've been here many times, always loved it, even in the heat. Now that it's a UNESCO World Heritage, I think they work at it that much harder to keep it up there. If you love parks, there are none better than this one."

,,Wildlife surprise,4.0,,"In the late morning of 28 April 2018, I visited the Singapore Botanical Gardens. I noticed an unusual movement in the bushes on my left and decided to take a closer look. To my pleasant surprise, there was a nest in the bush with several chicks. As the nest was about 1 meter (approximately 3 feet) from the ground, I tried to hold my mobile phone camera a bit nearer to snap a photo. Before I could do that, one parent flew onto the nest and covered the chicks with its body. I was deeply moved by the parental instinct and quietly moved away with a not-so-good photo."

Asides from all the trees, woods, forrests etc there were also big green grassy areas where you could just sit down and relax. I didnt notice any of that in Gardens of the Bay.

,,A beautiful Oasis,5.0,,"These gardens are huge, on a hot day you will be sweating in no time. The layout and diversity are stunning. You can easily spend hours here and there are places to get food or refreshments. The orchids are the most amazing collection you will ever likely see."
,,Stunning orchids,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit to the gardens, extremely well cared for, well planned gardens and great half to full day wandering around, or you could see some highlights in about an hour if short on time, but worth seeing. We got there easily by train, and were lucky enough to be in time for orchid show. Stunning!!! Enjoyed walking along the reflexology path, great for tired feet!"
,,Beautiful orchids,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed visiting the orchid garden - so many beautiful varieties and lots of photo points. Lots of information boards, and a good little souvenir shop on the way out. Great value for money."
,,Wonderful,4.0,,Go and pay to look at the orchid garden as it is Beautiful and calming. Students get a reduction. And so much to see.
,,Spectacular gardens,5.0,,"We only visited as it was a stop on the hop on hop off bus, but so glad we did, they are huge with beautiful grounds and lakes and spectacular flowers, my advice is take a picnic"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Recently visited here on our honeymoon. Huge gardens with beautiful plants and open areas. We caught the MRT to the Botanic Station, walked around the gardens and ended up at the other end and caught the bus back to Scotts Road. Allow a good 4 hours or so to get through the gardens. We didn't visit the Orchard Gardens but saw plenty of orchards from the front entry. Had lunch at one of the cafe near the the visitor information centre. Highly recommended."
,,Great visit,5.0,,Free. Lots to see and do. Set aside several hours. Also includes ginger and national orchid collections.
,,Worth Visiting,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are a great place to find shade, quiet and nature in Singapore. Many plants have descriptions nearby. Beautifully landscaped."
,,This place is massive,5.0,,"The gardens are hugh, so if you are limited to time, visit the area arounr the orchard garden,. Founded in 1859, they are an unesco world heritage site. We arrived on the hop on/off bus, and visited the orchard garden, rain forest, ginger garden, Bonsai garden. Make sure you pick up a map, to find your way around. Very quiet when we were there, a blessing. Nice walks and trails everywhere"
,,Must visit,5.0,,These days after Opening of garden of the battery few people visit botanical garden.but if u r a nature lover you must visit this place.a very good collection of orchids with in a very peaceful place.this must be your stop in your Singapore visit
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,Lovely place to visit and to sit back and enjoy the gardens. Well presented and designed with lots of interesting information along the way.
,,A beautiful tropical garden,5.0,,"I visited this gardens a few times during my trips to Singapore over the years. I love the beautiful setting and the vast variety of plants; and especially the Swam Lake. However due to the muggy and hot tropical weather, I chose to go there after a downpour or whenever it's drizzling as it's much cooler and less crowded.
For me the better way of experiencing this garden is to start at its Southeast entrance near Holland Road & Cluny Road junction. If you take the road on the left it will eventually lead you to the Swan Lake. After that it's up to individual to explore the rest of the vast garden. If you plan to take the public transportation, bus 7, 75, 77, 105, 106, 123, and 174 will get you there.
Although it might be more convenient to take the subway MRT Blue/Orange Line (Botanic Gardens MRT Station) to this garden, but the experience of entering the park is not as pleasant IMHO as buildings in the adjacent area are visible along the pathway."
,,Great morning; did the kids garden only,5.0,,With the SMRT to the north side of the Botanical Gardens we could walk in straight into the kids gardens. Our 5&3 year old really enjoyed the morning playing in the 3 different playgrounds. The slides in the treetop house were the best and nice shaded area for us to enjoy a rest on the bench. The gardens are just beautiful!!
,,What more can one add for superlatives for a botanical garden,5.0,,"This is just a wonderful place, a vast area in the middle of a teeming tropical metropolis. Clearly laid out by the British but lovingly maintained and developed since independence. And amazingly, it's free! There isn't as much signage for all the many plants as I have come to expect in smaller gardens in the US but there is plenty of information nonetheless. Plan on spending at least two hours and better a whole day and possibly a night. I was not able to come at night, when the Fragrance Garden is apparently most effective. And it's open late!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,A very well designed and informative space with lots of interesting diversions along the way. Considering the volume of people it attracts there are many times while walking around you can feel like you're the only ones there. Look out for the monitor lizards!
,,A very beautiful garden,5.0,,"It was a beautiful place and we all enjoyed a lot, benches are placed if you want to relax a bit, note that the “Jacob Ballas Park” for kids is closed on the last Monday of the month, and the gallery and the museum is also closed on Mondays, It’s a great place for taking pictures and it’s also free!"
,,Relaxing,4.0,,On the day we were here it was wet yet humid so a walk through the gardens was strange indeed we stayed dry while getting wet i kid you not a great place to visit :)
,,A quiet nature between skyline,4.0,,"The garden is almost similar to gardens by the bay apatt from being more quiet and more of a nature oriented than activity oriented. Unfortunately when I went there the children area was under maintenance, so we couldn't enjoy the full experience."
,,So much to see!,5.0,,"Despite the heat we spent hours here - there’s so much to see and it’s all so clean and well kept. There are a huge variety of flowers and plants - we also saw loads of birds, butterflies and saw one monitor lizard!
Free entry.
Plenty of cafes and restaurants to stop and refresh."
,,Back again,5.0,,Love this place come rain or shine. Just go and enjoy it....a great morning or afternoon out. Places to eat too...
,,Overwhelming experience,5.0,,This was extremely relaxing and nice place to visit. Very clean and so many beautiful orchids. I could have spent for hours there. It is also very nice that in Singapore they keep every location clean and tidy. Recommend also other parks in Singapore.
,,Beautiful scenery with great events!,5.0,,The botanic gardens hosts lots of music events and educational events (often involving cocktails!) on the topic of different plants or herbs in the garden. We attended a workshop on ginger where we then made ginger cocktails which were delicious!!
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"This was a lovely experience and the gardens were well kept enabling a peaceful experience. Coming straight from Gardens by the bay which was incredible, I wasn't entirely blown away by this place. Possibly if I had done this the other way round I would have thought higher of this botanical gardens as I had been comparing it to what I had just seen. Just a recommendation! But still a must do in Singapore."
,,Beautiful natural park,5.0,,"Great natural well thought out park , great for all ages , you can have a picnic, or purchase snacks and ice cream, drinks. Plenty of open space for every visitor , lakes to walk around , purchase fish food for the kids to have fun , easy to get to by public services. Loved the orchid houses"
,,Don't miss the evolution park!,4.0,,"Good fun filled outing at the Botanic Gardens

The Evolution garden is one of its kind and is a must visit.

Spice area is fun.

Medicinal area can potentially be improved as its just plant after plant where you read up the potential medicinal properties but can't really do much or even make am attempt to remember something.

Swan lake could have done with more swans but is pleasant sight nonetheless.

And of course the entry is free! (Barring the orchid gardens)"
,,Regular treat. Great outing,5.0,,We are friends of WRS. This annual pass is very much worth it for families with young children. There are many fresh activities and events. Coming back is always fun. Kids section with hungry goats is always fun.
,,Can't miss attraction,5.0,,"We have been here 2X and think it is the nicest botanic garden we have seen. You could spend a day here and not see everything. The orchard garden is a must.
About 1KM from the MRT stop and long trails equals lots of walking, be prepared. Lots of space to picnic or people watch."
,,lovely gardens for a stroll,5.0,,"lovely gardens, enormous though so we only did a small part of it. Take some food to feed the fish in swan lake"
,,That deserves 10 stars,5.0,,"Along with the orchid garden this botanical garden is the best one I've ever been in. We spend hours there, if not half of the day wondering around, admiring the flora and fauna. The among of birds and lizards and butterflies... Amazing!"

,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,"We visited the National orchid Garden on 23rd May. The weather was playing spoilsport that day with continous drizzle of rain. That however did not deter us from venturing into the landmark Singapore gardens.

Well planned ,well maintained and a pleasure to walk through this Orchid paradise."
,,An oasis of tranquility,5.0,,"This was my second visit after discovering these tranquil, beautiful gardens 5 years earlier. Fabulous place to wander & then relax sitting outside the cafe drinking coffee!

Its National Orchid Garden houses the largest orchid collection of 1,200 species and 2,000 hybrids. Its Admission free and opwns from 5 am to 12 midnite.

,,The World's Most Visited....,5.0,,"This UNESCO World Heritage Site was initiated by Singapore's founder Sir Stamford Raffles and it is quite the inspiration. This is the most visited Botanical Gardens in the world and considered Asia's best, all for good reason. Its been developed on a 3 core basis. First is Tanglin, the Heritage Core which retains the historical gardens, Central, the Tourist Core and finally the Bukit Timah, the Educational and Recreational Core.

,,Stunning Tulip show,5.0,,"The whole gardens are beautiful, free entry to the main parts of the park the only place that required a ticket was the tulip show. There are plenty of places to rest and have something to eat as well as drinking fountains. Definitely take comfortable shoes as the gardens are quite big and requires a lot of walking but are stunning! Plenty of beautiful photo opportunities.
The spot is super convenient to get to as the train station is right at the entrance to the gardens.
If in Singapore highly recommend!"

,,Peaceful Gardens,4.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens is a must for lovers of all things garden. Such a serene environment with beautiful open spaces
,,Nice Second Option,4.0,,"The botanic gardens have a wide range of trees and flowers. It is well maintained.

However, when visiting Singapore, the Gardens by the Bay is the preferred choice for people interested in botanics. The selection is wider and unlike the Singapore Botanical Garden you do not have to deal with the outside climate."

,,delicate garden,5.0,,"I have visited here in 2018/5/13, it is mother's day.

The garden took me 4 hours to walk around. I have to say the garden is a very good place to go if you are interested in botanic or simply want a peaceful place for a short time.

When I wondered in the garden, I noticed an open orchestra concert would be held on this place. I wait till 18:00 (pm 6:00) and join the outdoor concert which is held by Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO). Only then I knew that the SSO conducts performances at the Botanic Gardens at mother's day annually and I just joined it by chance!

It is a nice experience, both for the garden and the concert."
,,Amazing and beautiful landscaped grounds,5.0,,"We spent a day walking around the site and visiting the orchid garden.

,,Stunning,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens are truly stunning. Give yourself plenty of time to see everything as it is definitely worth seeing.

So take a couple of hours and enjoy this magnificent attraction.

,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Absolutely BEAUTIFUL.. We were there when the Orchid display opened. The Orchids were stunning. So much variety. The gardens are easy to negotiate and walk around. Very well laid out.

,,Green Singapore,4.0,,"This park is beautiful with lots of flora and fauna. There are some trees that look super cool as I've never seen anything like it before. There are lots of kids playing here and lots of joggers. This garden is free but you need to pay extra if you wanna access the Orchids Garden, which we didn't do as we only have limited time.

It's quite a walk / hike if you wanna exit the place. There are lots of directions on how to get to the exit and you will be directed to an MRT station, which is so cool and very convenient.

Stroll in the morning so that the weather would be a little cold and breezy."

Jacobs garden is the children’s garden which is great. The gardens also have a World Heritage part to them and only cost S$10 to enter. It’s fabulous."
,,Enjoyable visit.,4.0,,Very pleasant area to walk in - with very well maintained gardens. Found the staff member in the little visitor shop not as friendly as I would have hoped for but this was more than made up for by the lovely staff in the little cafe/restaurant just across from the visitor area. Would advise people to go there and sit in comfort having a cool drink rather than resting on the benches inside the visitor centre with drinks only available from their vending machine. The little cafe/restaurant is lovely and offers some much needed shade from the heat and humidity.
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,Outdoor garden with best view of many flower inside. You will feel back to nature in there. Excellent maintenance
,,Nice garden,4.0,,"Very nice garden, but it gets very hot. The orchid section is lovely and if you don't have much time head straight there."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Small city but exhaustive spaces of greenery just blows your mind away.How can we do it in India is what I kept wondering?
,,Delightful green space!,5.0,,It's a delight to see such a big green space inside a bustling city. You can easily spend half a day leisurely strolling through its many gardens or just sure besides the minature lakes and have a picnic.
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,"If there is one place I would love to come back is the Botanic Gardens in Singapore. That place is absolutely stunning- well maintained, clean (as everything in Singapore), wild and enchanting. Great place for couples, families and singles. Just take enough water and comfortable shoes."
,,Spectacular orchid garden,5.0,,"I was blown away by the orchid collection at this botanic gardens. The grounds itself is impressive enough but this orchid collection is a true treasure.

If you’re a nature lover and a flower lover, I would highly recommend this garden. Only after my visit did I find out that this garden is a UNESCO sight, as it should be.

The sprawling grounds are a pleasure to walk through with a rich collection of trees, shrubs, vines and flowers.

The highlight is of course the orchid collection which is inside the garden grounds. Orchids ranging in all colors and sizes are housed under this spectacular greenhouse. Some have wonderful scents and some just purely a visual feast."

,,Best botanic gardens I’ve visited,5.0,,"These gardens are simply wonderful. A huge space right in the middle of Singapore with the most amazing variety of flora. Informative displays all around, cafes to stop and relax, wonderful lakes, orchid and ginger garden...the list goes on.

If you’re in Singapore I think this is a must see!

Only downside is that if you exit through the South Gate of the park there is no MRT nearby (problem won’t be resolved until 2021 when the new station opens!) but there are plenty of buses"
,,A great outing,5.0,,It’s always a great outing when visiting the Botanic Gardens. I always stumble on something different here. Gardens are immaculate and our son absolutely loves it there.
,,Very large and well-organized,4.0,,"Be careful where you want to go there because you can easily get lost if it is your first visit. It is exremely huge but amazing to visit in the early morning. There is a Symphony that is played on the weekends, but you can check online if this show is played in the working days also."
,,Great place for morning walk,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit when you’re travelling and staying near the city area. You may alight at botanic garden MRT (I think downtown blue line) and the greens and peaceful scenery of this place. In the morning, you will find some group of oldies doing their daily exercises which I find inspiring."
,,Orchids!,5.0,,"The gardens are huge... prepare your walking shoes. We headed straight for the Orchid gardens and were not disappointed. Absolutely beautiful. Amazing varieties, colours, patterns. A must do. There is a shop at the end for some nice souvenirs. As you leave the main gardens on the left or the metro is an Italian cafe. Some really good food there. It has my favoirite soft drink. Hard to find Chinotto.... yummmm."
,,Green space,5.0,,Another lovely visit to this green oasis. The Orchid Garden was better than ever. Try Raffles House food court in the gardens for good food and very reasonable prices.
,,Huge and amazing,5.0,,"This place is lovely. So neat and manicured. Its a huge place so i didnt get to see the whole lot, but managed to see the gardens close to the Orchid show. It is hard going in the heat so its best to start early morning!!"

,,Wonderful!,5.0,,We took MRT to Botanic Gardens MRT station. It is free to visit the Gardens except the Orchid Garden. The gardens are well maintained. The visitor center is beautiful. The big trees are tall. We headed to the National Orchid Garden in 30 minutes. We took a bus #7 from Singapore Botanic Garden to Orchard MRT station.
,,Botanic,5.0,,We did a short two hour walk around the gardens. It could take you a good five hours to cover the whole park but for sure you need to see the orchid garden.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"This is a lovely place to see. Beautiful, informative, and good day or night. Easy way to spend an hour or a full day. Make it a must."

,,Amazing Place,5.0,,Wow just wow what an amazing place and when you consider it’s free you can’t beat spending a day in an Oasis with peace and quiet and open space for the kids to run around. This is definitely a must visit place for first timers we spent a whole day there many cafes and restaurants within the Gardens and a special area dedicated to children also free. As for being tourists friendly we got stuck in the Children’s garden as it started to rain very heavily we only had one umbrella we took shelter under a small shed very beautiful by the way. There staff members make rounds when it rains to see if anyone needs help a lovely lady came to us with umbrellas and helped us to the main entrance of the children’s garden talk about great service.
,,nice for a walk,5.0,,is really educating and nice for a walk or picnic in the evening. there is a lot of rare pokermon and a lot people use lure so I love it haha

,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,Really enjoyed my visit to the Botanic Gardens. Lovely and well maintained and a relaxing oasis in the city. Highly recommend a visit to the National Orchid Garden which is well worth the $5 entry fee.
,,Surprised that its a heritage site,1.0,,We were shocked at how this got a UNESCO heritage stamp. Is it because its a well maintained park with lots of tropical forestry. By that standards quite a bit of forests around the world should have also had that tag. Nothing much to see and easily avoided.
,,Beautiful Sites,5.0,,"Visited the botanical gardens on last week and it was so peaceful and beautiful. There was not an entry fee unless you entered the orchids garden which, was $5. I was a little disappointed with the Swan lake I assumed there would be alot more than 4 of them. I am a lover of orchids so I explored the garden and found there are so many types and colors. All and all is as a nice venture with alot of greenery structures and beautiful flowers. The greenery offers shade so it prevented the direct sunlight. This is alot a nice place to run the trails."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"This is so lush, creatively planted/established, large and diverse. Beautiful large canopies. Orchid house also worth visiting. Beautiful plants and how they have landscapes. A great counter balance to the shopping and city stimulation."

,,Worth a visit if you have time for wandering,4.0,,"If you have spare time and feel like wandering around, here is a good place to do so. There is room for picnicking and a number of café/restaurants and a vast number of tropical plants on display. Best way to get there is catch the MRT there and then the bus back when you reach the other end of the gardens (It is a 1.5 km walk back to the MRT from the other end of the garden)."
,,nice area,4.0,,"It is a nice big area, good for a leisurely day/ picnic. You should go there if you have a lot of time. It is free except the orchid garden. Orchid garden is free for children (<12 years) and just $1 for elderly. The $1 entry fee is for all the nationalities, just bring your passport."
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,This gorgeous garden is free to enter - though if you want to go in the orchid section it will cost $5. There is plenty to see around the Botanic Gardens and areas to rest if necessary. A must-do in Singapore
,,Tropical Paradise,5.0,,"We had a 'hop on-hop off' two day ticket and the Botanic Garden was the first on the list. We were blessed that day there was plenty of rain during our visit, making the best impression of tropical rain in tropical environment. We bought $3 raincoats and enjoyed a day going through the all parts of the garden. Unforgettable momories."
,,Excellent Garden...,5.0,,"it is very excellent place for nature lovers , you can spent 3 to 4 hours in this huge garden , it is well maintained , only problem lack of facility for handicap & elder persons i.e. tram, elecctrical car."

This UNESCO garden is a must visit if you come to Singapore! Reach here early to enjoy the tranquility, before the tour groups & running clubs gather.
Free admission. Except The Orchid Garden which is a paid entry area, but worth a visit if you are an orchid lover as it’s very well maintained.

There are also several breakfast cafes/stops within this large garden to sit down & have a nice coffee & enjoy the ambience!"
,,Most orchids I will ever see,5.0,,Only had time for the Orchid section and it was definitely an experience worth while. The display is huge with the flowers in their natural habitat. It is not to be missed if you are in Singapore
,,World heritage Gardens,5.0,,A great place to go for a morning walk amongst trees that are over 100 years old as well as a great orchid gardens featuring many hybrids named after dignitaries.
,,peaceful,4.0,,When we were there were not so many people so was a peaceful walk and relaxing would visit again for sure
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"Spectacular gardens, huge with so much to look at. The Orchid gardens in particular are stunning, a small fee to get in of around 5aussie dollars. Super hot, so make sure you stop and top up the water! Lots of walking, but well worth it."
,,Relaxing day out,5.0,,"Beautiful lush gardens. Free to get into. I was in a wheelchair so we didn't explore all of it but it's a lovely place where families come to picnic. Also lots of cafes on site and we ate at the cafe at the main entrance, spaghetti carbonara was excellent! They also serve breakfast and Malaysian food. With real freshly squeezed organ juice. There was an orchestra playing when we went the first time so we ended up relaxing and enjoying the music and went back the next day to explore the orchid garden which is really cheap to enter."
,,A worthy world heritage site,4.0,,"Somewhat different from usual WH sites in that it is a gardens not a building or ruins or natural landscape feature
They are impeccably kept. Pretty well signposted - though we found getting to the Fragrance Garden a bit convoluted.
Some nice places to eat and drink.
And many distinct, marked garden areas."
,,What a orchid display,5.0,,Spent a full day here and what a display of plants and trees. The orchid garden is fantastic and we did not realise how many kinds there are. There is a place to eat and drink which is not over expensive.

,,Best Botanical Gardens I've been to,5.0,,"Sure, Kew Gardens and a few other icons of botany are grea, but Singapore does this so well, it's hard to fault. Such a variety of tropical plants and some that are maybe not so tropical. The layout is brilliant and the whole thing so well maintained.
Orchards are beautiful and the small charge to enter the orchard area is well worthwhile. A great walk for a couple of hours when you're in this lovely city."
,,Outstanding botanic gardens- highly recommended,5.0,,"Our visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens was most memorable.

Our visit to this world class botanic gardens eclipsed (In parts) our visit to the extraordinary (if not more contrived) Gardens by the Bay.

The gardens are significant in size and are well maintained.

We loved the palm collection and sweeping lawns, fragrance garden, foliage garden and so on.

A shame that the cordoned off Toxic plants garden was not open when we visited- it looked fascinating!

Signage indicating history, taxonomy and use of plants was good and in some parts of the gardens was excellent.

We also visited the special orchid garden (paid entry) which seemed like a glorified flower show.. if you love orchids you may look behind the contrived nature of this installation. Having said that the ticket entry was worth seeing the yellow orchid arches which was quite spectacular.

One could easily spend a full day or several half days meandering through the greenery.

If you are spending a few days in Singapore make sure you break up eating and shopping with a meander through the Botanic Gardens."
,,Spectacular! Unesco World Heritage Site,5.0,,"Its a huge place with green landscapes all around. Has a lake with black swans and turtles. Beautiful place to relax, hang out with family and friends. Clean toilets with all amenities. Serene is the word for this place. It is a very peaceful location. But it can be very hot during summer. Go before 7 pm to explore the gardens completely."
,,A must see place when in Singapore which is a UNESCO Heritage Site .,5.0,,"Visit to Singapore is not complete without a visit to Botanic garden that has no entrance Fee. Right in the middle of the City with its Lush green grandeur, It is Indeed a sight to behold. It is beautifully designed and maintained with a variety of themes in the garden to enjoy! It even has a souvenir shop and eateries. Orchid Garden inside the Botanic garden needs to pay and that is also very nominal."
,,"It's pretty, but that's it.",3.0,,"It's well maintained, very pretty. We Australians have been spoiled by all the nature wonders and great beaches, so this is nothing new to us."

,,A sensational urban park,5.0,,"As with the National Orchid Garden that lies within this park, the Singapore Botanic Gardens is a great attraction, which frankly we enjoyed more than the over-hyped ""Gardens by the Bay"" that gets 10 times as many tourists. For a more secluded treat, take the MRT to the Botanic Gardens and enjoy one of the best urban parks you will ever see."
,,"Huge, green and well maintained",5.0,,"A very well maintained garden, in fact it's pretty huge and can easily consume a few hours to see. The walkways made here are amazing, takes you through the green landscape all around. Lot to learn here about plants as well."
,,In fact we are going for a run twice a week at botanic garden,5.0,,"Singapore inhabitants love their botanic garden and use it for simple walks (with or without dogs) yoga, group trainings, sword dance, thai-chi and what have you. We go for a 45 min run on a regular basis. It is amazing how nice maintained the garden is and that the management team and their gardeners constantly try to improve the facilities."
,,Walk of the Giants,5.0,,"Returned to the Botanic Gardens again for another visit yesterday, this time with just my daughter. Surprised to find the main car park nearly full at 9:30am, but fortunately we still found a space. The gardens remain just as impressive as before but this time I was pleased to stumble on the new Walk of Giants. This is a nice short elevated walk in the jungle. Not too many people either. I’m sure we will be back before long."
,,Nice Garden,5.0,,Visited during evening time. There are many verities of plants and flowers you will find.Also for walkers it is a best place.
,,Absolutley beautiful,5.0,,We were lucky enough to be at botanic gardens for the orchid display which was ery cheap at $5 entry. Although there is so much to see with out having to pay to see the full orchid display. I would highly recommend you do. regardless of when you are there you will not be disappointed by the amazing show of gardens. I go often to Singapore and will rarely miss a visit to these gardens.
,,BEAUTIFUL ORCHID DISPLAY,5.0,,"When we visited the Botanic Gardens we were luck to see the beautiful orchid display, the gardens them selfs were lovely, lots of shade trees, lot of people were exercising , running, also walking their dogs."
,,Incredible way to spend the day,5.0,,"What a gem! This place was amazing. The gardens were free to walk into, and are absolutely stunning. They are perfectly manicured and the landscaping is gorgeous. I paid for the orchid exhibit, which was worth every penny of the $5 it cost to get in. The flowers were so pretty, the trees were so beautiful, and the scenery was so lush, my visit was absolutely wonderful. I got stuck in a rain storm and was in the middle of the gardens, but didn't care, because I hid under a tree, next to a little pond, and felt like I was in a tropical rainforest. Probably because I was.

I walked all over the place and explored as much as I could. So many people were running, walking dogs, spending time with family; it is a wonderful public space that continues to show how green and lush Singapore is as a city."
,,Singapore Botanical gardens,4.0,,Sadly we had limited time here as we were on a city tour but enjoyed what we were able to see given our time restraints.

The place is open at 5 am and closes at midnight. At the main entrance there is a beautiful koi pond which is full of fish.

A great place to visit for a run or even with family for a peaceful walk / jog or run."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,We spent few hours in the daytime and saw part of it. Lucky to attend Orchid flower exhibit. Would recommend to all nature lovers. There are lots of old trees with labels on it. Well maintained and informative.
,,Lovely walk around in beautiful nature (BRING WATER),5.0,,"WARNING: IT GETS VERY HOT AND BRING WATER. Seriously, it was very nice to see all these things but the fact that it was so hot made most people pressed about seeing everything quickly and then leaving to find air conditioning. Transport there is not the most obvious thing but there are many photographic locations such as the road with all the arches. Might have to be patient to wait for everyone to leave so you have a good shot but it's worth it."

,,"Flora You've Never Seen, But Walk Slowly",5.0,,"The Gardens are extensive. Singapore is hot and humid. So take your time. There's a lot to see. Don't miss the ""walking net"" up in the trees.

,,"A magical place, where you really appreciate nature!",5.0,,"On our visit to green Singapore, we were eager to see the botanical gardens. I love the idea that a public park is so diverse. We got to see rainforest, bonsai collection (over 50), educational garden, healing garden, and plenty more. Even if you are on a short visit to Singapore, like we were is lovely to spend a day surrounded by nature and take an easy stroll or sit around. Just sitting here is interesting, when you have birds flying around, tourists walking and locals exercising. I loved every minute we spent there! There is so much to do in this city and on our blog page, you can see more about places we visited on our trip."
,,Cool respite in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Located just off Orchard Road is one of the several entrances to a massive garden housing ponds, lakes, expansive greeneries including ducks and turtles. We weren't able to navigate the whole park due to its size - but we were able to enjoy the pergolas scattered around the area and sit in one of the many benches."
,,Beautiful botanic garden,5.0,,"Came here many times and always miss the lush of green and trees! Newly tropical jungle section opened and really worth a walk . Well deserved for the unesco award. Maintain well and have a relax walking trail , jogging and running here are the best with no air pollution !!!"
,,Seasonal delights,5.0,,"We last visited the gardens in October 2 years ago, when we were blown away.
This. Is it coincided with a major orchid exhibition and competition.
The presentation were a step above previous delights. But so were the crowds!
Note to self (and others) Sunday is the only day off for many Singaporeans, so locations like the gardens & lucky plaza can be manic!"
,,Boanic Gardens Singapore,5.0,,We used the under ground rail to get there which was excellent. It was a very hot day and shade rest was hard to find. All aside it was a wonderful experience despite its huge size. The highlight for us was the Orchid Gardens which for $5 was well worth it
,,One of the most beautiful places in Singapore!,5.0,,I absolutely love this garden! Every time I visist Singapore I go there to relax and enjoy amazing variety of plants there.

,,Lovely place to walk around!,5.0,,"This is one of the best - organized botanical gardens I have ever been to. Lots of orchids of course, and interesting groupings like, fragrant plants, and medicinal plants. There is a nice restaurant called the Bees Knees; I had an amazing salad. Gift shop has some nice things, but is expensive."
,,The Jewel of Singapore,5.0,,"Don't miss seeing this wonder of the world and the crown jewel of Singapore. From a picture to attending a concert at the Shaw Foundation stage, The Botanic Gardens offers something for everyone, including your four legged pets. Dog friendly, with restrooms, food outlets and helpful signage."
,,A very nice experience but flower dome was horrible,3.0,,"I came here and was quite annoyed by fact that in the flower dome, there were very little flowers! My visit was during Chinese New Year, so the place was covered with decorations for Chinese New Year. Which was understandable but if it’s a flower dome shouldn’t there be lots of flowers?

Rest of the trip was berg pleasant and nice.
If you haven’t visited the place, I wont spoil the experience for you. This place is a must-see if you come to Singapore."

You can go jogging there and enjoy the view and peaceful atmosphere along ypur jogging track too."
,,A delightful place for a morning or evening walk,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is proudly a UNESCO site. Indeed the lush greenery and tranquil feel that you get as you walk through the park makes it an ideal place to relax and burn some calories. The garden offers some attractive walks in the evolution garden and the rain forest walk. Walkways are nicely paved or have wooden boardwalks.
The Singapore Orchid Gardens is located within the main gardens. Nice if you are a fan of orchids.
I do wish there were more swans and ducks though. At the moment I only see 2 swans, which is sad."
,,Interesting park in the city,4.0,,"Wonderful place for early morning or late evening walk especially during weekends. Free admission. Tourists, do come with comfortable clothes for hot and humid weather walk, instead of dressed up going to malls"

,,Wonderful park for relaxing,5.0,,Spent an afternoon at the botanic gardens while on business in Singapore. Wonderful place to relax and wonder through various gardens.

,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Wonderful place - no wonder it’s a world heritage site. The staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming, the gardens are well kept, clean and beautiful and the orchids are heaven on Earth. It would be worth coming to Singapore just for the orchids."
,,A hot visit,4.0,,"We unfortunately chose the wrong time of day to visit - late morning, and it was far too hot for the kids and us to do much exploring. What we saw of the gardens was lovely - mostly just the children’s garden"
,,"Exercise, beautiful plants & landscaping, & sculptures",5.0,,"Easy to find your way! Hop off at MRT Botanic Gardens & read the destinations on the various exit signs! The Bot Gards are on lush, rolling land, providing a bit of exercise (work off all that yummy Singaporean food) and delightful scenery. They have a monument in honour of Miss Joaquim who's credited with growing the first ever Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid; Singapore's national flower. And you can find Atabassa House; originally the French Embassy; very worthwhile having a look. And the Push Me Mama (girl on a swing) statue. Near the Tanglin Road exit you can see the Tembusa tree who's 'portrait' is on the Singaporean $5 banknote. The various security and volunteer info people are very helpful if you're looking for something specific.
From MRT Botanical Gardens you're only 1 MRT stop from Holland Village, where the ex-pats shop. In the 'shopping centre' (3 storey building) you can find Wellie Batik; the best place in Singapore to buy batik shirts, blouses, wrap-around skirts."

,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"As we were fortunate enough to be staying in Singapore for more than a week we were able to spend a whole day at the beautiful Botanic Gardens just a short MRT ride out from the city. It’s an oasis of peace and tranquillity - and what’s more, entry is free! The area is divided up into specific areas of botanical interest with lakes and pathways, shady areas and large green spaces. There’s a children’s area too. There is so much to look at and lots of information boards too.
Within the gardens you can find the National Orchid Gardens which cost SGD 5 each to enter. It is so worth it - the orchids are truly amazing, so colourful and so much variety. Quite awe inspiring.
We found a cafe/restaurant near the museum and scientific area and enjoyed some lovely waffles.
We had such a wonderful day here and would definitely recommend to others."
,,Fantastic - peace and joy.,5.0,,"Easy to get too. We took an open top bus tour and stopped here for what was to be a lovely walk around a beautiful, peaceful, thoughtful place. AND it's free, in the main.
You have to pay to see the Orchid collection, but it is so inexpensive. And it is the most vibrant place you could walk around. I just had not appreciated that orchids came in so many sizes, colours and shapes. As young people might say - I was gobsmacked.
If you go nowhere else in Singapore, take a trip here"

,,A lovely place for a wander around,4.0,,"The botanical gardens have been here for some years, and they're not far from the top end of Orchard Road if you fancy a break from high-pressure retail activity. They are the product of an earlier round of planning in Singapore and as a result are not as much part of the current tourist route as they perhaps were once. Well worth a visit."
,,A must see and a relaxing oasis in busy Singapore,5.0,,"I caught the MRT here from my hotel and walked most of the gardens including the national orchid garden (a fee to enter this).The botanical gardens are so well kept .Heaps of walking trails and beautifully presented. A few food places throughout but not overly cheap. You need good walking shoes and an umbrella if rain is about. some small hills so walking can get tiring, but plenty of interesting places to sit and take in the beauty of this place."
,,An amazing experience,4.0,,There is such alot to see here + within the gardens is the Orchid gardens. There there is a lovely lake with catfish & terrapins. You walk through a jungle walkway. Lots to do could spend several hours there.
,,Running through the park,5.0,,Perfect place if you want to escape the busyness on Orchard road. A few steps away from the crowd you can enjoy the green lush
,,good place to connect with nature,5.0,,"This is a nice go-to place if one wants to reconnect with nature as it has so many varieties of plants and trees and it's amazing how they kept the area virgin. Also, one can spot animals roaming the area freely. How I wish they could offer a quick tour using a golf cart for visitors especially for the senior citizens."
,,Beautifully kept garden park.,5.0,,A lovely well groomed park with the excellent Orchid gardens within it. Occasional nice surprises such as monitor lizards and specialist laid out sections.

,,Prettier than expected,5.0,,A wonderful place for a morning jog or evening walk. Surprised to find so many quaint spots for picnics. Rainforest treetop walk leads to a fun little rope hammock where you can lie down and look up at the canopy. Crowded on Sundays.
,,Super day activity!,4.0,,"So we decided to walk here because we already walked everywhere in Singapore but why walk when you can use Uber super easy in Asia!

So the ride took around 10min to the garden from center and can absolutely recommend Uber when you want to travel far and pay less.

We first tough that it would cost to enter but apparently it was free so we were happy,
First thing is to find a map because this I huge!

Bring walkable cloth and shoes because you’ll need it and a water bottle.

We were there for about 1h and that was enough, if you want to pay an extra cost to enter the flower area then put an extra 30min into the schedule.

I would definitely bring my dog, kid and friends here to have an chill day.
Don’t forget to walk down to the fountain where the swan & turtle is.

Let me know if you want me to visit something else in Singapore.

We do quite a lot of walking at home and, despite a little bit of complaining at first, they quickly got into the swing of things and started to enjoy the forest surrounds.

Although the terrain is very gentle it was quite warm which might by a problem for people not used to the heat. Certainly I was sweating.

There is a wonderful treetop walk that takes you into the canopy and the mats that go out over the forest floor from that height are good fun.

Although we didn’t intend to we ended up walking up to the Children’s garden. It took about 40 minutes, but there was some lovely scenery on the way.

The gardens are all well kept with interesting plants and well designed vistas.

,,Beautiful gardens and orchids,5.0,,"This place is huge,signposts so easy to navigate although sometimes you can branch out to explore.Currently had orchids show till end of April which was spectacular.Beautiful area"
,,One of the best places in Singapore for a morning walk,5.0,,"You will fall in love with the carefully manicured Gardens. Leaves are swept by an army of gardeners who go about in their buggy.

Feels like you’re entering a theme park each time...best of all, it’s free entry! The getaway place so near to the city."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The gardens are beautiful and it's very easy to find your way around, it's another must see attraction in Singapore."
,,WOW! Great Orchids,5.0,,The Casa Verde restaurant in the garden is a great place for breakfast and begin your day while it is cooler. The whole place is lovely but the Orchid area is unbelievably spectular. Don't miss it.
,,Beautiful day out,5.0,,"We spend half a day here and at the orchid gardens and had a really lovely time walking around, especially the jungle part at the beginning! It has its own MRT stop which is really handy and convenient to use. Would definitely recommend a visit!"
,,Peaceful get away from the city,5.0,,"Don’t get me wrong, Singapore is a fantastic city. But sometimes it is nice to get away from all the fumes & engines to just enjoy nature. There are many running & jogging courses, for the more athletically inclined."
,,Huge botanic gardens,5.0,,"This is a huge set of gardens, including the National Orchid Garden (about S$5 each) otherwise it is free. It is more hilly than I expected, and of course with the humidity is very tiring, but a beautiful way to spend a long day.

We got a taxi to Casa Verde in the garden to have breakfast - it wasn't as smart as I had expected, more of a self-service open-air fast food place, so don't think I would have bothered if I had known.

There are so many gardens within the Botanic gardens - eg bonsai, medicinal etc, plus lovely lakes with monitor lizards, turtles, swans etc. Really excellent."
,,150 years,5.0,,Heard that Botanic Garden in Singapore has 150 years history. My mum and I always like to go there and enjoy the fresh air. It’s also a good place for pre-wedding photo shoots.
,,Beautiful Place,4.0,,Far away from the city but a good place to see flowers and plants. Come along with friends to do sightseeing and pictorial is a perfect place to visit.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"This was a shear delight. These gardens are amazing and we loved the orchid garden and the rainforest. We were also impressed with Swan Lake, although on the day we visited we saw few swans, but lots of terrapins and catfish. The gardens are really well kept. We were sorry that the bromeliad garden was undergoing restoration but to be honest there was enough for us in one day in the wet heat of Singapore."
,,Beautiful and nearly free!,5.0,,"Highly recommend. A visit to Singapore without going here would incomplete. Beautiful free gardens, sculptures and the Orchid Garden was defietely worth the small paid admission fee. Took the MRT to Bukit gate. Take sturdy shoes, a camera, lots of water and enjoy!"
,,Not your average Botanic Gardens....,5.0,,Our visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens was part of our City Tour with RMG. Another great experience for not only people into gardening etc....A great way to spend a morning or afternoon or more in over 52 hectares of wonderful garden. Absolutely a must do.
,,One of the most beautiful gardens I've seen,5.0,,"I am going to keep this review short because:

1. We were very tired at the time we got here and it would not be a great detailed review.
2. The park was so peaceful that we fall asleep at some point and slept close to one hour.
3. There are several paid areas in the garden and we did not visit them.

Said that... I can tell you the garden has been designed with accessibility in mind, you get to see a lot of parents with trolleys, pushing their kids around or you get to see elderly people walking easily and enjoying the view of the treetops.

The gardens offer a huge variety of flowers and plants from different parts of the world and Singapore, making the visit very interesting if you enjoy plants.
You will also see chickens running around! I was expecting other animals but not chickens. That made the visit a bit bizarre.

As part of your walk, you might end up in the tropical forest (or rainforest) area, this place is especially dangerous if you are tired, it was this wonderful wood benches, a nice shade and a soft breeze that puts you under in two minutes! We slept like babies for an hour and a half, just waking up as my stomach woke us up to an all mighty growl.

Hope you enjoy your visit as much as we slept through it. We did walk the gardens and most of what we saw was gorgeous, unfortunately, we slept half of our visit and had to go somewhere else."
,,More flora,5.0,,"Excellent place to visit with your family, and it is FREE! There is also a MRT stop right on the spot. Lots of beautifully constructed wooden hats and a few refreshment joints provide the perfect checkpoint to catch your breathe too."
,,Spend many hours here,5.0,,Not just a botanical garden but rain forests and so much more to see. The vastness of the gardens provides an opportunity to spend a half day easily. The layout of the gardens is beautiful with small lakes and waterfalls. Highly recommend
,,big trees in middle of city,5.0,,"Lovely big trees. Do not go during rainy season, as the big trees carry large amount of water and the branches may break. There is children garden next to it, great for kids to run around and safe."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Really gorgeous and interesting place. Lovely setting, great place for a walk. Easily accessible by the subway. The Orchid garden is worth the additional admission. ."
,,good place for picnic,5.0,,"it is indeed a very good place for friends to go picnic. very serene atmosphere, and very relaxing..."
,,One more beautiful than the other,5.0,,All of us enjoyed our morning at the botanical gardens - including my 20 year old son! It is more like a walk/hike through different scenarios - and the orchid garden is a must!! There is also a very nice restaurant inside if you want to stop for a snack
,,Very nice,4.0,,Fabulously green park though a bit crowded on a Sunday with joggers and dog walkers. Probably less crowded on a weekday. Great place to let children run around. Free entry. Cafe with play area at the gate we used.
,,Beautifully maintained gardens,5.0,,"These gardens offer hours of relaxation, and fun. Beautiful trees, plants and shrubs. The employees are so very helpful, posted at the entrance gates they offer information about the gardens and the layout, both verbally and in printed form and are clearly so proud of their work environment.
Would recommend as an escape from city hustle and bustle and also the opportunity to experience nature."
,,Stunning gardens,5.0,,"Entrance to the gardens is free. If you wish to visit the Orchid Gardens then it is $S5 each, but well worth the fee.

Acres of grounds with amazing plants and wildlife. Wander around and you will find small groups of people making the most of the serenity and they will be taking part in a Tai Chi class."
,,Peaceful walk,3.0,,It was easy to find and a very peaceful experience with lots to see and do. Go on a nice day weather wise and you will enjoy it.
,,Beautiful morning walk at the Gardens,5.0,,"One of the best things about the Singapore Botanic Gardens are the beautiful trees, flowers and paths that you can walk on in the early morning. A great place to start your day and feel refreshed.
Though it's been around since as long as I remember with my grandfather working as a lab technician and my Dad even being born there, the ""Botanics"" as I call it, far surpasses the Gardens by the Bay which is too artificial for me. It's also free entry to this now coveted UNESCO site - so unlike other gardens in other parts of the world where one has to pay a fee just to get in.
I discover new places each time I come here, even though I've lost count on the number of times I've been here.
Interestingly enough, people of all ages love it here. For me, it's just a place that I would love to come home to and welcome anyone who is visiting Singapore."
,,Bring water,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay might be our newer, more exciting attraction with regards to botany, but the Botanic Gardens remains the OG in Singapore. It might not have air-conditioned amenities galore like Gardens by the Bay, but it promises a great way to spend time with your loved ones, strolling through a sprawling park of different types of plants.
I used to come to the Botanic Gardens really often as a child, and these visits were always fun and educational for me. During the weekends, you'll see lots of people having picnics in the fields near Symphony Lake - if you're into classical music as well, do keep an ear (ha, pun!) out for events that are held there too.
I highly recommend bringing water though - it's a park and there are water points for you to drink from, but in Singapore's heat it's always nice to have water on hand. Bring insect repellent, too - it'll come in handy especially since mosquitoes do love our humidity!"
,,stroll,4.0,,"its a good walk, love the nature feels, the falls, the atmosphere, one of the best garden in Asia.. ."
,,A must do,5.0,,Worth a visit - the orchid gardens are spectacular and the whole gardens are a true oasis in the heart of the city
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,The Botanic gardens can’t be missed when you visit Singapore. It is easy to get there on the metro. The grounds are arranged in clusters of different gardens much like a zoo. Pay 5 dollars to enter the paradise of the orchid garden. Go early to miss some of the daily heat.
,,Lush,4.0,,Very worth visiting. Have a walk and a beer as you dodge tropical rain storms. Visit the orchid museum while you are there well worth effort. Was warm warm
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,We visited the Botanical Gardens during a recent trip to Singapore. They are beautifully maintained and seem to be working on areas on an ongoing basis. Don’t miss the Orchid Gardens - stunning!
,,Free and attractive gardens,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are free to enter and provide an opportunity for a good walk amongst attractive gardens close to the city centre. A MRT station is situated conveniently at the main gate. The gardens cover a very large area with a mix of trees, plants and shrubs, although not many were in flower when we visited in April. The highlight is the National Orchid Gardens - see separate 5 start review - which has a small entrance fee and situated just over 1km from the MRT station entrance."
,,Nice and well kept,4.0,,"This is a very good botanical garden, very well kept and entrance is free. It has various gates but we entered through the Naseem gate (a nice name which means morning breeze in Arabic/Persian). You need to spend a good amount of time to explore this great treasure in Singapore. A must visit."
,,Amazing and a must do.,5.0,,Singapore is a credit to our planet. The botanic gardens are just amazing and breath taking. There is beauty everywhere and so much to enjoy. My teenage children loved the gardens with its magic and beauty.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"These gardens held a vast array of beautiful attractions. There was a rainforest walk that allowed you to go through part of the rainforest, it contained huge trees and was a good experience. There was also the orchid garden, which you have to pay to get in but it was worth it as it was so beautiful, full of so many different kinds of pretty orchids and plants.
However, there was another rainforest walk, that was called ""the walk of the giants"" and you went up a staircase on to a walkway quite high above the ground which led you through parts of the rainforest , it's surrounded by huge trees and lovely wildlife. Overall it was a great place to visit."
,,Living documents in Biodiversity and Conservation,5.0,,"Covering more than 80 hectares of greenery with thousands of flora, the Singapore Botanic Gardens is a testimony of the positive attitude towards conservation of local plant life through out two centuries maintained by all successive ruling powers: British Colonial, Japanese occupation forces and finally, Republic of Singapore.
National Orchid Garden houses the large orchid collection of 1,200 species and 2,000 hybrids. It is at the forefront of orchid studies and a pioneer in the cultivation of hybrids. The VIP Orchid section showcases Singapore's ""orchid diplomacy"" by honouring visiting Heads of States, dignitaries and celebrities, by naming its finest hybrids after them. The national flower of Singapore is a hybrid orchid, Vanda Miss Joaquim.
Other important segments are Ginger Garden, Rain Forest and Keppel Discovery Wetlands.
We took two guided tours : Learning Forest Tour and Rain Forest Tour. Each tour lasted for about 90 minutes and involved walking and interacting with friendly guides who were knowledgable and good communicators. No fees were charged except for the entrance to Orchid Garden.
Our visit was very interesting because we saw many old things from a new perspective and learnt by experiencing.
We could see, touch and feel the four layers of the lowland rainforest. Our respect for fig trees increased when we were made aware of their contributions to jungle life. The example of strangler figs revealed their mutualism with fig wasps! We could see many types of bamboo plants and gathered that growth rate of bamboo is the fastest among plants. We could learn that leaves have four broad types of shapes. We came across a large variety of local fruit plants like mangosteen, durian, sea apple, sea coconut. We could watch the differences in barks of different trees like Tembusu and Eucalyptus and closely see the Jelutong tree that yields latex for chewing gums! We learnt that parasite plants generally do not look green. In short, it was a rewarding experience to visit the Botanic Gardens."
,,Haven in a busy world,5.0,,The Orchid Garden is a particularly nice visit. The Orchids are outstanding. Very well laid out and kept in a pristine state.I highly recommend you visit.
,,Best free attraction around,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are large, well kept, and free to wander around. I loved seeing people strolling, walking their dogs, or running through the park. There are maps to help you find your way around, which is good since the place is huge. Lots of signs to explain what you're looking at. Plan to spend several hours there if you enjoy nature...it's a true oasis."
,,Things to do in Singapore,5.0,,"We only had a short stay but we loved the trishaw ride in Chinatown, also the markets there and a lovely Chinese meal.
If, you are only there for a short stay the open top buses are an excellent way to see Singapore A. trip to Sentosa Island is a must.
Also the shopping in Orchard Road"
,,Lots to see and do at the gardens,4.0,,Lots to see and do at the gardens. Worth walking from one side to the other stopping for refreshments half way. Easily spend at least half a day here.
,,Lovely Gardens,5.0,,"We went in March it was very hot. Take water. The gardens are very nice. We saw a snake, monitor lizards, a Sarawak bird and lots of other birds. You can walk for a couple of hours here. A couple of rest stops are around. Beautiful area in Singapore."
,,Amazing Gardens,5.0,,"These are simply beautiful spacious and well set out gardens. There are some areas where a extra few is payable such as the Orchid garden but the vast majority of the Botanic Garden is free which is fabulous for a classified world heritage site! There is also lots of information so you can understand what the area is setting out to achieve and the type of plants / trees that are planted in that area.

There is a dedicated Children’s garden which the kids loved due to the water fountain play area which is quite small but very effective and cooling for the kids on hot days. We managed to grab some lunch in the italian restaurant onsite which was reasonably priced and served a good variety of food. I had the pizza which was tasty.

There was a free music event setting up as we left and in the main area near the orchid garden (incredibly beautiful and accessible for an additional fee) was a Japanese market area with a few concessions. A superb and largely free day out...highly recommended."
,,Very beautiful gardens,5.0,,"These gardens are a great respite from the business of the city. It's relaxing wandering through the wonderful flower displays, enjoying the trees and many birds found in these gardens."
,,A wonderful park,5.0,,"This is the first time that I came here since it was listed as a UNESCO world heritage site.

The overall beauty of the park remains the same. Lots of exotic plants and the landscape was beautiful.

The park is more organised now and has lots more signs and directions.

As this is a big park, you need to plan at least 1-2 hours to fully enjoy the park. Many nice and cooling spots around to sit and relax."
,,A beautiful oasis in a metropolitan city!,5.0,,Beautifully landscaped with well maintained gardens interspersed with lots of shady spots. There are also ample outlets for the thirsty or hungry. An excellent place for the family. Do not miss the exceptional botanic gardens.
,,Singapore on a budget,3.0,,It's one of those things to put on your itinerary if you want to avoid expensive attractions. It's definitely not world class but somewhere to go for exercise.
,,Peace & Quiet,4.0,,"We had a lovely morning stroll around this park which was a delight. Plenty of shady spots if in need of shelter from the sun. Lovely cafes to quench your thirst & of course, a plethora of plants & trees to gaze at. Lovely!"
,,Singpore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,We spent about 2 hours walking through the gardens - amazing orchids and landscaping. We even saw a small monitor lizaard. Entrance is free - but had to pay a few $$ to enter the orchid garden. I would highly recommend a vist to the gardens.
,,Singapore’s UNESCO world heritage site,5.0,,Hosting many varieties of plants and trees in wide open spaces. The large premise also houses many award winning restaurants good for a trip out with family friends and even for business. Singapore’s first Unesco world heritage site
,,Amazing place of beauty!,5.0,,At the end of one of the tours in Singapore I decided to end the tour here. Walked around for a couple of hours and marveled at the beauty and simplicity of the gardens. I decided to have lunch at one of the restaurants in the garden and had a fantastic lunch and a great day at the Gardens. Well worth the time.
,,A must see excursion.,4.0,,"We decided to see the Botanic garden. Took the MRT train, very easy to the garden.
Despite the humidity and heat we really enjoyed the visit. So very well kept and thousands of different flowers and trees to see.
The entrance gave me my first pensioneer discount (Birthday 60 yrs) thanks.
We recommend all visitors to wear comfortable shoes....it is a lot of walking!
Brgds
Mats & Eva Sweden!"
,,Not really worth it,3.0,,Though it's free there is not really much there of major interest. Lovely setting and immaculate as usual for SG but I was in and out in 20 mins as it was so hot and humid.
,,Singapore botanic gardens,5.0,,"Best place for walking n exercise, was there almost every morning a beautiful and clean gardens with pleasant environment,"

,,"A great spot for a family walk, beautiful gardens to see for all ages",5.0,,"This was a great stop for us, we had been keen to get out for a long walk and let our son run and play. The area is so beautiful and there are so many different parts to these gardens. There are places to sit and rest, people watch, have refreshments and food. A must do in Singapore."
,,Didn't want to get out of there!,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens firstly, are so accessible by public transport that I could have gone there every day of my stay in Singapore! Well, I didn't. But the day I went there, I didn't want to get out of there. It's a different world from the city of Singapore and you can walk around and not get tired among the trees. The rainforest was my favourite patch; the air was just so different!"
,,Wonderful stroll in the city,5.0,,"Massive gardens right in the city. Lots of people come here to jog, exercise or walk their dog. Not crowded at all when we were there because it’s massive. There is a separate orchid garden which I enjoyed but the orchids were of the easy to grow varieties. Beautiful but nothing exotic."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Stunning gardens and well planned. I recommend wearing comfortable food wear and bringing water. Get a map from the information desk and then go exploring. We ate at Bees Knees and it was beautiful and affordably priced.
,,Spend time and enjoy,5.0,,We didn’t spend long in the gardens but could have spent more. It’s a place to wander and enjoy the peace and quiet within a busy city. The tree walk is calming and the wildlife abundant.
,,Something to suit all tastes,5.0,,"The gardens cover a large area, and there are many different habitat types, from grassy meadows to lakes to the orchid garden. The latter is the gem in the crown of the gardens and the only area which needs you to pay for entry ( only a token amount). The orchids are stunning and there are multiple photo opportunities. There is a smart gift shop at the entry point, and a small kiosk there for snacks and drinks. A larger cafe is in the gardens and is a favourite with the red jungle fowl! The food was good. The gardens are a good spot for bird-watching, and we also saw large lizards and squirrels. We visited twice, in January and in March, and enjoyed both."
,,Flowers and plants,5.0,,"Very interesting place to visit even in monsoon season , the different plants made the day Better because you could read all about the different plants , clean and well mentatined place would recommend my friends to go there"

It was a glorious hot day and it was lovely experience walking round these immaculate gardens. We had tickets for the orchid garden. Wow and wow again!! So many varieties and colours!! Just beautiful!!
Souvenir shop was expensive so watch out!!"
,,Quite place to walk,5.0,,Very good place to have a walk. But not so good from April since the temperature will be bit higher. Very well designed place.
,,Free landscaped park & great Childrens exploration/learning park!,5.0,,"Even as an adult I enjoyed the children's park. Large grounds for exploration and exercise. Great to expel kids energy. Takes around 30-45 mins walk from bukit timah side(botanical gardens mrt) to reach orchard road area.

No covered walkways. Need to bring an umbrella although there are pavilions for shelter along the way.

Avoid weekends if you want peace and quiet. Rather bustling as many people go on picnics and just hang out, chatter , dogs etc."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I found the botanical gardens while riding the hop on hop off bus and came back for an afternoon. The garden area is really enormous and would require more time than I had to really see it so I decided to visit the orchid house and the areas nearby. The orchid house required an additional fee, and US was acceptable. The orchids were beautiful, so many plants and so many flowers in every colours and size. The gardeners do a fabulous job with the display. The areas nearby are all easily accessible and worth visiting. There are plenty of places to buy a cold drink as it is very hot. Take a hat and your camera and you won't be disappointed."
,,Perfect gardens,5.0,,"These gardens have everything..they are beautifully cared for with lots of facilities and are easily accessible. You need comfortable clothes though..there is a lot to see, and a lot of walking. Try the reflexology footpath if your feet get tired!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It never ceases to amaze me how they are always improving and enlarging the (already great) botanic gardens.

having added 2 new gardens in the past few years, they are still making improvements, adding more visitor centers, improved parking and a new garden experience by the kids garden.

I run through the gardens in the morning when possible and its the best start to the day. Alternatively i walk it in mid morning with my wife at weekends, but best to go earlier and avoid the chinese tour groups!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Yes it was beautiful, perfect for a rainy afternoon. Be aware it’s chilly inside. Lots of floors and trees. We did both gardens since during the purchase they don’t give you much of an option."
,,Orchid Gardens a must,5.0,,All of the grounds are beautiful but the Orchid Gardens are amazing. The colors and variety will blow you away.
,,Very nice.,5.0,,"This is a very large Botanic garden. They say it takes 4-5 hours to see it all but you are in control of that. The National Orchid Garden in worth the $5 to go in and see it. The rest is purely a personal preference on how long you stay. Access is easy with hop on hop off, cabs, etc.
A key site to see in Singapore."
,,fantastic place to wander around...,5.0,,"love to wander here on a sunday morning and watch the world go by - it is so peaceful and tranquil especially off the beaten track areas. Look out for the treehouse area where you can lay on a rope bed about 50 feet above ground, amazing. Great places to eat and drink at reasonable prices. Some sunday afternoons there's live music on which is just best..."
,,A beautiful botanical garden,5.0,,"Didn’t spend nearly enough time here exploring, but absolutely loved it. Considering Singapore is a huge city, it’s lovely to go and see squirrels, monitor lizards, and so many birds, black swans, turtles, right there in the city. I’ve been to many botanical gardens and this is the cleanest, tidiest, best maintained and well organised one yet. Lots of families with kids enjoying nature there."
,,A lovely place to enjoy nature,5.0,,I will definitely return to view the other gardens. We only visited tge Orchid Garden because of lack of time. The Orchid garden alone is worth the entrance fee. The orchids are so varied and beautiful.

My favorite restaurant is in the Ginger Garden....an oasis of calm and friendly service.

Unexpected atraction was stormy rain which fited pefectly to the Rain-Forest part."

,,A beautiful oasis in Singapore,5.0,,"The extensive Botanic Gardens are well worth visiting and one of my favourite gardens to date. There are many different areas to explore , including the Orchid Garden which is a must. The gardens do not charge an entrance fee, but there is a small charge for the Orchid Gardens which were very beautiful.
There is an area where food and refreshments can be bought, plus a shop to buy souvenirs.
I would definitely recommend a visit here."
,,A lovely place,5.0,,"The botanical gardens were wonderful, most of the park is free to walk around, with many different areas and gardens.
The orchid garden has an entry fee, but it wasn’t expensive and worth a trip in.
The gardens were lovely and a great way to spend half a day or more."
,,Overrated,3.0,,In my opinion the Botanic Garden it self is not that exciting. There are mainly green/ brown plants and not very much flowers. The best part of the Botanic Garden is the Orchid Garden.
,,A Quiet Place,5.0,,"I have fond memories of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. My first visit there was 42 years ago. It is just a place for peace and quiet. The walking paths, unique flowers, bushes and trees. The open space in the middle of Singapore. Be prepared to walk and you won't be disappointed. The Orchid display is well worth the visit. Make sure you take good walking shoes, a sun hat and sunscreen. I would suggest a morning visit when it is not so hot. There is an MRT Station close by and public buses stop near the main gate. This is a great place for taking pictures. I would highly recommend spending at least the morning."
,,Beautiful grounds and lovely dinner,5.0,,"I attended a dinner hosted here and the food was delicious, probably the best meal I had in Singapore. Of course the grounds were beautiful as well."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"03/04/18
Stunning gardens which are all kept immaculate. There’s plenty of trails and walks to venture on to and exploring to do. The orchard gardens are definitely worth the visit - cost 5 Singapore dollars for an adult entry.

We spent around 2 hours there; it was very hot today! Please remember to take plenty of water with you and hats/sun umbrellas to shield you from the sun."

,,So peaceful !,5.0,,"I loved walking through the well kept gardens, it was so peaceful. The fish ponds were amazing and I loved the swan lake."
,,Orchid garden is a must-see,5.0,,"Go early or late in the day - people exercising all over the place - Tai chi classes, running, stretching in groups... free admission with very inexpensive charge for Orchid Garden - well worth the cost! Explanation of hybrids and separate gardens for hybrids dedicated to world leaders who visited and other famous people... but huge variety and gorgeously landscaped."
,,Great,5.0,,"A beautiful day out, and apart from the orchid garden it’s free. Spent a morning walking around, we didn’t go to the orchid garden this time. We did that the last time we were here. It is well worth the visit but we didn’t have enough time."
,,Stunning!,4.0,,Getting to Singapore Botanic Garden was quite a hike if you take the public transit but you'll be rewarded with the beautiful orchids display and the manicured lawn.
,,Lush of green,4.0,,"Very peaceful n greeny place. There are thosands of different species in the gdn. It is divided into 3 little segment, Eco pond , symphony park swan lake. Great for family outings, picnics and jogging & etc esp during the evening cooling period."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Arrived at the Gardens before dawn and it was spectacular to hear the dawn chorus of birds and frogs.

Lots of different areas to explore, each with their own highlights - but the National Orchid Garden was particularly fine.

Lots of walking, but well signposted and mapped and with plenty of places to get drinks.

The high point of my visit to Singapore."
,,How very pretty,5.0,,Baring in mind the heat and humidity these gardens are a real delight and well worth a visit. Take an umbrella to shade you.
,,"Historical, Pedigreed, Varied, and FREE!",5.0,,"There is truly something for everyone at the Botanics! I go there 5 times a week and depending on the time of day, you are guaranteed to see dog-walkers, family picnics, fitness fanatics (and not-so-fanatics), seniors doing tai-chi, meditation practitioners, nature lovers, and more. Beautifully and cleverly planned and laid-out with a huge variety of walks and hangouts. The eateries are well worth a stop after your visit. An UNESCO site that's easily accessible and totally free!"
,,Arrive early for a peaceful experience,5.0,,"We took the MRT there from Orchard Road. So easy to use to get around Singapore. Arrive early to avoid the crowds and the tours. It is beautiful place. It is incredibly hot walking round so take plenty of water. The orchid garden is a must do so try and do that first. Next to the Raffles building is an outdoor eatery where all the staff go to eat. Very reasonably priced casual, cafe style. Don't expect anything grand but the food looked good."
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"Easy access to top entrance by MRT. Very large area but well laid out. Much walking so need to be prepared with water etc. Very green, peaceful and relaxing. Just a beautiful place to visit."
,,Oasis,5.0,,Stunning please do yourself a favour especially if your in transit the gardens are free entry & open from 05.00. Put the phone away & wander around this beautiful huge oasis.. can’t recommend enough.
,,Not a quick visit.,5.0,,"There is so much more to these gardens than you first think. We almost made the mistake of thinking we had walked around them, only to find we had missed a turning, and by doubling back we found another large amount of beautiful gardens. Allow plenty of time to savour this tropical delight."
,,Green Heart of Singapore City,5.0,,"Set up during colonial times, and still having a few remnants of the Raj, this huge sprawling park is easily reached by Metro and is free, except for the Orchid Gardens, which charge a nominal fee. There are so many areas and themes throughout the park it could take more than one visit, especially due to the tropical heat and large areas to cover. There are kiosks and cafes in the park and a maze of paths visiting the specialist garden areas. Shady rainforest walks, palm and cycad areas and a large section dedicated to tropical food and Medicine tree crops make for a fascinating and insightful journey. For garden and nature lovers this botanical wonderland should be on everyone’s bucket list, especially when including the World renowned Orchid Gardens"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"What a beautiful, peaceful place with a variety of trails and areas to visit. You could get lost in here all day if you wanted to and can take your own picnic basket if you wish. The orchid garden was lovely and they had live entertainment in the outdoor theatre which was great. Very well laid out with signs everywhere. Very well kept and despite the heat, very enjoyable! Lovely!"
,,Lovely green place right in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Singapore botanical garden is easily accessible by walking from its subway station by same name.. the only hitch is we need to walk all the way back to catch a train so its a double walk maybe in warm weather thats a minus... Lovely gardens with great views picnic spots and variety of flora and fauna..National Orchid garden is their pride which is in the middle needs a 5$ entry fee a must visit to variety of orchids... Botanicals are ofcourse free... long walks if we want to cover all the places maybe will need 3-4 hours...one star less in the review is for absence of some tram or bikes ( altho it would mar the serenity but a separate way for reaching in the middle would be nice) options for people who dont want to or cant walk.
Locals go for their morning walks ."
,,The pride of Singapore,5.0,,"Outside of Japan, outside of Australia , there is no doubt that the Singapore Botanical Garden (SBG, abbreviation mine) is the best of its kind in Asia.

The fact that it has been around since the 1800’s makes it more amazing. I personally prefer it so much more than Gardens by the Bay.

The British , who used to run Singapore, contributed much with the beginning of the SBG with their steep knowledge on the establishment and the design .

It is a very walkable garden suited for young strollers and kids in “strollers”, and a great place for negative ions.

Culinary delights are made available to refresh the body too.

The foliage and the serenity are prized . Choose mornings or evenings to visit.

The upto 6 year olds should be brought to the relative of the SBG, the Jacob Ballas Garden, for additional outdoor enjoyment ."
,,An oasis in Singapore,5.0,,"Well worth a visit considering it's free entry. Incredible variety of plants, beautifully laid out. You may even see some monitor lizards browsing in the undergrowth."
,,A must see!,5.0,,Free attraction. Easy to get to by MRT. Beautiful garden and wildlife. Could spend many hours here. Be sure to see the tortoises and lily pads by the pond!
,,It was nice,5.0,,Bring an umbrella to shade you from the sun. Follow the path on the map. It is a beautiful display of how they nurture the plants and how they are able to graft. I enjoyed it and would want to come again to spend more time taking pictures of everything.
,,"Beautiful gardens, particularly orchids",4.0,,"As we were visiting as part of a coach tour, we didn’t get to spend as long here as we would have liked as we really enjoyed the parts we saw. The highlight for us was the VIP orchid garden (where new species have been named after foreign dignitaries), which was beautiful. It took us around half an hour to do that section, but the rest of the gardens were massive so I’m sure we would have spent much longer there."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Have been to Singapore on many occasions but not to the botanical gardens. Are really worth a visit spent approx 4 hors here. Lots of places to eat and every time you stop you will see wild life whether it be squirrels, dragon flies, butterflies, goannas and even bantams. A relaxing day out"
,,Day Run,5.0,,In the morning I was feeling a little flat after our plane trip so the hotel staff at The Grand Hyatt advised me to go for a run through the gardens. Its beautiful and quite. Highly recommend you come here.
,,Perfect Day...until the thunderstorm came!!,5.0,,"This is the most perfect Botanical Garden, free save for a nominal price to get into the Orchid section....but well worth the dollar it cost me as a Senior. Even though the day was cut short, I walked until my legs felt like they would drop off. There are lakes and bridges and stairs (and lifts) and ramps, play areas, lunch areas...water features and more!! It is well taken care of and very, very clean. You learn a lot if you have time to read any of the signage; if not, it would be just as pleasant. I would return over and over if my trip wasn’t so short. Do NOT miss this place!!"
,,wonderful for a quick visit or all day,5.0,,"This is a spectacular example of a public space and botanical garden, with significant attention to plant material, public spaces, art and water elements. A treat for all"
,,Relaxing stroll to enjoy nature and the fragrant orchids,5.0,,"Our top priority for our one day stay in Singapore was to visit here. Easily reached by Metro. Free entrance and as we are both 60 years young it only cost us 1SD each extra to enter the Orchid Garden instead of 5 SD.Very well worth our time. All areas are well signposted and we walked by the Symphony Lake to reach the Orchid Garden. We particularly enjoyed the sights and smells of the Orchids in the Famous people section where we enjoyed identifying orchids named after our Queen Elizabeth, Margaret Thatcher and Barack Obama. It wasn't very busy and we visited around 12pm on an overcast day when it was less humid. The gift shop was pleasant to explore and I bought a birthday card of a famous orchid for my mum for 5SD so not overpriced."
,,Huge and impressive,5.0,,"My husband and I had a walk in this beautiful Botanic Gardens just close to our hotel.It is very huge to see everything for a day . Very clean and peaceful to sit there in the middle of the park during weekedays.It is for free, unless you want to see the butterfly garden."

,,Always Amazing,5.0,,"Whenever we visit Singapore we always visit the botanical gardens, they're normally first on our list of things to do. Apart from the stunning trees and parkland, the orchid gardens are incredible and there is a fair amount of wildife in the gardens, in addition to the visitors! Well recommended, a ""must do"" when in Singapore."
,,Visited twice in a week,5.0,,"Every time we visit Singapore we go to the Botanical Gardens mainly to photograph the wild birds in the gardens. The gardens are huge and to get around it all in a day is not really possible. Lots of places to buy food inside the park. A very enjoyable day, lots of photographs. Easy to get to via the SMRT."
,,Fresh and Green,5.0,,"Love this place a lot especially when in Singapore, everything was a skyrise building. This place is a very big garden and the place is very calm. Will definitely come here everytime I come to Singapore. Love this place a lot. Very good to relax yourself or even if you wish to go for a jog, this is a good place to do so."
,,Exceptional,5.0,,"As humid as the day was, felt like was in s biology class, so much to see, wear good shoes, beautiful, and have water for hydration"
,,Bigger than you think,4.0,,"I usually do a fitness boot camp here twice a week but this was a chance to stroll around parts of the gardens that I don't normally see. It's a lovely, tranquil oasis in what is one of the busiest cities in the world. Calming yet invigorating at the same time. Take the time to visit as it is a great place to unwind after a few days of hectic touristy stuff..."

,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Like anything in Singapore the gardens are well planned. The gardens are very big and you can spend there 5 hours. However, we were there approximately two hours, visited the west side of the park.
Variety of plants, trees, flowers and animals (in the lake).
Some of the activities inside the gardens require entry fees while the entry to the botanic gardens is free of cost.
We had great experience there and I wish you too."

,,Must see and it's free!,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens are a delight, beautifully maintained and so clean. Lots of paths and themed areas to enjoy and good restaurants and coffee stops. It is clearly a place used by families on a sunny weekend day and this adds to the charm. A run in the early morning sees the Gardens at their most tranquil and this is probably the most enjoyable early morning run I have ever had! If you only visit one place in Singapore then this must be it"
,,What a treat,5.0,,Oh My! This is the most beautiful and diverse botanical gardens we have ever been to during our travels. The evolution gardens are just amazing. So much to see in plants and wildlife. So many different types of plants. Put this at the top of your list as it is great and it’s free.
,,Must Do's In Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens is one of the most beautiful things that you can see in Singapore, maybe even the world. Featuring restaurants, pagodas, information on plants, plant sections, and it is even home to the National Orchid Garden. You can come with your family to have a nice evening picnic, or drop by on a business trip to have a cup of coffee, the botanic gardens are the perfect place to be in any occasion. I recommend popping into the National Orchid Garden, and also visiting the Children's garden, for fun, learning, and bonding with you and your child. Definitely should be top of the list of things to do in Singapore"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Went out for a little wander. Gardens are beautiful. There were turtles in the lake as well and lots to see in the park. Definitely worth going for a stroll as it’s free to do also.

,,The only must see place in Singapore,5.0,,Forget Marina Bay Sands and other attractions. This is the only must see thing in Singapore. Truly special and flawless.
,,truly wonderful,5.0,,"much nicer than the gardens by the bay. the Botanic gardens are truly beautiful, especially the Orchid Garden. Lots of nice places for a snack too. Highly recommended."
,,Another fun Singapore attraction!,4.0,,Singapore has some of the best greenery because of the warm and humid climate. You will not be disappointed if you visit these gardens.

,,Relaxing running trails!,5.0,,"I’m an avid runner and I loved the running escape that was provided by the botanical gardens. It’s only 15 minutes or so away from the heart of Singapore, I’d advise you run before 11am if you want to avoid the heat."

,,Amazing!!,5.0,,Such a great thing to see whilst in Singapore. One of the most beautiful gardens I’ve ever seen! Could spend a day relaxing
,,A Gardener's Paradise,5.0,,The botanical gardens are amazing but be prepared to do a lot of walking. There are several sections including one of only 2 rainforests within a city. The highlight for me was the Orchid collection. Incredible tropical displays of amazing size and collours.
,,Amazing gardens,5.0,,"As you would expect in Singapore, the gardens are so well set out, maintained and the most glorious designs. The Orchid Garden is marvellous with many and varied orchids."

,,Really beautiful,5.0,,"If you like gardens, this one is exceptionally well maintained. Definitely worth a few hours viewing, or more. Not to mention the Orchid Garden!! Food available too."
,,Delightful World Heritage Garden,5.0,,"Choose a non-rainy day, dress casually with sun protection, and go early in the morning. Give yourself 6 hours if you really want to see the 3 wings of the Garden. Add another hour if you eat at the various cafes.

There are 3 different sections, all connected by paths, with different garden themes. The Heritage Garden is the most well known and most visited by tourists. However if time, weather and fitness permits, go visit the 2 newer sections. They are the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden and the Learning Forest.

The Heritage section includes orchids, ferns and ginger specialisations. The other 2 sections have tall trees and cash crops. On their own, these 2 lesser known sections are well worth spending time at.

For a totally different feel, re-visit at night (except Learning Forest which closes early). The cooler air, lights and shadows transforms the scenery. The garden is an excellent place for an evening jog."
,,Beautiful park.,5.0,,"The gardens are beautiful, with a lovely, relaxed atmosphere. The park is massive, with lots to see. We particularly enjoyed the rainforest area, and the treetop walk near the wetlands. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend if you’re in Singapore for a few days."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,A must do but go early to beat the brutal heat of the day. Bucolic and peaceful with orchids aplenty.
,,Meditation at its best,5.0,,Beautiful - calm- educational. The Botanic Gardens are simply the best part of Singapore. Amazing beauty and science abound! Do not miss!

,,"드넓은 자연놀이터, 도심근처 자연을 느낄 수 있는 곳 great nature near Orchard, also popular with local people for picnic, crowded on weekends",5.0,,"공원산책을 즐기는 분이라면 꼭 방문해야 할 곳임에 틀림없지만, 선글래스, 모자, 양산, 물통 등 싱가폴의 강렬한 태양과 맞서 싸울 준비 또한 필요합니다. 입장은 무료이나 유료로 들어가는 공간이 일부 있고, 몇 개의 식당들과 기념품샵들이 있습니다. 일요일은 조금 붐비는 편이지만 서울의 공원들보다는 한산합니다. 입구가 여러 곳이므로 미리 지도 확인 필수입니다. Must visit place if you're a nature lover, but you also need to be prepared to protect yourself from the sun. Bring your sunglasses, hats, and water. No entrance fee.(Only orchid garden is charged.) There're restaurants and souvenir shops. Sundays are a bit crowded, but still enjoyable. Because there are several entrances, you'd better to check the map in advance."
,,Very pretty,5.0,,We had a short stop at the Botanical Gardens as part of our city tour and walked through the orchid gardens which were very beautiful and provided a multitude of gorgeous backdrops for photo opportunities
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A must see when in Singapore. Would definitely recommend walking around (you cannot cycle). We spent 5 hrs there!
,,A Couple Hours or a Full Day,5.0,,We saw the gardens with a tour guide which gave us the opportunity to see the highlights without wandering around on our own.
,,Before 11am...Great quite green place to visit,4.0,,"Visited early in the morning. A place to breath and get away from the hustle and crowd of the rush city of Singapore. Spent about 3 hours walking through the trees, the orchid garden. Sat at the Swan lake and did see the white swans. The entrance is free but you do need to pay as a foreigner for the Orchid Garden but its worth to go in there. I haven't seen so much different coloured orchids, they're beautiful. A must visit if you are in Singapore and a lover of nature and flowers. But come as early as possible because if the crowd wakes up and arrive in groups at the Botanic Garden, the atmosphere changes into that of a busy tourist place."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Can't go to Singapore without seeing the orchid garden... And it's not just orchids but beautiful foliage of all kinds. Only saw half of what there was too see and could easily return. Informative sign boards, easy walking paths, delightful experience"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Spent 3/4 hours wandering around the gardens - probably not best time of the year to see it at its best but it was certainly worth while and Free entrance
,,Enjoyable & Educational!,5.0,,"Family friendly, great place for family picnics, educational, inspiring, and awesome photo ops for picture taking!"
,,Went here on a bike tour,5.0,,"Lovely well done gardens, free admission too (but must buy ticket for orchid collection), totally quiet and pristine. Really enjoyed out picnic by Swan Lake with the Let's Go Bike Singapore tour. Nice! Enjoyed biking but also the chance to see the gardens and have a nice rest in a lovely spot."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens - Well worth a walk around,5.0,,Enjoy a walk through the gardens - it will be well worth it to take in the many planting types to be found in the region and able to grow in the climate.
,,Huge tropical gardens,5.0,,"One of the most fantastic Botanic Gardens that I've ever visited, it covers a huge area perhaps a forty minute walk from The Orchard downtown area. The Orchid garden is certainly well worth a visit with the most extraordinary collection. Funnily enough the meal that I had in their automated restaurant was fantastic too. If you have time it might well be worth spending most of a day there seeing the whole gardens."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This has been a heritage site and rightly so. Its an absolute must visit on your next trip to Singapore.
,,Immaculate public space,4.0,,These gardens are easy to reach by MRT and entrance is free to the main gardens. They are immaculately maintained with botanical names featuring in the planted areas. Most of the garden is a UNESCO site. Very pleasant afternoon visit and I was lucky to see a monitor lizard
,,Wow!,5.0,,A great addition to Singapore's many attractions.Very popular at night and long waiting times for queues to the towers were worth it to experience the spectacular sound and light show. Don't miss it!
,,A must see,5.0,,"Let me just say, your trip to Singapore won’t be complete without visiting The Singapore Botanical Gardens. This heritage listed site is absolutely amazing. The orchid garden is also highly recommend. There is a $5 admission to the orchid garden, the botanical gardens are free admission. My recommendation is, the gardens cover a large area and to see everything will take you 3 to 5 hours. Take a bottle of water, there’s plenty of fresh chilled water refill stations located around the gardens. Wearing comfortable shoes is a must. There are several cafes and restaurants located within the gardens that offer reasonably priced meals. The gardens are easily accessible by the MRT. Apart from that enjoy yourself."
,,Short visit but wow...,4.0,,We didn't have a lot of time in Singapore itself as we were leaving here for a cruise so wanted to see all the places that had been recommended to us.. this one we heard about from various people so decided to do a quick visit when we could.... Have to say next time we're there will definitely spend more time here...
,,Nice gardens,4.0,,"Easy to reach, nice display of various groups of plants. Everything tidy and cared for. Bonsai are very impressive, orchid garden as well. The giant tiger orchid was not in blossom, unfortunately. The others are incredible. A must for orchid lovers"
,,Remarkable vegetation - and history,5.0,,"We had booked a small tour (through Viator) which turned out to be two of us. Our very good guide showed us all the highlights and explained their place in the history of the country.
Best to visit towards the end of the day or evening. You might miss some humidity!"
,,"Immaculate, tranquil, astounding",5.0,,"This place is open really early in the morning and late into the evening. I think locals must use it a lot for jogging and recreation. It is over 158 years old so very (very) well established trees and plantings. Such a variety. It is huge but easy to navigate with maps and signage. Also excellent wide footpaths suitable for wheelchairs/prams and those with mobility issues. Quite a few seats dotted around for when you need a rest. Recommend coming early in the morning when it is cooler (assuming you are a tourist from a more temperate climate like myself and not used to heat and humidity). There is an MRT station at the north eastern corner and good bus stops around the outside. If you take a taxi, make sure you know which entrance you want to go to as there are several entrances all around the gardens. We went to the main entrance and got a map. Great details. If you enjoy walking in gardens, you could easily spend 2 hours wandering around. The rainforest display and National Orchid Garden are definite musts as well as the Swan Lake. Amazingly well-maintained and immaculate. A definite must if you want somewhere to escape the hustle and bustle of the city too."
,,Well worth the trip,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens and free to get in. its worth paying for entry to the orchid garden, i think was 2 bucks each."
,,Fantastic orchids,4.0,,"These gardens have the most fabulous foliage it has bamboo corners and ferneries, rainforest walks and the National orchid garden."
,,Well worth visiting!,5.0,,Had a lovely day out at the botanical gardens. Sun was shining and the gardens were beautiful. Colours were amazing. Great day out and would return if given the chance.
,,Beautiful and peaceful,5.0,,"Do visit this lovely botanical garden when in Singapore. Easy to reach on the MRT and just so lovely to walk about these beautiful well maintained gardens.

It is used by yoga classes and joggers and what a lovely place to do both.
The lakes are filled with terrapins and large catfish as well as carp. Lilly pads cover areas of the ponds. Huge trees with birds calling and flying about. Cycads, cacti, bonsai and a large variety of palms and many many other trees.

We visited the orchid garden for a small price and it has a stunning array of orchid species. A must to see.

Think this is the best botanical garden I have ever visited."

,,One of my Favorite Place,5.0,,"This is a great place for picnic with lunch package, mat and some drink(no alcohol tho). Free entrance(unless you wanna visit The National Orchid Garden). You could take MRT from the Circle Line(yellow colour line) and stop at Botanic Garden station. Good for photo shoot as well such as pre-wedding, so there is a spot called The Grand Stand which is kind of white gazebo with the climbing plants. You could spend a whole day exploring this place."
,,Huge and Beautiful,5.0,,"Botanical gardens

This was the first place I wanted to visit as I live in the Middle East I miss greenery and flowers. It was free and on the tour bus route. The optional orchid garden was $5 extra. It was very nice, well kept and I loved it. I only saw about 1/4 of the gardens due to time restrictions. Wish I could have stayed longer. I was a little disappointed at the bonsai garden. It took me ages to find it and it wasn’t very big when I got there. Much better display at the Chinese gardens (reviewed separately). Its still a lovely place to visit if you like gardens and parks"
,,So good and enhanced,5.0,,Whenever we stay in Singapore we make sure we are in walking distance of these wonderful gardens. Nothing nicer than an early morning walk to and thru the gardens followed by breakfast in the open air restaurant. Now there is even more to see since they have opened up the adjacent forest to the west and uncovered a marsh land and built extensive elevated walkways. Such a great experience
,,The most nice botanical garden ever,5.0,,"I'm returning There every time I travel through Singapore or 1-2 per year
This place is fantastic and the orchids garden just a must
You really relax from the hassle ofthis city and you always learn something new
I wish this garden will remain like it for very long as green places in Singapore are a rarity soon"
,,Beautiful....,4.0,,Great way to spend a relaxing afternoon. Good service by the staff and beautiful surroundings. Would recommend taking the shuttle tour if you are not a keen walker.
,,Beautiful & Relaxing,5.0,,We spent a morning in this fabulous garden. It is big and obviously well kept. The orchid display was beautiful with a huge amount of effort put in to present these flowers to the public. It’s big and you could spend days there. Visit early in the morning as it’s starts getting hot approaching midday.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"We visited the botanical gardens and were surprised at what a large area there was to see and so many varieties of flowers, trees, shrubs etc. The gardens themselves are free to enter but we paid the extra $5 to enter the orchid garden. This is extraordinarily so many variations of orchid and set out so well. I would definitely recommend a visit"
,,Remarkable...a must for those who enjoy horticulture,3.0,,We had a really interesting time here. It was reasonably easy to walk around and lots to see. I think that if you’re not too interested in plants etc it could be a wasted trip...do something else. Very hot and humid though as is all of Singapore.
,,Nice walk in the park,4.0,,"It was a really hot day when we visited, but still the gardens were nice to walk around. Definitely go here before Gardens by the Bay, otherwise you'll be underwhelmed here. We enjoyed especially the turtles swimming in the lakes."
,,Orchids and incredible trees,5.0,,"Amazing orchids, beautiful gardens. Well worth the visit. Bit of a wait for a cab on a Sunday when leaving otherwise a very pleasant afternoon."
,,Just wonderful!,5.0,,"We went to the gardens as a stop on the Hop on/Hop off bus. The gardens are immense and one could easily spend an entire day here. We focused on the National Orchid as it was easily done within our time constraints. It was sensational; so many varieties, colors and sizes. It is well laid out and the pathways meander throughout the garden.
Great gift shop and washrooms located at the entrance. There is an entrance fee for the Orchid Garden (only $1 for seniors)."
,,Fab time in the botanic gardens,5.0,,Went to the botanic gardens spent 3 hours looking around it was absolutely fantastic the orchid garden was lovely
,,"Stunning, peaceful experience",5.0,,"The Singapore transit system, either bus or tube is great to reach this garden. Beautiful inside. The orchid garden is well worth paying a little extra for. There are numerous cafés inside as well which offers very good snack. Definitely add to your list of things to do here."
,,Sky Park Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"Best time to visit is Oct.Nov.Dec..September was a bit hot and Humid.The Botanical Gardens are a must see.Very huge and beautiful.Every variety of plant and flowers.Couldn’t believe my eyes.Being a garden lover myself ,this was unbelievable .Plants and flowers were huge in size.Very well taken care of.Lots to see ,your mouth stay open most of the time.Wow.Describe it.Did’nt want to live from their.Camera for lots of pictures.Large garden,so carry plenty of water,and walking shoes.Comfortable shoes.Nice tourist shop for Souvineours.Food."
,,Beautiful space and orchids,5.0,,Wonderful space in the city. The ordchid garden is spectacular and the garden truly is alive from day to dusk. Quiet corners to be found everywhere for some peace and quiet and heady scents abound. Wonderful.
,,Fantastic experience which must not be missed,5.0,,"For me the city of Singapore itself is quite a boring and sterile environment full of modern skyscrapers and little history or culture.
One jewel in the City is the Botanical Gardens which must not be missed and is free to get into. Never in the world have I seen to many beautiful orchids and walking through the gardens you almost feel like you are in Paradise or another world with these wonderful plants growing everywhere in the open air.
The garden has one orchid which is named after our disastrous former UK Prime Minister David Cameron. I'm glad to report that the orchid seems to be withering on the vine much the same as his reputation and career post his disastrous decision to have a Brexit vote!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The gardens is immense and one of a kind. Has a museum within, and the information center lady was extremely helpful, giving me tips about not just the gardens but Singapore in general."
,,A unique site,4.0,,Taxi ride from the city and you must go to the Orchid Garden. Can be hot though and walking must be taken slowly with water stop offs at the cafe's
,,"Great activity, beautiful scenery.",5.0,,"Highly recommend this place to visit in Singapore. The scenery is magnificent and the park is very well kept.
There are so many different plants, flowers to see. They even have a rainforest inside ;)
At the lake you can feed turtles, they are super cute.
The entrance is completely free but to enter the Orchids garden you need to pay $5 unless you are a student or Singaporean than it's free.
The park is about 2.5km but you can spend there 3-4hrs easily.
My only recommendation is to take water and some snacks with you as it's very expensive inside.
Have a great day!"
,,A paradise for exoic plant lovers.,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens do the city proud and provide not only a habitat for plantlife but many other forms of wildlife also. The place is alive with birdsong, frogs, crickets and squirrels to name but a few. We spent a day there enjoying a very good lunch as well as looking at the National Orchid Garden. Highly recommended!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"The botanical garden of Singapore is fantastic, clean as everything in the city and very well managed. The trees are huge, the lakes very nice and you have restaurants inside . The visit is free . Must be visited"
,,Wonderful garden :Well protect and excellent Orchid Garden,5.0,,"A UNESCO heritage site.This is a must visit for traveller.It show how natural environment is so important to Singaporean.
It has Orchid garden.I never seen so much variety of orchids at one place.I fell so blessed to see such a beautiful & colourful place.
It has a beautiful Swan lake.The lake is well maintained and you fell like to spend whole day.
The whole experience is so good that I like to visit this place again and again whenever I shall visit Singapore."
,,I love it,5.0,,"This is a huge garden. I love walking, exploring this garden very clean. They have a lot of collection here. This place also convenient because the entrance just exactly in front of MRT station (botanic garden station)"
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"In my opinion this is a must do! The gardens are second to none that I have seen before. The orchid garden is a definite too, worth the $5 entry pp. Allow a couple of hours easy to explore!"
,,Head for the Orchid Gardens.,5.0,,"We arrived at the Botanical Gardens MRT station late morning and by early afternoon it was extremely hot and humid.

The paths were flat an even but very undulating. The gardens themselves are well kept but really this is just a large park with a couple of lakes.

The Orchid Garden is the Jewel in the Crown. The rest of the park is missable but not the Orchid Gardens. They are a
""must do"" on your trip to Singapore.

Good shoes, light clothing, water and sun hats are must have items."
,,Check it out for Team building activity in April,4.0,,Great location for Team building for our company activity. Great little areas where u can gather a group of people to have an activity or game.
,,WONDERFUL - WELL WORTH A VISIT,5.0,,"Wonderful botanic gardens - well,worth a visit. And, apart from the Orchid Garden, entrance is free."
,,Singapore Botanical Garden,5.0,,"An early start to visit the Botanical Garden is highly recommended. It's an amazing and breathtaking experience. Don't miss the Orchid garden. If you're a senior, over 60, ask for a senior price, $1 Vs $5. It worked for us and we're foreigners! Make sure you have enough storage on your phone or camera, as one cannot resist to click away...."
,,One of the best,5.0,,"Really loved these gardens, great range of plants, beautifully landscaped and cared for, great sculptures and also saw lots of wildlife which was an added bonus. Definitely up there as one of the best botanical gardens I've visited. Loved the concept of the healing garden. Worth the short taxi ride, allow half a day, cafes on site."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"It was a very humid day and we were with our infant in a stroller, but still, definitely worthwhile."
,,Exquisite!,5.0,,"I only wish I had more time to leisurely stroll through the gardnens. It was so amazing, gorgeous, mesmerizing and incredibly relaxing -- like a dream, truly!"
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,"Singapore is one of thos cities that is doing things right. Singapore is clean, but be warned there are strict laws against people chewing gum or spitting, and other things. Not to mention it's pretty expensive in Singapore.

None the less, it's a great city to explore and enjoy the scenery. This is just one of the places to check out in Singapore. Also, if you are not a fan of the heat and humidity, Singapore is not your place.

Looking forward to my next visit there."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,A wonderful place to visit. You could spend hours walking around admiring everything. Easy to get to via the Singapore MTR. Take a packed lunch as buying food from the shops in the park isn’t cheap.
,,Interesting free entry gardens to walk through on your way to the Orchid Garden,4.0,,Really interesting gardens with a taste of jungle which we walked through from the Botanic Garden MRT station. There's a lake with turtles & fish and plant collections such as bourganvillea. Also places for refreshments but take water along and put on sun screen and wear a hat.
,,Tranquil,4.0,,Take a lovely walk in these gardens which are free it is well laid out will take at 2hrs to walk the gardens. The Orchid element has a fee.
,,"Beautiful, just beautiful",5.0,,"Unfortunately, we picked quite a hot day to visit the Singapore Botanical Gardens, so the kids got slightly weary, but there was so much to do and the Orchid Garden was well worth a visit. I’ve never seen so many different orchids!

Beautiful grounds and a good day out."
,,A must see if you have time while in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a huge park with tons of trees, shrubs, streams, lot's of bench's to sit on and a wonderful Orchid garden, another must see!"
,,Accidental lovely find,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens that even the rain couldn't spoil. Found by accident when on the hop on hop bus and got it mixed up with the gardens by the bay! 2 very different experiences, this is all outdoors and is split into different gardens. Took around 3 hours to go around but has little ""photo points"" where you can take your selfies or photos in beautiful backdrops. Can't believe this is free to visit (except the orchid garden, see separate review). There was a bride there too having pics taken, can't imagine a more gorgeous place for wedding photos."
,,Stunning gardens - a lovely place to stroll,5.0,,"My wife recommended that I come here on my first (business) trip to Singapore. My schedule was pretty packed, but I took an uber from my hotel to here early morning, to beat the traffic, and find somewhere for breakfast. I'm so glad I did - there is such a feeling of tranquility and peace, but also such vibrant colours, so much greenery, and lovely noises of the birds. I saw such interesting things - orchids, drones being tested, whole gaggles of people engaged in group yoga and mystical martial arts. If I lived here, I would be here every single day."
,,Nature's Eye-Candy,5.0,,"There are two pavilions and although we recommend both, we liked the flowers better. Time your visit based on anticipated crowds...go early. Alternatively, make it a later afternoon, have dinner at Marina Bay, and then hang around for the evening in the Gardens by The Bay which is lighted in a spectacular way. Look for news regarding eveing laser light shows."
,,Most beautiful place in Singapore,4.0,,"In a crowded modern city famed for skyscrapers, the Botanic Gardens are spectacular, a marvelous experience. The collection of orchids is the best in the world. It is a sweet surprise to find such a vast expanse of manicured green."
,,Superb Botanical Gardens and park.,5.0,,"You must go and spend at least half a day there. They are huge, fascinating, beautiful, obviously very humid, lots of wildlife, restaurants and cafes."
,,Even has its own railway station,4.0,,"The train station is on one end of the gardens so you have to walk through the gardens to get to near the other end for the orchard gardens it’s a fair hike on a hot though. What we saw of the gardens would lead you to go back again if we had the time, well maintained and designed worth a trip but make sure you go to the orchid gardens though they are stunning"
,,Mandatory to visit if you are in Singapore,5.0,,"An excellent, very large botanical garden, which is also free to visit. Here is Orchid garden, and the very interesting part - a walk in the Rainforest. I think the garden is more interesting than the artificial Gardens by the Bay."
,,A break from the concrete jungle,4.0,,"Beautiful garden consisting of greenery, a good break from the concrete jungle. Be sure to bring along mosquito repellent if you plan to have a picnic or even just sit around. It will be good to pack a bottle of iced cold water to combat Singapore's hot and humid climate as the water sold at the drinks kiosk is often not cold enough due to it not being left long enough in the chiller."
,,Peaceful,4.0,,"Very beautiful walk. It’s crazy that this is in the middle of a city. If you’re looking for something relaxing and a good way to stretch, highly recommend. Please note the orchid gardens cost money — well worth it!"
,,Don't visit after you've seen Gardens By the Bay,3.0,,"My biggest recommendation would be to visit this first THEN visit Gardens by the Bay. I came here after and found it underwhelming, which I really didn't think I would.

The Botanical Gardens is much quieter than Gardens by the Bay which is flooded with tourist.

I caught the MRT and explored for around an hour on the side closest to MRT, I didn't get to see the other side so maybe there is more to explore over there. I would have loved to have been able to see the Healing Gardens but it was quite a distance from the MRT station.

Wear good walking shoes as there is a good distance to cover.

Had breakfast at the Bees Knees Garage - awesome."
,,Good for a walk,4.0,,It may be a little too humid and hot for those who do not like the weather in Singapore. But it was a pretty chill place to take a walk.
,,Nice Gardens,4.0,,"Plenty to see, lots of tranquil walking.
MRT takes you right there cheap as chips and very quick.
Take some water with you as you will be walking a lot and can get quite still and humid in the summer months.
Note: It is an undulating area, some pathways are reasonably steep so keep your level of fitness in mind."
,,Go early in the morning,5.0,,"This is a World Heritage site popular with locals and tourists alike. And for good reason -- it is an oasis of quiet sanity in the concrete of Singapore. World class botanical garden with clear explanations in English -- the huge draw of the Orchid Garden (separate admission fee) is about a half-mile walk from the MRT. If you start early, the cooler temperature will add to the enjoyment."
,,A few hours of delight,5.0,,Many individual gardens from different countries exhibiting species and information. A wonderful waterfall cascading down where you can climb to the top - or take the lift. The aroma as you walk around the gardens are really something special.
,,"Boatnic gardens, a Singapore must visit",5.0,,The gardens are extensive with excellent places to eat. Entrance is free but there is small charge for the Orchid garden which is worth it.
,,Botanical Treasure,4.0,,Spent most of the afternoon looking around and found it very relaxing and quiet. Rainforest walk was very good particularly. Orchid Gatden partly closed off - a shame really. David H.
,,That's how a Botanic Garden is supposed to look like.,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our long stroll through the Botanic Garden, there is so much to see! Everything is - what else to expect in Singapore - nice and tidy. A must see in this city and one of the nicest parks we have ever been to!
(Handy hint after a long flight and / or jet lag: Go there, acclimatize and relax!)"
,,Fell in love with this place,5.0,,A short journey on the underground and clear directions leads to the beautiful Singapore Botanic Gardens. It was an extremely hot day when we visited but we managed to walk around the majority of the gardens. The flowers and plants are so beautiful and well looked after. We paid the entrance fee for the National Orchid Centre and it was worth every penny. Plenty of toilets throughout- all well looked after. Lots of eateries although we just purchased a snack and drink. Take some water with you to keep hydrated!!
,,A must see,4.0,,In the middle of a vibrant city a wonderful botanic garden. You can get lost in this tropical paradise. Easy to get to on the metro. Go in the morning while it is cool.
,,Excellent Garden and very vast!,5.0,,"At the far end of the orchard road, you find the botanical garden and you can keep half a day (4 hrs) to cover the whole garden including the Orchard garden. So I find it worth the time among the other attractions that Singapore has to offer. Do visit this place if you are doing a week longSingapore vacation."
,,Beautifully laid out,5.0,,"I visited the Botanical Gardens basically without high expectations, but I was totally wrong. The gardens are stunning and there is so much to see. If you have any interest at all in gardens this is an absolute ""must see"" in Singapore and a visit to that city would be incomplete without a visit to the Botanical Gardens."
,,Amazing and very well organized,5.0,,Amazing and very well organized Botanic Garden. The Orchid Exhibition is fabulous. Never seen so many orchids at once.
,,Stunning gardens and maintained to a high standard,5.0,,"The flowers and landscapes in the Botanic Gardens Singapore are stunning, and mostly free of charge, only a small additional charge for the Orchid Garden, which contains so many varieties of orchids. There are a few cafes and seating areas to rest at along the way."
,,Perfect green oasis for running and relaxing admist busy city life,5.0,,"Runners, walkers, and dog-walkers can appreciate this lovely Botanic Gardens with its sprawling landscape, as well as its rich flora and fauna.

,,One of the best,5.0,,"I love the Botanic Gardens, they have something for everyone.

There is also everything from...More"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Miles of sculptured gardens. Great wildlife, great flora you could look around for days. We were walking along the manicured paths when a huge lizard walked across the footpath. Go to the orchid garden, well worth seeing. Great experience."
,,Lungs of Singapore,5.0,,"Though singapore is very green thru the country , Botanical Garden created in 1859 stands out as the maintenance and care with which each nook and corner of the Garden is Nurtured, has no parallel else where. It’s amazing and refreshing to have walk thru...More"

,,Beautiful gardens & the orchids are amazing,4.0,,If you visit Singapore you really should gi here. We spent about 2 hours walking through the botanical gardens it's big & there's a lot to see.

,,Family bonding,4.0,,"We had great time at Singapore Botanical garden. We went there early Saturday morning. We saw many people walking, jogging, brought their dogs for a walk and even families with young children having picnic. There were many trees and plants with rare flowers. We went...More"
,,"Walk of Giants, Singapore Botanic Gardens",5.0,,The Botanic Gardens has undergone progressive updates inclusive of new sections with interest themes. Do take the time to visit the Walk of Giants in the Learning Forest in which kids can play on the well appointed natural fiber 'trampolenes' that wrap around 2 trees. Nice to do so in the morning when it's not too sunny.
,,wonderfully calm place,5.0,,take a walk there away from the hectic city life and find tranquilly - highly recommended amble amongst the tress
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens - a must visit,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2015. The 82 hectare garden founded in 1822 has a very rich history including that the gardens pioneered the techniques for rubber (latex) from the rubber trees.
It is a MUST visit site when you are in Singapore. The gardens are daily from 5am to 12 midnight and there is no entrance fees (but there is an entrance fees for visiting the National Orchid Gardens inside the Botanic Gardens. If you are a free and easy visitor, take the Mass Rapid Train to Botanic Gardens station and the entrance to the gardens is just at one of the exits. You can also enter from the Tanglin Gate Entrance which is off Napier Road - any buses ply that Road.
The Gardens caters for the needs of various people - from early in the morning - for the joggers and group of people doing exercises; later in the morning - you will see family walking with their dogs and children feeding the fishes in the ponds. you will see people just strolling in the various parts of the garden at every time of the day - some making walking trails - some casually strolling to soak in the atmosphere."
,,Great place to hang out,5.0,,"Love visiting the Botanic Gardens, especially given that it's free! It's a nice place to stroll around but best to visit on a day that's not too hot and not raining. Plenty of room for kids to run about, plenty of free areas (herb garden etc) as well as the (not free) National Orchid Garden. On an ideal day, it's an ideal place for a picnic gathering!"
,,Lovely garden,5.0,,"Am very proud of Singapore Botanic Gardens, full of heritage trees, beautiful flowers especially orchids and constantly improving to give all visitors the most pleasant experience!"
,,My Favourite Place in Singapore,5.0,,"This is most possibly my favourite place in Singapore. It's beautiful with lakes in big open spaces. Nature provided and man cultivated the landscape...everyone here is in a good mood. Free for all to enjoy. Families, couples, friends, kids, dogs, picnics, free concerts, huge 200 year old trees, flowers and plants of so many types, swans, monitor lizards, fish, terrapins - it almost feels like Heaven."
,,Good place for a family picnic or walks,5.0,,"At times you may also see people doing Taiji in the morning. It’s very relaxing for walks and if you look at the plants closely, they are tags with breed and types. Good for kids to understand the various types of tropical plant species.
The orchid garden is also highly recommended."
,,Excellent grounds,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens is a great place to go for a stroll, exercise, meditate or just simply enjoy the beautiful and wide variety of flora and fauna."
,,Relaxing walk,5.0,,"Beautiful grpunds with lakes with swans, fish and turtles;, gardens and covered seating areas. very nice for walking, reading, day out for everyone. a variety of cafes and food available."
,,Very scenic and awesome,5.0,,"I was with my family in February this year. I enjoyed everything, everything was regular, clean, and carefully decorated. The pigeons were in few steps and they did not escape from them at all. If I go back to Singapore again, I'll go there."
,,Lots of open air things to see,5.0,,"These gardens are amazing. They have a few animals you can spot while going around and lots lots of plants. The gardens are very orderely taking care of and in case there is too much sun you can always sit in one of the many covered gazeboes. Oh, and its completely free!"
,,Nature's story just gets better in Singapore,5.0,,"This extensive varied and well organised garden complex is….free to enter! It is surely one of the best attractions in Singapore and well worth a visit...and, over the years, it just gets better! Even a visit to the Orchid Garden within the complex is just $5 ($1 for Seniors from anywhere in the world).

Access to this UNESCO World Heritage Site is easy, via all sorts of transportation, but the most simple is the Singapore Underground (SMRT) which has a station immediately outside the Bukit Gate entrance and another at the other end of the garden, relatively nearby at Orchard Road ((Tanglin Entrance). My recommendation is via the Bukit Gate and simply walking a round trip incorporating all the main features of the gardens and returning to the same Station, this would be a walk of several kilometres but so worth it. There are rest rooms and food outlets throughout the gardens and there is a very good map available at the entrance, although signage is also good.

The pathways are easy walking, including disabled access slopes throughout. There are various themes to the gardens, but one of my favourites is the Evolution Garden, a well posted trip to the origins of the planet from a natural perspective – just don’t expect many flowers there!. In contrast, the fragrant garden is a sensory experience, the healing garden informative and the Palm Valley spectacular. However the jewel in the crown is undoubtedly the largest Orchid Garden in the world. It is simply wonderful, displaying over 1000 species and 200 hybrids…I defy you to agree on a single favourite…you will find many.

All garden themes are well laid out, spacious and it is easy to lose the crowds, even on the Sunday of the Chinese New Year. Of all the gardens in the world, and we have visited many, this is a “must”. Hope you enjoy it as much as we have."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"A place I go regularly particularly to photograph birds. Hornbills, sunbirds, kingfishers, woodpeckers, red legged crake & drongos amongst the many species there. National Orchid Garden,Heritage trees & heliconias a big draw too."
,,Probably the most beautiful gardens in all my travels,5.0,,"I am never tired of this place, great place for a relaxing stroll, light workout or just laying about. Beautiful open spaces for energetic kids to roam about, it’s a place where I let my kids do all the rough and tumbling stuff without unduly worry."
,,Great Place to Spend an Afternoon,5.0,,"I some time most weekends walking with one or more of my kids in the Botanic Gardens. Its great to get your steps in, and you never run out of things to learn. If you are lucky you will even see a Monitor Lizard or two. Most trees and plants are documented so reading and learning a must. Its one of our favourite outdoor places to visit in Singapore."
,,UNESCO? only barely make its mark,3.0,,"While it is amazing that this place has quite alot of species (esp trees and plants , not so much of spices n herbs)in this Rainforest including the hard to spot - Monkey Pot, Sapucaia-nut trees, it has not much of other wow factors
U must set aside 1-2hours to explore the various areas of this gardens, from the cactus to the area on ginger (so good to explore from one gate to the other gate/exit)
YOU have to be a nature lover or someone into gardening in order to appreciate this place and it is quiet and peaceful (good for books reading or simple picnic)

It houses the National Orchid Garden which is worth a visit (pls see my review separately) and I noticed that travellors rate this gardens high due to the good scoring given to the Orchid Garden instead"
,,Pleasant,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is good fun for weekend trip. It is well maintained and centrally located. It often has activities over the weekend. However, I do think It is somewhat overrated a tourist destination. It can be tiring too as it involves a lot of walk within the garden."
,,Love the wide and spacious gardens,5.0,,Beautiful gardens. Very spacious and easy for strollers. Good for photo taking. There’s free concert on weekends too.
,,Spectacular botanical gardens. One of the best in the world.,5.0,,"Words cannot describe. The architecture, the displays, just the overall experience is magnificent. Highly recommended. Not to be missed if you like flowers and plants."
,,Great time with young kids,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the Botanic Gardens. Highly recommend the Children’s gardens...make sure you bring bathing suits so the kiddos can enjoy the spray park. Suggest hitting the Adam Road Food Center for breakfast or a meal top off before the park, it’s right by the northern entrance."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"We spent a Sunday morning wandering around the botanical gardens & orchid gardens, despite being warned it would be busy they were an oasis of tranquillity. Beautiful, interesting & immaculately maintained I'd say these are a must see if you're in Singapore."
,,A Zen of an Outing,5.0,,"Came here with my wife on our last day in Singapore and was definitely worth the visit. For $5 Singh dollars, one gets to explore the roaming gardens of various flowers with the highlight being the various species of orchids displayed."
,,One of my favourite places on earth,5.0,,I love the Botanical Gardens. They are immaculate and a beautiful green place to visit in the heart of Singapore. The Orchid garden is only $5 SGD and at every turn you are accosted by the most amazing displays and perfect borders. Some exhibits are currently closed off while they construct (what looks to be) a sort of mini Gardens by the Bay Mist Dome. Which means only one thing- I will need to come back to see it! Fantastic visit.
,,Fantastic gardens and it's free!,5.0,,"Very impressive botanical gardens and no entry fee. (Although there is a small charge for the orchid collection).
Easy to get to by bus or MRT.
A peaceful escape from the city. One could easily spend all day here.
The highlights for me were the orchids and the palm collection."
,,Awesome exprience,5.0,,"Chosen to enter these delightful gardens by the Tanglin Gate on counsel of a Trip Advisor commentator and in this manner took the MRT to Orchard Road. There were no headings to the greenery enclosures from that point and we tragically walked on an exceptionally hot, muggy day and had we understood how far it was would have taken a transport! The patio nurseries themselves were well worth going by, exceptionally well laid out and kept up with lavish greenery and were anything but difficult to walk around. The summit of our excursion was a visit to the Orchard Garden which was a flat out happiness. Having got single MRT tickets we could leave the garden and come back from the Botanic Gardens MRT station. The Tanglin Gate is a decent proposal yet do take the transport!"
,,a pleasant oasis,4.0,,"Really enjoyed wandering round the different parts of the garden. Particularly liked the part showing the evolution of plants, the rainforest and the wetlands area. A lovely oasis. The herbs and spices area was a little disappointing. No charge apart from the orchid garden."
,,Worldwide top!,5.0,,"With the astounding Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro, the Botanical Garden of Singapore is a true marvel to visit: So artistically arranged, perfectly maintained, it is the ultimate location in busy Singapore for a nice relaxing day full of natural wonders... Do not miss the orchid garden, do not miss it!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Explored all the range of different environments in the gardens and found it great place to escape hustle and bustle of Singapore. Great for birds and wildlife. Must see!
,,Magnificent orchids,5.0,,"Don’t miss the national orchid garden at Singapore’s beautifully maintained Botanic gardens. We didn’t have time to cover all the gardens, however we did take a walk through the trees to see the orchids which are magnificent. Never would have guessed there are so many varieties. We visited on a Tuesday and parked easily, no crowds, plenty of seating around the gardens. A good place to see and hear various birds.

Saw a couple of places for refreshments and shop featuring various orchid souvenirs."
,,Serene,5.0,,I'd come back to this place to jog and just to unwind. It's beautiful and the staff are very helpful.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Went on a very hot day , MRT right outside the park so no long walk to it. The whole place is amazing and perfectly tidy , no drunks or weirdos like in a park in the UK. Don't miss it when visiting Singapore"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A huge area that showcase great attention to fine details. No picture could do the scenary justice. If going with small kids, take a stroller."
,,Escape the city,5.0,,If you find the tall skyscrapers overpowering a visit to the Botanic Gardens is a wonderful retreat. The gardens are very well maintained and the flowering exhibits absolutely beautiful.
,,Popular Public Park,5.0,,"I used to visit here as a child and it remains a lovely place to visit. Entrance is free apart from for the Orchid collection which should not be missed. A great public park popular with families, joggers, dogwalkers and tourists alike. There is a rainforest walk and various different sections dedicated to particular plants and trees. The orchid selection is simply stunning. A real feast for the eyes. There are places to buy drinks and snacks. It can take a bit of time to get a taxi when you are finished. There is a stand where you wait. There is a number to call which we had no success with and a button to press to alert taxis on the road outside that someone is waiting. We had a wait of about 15 minutes."
,,"What a wonderful, tranquil place.....",4.0,,"A great place for a mornings (or afternoon) stroll .... no charge for getting in but the Orchid Gardens cost $5 per person and are well worth it. Seems a great place for various groups doing tai chi, yoga and several other classes in a great setting. Just a lovely place.

Also went for an early lunch at the Fusion Restaurant at the main gate and - once we got over the ordering system the food was good, fresh cooked, loads of choice and pretty reasonably priced."
,,Peace and tranquility just outside the bustling city.,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens were initiated by Singapore’s founder, Stamford Raffles, then a young officer of the East India Company, just three years after stepping foot on the island. It later blossomed into the centre for rubber and orchid experimentation leading to the development of the region’s rubber industry and Singapore as a leading orchid exporter. Today its Herbarium, housing over 750,000 specimens, and lab facilities are at the forefront of orchid hybridisation, and research in the region’s vast horticultural and agricultural resources.

In 2015 the Botanic Gardens was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Occupying a sprawling 82 hectare patch on the edge of the city, it has three entry/exit points with convenient links by bus and MRT.

The main attractions are:

5. The Swan Lake, home to a bevy of white swans

6. Symphony Lake, an open-air concert venue with band and orchestral performances from its waterside bandstand.

7. Several English style pavilions where weary walkers can seek respite.

,,Brilliant place,5.0,,"We always visit the gardens. It really is a wonderful place to walk about. Refreshment places are good and the gardens are beautifully laid out. Great place to see the local birds. Plenty of nice spots to sit and enjoy and there are speciality spots like the orchid gardens,"
,,Best in the World,5.0,,This was our second visit and we had forgotten just how beautiful the Botanic Gardens are and how well tended. We always make a point of visiting botanic gardens in our travels and this ranks right at the top of the list. With the high afternoon temperatures we visited in the morning ending up with lunch at one of the many restaurants. We decided to go back a second day as we realised we had only seen half and we visited the less established northern side of the gardens which can be approached by the Nassim Gate entrance. The orchid garden is one of the stand out features but the calm and relaxed atmosphere with occasional glimpses of wild life make any part of the gardens a must see.
,,Absolutely awesome,5.0,,This Botanic Garden is simply astonishing. It is beautifully designed and it’s really well cared for. Very clean and plenty benches and resting/halting places. For me - one of the most beautiful places in the world. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Top Ten to do in Singapore. Top 5 runs/walks!,5.0,,"Great for a run or a walk. Beautiful, Peaceful, Relaxing, Smoke FREE!, Bike free, (you can bike there and then walk or run around the gardens), lots of picture taking. I really liked the elevated wooden walkway as it puts you into the understory. The lake, the paths, the quiet areas. It was not busy when I was there but there were picnickers, runners, photographers, walkers, gardeners, guides, etc. Definitely going again. Soak up that humidity!!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"A historic location for Singapore, with some amazing trees and other plants to see. Apparently this is the location where the rubber tree was first bred in its commercial form.

There is a short ""rainforest walk"" and - this being Singapore - it's even accessible to those using wheelchairs or buggies!"
,,Nice gardens,3.0,,"Nice gardens, but not too interesting for kids. Our 8-year old liked the swanlake and the swinging benches, but she couldn’t reallly appreciate the plants and trees. However, we would recommend this for people who visit without kids."
,,Hot but worth it!,5.0,,"Beautiful and huge. Pace yourself but try to stroll round everything. Great raised walkways, rain forest, fabulous palms and spectacular orchid garden. Free apart from the orchids."
,,What a great place!,5.0,,"What a beautiful place, in the middle of Singapore, the greenery is just beautiful, and the variety of plants. Love the peace and tranquility"
,,Appreciated By Specific People,3.0,,"I visited the Botanic Gardens as one half of the Marina Bay Gardens tour. It was incredible to be inside and be surrounded by so such a beautiful array of plant life, and so neatly organized at that! However, since I do not know much about flowers, I'm sure I didn't appreciate it as much as I could have. Definitely worth the visit though!"
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"Beautiful setting. So many different areas to explore. Lovely cafes. We didn’t have enough time to explore all the gardens, so will be going back next time we’re in Singapore."
,,So much of interest to see and take in.,4.0,,"To do justice to the Botanic Gardens you really need to commit to a sizeable chunk of time.....we were unable due give it our full commitment largely because of the heat. What we did manage to see was wonderful, with lots of very informative summaries at different points.

The are very good food outlets within the Gardens which help you to ""split"" the visit when it is very hot outside."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,Its so lovely place. We saw many beautiful things there. beautiful moment it was. Next time will go there again.
,,A Garden you could spend a week in and not see it all.,5.0,,"One of the finest Public gardens in the World - this is top class in every respect. Free to enter and lots of places to stop off as you weak round, for water and the loo."
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"I really liked this place. A meticulously maintained garden with a beautiful diversity of flora to enjoy. The layout of the walking path is thoughtfully laid out and basically everything about this place is lovely, relaxing and visually pleasing. Definitely worth your time."
,,One of the best free attractions in Singapore,5.0,,"There aren't many freebies to be had in Singapore but this is one of the best. My husband and I spent a great day out with a friend who brought chicken rice - and which we had a kind of picnic, sitting under the shade of trees, listening to birds singing and butterflies flitting in and out of the sunshine.
You only get charged if you wish to visit the Orchid Garden Centre - which was delightful if you love orchids - but if you are over 60, the price is S$1. Under 60s have to pay $5 entry."
,,Free entry and beautiful gardens,5.0,,This place is great for everyone! If you want a beautiful free day out out I strongly recommend coming here and bringing your camera!
,,Beautiful and well maintained,4.0,,We have visited the botanical gardens many times over the years and love it that there is always a huge selection of blooms in flower so lots of colour especially in the Orchid p
,,A good place to walk and observe.,5.0,,"The gardens can be accessed by bus from the southern end and by MRT and bus from the north. There are other entrances too, but not sure about public transport.

We visited on one of the days when guided rainforest tours were being given, so took breakfast at Adam Rd food centre and joined the 10am tour.

This took us through the rainforest area, which is mainly accessed via slightly elevated walkways. Many of the tree species were pointed out, but they are well labelled even if not on a tour. After the tour we spent an hour or so wandering the gardens, and would have stayed longer but we intended visiting again on another occasion.

We revisited in an evening to take in the orchid garden and then strolled around in the cooler evening. The atmosphere is completely different, with many locals setting up a family picnic on the slope approaching the music stage in the lake. Unfortunately there was no music on our visit, but we had seen the Singapore Symphony Orchestra here on a visit some years ago.

There are plenty of places to top up your water supplies at various locations around the garden. There are signposts to the different areas, and a map is available to aid navigation."
,,Gorgeous Green Space,5.0,,Singapore is lucky to have almost 10% of its land as parklands or reserves. These gardens are well worth a visit. Lots to enjoy as you stroll around this free attraction. If you get lucky you may meet some of the critters who reside here. Huge variety of flora to be seen. Home to the famous Orchid Gardens(entry fee) A favourite with dog walkers.
,,Stunning and historical,5.0,,"Unlike the Gardens by the Bay this place is full of history. Lovely Sunday morning walk around for a couple of hours. Loads to see including the amazing Orchid displays ($5 entry). It’s hot walking around so stay hydrated.

Getting there on MRT is easy but also easy to get a taxi to pick you up."
,,UNESCO World Heritage Site comes alive,5.0,,"For the first time we went by Metro and early to enjoy many birds in the Singapore Botanic Garden, an UNESCO World Heritage Site. For the first time ever we saw two black swans hanging out with some mud turtles. Another first was exploring the Ginger Garden; it's definitely worth doing again. Overall, the signage is good, and you can find welcoming benches. Beware of the runners and many folks like to walk their dogs at this park, especially on a holiday morning or weekend. Thus, we found that an early start meant more birds were sighted, especially in the Orchid Garden. Next time I plan to try one of the many food outlets for a snack or meal. This time I did buy a jar of ginger pineapple jam from the little shop adjacent to the ginger garden that also has coffee, drinks, and snacks. For a fun-filled day do head to this urban oasis."
,,Lush Greenery,5.0,,"Deemed as a UNESCO world heritage site, the Botanical Gardens is a large space of lush greenery spanning across Cluny through Tanglin. The location makes it an ideal place to enjoy peace and serenity while witnessing wild life (iguanas, black/white swans, roosters, etc.) roaming freely within the vicinity. Would definitely visit more often for weekend strolls. Don't forget to pile on the sunscreen and wear light clothing, the tropical heat can be quite unbearable."
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,With half a day I picked up the botanical gardens to visit. The place is spectacular. Anyone will enjoy it. The orchid garden being the best of all. There are so many varieties. The place is well maintained. It's a big park that offers good walk and stretch. I finished the day the going to the deck for a good view of the harbour
,,Spacious wonderful Place,5.0,,"many secret corners and age old trees, including a real jungle, and an evolutionary walk through the ages"
,,Great day out,5.0,,"A wonderful free day out, well worth a day out, wonderful views and plants of all types, easy to naviate"
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,A beautiful piece of tranquility in a hectic city. The gardens were well kept and the paths wide and easily accessed
,,Relaxing,5.0,,Really nice gardens. So many flowers and plants to get lost in. Perfect for a simple stress free moment
,,Mentulang Daun Lebar,5.0,,"What the hell is Mentulang Daun Lebar you are probably wandering?!
Well stick around and I will tell you.

It’s the last tree of its kind. The last one. You will not see it anywhere else in the world.
That alone is the reason to visit Singapore Botanic Gardens.

There are descriptions near some of the trees, and although it sounds a little bit tedious to read all these descriptions, believe me it’s not.

One of great things about Singapore Botanic Gardens is that it is completely free. I mean if you want to see the famous orchid garden you will have to pay the ticket, but everything else is completely free.

Regarding orchid garden - it’s really a sin if you don’t visit it, and ticket will only set you back for 5$. Take also in account that I’m a guy who is telling you that it’s well worth your time if you go look at “some flowers”.

Somewhere in the middle of the gardens there are few interesting restaurants where you can order some of the kind drinks and food is on acceptable level.

The best part of the year to visit the gardens is between June and August, since most of the flowers are blooming in that part of year.

Also if you didn’t know already it’s worth mentioning that Singapore Botanic Gardens are a considered a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

To conclude this review let’s just say that the Gardens are one of those areas which are very hard to describe with words. They are truly something unique and beautiful- so stop waisting your time and go and see them."
,,Futuristic trees,3.0,,"I'm fact, in my opinion, there is not do much to do and see. I would say whole city is touristic trap.
So ""half a loaf is better thank no bread"".
Do you can visit if you have too much time.
Futuristic trees are nice. I liked idea. They aren't so big as you can think lookin' on Photoshop."
,,Botanic Garden,5.0,,Lovely orchid collection. Must visit places in Singapore. Both of us liked it and love to go again. Very big place to walk.
,,Diverse garden with something for everyone,5.0,,"If you love to walk, this is a great place especially the forest walk ... lots of trees and shade. The path is well maintained and easy to walk. There are also open areas for picnics and nice restaurants for dining with nature. Great way to spend a morning."
,,A must visit!,5.0,,Breathe taking! I would recommend a whole day to visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Great gift shop and facilities to get drinks and the toilets were spotless with great views!
,,Fantastic by day and magic by night!,5.0,,"This botanical garden is absolutely amazing. There are so many corners and areas to experience, it can never grow old. At night, the park is also open and masterfully lit, and there are very few people, the atmosphere is really magic."
,,Stunning trip through time,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a fantastic way to spend a relaxing morning, and give you a chance to learn about the history of the world's flora. The orchids are absolutely beautiful."
,,Nice place for a walk,5.0,,This is a great place for a walk. The area is very wide and the entrance is free. Only the orchid garden charges for entrance (5SGD) but it’s worth visiting as the abundance of different orchid species is overwhelming.
,,Great walk with your loved one.,5.0,,"A nice cup of coffee and slow meandering walk will allow you to leave all concerns at the gate. Working here would not be a job, but a love for life."
,,My favorite spot,5.0,,"I went every day for a run in the botanical garden and I enjoyed it every single day. Opening at 5 AM, well lighted and so calm in the morning. I love it"
,,Beautiful part of a beautiful city,5.0,,"Huge garden with many, many differnt species of plants and trees. So much to see and experience. Bring a blanket and lunch basket and enjoy the peace and quiet. What a treat"
,,Amazing UNESCO Park inside the city --- Largest display of Tropical Orchids anywhere !,5.0,,"This is a fun place to walk around in the middle of Singapore. The plants and other greenery is amazing. The National Orchid Garden is the largest display of tropical orchids, anywhere. Well worth your time. Bring your camera."
,,Amazing gardens!,5.0,,Well worth a visit - allocate half a day if you like this kind of thing as it is very extensive/spread out. VIP orchid section also very interesting. Some good photo spots and plenty of information boards throughout the gardens.
,,Humid afternoon,4.0,,"We spent 3 hours walking this beautiful site on a hot and humid Saturday
It is a treasure, well maintained ( its Singapore!) and very relaxing in the middle of this bustling city
Make sure to pay the $5 for the Orchid Preservation- it’s truly amazing"
,,Refreshing view!,5.0,,"A nice place to spend good time with family and children! It is a picnic spot, a nice walking trail with refreshing view all over. Also have a beautiful orchid garden one must not miss to visit! New people must enter from info center gate i.e. gate no.1! They provide a map, also guide you the path(that saves a lot of your time and energy)! Entry to garden is free but for orchid garden, one have to buy ticket(only for foreigners). But it doesn’t cost much, 5$ per adult. Don’t forget to take your camera for sure!"
,,Beautiful tropical gardens,5.0,,"These gardens are delightful, there is so much to see. The plants are incredible and the settings are amazing. The MRT station is just outside the gate so it is easy to find. Go there, you will be glad you did."
,,Lovely garden,5.0,,Had to visit this UNESCO heritage site and it is a lovely botanic garden that is well designed. Plenty of wildlife especially lizards if you look closely. Be aware that some parts of the gardens are closed on Tuesdays.
,,see my trip,5.0,,"The Healing Garden showcases over 400 varieties of plants used medicinally. It is laid out thematically relating to component parts of the body such as head, respiratory and reproductive systems. Visit one of the largest collections of orchids in the world at the National Orchid Garden. With over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids in our collection, you will be treated to a visual spectacle and learn about the distinctive attributes of orchids."
,,This place is huge!,4.0,,Like most of singapore the gardens are spotless - even the leaves are too scared to fall onto the ground. The gardens are massive and there is a lot of walking involved if you want to see it all. Wear your comfy walking shoes.
,,Wow,5.0,,This has got to be one of the best deals in Singapore. Recognized as a World Heritage Sight and it’s free. If you would like to visit the National Orchid Garden (recommended) it’s only S$5 and only S$1 if you are a senior. Easy trip by metro and the place is amazing.
,,World Heritage site in Bonn 2015 together with Rjukan - Notodden in Norway,5.0,,This old an beautiful organised park is a wonderful place for studying orchids and other exotic plants. They also have a very interestin native jungle similar to the one they have in Rio Di Janeiro.
,,It's nearly all free!,5.0,,"We travelled to the Botanic Gardens by service bus and returned to the city centre by the MRT - both very efficient and cheap.
The gardens are free to visit and you can spend a day taking in the beauty. There is a charge to enter to Orchid Garden but as we are both over 60 it was only $1 each. The orchids are stunning and well worth a visit."
,,Amazing,5.0,,We came last year but couldn't stay for long so this was on our list for this year and it didn't disappoint. Some of the attractions are being updated but it was still wonderful . We paid for the orchid garden but actually just going around the actual gardens is free and so lovely we would highly recommend .
,,A haven is a wonderfully frenetic City.,5.0,,A beautiful place to stop and stare. Gorgeous orchids ! Gd eateries with helpful staff and promot service. Shops were well staffed lots of gifts to entice you to spend. Red hop on hop off bus best way to get there.
,,VIew,5.0,,Having a morning and evening walk is the best choice the place is quiet and you can sit down to read your novel on a breezy day sometimes they held concert which is wonderful
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,We liked the easy access from MRT. We noticed how well the locals use the park as free space. We appreciated all the lovely orchids growing and displayed so beautifully. We loved the rain forest walk. The Botanic Gardens gift shop is one of the best in Singapore. We stayed about 2 hours. It was hot and humid walking around .
,,Orchid garden is definitely worth it!,4.0,,"The botanical gardens as a whole we're slightly disappointing to me since I expect there to be more flowers than I saw. But the Orchid Garden was AMAZING! Highly recommend that portion even though you have to pay for it. So many orchids and so many colors (which is what I look for in botanical gardens, hence why I was probably disappointed a bit overall). Could spend a lot of time here if you are into trees."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Had a walk around these beautiful gardens well a small proportion of them, they are a huge. Doesn’t cost anything to enter the gardens but there is a cost to the orchid house which we didn’t go to. Though there were lots of people in the gardens we never felt it was over crowded, also how quiet it was in there considering how close it is to the city. There are superb sculptures around the areas we visited and most of the trees and plants are labelled. There are places to eat and also plenty of toilets and a visitors centre. So if you want a nice stroll in some lovely gardens in a busy city the Botanical gardens is the place to visit. Certainly recommend them for all the family."
,,Orchids,4.0,,Only had short time here on organised excursion and saw the orchid garden. Absolutely stunning. Wish we'd had more time to do the rest as it was vast and free entry.
,,Beautiful gardens with free admission,5.0,,The gardens are huge and beautifully kept. We stayed for 4 hours and were enchanted. There’s a $5 fee to go into the orchid garden and it’s worth every cent of that. Worth taking your own lunch as the restaurants are expensive.
,,Absolutely to do !,5.0,,"Very charming place, we did it at 2pm, not a good idea.. the garden is very huge, you can spent the hole day in it. Very large flowers and trees varieties where you’re like in jungle sometimes. We really appreciated our walk inside it."
,,Beautiful quiet Garden,5.0,,"If you want to relax and have a nice walk or just hang out check out the botanic gardens, beautiful variety of plants and colors. Be sure to go to the orchid part of the garden as well, it costs $5 to get in but that is totally worth it."
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,"The best gardens I have ever visited. The gardens were simply beautiful and well set out. I liked the orchid garden the best, whoever manages them really knows their subject. My one regret was I should have devoted at least two days to fully enjoy the complete garden spectacle."
,,The orchids are wonderful,4.0,,"The highlight of the gardens is the Orchid Gardens (small entrance fee payable) - situated in the centre of the Botanical gardens which are extensive - stretching around 2 Kms from end to end. There were no alternative other than to walk through the park in the heat.
There was a huge collection of orchids planted around a network of paths on the side of a hill.
The rest of the Gardens hold examples of many trees and shrubs but not any flower beds that we found.
There is a nice picnic area near the Symphony stage and Orchid Gardens. There are also several cafes and restaurants- which we didn’t sample"
,,Tranquil retreat.,4.0,,Easy to reach on MTR and a lovely escape from the bustling shopping areas. We went on a Sunday and were amazed to see the place full of local residents ( from High Rise flats) enjoying picnics under almost every tree. The orchid garden is quite a walk from the main entrance so be prepared for this.
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,"Exceptionally well maintained and presented open space in the heart of Singapore. As I expected it was all kept in pristine condition, and there were gardeners working all over the place. Orchid garden particularly impressive, in line with its reputation. Entry to the gardens is free except for $5 entry for adults into the Orchid garden. There was enough variety to keep the kids attention for 2-3 hours which is to be applauded."
,,Very nice Garden,4.0,,The park is huge and has a lot of diffrent sections. Nice place to spend the day For the Orchid Garden you have to pay 5$ entrance which in my oppinion is well worth it.
,,Fantastic gardens,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a bit out of the city centre but worth visiting none the less. They are rightly a UNESCO World Heritage Site and once inside it is easy to see the reason why. There is an abundance of trees, shrubs, plants and flowers to marvel at and the grounds themselves are really well maintained. Entry is free so that is a bonus but if you want to see the magical collection of orchids that will be the only charge you will need to pay. Well worth a visit."
,,Glorious,5.0,,This was by far one of the best gardens I have ever been in my life. The experience is a must and if you save your flight ticket you get a 10% discount.
,,Glad to have this option,5.0,,Love to go there for a walk. Great food options. My suggestion is few more sheltered areas in case it starts raining suddenly which happened to me so many times. IT will be good if they can add more things or programs catered to kids as well.
,,Any time any weather!,5.0,,"What a wonderful place to photosynthesize!! If u r over the malls and the plastic go to this space, take some food and spend the day wandering. Kids will love it. And if u can afford an iced coffee in one of the aircon cafes it will top off a perfect day for you!!"
,,JUST BEAUTIFUL,5.0,,"A must visit if in Singapore Great surroundings, clean and many different trees, plants and flowers. Great to spend the day here just walking and looking around"
,,Breath Taking,4.0,,Beautiful place to explore. Easy to get to by the subway system. Lots of places and areas to explore .
,,Boring in february,3.0,,Last time I was here it was summer and the Botanic Garden was a riot of color. In February only the orchids are in bloom. The orchids are great but a little color elsewhere would have livened up the hot and humid 1 mile walk from the metro to the orchid garden.
,,Quiet haven,5.0,,"Extensive parkland and gardens offers quiet alternative to a very bustling and modern city. Easily accessed from the adjacent Metro station (the best way to travel there) and free to enter. There is a variety of environments to enjoy from lakes with open parkland, a rain forest and the national orchid collection ( entry fee here, $5 pp $1 for seniors, no ID required). Having only a morning available we could not do the whole gardens justice but a most enjoyable experience nevertheless. Highly recommended!"
,,Visit daily,5.0,,"If you are staying in the orchard area of Singapore, it is an easy, while sweaty walk to the gardens. Once inside, the canopy of trees and soft breeze takes you away to another time. They have rainforest walks, healing gardens, and a fascinating evolution garden. Just scrolling the grounds brings you to new sites but you are never lost as there are signposts and maps close by. Groups are doing tai chi, often complete in national clothing with real swords while other groups are dressed in Nike and doing squats. Something for everyone. Here, the city seems far away and there are plenty of quiet places to relax and decompress. There are many attractions to see if that is for you, tickets on sale. If you are looking for no costs and serenity, then step through one of the many gates."
,,Great Attraction,4.0,,"For nature lovers, this is a great attraction to visit, having all kinds of floras and faunas, one could appreciate the wonders of nature."
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"We originally did not have Singapore Botanic Gardens in our itinerary. We had free time on the day we reached Singapore so we took MRT/Bus to reach there. This is certainly one of the best-kept botanical gardens in the world. Its free, large, green and clean. A lovely spot full of beautiful plants and lakes, turtles and squirrels and all sorts. The garden also houses the National Orchid garden."
,,A really lovely place to visit,5.0,,"Caught the MRT out to Singapore Botanic Gardens, and the entrance is right next to the station. It is a lovely peaceful place to walk around, though can be very humid so be prepared to take your time. There are many different areas to the gardens, but the Orchid Gardens are definitely worth paying to go into (only $1) - the rest is free entrance. They cover a very large area and you can spend at least half a day there."
,,Stunning,5.0,,I spent several hours here on a Sunday morning. The gardens are truly spectacular. The highlight is probably the orchid garden (which has a nominal fee to enter). The orchids are all amazingly beautiful. They are doing construction on a new pavilion in the orchid garden as well. The rainforest walk is also beautiful. The entire facility is well laid out. The signs are easy to follow. Make sure to get a map so you don’t miss anything. And bring water. It is a hot walk.
,,Must visit,5.0,,"This was one of my absolute favourite things in the city and I must say blows the flower dome/ gardens by the bay out of the water! and the best bit - its free.
You only have to pay to go into the orchid garden (must do) but that was 50p for students!

Its an incredible oasis in the city. There is so many areas you really could spend all day in here.
There is a beautiful lake, flowers, a carved wall, little waterfall - its so very beautiful I loved every minute.
Its a little out of the city but we got a bus there very easily and cheaply.
Definitely not at all to be missed its magical."
,,Very Nice,4.0,,Beautiful orchids and types of flowers. Go in the morning as it is hot in the afternoon. Very busy was laid out with lots of pathes. be aware there are some steeper grades when walking.
,,Quiet relief,4.0,,"A lovely garden abundant with native plants
Orchid display well worth the visit
Long paths that are well kept provide access for disabled
Bench seating or rest stop areas are not plentiful. Grass areas for picnics are expansive.
Catch MRT direct to the main gates. Orchard garden labelled as 1.3km (however distances seem somewhat inaccurate)"
,,Botanical Gardens - Singapore,4.0,,"We visit Botanical Gardens twice a year and with our guests visiting us. It is very relaxing and refreshing experience to see all types of species. The highlight of the visit is The Orchid Garden where different orchid plants are dedicated to the dignitaries who visited Botanical Gardens. While some visit during the evening, my preference is early morning. Get there by 7:30 AM or earlier, have breakfast at restaurant near the Orchid Garden, and spend a good couple of hours walking through the amazing species of flora and enjoy. You will develop a good appetite for lunch. It is worth your time."
,,So much more than just the Orchid Garden,5.0,,"To really appreciate this beautiful area go very early before the heat of the day. There are many areas to explore and you need to be prepared to do a lot of walking, take lots of water and an umbrella. It's easy to get to by MRT (Botanic Garden) then walk right through to the other end and get the bus from the Tanglin gate, the gardens website has full details of the buses and trains etc."
,,Must see if you like flowers,5.0,,"Part of orchid garden was closed for renovation in Feb.2018. Still plenty to see. Nice lay-out, plent if shade. Long walk from mtr Botanic Gardens ( 30 minutes) and easy to get lost. Better Take a taxi to entrance closest to orchid garden. Hop on/hop off stops there. Rooftop forest on the right tells you about nature’s riches."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Lovely gardens, well worth a visit. We visited on a weekend and was quite crowded. Recommend going through the week if possible."
,,Gardens,5.0,,"Easy to get around, beautiful displays, all types of plants, creative, could have easily spent all day here. Allow minimum of 3 hours to see everything. Not packed with people when we went during the day."
,,Must See,5.0,,"Spent most of the day walking round here lots to see and very reasonably priced, many different areas to visit."
,,One of the nicest man-made sites on the planet,5.0,,"I’ve been to the Botanic Gardens around fifty times and look forward to the next....and subsequent visits. It has the feel of an oasis. While you have the sense of being in nature the remarkable thing is that nearly every plant and tree was placed here, at one time or another, with a purpose in mind. Different parts of the Gardens have a very different character. Some parts are highly structured, others more wild, and most somewhere in between. The vegetative scenery is great but so is watching the people who are exercising, relaxing or walking their designer dogs in the park. It is especially nice sitting on the grass watching a concert at the open-air amphitheater at night."
,,LOVED IT,5.0,,A vast expanse of natural wonders. Takes an age to get round but boy is it worth the effort. The garden is logically sectioned and each area contains is own fascinations and wonders. Apart from the Orchid gardens it's free to get in and roam about and it's well worth taking time out to do so. Loved it. Plenty of cafes to have a drink or a bite to eat.
,,Excellent Park,5.0,,A very nice outdoor area. The Rainforest trail is a wonderful walk. The signage is unobtrusive but easy to identify and read. Restaurants inside the park. The Orchid area is excellent - cost $5. The rest of the park is free. Beautiful!
,,A stroll along natures best offering,4.0,,"We arrived at the main entrance about 10am for a great walk along the beautiful garden paths. It was about 1.5km to the orchid gardens which was our main interest. The 5 dollar admission to the orchid garden was an easy decision. The gardens explode with colorful orchids throughout, in single flowers and with a larhe numbee of flowers to fill your lens for portrait or landscape views."
,,Oasis in the city.,5.0,,"Spent a lovely relaxing morning wandering around the botanic gardens.
Travelled there on the MRT which has a stop at the main gate.
Vast areas of different gardens to wander in with a specific area for outdoor concerts.
Payment required for the Orchid garden but worth it.
Places to eat and drink with gift shops."
,,Amazing orchids,4.0,,"We only had a short time available so focussed on the orchid garden, which was fabulous. Who knew there were so many types and colours of orchid!"
,,Essential fare for plant lovers,5.0,,"These are perhaps the crowning glory of Singapore. The Singapore Botanic Gardens could probably match anything worldwide and provide a welcome oasis of calm in a city known for its high rise buildings and bustling nature. The venue is free to enter, although a fee is charged for the National Orchid Garden that is located within the grounds. For Europeans, getting up close to plants that are exotic to us, in as near as possible their natural habitat was a treat. For those staying in the centre of Singapore, the gardens are a taxi or bus ride away. Make the effort; it will be worth it."
,,Beautiful park containing Orchid garden,4.0,,"This was our first attraction in Singapore. Very nice park like setting easily accessible by MRT. However, orchid garden was a long walk in hot humid weather from MRT station."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"A bus stop close by gives good access from Orchard Road. Most of the Garden is free to enter, a charge is made for the Orchid House. The garden covers a large area and can be quite tiring in hot and humid conditions. Drink lots of fluids and take an umbrella or wear a hat to give a bit of shade. Informative maps available on entry and plenty of places to sit and rest during visit. Well laid out gardens and lots to see. A favourite place for wedding pictures. Saw two couples whilst we visited. Allow several hours for the visit or more if you’re really into gardens."
,,National Treasure,5.0,,"To my mind this is a must place to visit. It is so well kept, so well set out the range and variety of rare orchids is to be seen. A pleasant way to spend a relaxing afternoon in a super environment."
,,A must if you like plants and gardens,5.0,,This free attraction is wonderful. Areas of Gardens to see. It will be hot and humid so take water though there are places to eat and drink. Our second visit here and would go again.
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a good attraction to do during the day as there is lots of shade with the trees. Stunning gardens, something different around every corner. Well signposted and FREE!"
,,The best park I have ever been to,5.0,,"I was just planning on walking around taking in the sights for an hours or two. Flash forward 7 hours and I was sad that I had to leave. I have never been to a more beautiful park in my life. There is so much going on here that it was one thing after another. The plants are marked- a process that makes you appreciate the effort- with information on what they are and what a lot of them were used for. There are areas for desert plants, rainforest plants, orchids, etc.

I'm glad I went and I would travel to Singapore again just to go there another time."
,,Big and Beautiful,5.0,,This garden is the best botanical garden I have been to. Its huge with a big variety in gardens. My favorite garden was the evolution garden. Truly a walk through time.
,,Peaceful and beautiful,5.0,,"Lots of places to see in Singapore, but be sure to include the gardens as its a great way to relax away from the city and absorb the natural beauties and history of Singapore"
,,Great park with interesting flora!,5.0,,"I loved this place. It’s free, which is nice, and there are plenty of information boards on the plants, with lots of seats and sheltered areas also.

There are a couple of nice cafes and restaurants that you can stop at also. Thoroughly recommended! Also, the orchid garden is in the same space, although not free, and also worth a visit!"
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,"A fantastic beautiful and interesting botanical garden, with an English layout, but amazing exotic plants. Too big and interesting to do in one day. I would really want to come back."
,,Favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,"This is absolutely my favorite place so far in Singapore. You take the train and get off, there it is entering through the gates. Absolutely free! The morning time was absolutely perfect and I suggest grabbing a coffee before hand across the street before you head into the gardens. Check out the map outside before you head in. You can spend 3-4 hours walking around or you could spend just an hour. Just be sure to take a look at the Orchid Exhibit as it is astonishing. Costs money, but well worth it. If you are a student you get in for free also.
Make your way around the park, there are a couple stops for food around the area with well placed restrooms as well. The dining is quite expensive, so I recommend packing a lunch and having a picnic near the lake. What a beautiful place for all types of people."
,,"150 year old gardens , spectacular",5.0,,"A very special place in the world, we were amazed at the variation of plants and trees, especially the orchids. So glad we visited here , one of our highlights of Singapore. You do need to be fit as some of the paths were quite steep. we highly recommend a visit here."
,,The best orchid garden not under glass.,5.0,,The gardens are beautiful with the orchid garden that really stands out as top quality. The flowering display in a natural envoironment is superb. Only one problem because of the humidity my camera lens steamed up (bring a cloth). Still a good morning spent in the park.
,,A suitable location to look for clean air,5.0,,"The first time me and my family were together here. This place is a spacious and comfortable garden to relax. The plants are green and well groomed. Someday, we will definitely come back here."
,,Charming place for an afternoon stroll with family,5.0,,Have always love the greenery at Botanical Garden. One of the great hangouts with kids in Singapore or a nice brunch at the award winning Corner House on a lazy afternoon. One of the hidden gems away from the busy crowd in Orchard Road. You may wamt to consider this place to spend a lovely day with your family if your aim is to relax.
,,"Large, Beautiful Park",4.0,,"I went to the Botanical Garden because I wanted to go to the Orchid Garden, which is inside. The Botanical Garden is unlike some of the other ones I've been to. It's more like a very large park with a ton of activity in it. You will of course find signage for various flora and collections of specific varieties. You'll also find a lot of runners/joggers, tons of dogs being walked, families out for walks and picnics with strollers, and school kids on a field trip.

You could spend all day here if you wanted, the park is very large and lots of different collections. The park is free, but the Orchid Garden is not."
,,Perfect palace for Orchid Lovers,5.0,,I have a question before I get started..... how do you manage to keep all the flowers so nicely and blooming all year ..... Thanks Team for a wonderful experience.
,,AMAZING!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens, and particularly the Orchid Garden, are simply amazing. It was great to stroll through the gardens and see all the different plants and greenery we do not have here in the US. The main gardens are free, and it was S$5 to enter the Orchid Gardens, which was totally worth it. The orchids are gorgeous! By far one of my favorite attractions on my visit!"
,,Beautiful Gardens and Helpful Staff,5.0,,The gardens are immaculately maintained with areas continuously being updated. Staff at each of the three visitor centers are quite helpful in planning a visit and answering questions.
,,By far the best experience in Singapore,5.0,,"Refined, spectacularly rich flora, nice atmosphere. Even restaurant and shops are good. If you have any interest in botanic gardens, this one is a must."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"We had an awesome time strolling the gardens. Nice layout with plants from different parts of the world. Overall, Beautiful place, good to escape from the city"
,,Huge park - well worth visiting,5.0,,"We only had time to go through the orchid part of the park, where you have to pay entrance. The other parts are free of charge and a lot bigger than the orchid park. But as We understood it is very nice to stroll around if you had the time."
,,Perfect!!,5.0,,"The entry to the park is free and it’s right next to a train station (Botanic Gardens MRT)

It’s a huge park with plenty of places to sit and relax or have a picnic.

It has a nice pond with ducks if you want to take some pictures. Actually there are plenty of photo spots in the park.

You can jog and exercise here as there are jogging tracks

Just outside the park there are so many dining options after you get tired of the walks. There is a souvenir shop. And random water fountains.

There is an open Shaw theatre where some or the other event happens on weekends. I mean what more do you want from a park.

It’s a 10 on 10"
,,Vast garden!,5.0,,"A must see place if you are in Singapore, but be prepared to walk, we walked all day and I am sure we might have missed something. So much to see. It is free to enter!"
,,Lovely!!,5.0,,Great day out- we ate at casa verde and then visited the orchid garden. Would highly recommend for a peaceful day out!
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,The National Orchid Garden is within the Boanic Gardens. The plants are amazing to see. You could spend hours here.
,,Beautiful Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"Worth the visit and we were able to see beautiful and colorful Orchids in full Bloom. Though we walked a long distance, it is worth."
,,Great place to spend a few hours,5.0,,"It must be among the most beautiful botanical gardens I've ever seen. Nice, orderly, a lot of lovely plants and some birds, some little chickens running around, it definitely has charm. There is no entrance fee and you can take all the photos you want. But prepare to be there for a few hours as there is quite a bit to see."
,,Amazing place to spend half day!,5.0,,"A huge, amazing botanical garden that has multiple smaller gardens inside! The garden is huge, be prepared to walk a lot!‍♀️there are many drinking water fountains around to fill your own bottles. Not too many toilets around though. There are a few cafes or such around as well a few souvenirs shops. Only the orchid garden needs a ticket to be bought. otherwise it’s free! You can also see a few squirrels and dragons!"
,,Special place,5.0,,"Having lived in Singapore a few years ago, close enough to walk to the Gardens most weeks, we really look forward to visiting each time we come back. The variety of plants and wildlife is wonderful and it is so popular with the locals that it is rarely quiet. Try to visit during the week as it gets really busy at weekends. The ""special"" gardens are really interesting and the explanatory signage is great. It is best to get there early in the morning to avoid the hottest part of the day although there are plenty of shady walks. Look for the lizards, turtles, dragonflies, butterflies and birds as you wander as well as for the flowers and the unusual trees. The local tai chi and other groups that gather on the flat courtyards during the day make for a quirky experience. Feel free to join in.
The Orchid garden is worth a visit for the flowers but also the sunbirds and the spectacular insects. The small bonsai display is also very interesting.
There is a new area called the Learning Garden that made this visit even more worthwhile. Never go to Singapore without a visit here if you are at all interested in the natural world."
,,Have a lunch time in park..,4.0,,Perfect place to spend family time. Known better the various floras. My daughter loves the playground.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"We absolutely loved our visit to the gardens, especially the orchid pavilion. The whole garden is beautifully set out and maintained. Not to be missed!!!"
,,Amazing Gardens and Super Trees,5.0,,The biospheres where incredible places providing all specimens of local flora and fauna. Every country should have Super Tree to collect rain water and purify air! Not to be missed!
,,Earthly paradise!,5.0,,This is certainly one of the best-kept botanical gardens in the world. One can stroll and enjoy the plants anbd trees for hours.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Visited using a hop-on, hip-off bus, very easy to get to. Absolutely beautiful place, well worth a visit. We saw a number of Clouded Monitors walking around, just look off the path and you may see/hear them walking through the leaves.

This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it’s easy to see why. It’s great that Singapore has preserved this land as you get a sense of what Singapore may have been like before it was developed. So many beautiful trees and plants, very relaxing walk (and many different trails to explore)."
,,Wonderful place.,5.0,,"Enough to do two days there, free entrance! This was an amazing place and was one of our highlights. We went back for a second day and we still didn't cover it all and both learned a lot in a very relaxed way!"
,,Wonderful Botanics,5.0,,"You could spend 2 hours or a whole day here. It is a wonderful place and one of only 2 rain forests in a city in the world. Fantastic wildlife keep your eyes open for the Monitor Lizards there are some big boys walking and swimming round in here. Great opportunity for the camera so don't forget it.

Gets really hot in middle of day, some places to eat and grab a cold drink, but as you would expect it's not cheap, but then the gardens are free so it's a fair trade."
,,Very enjoyable on a hot day,4.0,,We wandered slowly around and enjoyed the peace and quiet of the gardens. Plenty to see and places to sit in the shade to catch up on all that's been seen.
,,Went twice in a 5 day visit....,5.0,,And didn't see the same area twice. It is a very well planted and labeled and organized expanse of botanical pleasure. Free to visit. One can take the MRT to the one end of the park. About 3km from end to end .... including the many twists and turns. There is an orchard garden in the near centre which is the only charge....of $5. The gardens had many paths and areas with different botanical wonders. There are monitor lizards walking the floors....interesting to see. The Swan pond has otters and swans and turtles and a variety of large fish. A pleasant visit and escape from the city. There were locals in among the various trails doing tai chi. A nice addition to the ambiance of the gardens. Very well done. Recommend for a visit....
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"We stopped off here using our Hop on Hop off bus ticket, but it expired whilst there. We spent a great 3 hours here, it’s free! There are plenty of places to eat/drink although we just had water. Lovely to stroll around. We used the Metro to travel back to our hotel and that was very simple too although we had to use cash to buy our ticket!!"
,,Botanic garden,5.0,,We stayed at marina bay sands hotel.There was a laser show at the botanic garden at night.My son who visited Singapore 3 months ago on a business trip recommended it. We could go from Marina bay sands hotel directly to the garden. At night it looks spectacular with the colored lighting and view of the city.
,,Simply the best,5.0,,"This is, in my opinion the best botanic garden in the world bar none. Including the famous orchid garden, the whole botanic garden is a world heritage site. Glorious displays year round. A must do attraction in Singapore"
,,Mr,4.0,,Nice gardens ..Wiorth a look definitely as It’s free entry . .Its on the MRT line so very easy to access ..
,,Wonderful array of orchids,5.0,,"Great gardens. We went for the orchids and were amazed at the variety and colours. We were a little disappointed as a couple of buildings were closed for maintenance.

There is MRT access, but check which gate you want to enter as you may need a taxi."
,,Simply the best!,5.0,,"We never tire of visiting the world famous botanic gardens in Singapore. It's usually the first place we visit whenever we travel to this wonderful city. Every time we visit we see something new or a corner we hadn't seen before.
Firstly, it's free admission apart from the National Orchid Garden which only costs 5SGD ( concessions 1SGD). Probably the best time to visit is early morning when it's cooler and quieter. From our experience, it seems most organized tour groups arrive around about 10am and after and this means some areas become very busy.
Like any garden, work never stops and the Botanic Gardens continue to evolve which can mean some areas are closed but there is so much to see and admire time just flies!
This time, for us, there was a recently completed area with a boardwalk well up into the tree canopy which is certainly worth visiting. Paths meander through out the gardens and there are so many sections, it's almost impossible to visit them all on one visit.
In addition to a huge variety of trees, shrubs and plants, there are some fascinating sculptures dotted around which add to the overall attractiveness of the gardens.
The focal point for many visitors is the National Orchid Garden which is well worth the small admission fee. There are toilets nearby and a small but well stocked gift shop at the entrance/exit to the orchid collection.
Within the gardens there are several places for refreshment where weary feet can rest! The gardens are a smoke free zone which is another plus. Early morning is a popular time for joggers if you fancy some light exercise!
Pick up the very useful leaflet and map at the entrance which will guide you around. Depending where you are staying, there is an MRT station( Botanic Gardens Station).
What to take: comfortable footwear, fully charged camera or mobile phone batteries and if you're a keen gardener, a notebook and pen!
Don't miss this wonderful place."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The flowers were stunning and lots to look at. Never were we bored or not interested in the array of fliers and plants. Stunning set up
,,Garden in a city,5.0,,"A garden in a city, its spacious enough to feel that it's not crowded. Great to bring kids and have a stroll as well as jogging. Great place to be in after a hectic day."
,,A must stop for those seeking tranquility in Singapore,5.0,,"This is clearly one of the best and largest botanical gardens in the world. And Singapore's nearly equatorial location makes it perfect to display a huge assortment of interesting tropical plants. With the exception of the $5 fee to enter the Orchid Garden (pay if you like orchids, otherwise there's plenty else to see), it's all free. I'd allocate at least 2 hours for a visit; more if you're craving tranquility in otherwise hectic Singapore."
,,Lage garden with plenty to see,5.0,,"To start entrance to the garden is free, alway a good thing to start with.

It covers a large area so a) you will need to be extremely fit and determined to cover all of it in a day or b) accept you can't see it all and slow down to take in the ambience of it all.
It tends to be reasonably busy between the main entrance and the orchid garden but not oppressively so and quieter the further you go away from there.

The orchid garden has many varieties in bloom for you to admire and wonder why yours at home don't grow that big.
It appears that most of the plants have been put in their potion so there is a certain formality about the place but if you can put that to one side it is worth the visit."
,,Relaxation time,5.0,,"The gardens are just so relaxing, although on the day that we visited, the heat was unforgiving. Find time to go through the famed orchid garden also. The curators make growing orchids seem so easy."
,,Take your time; so much to see,5.0,,I walked through the gardens to get to the Orchid Gardens and then out across to the railway station on the other side. There are places to buy food and drink but I wish I had thought to take a picnic. It is so relaxing and with so much to see and it's free. The picture you see is actually in the Orchid Garden.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Beautiful gardens of exotic flowers & some wildlife (looked like a monitor lizard in a pool). Extraordinary flower arranging and hybrid orchids. I especially enjoyed the orchids named after some famous visitors. Maybe you will agree once you've visited 😊
,,A relaxing wonder,5.0,,"It is a healing for the soul to stroll around in this park, you can see flower, rainforest, lakes, locals sitting around the grass."
,,Fabulous Gardens and Free!!!,5.0,,This is a beautiful park to go for a walk. Really amazing selection of plants and trees. Recommended!!
,,Tranquility,5.0,,"This is a wonderful place to come in the early morning and you can find various groups of fitness and Yoga informal classes throughout the grounds. I met a friendly expat that had been going regularly to a ""mommy fitness"" class she found here and that's how she had met her new found friends. If you are just here for a visit while in Singapore, it's a lovely place to take a morning walk and get some exercise. Stop by the little lake (not the one with the swans) and peer over the edge of the gazebo. It won't be long before dozens of little water turtles will come over to you, hoping to be fed. Fish food is sold, but even if you choose simply to watch the turtles, they'll stick around. The Botanic Gardens are FREE (unless you visit the Orchid House) and there are clean restrooms available. Tours are offered to this attraction, so if you want true tranquility, come early in the morning. Take the MRT to get here (easy) and one of the city buses to leave."
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"Peaceful, balmy, relaxing, and full of heavenly scents. This was a real oasis of calm by the city and a joy to look around. The orchid garden is worth paying the extra ticket for. I wish I had had more time here"
,,One of the most beautiful garden,5.0,,"We absouletly loved this botanical garden. It is really beautiful and really big. The orchid garden was amazing,never saw that many different orchids before. Also the botanical garden has so many fantastic trees and flowers. It is a few restaurant where you can eat and rest a bit. I wish we have more time to go back."
,,A free nicely maintained safe park,4.0,,"Its hard to think of anything 15,000+ others have not said so I will keep it brief. Its free, large, green, clean, safe and outdoors for whatever you want, plus it easy to get to with a MRT stop of its own.

There are several good places to stop and rest or eat in the garden. The Nassim Gate Malay food is cheap and excellent although mostly self serve."
,,Outstanding gardens!,5.0,,"What more can one say other than that these gardens are stunningly well presented. Apart from the spectacular orchid collection the whole place is free of charge.

The rain forest area shows how the area was before a population arrived.

Beautifully clean and undergoing enhancement works the Botanic Gardens must be a first choice place for any visitor to Singapore."
,,"Beautiful gardens, full of birds",5.0,,"The gardens are wonderful, but if you're interested in seeing birds as I am, it's a great place to get an introduction to the local species. We had an added bonus of a mega rarity, only the 2nd record for Singapore while we were there."
,,Best place to chill,4.0,,"Well, I love botanical gardens. Specially on weekends where there is free music at the shaw amphitheater. Often includes music from army bands and Singapore national bands. I love it when people gather around and watch the free music, appreciate the efforts of the Government in community development. The entry fee is free. Only the national orchid garden inside has an entry fee. Which by far is the best place for some good selfies. Crowd is good. The mist house is awesome (though it is being upgraded now,probably till 2019 it will be closed for upgrades).

You can enjoy with your family and friends here. Definitely worth the visit."
,,Tourist,4.0,,Perhaps even a little bit too artificial and clean for a “garden”. Make a combination of a nice stroll through the park and finish in one of the many nice restaurants in the park.
,,Energize yourself with nature,5.0,,"It is free, can reach with mrt, very large, consist of a lot of plants (some in specific garden).
Wear you comfortable shoes, bring your water. Best time to visit is morning time because you can explore much here, just don't forget your hat and glasses."
,,Botanical gardens.,5.0,,Interesting gardens to stroll around. Free admission to gardens but there is a small fee to enter the orchid gardens which are well worth a visit.
,,Natural in tbe Big city,5.0,,Don't think too much for going here It's good for relaxing and visit the natural which human-made. Suitable for rest the weekend
,,Beautiful peaceful garden in the city.,4.0,,"If you not favour of visiting garden as your holiday itinerary, think again.
Singapore Botanic Gardens is a heritage protected garden with lots of beautiful nature creations, and is quite a big garden, is ideal if you like to walk or jogging within the garden, surely you will be satisfy with it amazing greenery and fresh air.
More individual site within the garden, and an cafeteria is at the corner so don't worry to relaxing yourself after a long walk or jogging.
Cheers, Enjoy the visit ya."
,,Regular visitor,5.0,,"We go to the Gardens regularly for walks and to see the various sections. Over recent years they have expanded the Gardens quite a lot with new things to see. The older parts still remain and the place is very well maintained. It’s busy at certain times but not unpleasantly so. Very good exhibits of tropical rain forest and other types of environments. I would say one of the must visit places in Singapore especially if you have not been to tropical Asia before. The orchid garden is worth a visit although you have to pay for this. One of the things they could consider adding is an exhibit on the commercial crops of Singapore and Malaysia and what part the Gardens played in research in the early days of Singapore. Also, why was it called Orchard Road and what was grown in Singapore previously?"
,,Good place to do a leisurely walk,4.0,,"We were there in January so not too many flowers were blooming! It's mostly green and saw lots of locals picnicking in the park! It's a big place to do some leisurely walk! They give Senior citizen discounts so make sure you bring some kind of ID! We paid an extra$1 to see the orchids! But not too many orchids were blooming so I would recommend to go there a little later, but not too late cause it can get really hot and humid!"
,,A walk on the almost Wild side...,5.0,,A walk in the botanic gardens is a definite must-do in Singapore. You easily spend 2-3 hours strolling around the gardens and you need to slow down and take your time. Try the jungle walk - It’s almost like the real thing. And don’t miss the orchid part - it is soooo beautiful!!
,,Size is impressive - clean and nice,4.0,,You can have almost endless walks in the park which provides a nice break from the otherwise busy Singaporean style.
,,Tree talk,4.0,,"A wonderful nature haven with tall old shady trees. In the original part of the garden surronding swan and symphony lake it is possible to talk a walk on a hot, humid afternoon and still feel cool under the tree shades. And if you choose to lie on a mat, have a picnic or read a book, you will have the majestic view of tropical tree outlines against a bright blue sky along with the wafts of scents from flowering shrubs brought on by gentle breezes. A great way to spend a hot afternoon in nature."
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"We visited the Singapore Botanical Gardens in the morning before it got too hot and we loved it. I would even say it was one of the best places to visit in Singapore.

We travelled by MRT, which was really easy and found the gardens within seconds.

The gardens are vast with lots of walks, lakes, artists and lots of variety of flowers and plants.

We paid to go in the Orchid Garden, which was stunning. Lots of little paths to explore and orchids were amazing. The Orchid Garden did get busy as everyone wanted to take photos, but I would recommend you pay to enter as it is worth the money.

You do need a couple of hours minimum to visit, but if you have longer I would recommend you make the time."
,,Nice place to take a walk,5.0,,Large garden with plenty of trees and flowers. We spend all day long here and visit orchard garden cost $5 fee for ticket.
,,Brilliant escape from a bustling city,5.0,,"We walked from the top of Orchard Road to the Nassim Gate of the Botanic Gardens. It was a good walk rewarded by beautiful gardens inside the UNESCO site.

We loved the green in front of the Shaw Foundation Symphony théâtre, the National Orchid Garden and the Ginger Gardens. We also passed through the Rainforest boardwalk.

Thankfully it was a lovely day to appreciate the variety of orchids, including the VIP hybrids."
,,Wow!!! Must see!,5.0,,"Ok, I love flowers and have been to many Botanical gardens but this place is my #1 in the world. The Orchid garden is a must. You can spend a small amount of time or 3+ hours like I did - but I love plants. It is huge, diverse and perfectly maintained."
,,Beautiful gardens not to be missed,5.0,,"They say that Singapore is the only shopping mall to be in the United Nations. When you get sick of all the commercialism, the gardens offer beautiful respite."
,,A hidden gem in this remarkable city,5.0,,With all this hype around the gardens by the way one might miss this beautiful garden in the heart of the city. If you love a good stroll through the greens you'll definitely love this place. There's enough room for the kids to run to their hearts content as well
,,Incredibly Beautiful,4.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens are exquisite. The gardens are enormous and full of some of the most beautiful fauna. Bring your camera as there are some terrific photo opportunities around the garden. This is a great day out in Singapore.
,,A really beautiful park,5.0,,This is a beautiful park which is very large so remember water and sun cream as it is very hot walking around. The cafes in the park were very disappointing and very expensive for what they are
,,Wonderful day out,5.0,,"The gardens are vast and beautiful, I really enjoyed walking around and taking pictures. Visiting the orchid garden is a great option too, but it costs a little bit extra (over free entry to the gardens!). It's generally quiet, and you'll get to see some local wildlife."
,,Worthy visit,5.0,,"Botanical Gardens has different atmosphere compared with Gardens By The Bay, with same excitement.
This garden offers more quite ambience. Many people do jogging, and I can say this is the perfect jogging track. This is my first time visit, and next time I visit Botanical Gardens again, I will prepare my shoes."
,,A great FREE place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"I live in Singapore and go to the Botanic Gardens as a must do activity when I have visiting friends and family. There is an abundance of wildlife there, which is a real treasure in the heart of the city. Plenty of nice places to eat. The orchid garden is the only part with an entrance fee, but is well worth the few dollars it costs. On Sunday afternoons there are usually music performances at the shaw foundation symphony stage - again free! Take a picnic blanket down and enjoy!"
,,Wonderful Botanic Visit,5.0,,"What a fantastic place to visit, this is a must for all who love, plants, greenery and space. So much thought has gone into the planning of the Gardens, the walks through are fantastic, with fantastic views, plants, trees and flowers around every bend. Also plenty of places to stop for drink s and snacks, which is a must in the humidity here .

I think the Orchid Gardens were my favourite, they allow you to see the many species available.

Loved every minute and will definitely be coming here again, next time in Singapore."
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"These gardens are beautiful but the star is the orchid gardens. Absolutely, don't miss seeing them. They're spectacular."
,,A must visit if gardens are your interest,5.0,,One of the most beautiful and extensive botanic gardens in the world. The Orchid collection is outstanding.
,,Lush life,5.0,,"We visited on our last day in Singapore and very glad we didn’t miss it! Orchids were the primary draw for me, but the entire gardens were so beautiful, well organized, lush with life!

The special separate orchid exhibit was breathtaking - myriad intense colors and some truly unusual yet natural shapes! Simply splendid!

It’s warm and humid, but that’s expected. Access to restrooms, cafes, and excellent signage abound - that’s Singapore!"
,,Probably not worth a visit if you aren't especially interested in flora.,3.0,,"I got down from the MRT station and headed straight into the gardens. The orchid garden is reached after a 2kmwalk through the 'usual' garden.
The sun was scorching which ruined half the fun. Nevertheless, we bought a ticket for the orchid garden. Some parts of it were under maintenance and since I'm not a fan of gardens, I didn't enjoy walking through the heat.

So skip this if you aren't interested in different types of Flora. But if you DO go, try choosing a relatively cooler day."
,,Peaceful and tranquillity,5.0,,"What a beautiful environment! If you like nature and tranquility this is a must visit. We spent four hours here and easily could've spent many more. The beautiful flowers and plants were a joy to experience....It felt like we were in a rain forest....so beautiful. Watch out for the Lizards, we saw quite a few large ones on our walk around. The gardens are well kept, extremely tidy and so peaceful except for the sounds of nature."
,,Incredible diversity and care,5.0,,"Great way to spend a few hours - lovely gardens, and interesting information shared. The Fragrant Garden is tiny and not in terrific bloom in January. The Orchid Gardens were amazingly gorgeous. Easy to walk miles here and enjoy the variety of sites and knowledge shared throughout the gardnes."
,,See the Orchids,5.0,,"Before we ever went to Singapore we were told to visit the orchids. Once we got to the Botanic Gardens we could see that not only did Singapore have the right climate, they had over 100 years of people building the institution and the varieties.
Singapore orchid growers create special hybrids for arriving visitors, which are then maintained in the orchid garden. There are well over 1,000 varieties, and you can see how they are set in natural settings."
,,This place is big,5.0,,This place is massive but the directions in the park are awesome. There's a lot to see and take pics of. There is also an MRT station which is always good.
,,A real must do,5.0,,"You could easily spend a whole day here....stunning. The flora is amazing and the orchid garden is absolutely superb. The array of flowers is something I have never seen before. A large area, but, simply take your time"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Lovely walk through the gardens, charming gift shop if expensive. Bought a lovely orchid to take home"
,,Nice early morning walk.,4.0,,"Decent gardens for early morning exercise or walking. Did start to get real busy after 11am, once tourists started to arrive."
,,Pretty park ... for everyone,3.0,,"It is a heritage site. In the day, you can walk around the park and consider looking out for any free performances at the theatre. At night, the lighting makes some parts of the park look slightly mystical... it is otherwise free..."
,,Beautiful lush gardens,5.0,,"Very impressive, particularly the themed gardens. Could spend hours exploring and there are good eating options within the gardens."
,,Lots of attractions for Tree Lovers,4.0,,Very big open space as well as lots of tree and Flower tree. Have lots of open space where you can move and take rest. the problem i faced i was too tired but have to walk back to the main gate of the garden to catch the MRT!!
,,Family day out,5.0,,Enjoyed the wide open spaces here Excellent lunchtime menu Beautiful gardens visited more than once during stay in Singapore definitely visit next time
,,Stunning array of orchids,4.0,,"Truly well worth a visit and even though some areas under renovations still some absolutely wonderful plants and flowers on view. Since most of the gardens are well lined with trees and bushes, it was a pleasant stroll in shady conditions and not too hot in the mid morning.

For those with green thumbs or those aspiring to have them, well worth a visit."
,,A lovely and much needed Nature Day,5.0,,After shopping in Singapore for three days the Botanic gardens were a very welcome relief and nature break to bring us back to earth. It's a shame they make you pay for the Orchid garden though. Of course all the touristy food places overcharge so eat and drink before you go. The MRT goes right there and is a cinch to use.
,,"Wow, just Wow",5.0,,We had an awesome time strolling the gardens. Orchid Garden is a must see and $5 fee is will worth it. Loved the flowers and all greenery!!!! Must do in Singapore...
,,Very nice gardens.,4.0,,Gardens are well looked after and they were lush and green. Nice layout with plants from different parts of the world. Very humid so keep well hydrated.
,,Good to get away from the city,4.0,,"Beautiful place, good to escape from the city. Some things were not on the map and I couldn’t find them, eg the fragrant garden but otherwise would recommend."
,,What a Fantastic Place,5.0,,"We were there in late December 2017, We couldn't walk around the whole of the Garden because we are older and have a problem walking any great distance, we actually had Walking Frames with us, so we got around some of the Garden. What a beautiful place, in the middle of Singapore, the greenery is just beautiful, and the variety of plants. What a place, I think it should be a place everyone should go and just walk around, the peace and tranquility is second to none. And it is FREE."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We went here as we had heard it was special as it a World Heritage Unesco Site. It did not let us down! We loved the Orchid area and the walks around this very large gardens. We also had lunch there which was also lovely. We used our hop on hop off bus route to visit.
,,Green island in the ocean of buzz,5.0,,"Just imagine you are travelling for a while through some Asian countries or have been to Singapore for a while, then you are likely going to miss some silence, privacy and green under your feet. The botanic garden offers exactly that. It is very calm place to relax from the city buzz. The orchid garden is amazing. then you will how these flowers can look (rather than the one your buy home and are not good anymore after a short time)."
,,An oasis of calm in the middle of the city.,5.0,,"We were advised by the hotel to visit the gardens , as suggested we caught the MRT to he top entrance a meandered our way through some stunningly lush tropical gardens and eventually emerged at the lower entrance not far from Orchard road, taking in a light lunch at one of the restaurants, the gardens were emaculately kept like most things in Singapore (the cleanest city We've visited) with every type of flower, orchid tree and shrub all at their best, so I was a pleasure to walk through it taking in its beauty and tranquility a quality break from the city a must for any lover of plants and trees."
,,"Relaxing, beautiful, world class, and FREE!",5.0,,"I love botanical gardens and go out of my way to visit them everywhere I go. The Singapore Botanical Gardens are beautiful, relaxed, and rival anything I've seen. Better yet it is free (except some exhibits/areas). I highly recommend it for an hour or two stroll."
,,A lovely place,5.0,,I envy those who live nearby this botanic garden. The greenery view is very soothing. I felt refreshed after a visit to this place.
,,Go directly to the Orchid Garden,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are huge and pretty but go for the Orchid Gardens within the Botanic Gardens. Entry to the Gardens is free; there is a fee to enter the Orchid Garden but it is not to be missed. There are over 60,000 orchid plants. You will see orchid species you have never seen before. You will want to stop and take a picture of everyone"
,,Great for a whole day or just a few hours,5.0,,"A lovely large garden to spend a day or a few hours, chilling and enjoying the beautiful different plants, trees and wildlife. Will come back."
,,Beautiful landscaped gardens,5.0,,Walked around for approx 4 hours around this well planned and landscaped amazing world heritage gardens. There’s surprises around each corner to see and gardens to please every age group.
,,A must see,5.0,,"We had been to the Orchid Gardens on a previous trip so decided to do the whole gardens this time. There is a small lake, Swan Lake, which has swans plus an amazing statue as well. I have never been to a city that invests so heavily in statues. There are simply amazing ones here. The gardens are varied and well maintained. Also a peaceful place to wander and relax."
,,Brilliant Botanical walk without charge,5.0,,"An excellent tropical botanical garden maintained to the highest standard as you would expect in Singapore. Many features including accessible by MRT, music performances, Orchid garden, lakes and an excellent rain forest boarded walk in the shade."
,,Great place to breathe clean air,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens is such a lovely space. I thought it was something you can do in a short period of time but because of its size I think you need at least 1/2 a day. It was so great to breathe clean green fresh air walking around. There was so many people running/walking with their dogs and lots of kids. Admission is free except for the Orchid garden...you have to pay $5sgd. 

The grounds are kept clean. Plenty of bathrooms along the routes. Love the water near the Symphony. So peaceful. 

Lots of restaurants/cafe's to choose from. Again, so nice to see so many diners outside with their dogs ! 

Definite must if in Singapore."
,,Very pleasant,5.0,,This is great place for anyone. A wonder ambience to the place and plenty of places to walk. A real pleasure..
,,A pleasant respite from the throng of the citu,5.0,,"The gardens are a great place to take a break from the city - a shady walk or a picnic on the many grassed areas.
There is a small entry fee.
Some beautiful plants to see along the winding pathways and there are a couple of cafes where you can purchase refreshments along the way. The orchid house (at additional cost) appears to have a static display year round. I didn't go in on this visit.
Easy to find your way around, make sure you get a map at the start.
There is also an area for children to climb amongst tall trees.
Can be a bit humid at different times of the year but generally a lovely place for some exercise or relaxing."
,,Visited multiple times and could go more,4.0,,"This is an impressive park. The orchid gardens are the main attraction for most but the extensive pathway ways and gardens located throughout the larger park are the true attraction. Look at the variety of trees, plants, flowers etc. great for people watching as well. The orchid gardens deserve more than the 30-40 min most tour groups allow. Definitely spend time exploring the whole park including the ginger garden."
,,Calm oasis in the middle of the City,5.0,,"Calm..Serene..A morning walk in the gardens is a perfect way to destress n soak in fresh air..We had a work retreat at the Villa and it was fantastic..From tuna and beef sandwiches to smoked duck and cakes for lunch..it's an ideal place to relax, recharge and renew.. Perfection.."
,,Amazing garden,4.0,,It was amazing garden with rare flowers. You can spend several hours there. But for rare flowers you must take ticket and it is not free.
,,Nice Day Out,5.0,,"Very Impresive Garden. We came here to see the various flowers, because I really love the flowers. Orchid flowers here are very beautiful. Supported by a peaceful atmosphere, at least it can be spared a bit from the busy Singapore."
,,Spectacularly beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Of all the things to do in Singapore, the Botanic Gardens should top everyone's list. For garden lovers to children, this oasis in the city is the perfect place to spend a few hours or a whole day. I would rate it one of the greatest city parks in the world."
,,First Trip,5.0,,I would the botanic gardens. Such a calm and peaceful place. My girlfriend and I loved the fresh smell of nature especially just after the rain.
,,A very big Garden,3.0,,"The entrance to the Botanical Garden is very near to the MRT Station. Unfortunately, we cannot finish all the places in the Garden as it is too big. We came around 9 am also, so the weather is quite hot. Overall, this place is relaxing and free."
,,Orchid delight,5.0,,"This hidden treasure is so wonderful. We visited as part of a city tour but you do need to go by car, taxi or coach as there is no public transport to it. We spent only 45 minutes there but I could spend much longer. We only saw the orchid section and loved the area where they show which orchids they have planted following visits from other nations.
Well presented and reasonably priced cold drinks are available towards the exit.
Great place which I hadn’t expected much from. Thanks"
,,Lovely garden,5.0,,It was nice visit for the kids. We saw the big Lizard. Clean garden with plenty of plants. Staff are very helpful and respectful
,,Beautiful and the only place to buy gold dipped orchids,5.0,,Highly recommend visiting and the orchid garden within. A visual spectacular. Wild life and amazing gardens but be warned super warm and steamy through the gardens. Food and beverage available. Free to enter main park but small fee for orchid garden which is well worth it. My parents bought me a gold dipped Singapore orchid for me 30 year s ago and I took my daughter there to buy one for her. Wonderful gifts but take a picture of your passport to claim back tax. And... Take plenty of water and comfortable shoes
,,Very peaceful and relaxing.,5.0,,A great place to lose a day if you love gardens. Easy to get to by metro. Take a picnic. A top attraction
,,A good day out,4.0,,"If you are a garden lover, this is the place worth the visit. You could spend the whole day there. Very impressive!"
,,It is a nice garden but lacked the wow factor.,3.0,,We had a nice afternoon wandering around this garden but it lacked serendipity. It is a nicely designed garden but it didn't really have any special features or anything that made you go wow. It needs more colour and more creativity and thought in the design.
,,A Small paradise within an Island,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, never forget to visit the this wonderful place and it is for free. Nicely landscaped , huge garden with a pleasant relaxing environment. Easiest way to get there is to take the MRT (botanical gardens Station) Downtown or Circle Line.

Most important thing is to see the Singapore National Orchid Garden. you will see a Wide variety of Orchids which are nicely organised. Wonderful place to visit. Worth every penny you spent.

,,Thank you!,5.0,,The place is stunning and a tribute to Singapore where space is a premium. Whilst I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the Gardens i have to give massive thank you to the staff at the main gate. I lost my phone but within a very short period it was back in my hands. Singapore; you are the best!
,,Wonderful day of relaxation,5.0,,It was wonderful to spend 4 relaxing hours away from busy Singapore. The orchid garden was beautiful but the whole garden is quiet & peaceful. I would recommend this as a way to spend time in Singapore away from the hustle and bustle.
,,Had a wonderful Walk through zone Morning,5.0,,"We walked though this area as part of an extended walk and were very impressed.

The Gardens are quite impressive and well used and covers many hectares of area. There is also a special area just for kids.

This location is well worth the effort to visit"
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens - not to be missed,5.0,,"I visited the Singapore Botanic Gardens in October 2017. It was a hot day (as most are in Singapore) - so be sure to take a hat or sun umbrella (I had both). I traveled to the Botanic Gardens on the Hop-On, Hop-Off buses that I had bought a pass for the duration of my stay. You cannot begin to imagine how big these gardens are. You really need at least a whole day, from early morning to night, to fully appreciate all it has to offer. Unfortunately, I misjudged the timing so needed to edit the places I had the time to see. There are many maps available and signage to help you find your way through the large garden areas. I also took the time to rest and have brunch at one of the restaurants on site which was tasty and well-priced. This truly is a wonderful place to visit and the variety of plants and flowers is astounding, different and very beautiful."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,The gardens are free to enter but on a rainy day in January we were just sloshing along waterlogged paths looking at nothing very much - sadly there are no plant identification markers. The best bit is undoubtedly the orchid house for which there is an admission fee.
,,Good spot for a walk and relax,5.0,,"Good spot for a walk and relax in big city. It's a huge, took us half a day and still wasn't able to see everything in Botanic Gardens. You can see lots of different plants and animals."
,,Top botanical garden,5.0,,"The 0$ price of admission makes this a must-see. Easy to get to, with the main gate next to an SMRT stop. Lots of different environments, a lake, an open-air concert hall, lots of eating places. I especially enjoyed the Ginger Garden."
,,Important garden of spore,5.0,,"When it was named as UNESCO heritage, I was not surprised. It was in my childhood memory till now. My friend was not surprised too cos he said he cannot imagine a small land scarce Singapore has a big hectare of garden just outside Orchard Road shopping belt. This was when I brought him n Wife there. It was a pleasant walk n they particularly like the orchid n colonial bungalows. The gazebo brings back lots of fond memories of our parents who took photos here when they were teens. .It is indeed an icon of spore. And it kept on improving."
,,Wonderful walking,5.0,,"Be Careful about the rain, it can ruin your visit, but it still beautiful and quiet place to read a book and walk slowly"
,,A relaxing garden to visit,4.0,,"Wonderful experience came alone for a run whilst in the city. Super relaxing and so much to see. The wildlife and nature is just so lovely to be around and again something so April that singapore has to offer ! I wouldn't recommend this as a full day out as you can walk around the whole place in under an hour but if you want to take your time then maybe you could go for a few hours!
Relaxing and beautiful"
,,interesting gardens,3.0,,I took the free Saturday walking tour of the Medicinal garden. It had promise to be educational but the guide ended up reading the signs not sharing other information. There's a good food court near the Medicinal garden for refreshments. I visit alot of botanical gardens thus the average rating.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Must visit when in Singapore! Just beautiful and peaceful. Take your most comfortable shoes and spent a day at the gardens.
,,A great day out,5.0,,"Our favourite place in Singapore. A lovely variety of flora, tons of birds, water monitors and turtles. Perfect for a wander or a picnic or a yoga session."
,,Very nice park for the people of Singapore,4.0,,"We were pleasantly surprised by this attraction. It is more like a city park for locals--we had thought it was a tourist attraction that charges admission fee. Except for one section, the entire park is free."
,,One of the most famous in the world,5.0,,There is a great history here going back to colonial days. all very well laid out and it includes the famous Orchid Gardens which is a speciality in itself.
,,An oasis of beauty and calm in the middle of a bustling city state,5.0,,"This garden looks big on the map and is even larger in person, running nearly 2 Km from north to south. We chose to take the MRT to the Botanic Garden station at the north end, and walk south through the garden. Admission is free, which surprised us. There are many sub areas in the park, so you are unlikely to see them all in a single visit. Like everything else in Singapore, the entire park is spotless and impeccably maintained. The pathways integrate beautifully with the landscape, and many are lit for night use. Signage in the park is very well done, so one can quickly study the signs at each path intersection, and decide which way to go to see individual areas. All paths lead to the Orchid Gardens in the southern third of the park. We exited the south end of the park and walked to the Orchard Road MRT station, stopping to shop along the way, for the trip back to our hotel. I can see how this park is popular with visitors and locals alike."
,,Beauty all the way,5.0,,"Was not able to walk through the entire garden, but this is a place where you can see all sorts of flowers bloom"
,,Orchid Garden at Singapore Botannical Gardens,5.0,,"As part of a half day City Tour we visited the Orchid Garden at Singapore‘s Botannical Gardens. What a delightful place! Everywhere we walked we saw beautiful flowers in well tended garden beds and imaginative cultivation of orchids on tree branches and trellises. So lovely! An extensive range of jewellery, scarves and cloth bags displaying attractive orchid designs were available though prices were quite high. As our tour guide said you could easily spend two hours to do the Orchid Garden justice."
,,Great gardens,5.0,,"We went on the hop on hop of bus tour and decided to get off at the garden, we were so pleased we did. This was a lovely afternoon walking in some beautiful garden. They are well kept and clean with good facilities ( plenty of bathrooms and cafes which were reasonably priced with lots of options). We also enjoyed the orchid garden, which there was a small fee for.
We would have stayed longer had a storm not arrived. Definitely worth a stop here!"
,,Always lovely,4.0,,"Beautiful any time of the day but probably best to go early to avoid the heat and humidity. In the morning you will see groups of women doing yoga and aerobics, older Singaporean men and women doing tai chi and other people jogging and walking dogs. There’s a nice place to stop for a cool drink, snack or coffee called Bee’s Knees. There are other places, both upscale and casual, to eat too. Sundays tend to be crowded as it’s the helpers’ day off and many flock to the gardens."
,,Good relaxing place,4.0,,"This is perfect for a day out, nice and clean, And you must go to orchid garden. There is few options for food and drinks, So you can spend the whole day around"
,,Fantastic when not to hot,5.0,,"Visited the Botanic Garden in December 2017 during a overnight stay with a cruise ship. The first day we spend in the Gardens at the Beach and the second in the Botanical Gardens.
It is amazing how a beautiful garden is just hidden is the buzzing city. You can work for hours. The Rainforest and the Orchid garden are a must do. Make sure you have enough memory free in your camera or smart phone. We started at ten in the morning a left by four in the afternoon. The botanical garden is easily reachable by the subway."
,,beautiful gardens,5.0,,"good open spaces for children to roam.. phenomenal variety of plants.. if going by public transport, please note that the mrt is at one corner of the gardens.. you will need to take the bus if u walk to the other end or vice versa"
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Be there

If u like nature pristine

If u like flora and fauna
and clear water ponds with lotus floatin
If u like air tinged with smell of the soil

If u like walking

and plain catching up with ur SELF being"
,,Family outing,5.0,,One of the best garden to visit as a family. There are many type of plants and tress. Exhibitions on plant. There are food and beverages stors so no need to bring your own.
,,All green and fresh,5.0,,Do visit botanic gardens once during your visit. Its is one of the quite inserting place out of all tourist attractions to go for .
,,Wonderland,4.0,,"To have this piece of tropical paradise in the midst of the city is nothing but incredible. The sprawling gardens are maintained very well with walkways and signage. The orchid garden is a highlight one should not visit. Plan a day for this place so that you can enjoy it in leisure.

PS - carry an umbrella or hat for protection from the odd rain and the afternoon sun."
,,nature in the heart of spore city,5.0,,I like the history of this old-maiden. The surround is so natural and the smell of nature is all around. Visitors are really at peace with themselves in nature here.Lots of trees that are as old as the city-state itself.
,,A bit of heaven in Singapore,5.0,,"I'm generally not one for botanic gardens, but my daughter wanted to go, so I relented. What a pleasant surprise, although there a lots of beautiful flowers and other local flora, your are not overwhelmed by floral exhibits. It's just a beautiful, well organised park and a great place to walk and check out the views. By all means, pay the gardens a visit."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"A wonderful place to visit for a nice long walk, you can either enter through the Tanglin Gates or the Botanical Gardens MRT on the other end of the garden. Kids friendly place and suitable for a good time outdoors if the weather permits."
,,World Heritage site and the third Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"It is Singapore's first World Heritage site and the third Botanic Gardens to be listed as a World Heritage Site, after Kew Gardens in England and the Padua Gardens in Italy.

On weekends, friends and families enjoy a stroll at the Gardens, or watch musical performances at the Symphony Lake - a long-standing tradition that dates back to 1861."
,,A paradise,5.0,,"There is not much to say, it's a paradise on God's own island. Words are not enough to express the beauty of this garden. It's a ""must"" for every traveller to Singapore."
,,Great for early morning runs!,5.0,,It is a beautiful park. All trees and plants are in impeccable condition. Nice places to eat or have a coffee and also very suitable if you want to work out on a sunday morning! Very happy to live close to this park.
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,While enjoying the beautiful flora and fauna don’t forget to check out the food court. We visit during Christmas so we were able to watch the light show which was amazing! It was of course crowded though it was a Thursday evening.
,,UNESCO site,5.0,,Singapore Botanic Garden is an UNESCO site. I imagine this to be a less visited attraction by tourists because there is really nothing much to see but trees and plants. But Botanic Garden has re-invented itself. Other than botany now they organise events during weekends to attract more visitors. I had been to a few of these concerts in the park and the picnic atmosphere was great. The Jacob Ball as children garden is also a nice place for children.
,,Great,5.0,,This is a lovely garden easily accessible by bus or train. It is divided into different gardens but be warned it's huge bring plenty of water although there are cafes there. The orchid garden has a small fee but it's well worth it. It is all well maintained and clean. The walk in the rain forest was lovely and round the lake.
,,Amazed by full of trees and flowers,5.0,,"After rainfall the other night, walking around Botanic Garden in the morning was so refreshing. Orchid garden, recommended by staff as hot spot within the whole garden, was hilarious to see exotic orchid flowers. But some of spots were closed due to renovation work. Car parking took little time to enter."
,,Walk,5.0,,Really enjoyed walking around and the views was amazing so much to see as well We got there by the hop on hop off bus
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It was a great day, to walk around this lovely garden. we would highly recommend visiting the National Orchid Garden - the types of Orchid were just breathtaking"
,,Good Large Gardens,4.0,,"Large Gardens we entered via the Botanic Gardens MRT Stop and walked through the Gardens to the other end spent a bit of time strolling around, good and relaxing. Got the bus back to town rather than walk back to the MRT."
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"If you are only going to see one garden in Singapore chose gardens by the bay, but this is a close second. The orchid garden is a clear stand out and worth paying to enter, but I spent a whole morning exploring the rest of the extensive grounds. You certainly wouldn’t need to spend this long there to get a feel for the place, but it really is very big! It is a place with an interesting history, which you can read about on signs throughout the garden. There are food places scattered through the garden but most are expensive for Singapore, for cheap local food there is a hawker Center at the Raffles building."
,,Excellent garden,5.0,,"Excellent garden!!!! Many things to see. The only negative is even January still hot ♨. This is Singapore!! However is a very clean and well arranged garden. If you ever visit Singapore, it is good to include to your tour schedule."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Just so many amazing features to see in Singapore but a must do is the botanical gardens. Featuring fauna from all over the world, superbly designed and presented and assessable for people with disabilities. The actual structure of the two domes and how the interior has been erected is awe inspiring. Be prepared to spend quite a few hours here."
,,Landscape... Heritage site... Mind blowing.,5.0,,"If in Singapore and loves to watch greenery and connects to nature then this place is definitely your cup of tea.
I am overwhelmed with the beauty of this place. The lakes, the orchid garden, the pair of black swans, the waterfall.
There is do much to admire.
It is among one of the finest gardens I have ever visited.
The place consists of cafes and gifts shop.
Connectivity is easy either by bus or mrt.
The heritage part is an added bonus to the visitors.
Conclusion..... beautiful place to spend quality time with kids and family.
Heaven for natue lovers and fitness freak's.....a must visit place."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"We enjoyed a beautiful Saturday in the Singapore Botanic Garden. Although busy on the weekend, the garden is so large that the number of guests is not a problem. We came upon a toucan playing in the trees and many other birds, and appreciated the great diversity in the gardens and that most plants and trees were labeled. Our only disappointment was that we could not go in the children's garden because we did not have children with us--being ""children at heart"" wasn't enough! We did enjoy coming upon a class of preschool children on lawn mats who were praying with their teacher and thanking God for their lunch and and his beautiful creation in the garden. Amen!! Although difficult to choose, our favorite areas were the tropical rain forest and the heliconia walks, and Iggy the iguana. A sincere ""thank you"" to the garden management and the country of Singapore for keeping the admission free so this beauty is accessible to all!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Really enjoyed visiting this place to get away from the usual city vibes. You can easily spend a whole day there or half a day and see a decent amount of it.

We caught hop on/off bus to get there but the MRT also has a stop there which we used to get back into the city and found very easy.

The drinks In Halia restaurant are amazing considering they do not serve alcohol."
,,Relaxing park in the middle of the city,4.0,,Definitely a beautiful area to walk through. Nice place to walk and have a conversation with someone. Be ready to walk a kilometer or two and just enjoy the plant life
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Escape the heat in the shade under giant trees: experience all possible nuances of green and all forms of leaves; a fantastic contrast to the hectic city life around the park!
,,Don't miss the orchids!,5.0,,There are so many things to see that we couldn't see them all. Most of the garden is free. You have to pay for the orchid exhibit but it is fantastic and well worth it! (Also discounted for those over 60.) Take a walk and enjoy plants from all over Asia. The people watching is great also. Another highlight is the architectural drawing exhibit.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,We visited the beautiful gardens and rode the trolley around the park. Very nice tour! Many families and children at the park enjoying their day.
,,Wow factor,5.0,,"What a truly beautiful garden. It was hard to know where to look and just how many varieties of plants were in the Garden. It is a beautiful, peaceful place to relax and enjoy nature."
,,A real delight - by day or night,5.0,,"Another 'must do' for visitors to Singapore, chock-full of pleasant experiences. It attracts, joggers, walkers, romantic lovers and families getting back to nature. Easily deserving its ranking as a World Heritage Site, every few steps reveal a new vista of trees and plants from around the world, or a peaceful lake, a specialist garden or relaxation area. Highlights include the Orchid Garden and restaurants - Halia and The Villa - which are fantastic though well above food-court level. When dark descends, the effect is stunning. The lighting is stunning and effective, making this a real day-or-night attraction."
,,Relaxing atmosphere,5.0,,The gardens are a welcome oasis from the crazy city - I would recommend visiting early morning though as it was so hot to walk around are lunchtime when we visited. There are various areas to explore and the rainforest part is great - bring water to drink though as it's a large park and can be draining in the heat. It's great seeing all the plants though and very calming.
,,The best if seen,5.0,,"Wow what gardens, Could of stayed there for hours and hours. Very Clean, Large,Lots of walking,with beautiful atmosphere"

It’s a photographers dream. There are excellent shots everywhere. For gardeners, they are in heaven. Enjoy the flowers as you walk through the park enjoying the fantastic views. A Must Do Activity."
,,Don’t miss this walk,5.0,,"I took several hours to meander around the garden, rainforest, swan lake and orchid garden. Wow! A really down the earth way to spend Your time in the midst of this tech city. Give Yourself the time to walk around and then sit down and then walk a bit more and then sit down again and then walk again..."
,,UNESCO world heritage,3.0,,"The only heritage site in Singapore is the Botanic Gardens, it is easily accessible by either bus or MRT. The entrance to this place is free and the place is very big and divided into different section. We had a bad experience whereby we booked a valentine day dinner with Halia but due to night time we couldn't find the way and took us a while to find. I am not really a person that appreciate the plants and trees though, but during the day the place is very beautiful."
,,Easy trip in Singapore,5.0,,Great day out for orchid lovers. Free to enter world heritage site. Extra charge for orchid collection. Great chance to see hummingbirds and monitor lizards up close and feed turtles and fish in the lake for $1. Easy to find on the underground.
,,Great experience,5.0,,Absolutely a great experience if you like nature. It's so calming with a great view. I've been here with my friends for hours :)
,,Beautiful. Breathtaking. Legs turned into jello,4.0,,"It was an amazing place. Sprawling land filled with nature. A museum of flowers. If you like walking alot. People jogging, children running around. A serene park. Though hard to catch a taxi sometimes."

,,Amazing orchids,5.0,,"We walked around the Botanical Garden and paid 1 US$ senior citizens prize to visit orchids garden it’s has many kinds of orchids and they are amazing beautiful! We as small group of tourists it is a must see! We enjoyed every minute of the walk ,there’s a bench everywhere that you can sit and relax all over the garden"
,,Great gardens but watch those crazy buggy drivers! NOTE-various areas of the Orchid Garden are closed!,3.0,,"These gardens are beautiful, well laid out and well maintained. However they are very extensive so staff travel around on golf buggy type vehicles and small commercial carts. They fly around, so keep your wits about you.
If you are thinking of going into the Orchid Gardens note that several areas are closed pending development, including two houses (both) and the Bromeliad enclosure. There was no apparent warning of this before you bought your tickets and it was obviously a source of frustration for some visitors."
,,Allow time to wander and enjoy,5.0,,"I went first with a tour and had to go back on my own to enjoy the beauty without being rushed. Allow about 3 hours if you can and don’t miss the orchid garden. Tip: if you go by taxi, get dropped off at the gate by the visitor center so you are close to the orchid garden but go to the Orchard Road exit when you leave. I waited maybe two minutes for a taxi. Also don’t miss the Ginger Garden. The waterfalls and giant lily pads are gorgeous. If we come back to Singapore, this will always be on my list to visit."
,,Green and lush.,5.0,,We had a lovely walk around these beautiful gardens. There is so much to see and enjoy if you like gardens. The Orchid Garden is inside so that is an added bonus.
,,Orchid garden,4.0,,"Fantastic display of hundreds of orchids of all sorts and colours. Good tip, visit the ginger garden first as it is a little underwhelming after the Orchid garden."
,,Peaceful and Beautiful,5.0,,We walked around the garden and it took 2 hours. There are a lot of big trees and landscape is so beautiful. We walked on a bridge and enjoyed the upper viewing
,,A vast area of gardens with so much to see,4.0,,A vast area of different things to see in the gardens. Well signposted and accessible for disabled people too. We like the swan lake and exploring others areas of the gardens. it is possible to spend 2 or 3 hours at least. recommended for those who like the great outdoors
,,Don’t miss this,2.0,,"The botanic gardens are a must see in Singapore. Easy to reach by MRT.
There is a 5$fee to the orchid displays which were a highlight. Only 1$ for seniors.
You could spend hours here just enjoying the gardens.
Recommend going early to avoid the heat.
Had a lovely pastry and coffee in their cafe.
Lovely gift shop but pricey."
,,Very lovely garden and funny turtles,5.0,,We loved this garden. Especially the orchid section. The turtles in the large pond were very fun to watch.
,,Outstanding & Free,5.0,,"This is one of the best places to visit in Singapore and it’s free (except for orchid garden). A very peaceful way to spend half a day or just to stroll through on your way somewhere. I suggest those unable to bear the shopaholics experience in Orchard Rd should come here and wait for others while they shop themselves stupid!
Many fascinating species of trees and shrubs here in their natural habitat plus some nice little creatures amongst them. Bliss!"
,,Can spend whole day here,5.0,,Great place for a picnic or just walking around on a beautiful afternoon or evening. Day time sun is too hot so I'd go after sunset or early in the morning.
,,An oasis of calm.,5.0,,"Even in the rain it was worth spending a few hours in these immaculately maintained tranquil gardens. Entrance is free and it is easy to reach via the MRT. There's even a station named Botanic Gardens to help you orient yourself! We went expressly to visit the orchid collection but equally enjoyed the heritage trees, palm grove and rain forest. There are informative boards at regular intervals explaining the significance of the specimens in relation to the history of Singapore and the role it played in the development of forest products internationally. Despite studying geography to degree level, I still learnt a lot, including the fact that the banana and several other tropical plants are members of the ginger family. Highly recommended if you have time."
,,Botanical gardens,5.0,,"This is a place with lush greenery, calm, quiet and tranquil spots for me in Singapore to spend a whole day walking with my family through the winding walkways of colours of freshly bloomed Orkids, many varieties of palms and many tropical magic of green.
For me, as a flora & fauna lover , I felt this was where I belonged. A full day past without knowledge.
There is a MRT @ 900.Meters from the Swan lake and buses & Taxi is available on the main road near the entrance.
Always take with you water, some snack to have during a short rest and never forget an umbrella or a use & throw raincoat.
If you love nature you will never want to leave this place."
,,Beautifully-designed and an excellent way to spend the day,5.0,,"This is a must-do during your stay. The garden is big, peaceful, clean and very affordable at $5 an adult. They are very nice to offer free tours every Saturday a few times a day."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Maybe tue Mist wonderful botanical garden I've been so far . It's huge - very clean and well maintained . We loved it and could have spent lot more hours in this paradise in middle of a busy noisy town.
,,Beautiful Must Visit Place,5.0,,It is a beautiful widely spread out garden which is a must visit by all. The orchids are beautiful and the overall look of the place is simply mesmerising. One can spend a whole day here.
,,Great place to relax,4.0,,"This is a wonderful place to spend a day if it isn't too hot or it isn't raining as it can get very humid and sweaty. I really liked the variety of plants here and how they were arranged. The orchid garden is one of the best I have seen, and well worth the effort to get here, even if you see nothing else. With the Downtown MRT line now in place access is easy."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Free. Oasis from the concrete in the city. Give yourself plenty of time, its longer walks in a humid climate. Popular for picnics."
,,Forest in the city,5.0,,"Nice place to hang out with young children. Away from the bustling street, you can see many students doing reading and research there as it is near to the NUS campus. There is a children playground. The flowers and the ambience reminded us the park at Kyoto."
,,City Nature,5.0,,"Had a beautiful walk through the garden, enchanted by the sound, the smell and the beauty of nature in the heart of the City"
,,Botanical Garden - Nice and Calm Place,4.0,,"Botanical garden is a nice and calm place. It has very less crowd compared to many other tourist attractions in SG. But for those who love nature and who love calmness, this is a good place. Orchid garden is inside the Botanical garden. If you visit, you can also see Orchid garden."
,,Calming and stunning,5.0,,I spent about 5 hours wandering through here including the orchid gardens. Its just lovely. So many fabulous walks and so so green. There are so many gardens within the gardens to explore.

,,Nice Gardens,5.0,,"Natural, and beautifull places, very well organized, and highly educated. suitable to bring family to relax enjoy the holiday"
,,Nice to wander,4.0,,"Pleasant and a nice place to wander but not terribly exciting or interesting. Good to see it has UNESCO heritage listing though. And I was interested to learn (elsewhere), that an earlier iteration of it on Government Hill was started by Raffles to investigate viable crops for the region. It was instrumental in developing a viable rubber industry."
,,DO NOT MISS IT,5.0,,I am not a great flower or garden person however these gardens are outstanding. They are maintained immaculately and should not be missed. They are a real credit to Singapore. Anyone with an interest in gardening could easily spend at least a day here.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,We travelled to the gardens on the MRT. The stop is right at the botanic gardens. What aa pleasant walk to get to any of the gardens. We specifically went to the orchid gardens and we were ot disaapointed. They were lovely and very peaceful. Such a beautiful part of the gardens. The walk from the MRT to the orchid gardens is pleasant. Well worth the trip.
,,I love going to this garden!,5.0,,"This is one of the best structured and well-maintained gardens I have been to. Even if you don't like plants, I recommend you giving this place a try. It is beautiful and serene and is a great place for brisk jogs or walks with the family. The area of the garden is quite large and there are multiple routes to different parts of the garden (so bring a map as it is easy to get lost).

They have an impressive diversity of plants and house one of the biggest collections of orchids (for an additional fee entrance fee) for those who may be interested. I thought their orchid section was definitely worth a visit.

Conclusion: if you have time to spare, need to resettle your mind, or love plants—come visit this garden! Plus, admission is free."
,,Fresh Sanctuary in Singapore,4.0,,"This garden was very big. They have some garden sections in there, include National Orchid Garden.
To enter this garden is free, but some place need to buy a ticket (e.q. National Orchid Garden). The air is fresh, the pond with turles is relaxing. Many visitor bring a pet while jogging inside the garden.
Since it's so big, maybe we need 4 hours to explore all side of the garden."
,,Good place for relaxation,4.0,,"It is a very big park, you can relax and walk there or ride a bike for morning sports. Recommended for weekend activities."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Spent the whole day in these gardens, so much to see and do. Was so much better than we expected and all free. Except for the orchid garden which is 5 dollars each, however this is well worth the money as it’s beautiful. This is a must do when visiting Singapore. If you get hungry while you’re there we ate at Bee Knees which was really good and reasonably priced."
,,Must-visit,4.0,,Beautiful gardens that are huge. You need many hours to walk through all of it. The ginger-restaurant is lovely. Do not miss the rainforest part!
,,Pristine condition,5.0,,"One of the real highlights of any visit to Singapore - and its free to come in and enjoy. Beautifully cared for tropical and rainforest gardens in an extensive area it is over 2 kilometers long with lovely lakeside walks.
It is a great place to visit, and is kept in a pristine condition, by an army of very dedicated gardeners."
,,"Botanic Gardens always a beauty, UNESCO or not ;)",5.0,,"An oasis irrespective of Unesco Heritage status. Beautiful surroundings, garden in a city, also with performances at the lovely theatre. Enjoy! :)"
,,Great place to spend a lazy day,5.0,,"Really beautifully put together, lots of specimen trees, some interesting hard landscaping and includes the National Orchid Garden. Some fairly cheesy gift shops, but a surprisingly good restaurant. Watch out for local wildlife, including a large monitor lizard... managed to keep my husband awake throughout the day .. so must be interesting even if you don't like plants ( unless he was just humouring me!)"
,,Super place,5.0,,"We went on Sunday, had a bite to eat in one of the restaurants and walked through the spectacular and peaceful orchid garden.
The whole garden is a must see!
Although busy as it was Sunday, it wasn’t that crowded that you wished you hadn’t come... there is loads of space."
,,Peaceful beautiful,5.0,,"How well planned. Maintained and peaceful. Singapore in nature, perfect, clean. Don't miss it, take it all in"
,,Sheer Beauty,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful gardens on earth. A real credit to the people who have developed it & continued with it's preservation as a UNESCO site but also an education centre. If you do nothing else in Singapore, you must do this."
,,Amazing Botanic Garden,5.0,,A diverse collection of plants .It is worth visiting just to experience the orchid section .Wonderful sculptures scattered throughout the gardens .
,,nice place,5.0,,"Easy to reach by MRT...right at the entrance. Good area for walking around. Different kind of plants, good shades howerver there are not single place to eat wihin the compound....I may miss it but I not really see it....still highly recommend."
,,Tryst with nature- amazingly well-maintained gardens,4.0,,"We wanted to do something light on our first day in Singapore, as we had just reached after a long bus ride from KL and only had a couple of hours to spare. We decided to go to the Botanic Gardens as it was a short taxi ride away from our hotel in Robertson Quay.The Gardens are not designed to be a tourist attraction, it is where locals go for their picnic, jog/walk/stroll or just a day out with nature.But there are parts of the gardens where you find more tourists than locals (the National Orchid Gardens for one). Be prepared to walk (a good walking shoe would help) and also carry water and food. There are many lovely areas where you could do a quick picnic. The trees look spectacular and many of them very old (60+ years). The swan lake is pretty with an interesting stone sculpture in the middle. The National Orchid Gardens charges a fee for foreigners and seemed to be the photographers' favourite. It is undoubtedly very beautiful, though i expected a little more flowers. We did not plan our trip very well, so we just walked as we pleased for a little more than 2 hours with some breaks in between. But there are attractions within the gardens, which could be more interesting for children (my 6 year old wasn't too pleased with all the walking and looking at trees!). These close early and hence it is better to plan the visit. Nevertheless, i loved the gardens and it is definitely a good stop to admire nature at its best (and also to avoid the crowds at all the other regular tourist attractions)."
,,Love this park,5.0,,"Always a stop for me in the mornings when I'm in town for business or pleasure, starting the day off with a run in the botanical gardens, watching the locals do tai chi, and take in a yoga session on the grass, love this place, super special."
,,Out of this World.,5.0,,The most beautiful gardens you go to. Just love them. For seniors it’s $1 to go into the National Orchid Garden & it is exquisite. We walked to the gardens from Clarke Quay along the river & canal. A lovely walk.
,,Orchids,5.0,,Beautiful gardens to visit for all orchids and wild life lovers. Plan to spend at least a few hours inside. The garden is pretty big.
,,Wonderful as always,5.0,,Full of new attractions and renovation; easy connection to MRT; Park in a great condition and amazing exuberance.. A must visit in Singapore..
,,Fantastic Garden!,5.0,,"Absolutely fabulous Botanic Garden well worth the visit! Except for the Orchid Gardens, the visit is free and there are some nice restaurants in the Gardens. Good place to spend some relaxing hours."
,,Spend a full day here!,5.0,,"I decided to check this place out since my company loves nature and that kind of stuff.
This place is humongous! There are several gardens that you can actually go see. (Ginger garden, Healing garden, Bonsai garden, etc.). Make sure you get a map at the entrance and then plan your way around. There is gonna be plenty of walking!
Since it is a Botanic garden, you will see plenty of different plant species. The good thing about it is that you can check this place out for free (except for the Orchid garden).
This place is a must visit when in SG."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"The botanical garden is beautiful with several interesting areas. Take a map and make a route and make sure to bring water, sunglasses and a stroller for the younger ones. By the Nassim gate there is a taxi stand. The orchidee garden is worth the entrance fee, but know that some parts of it are currently closed."
,,Beautiful and restful garden,4.0,,"We spend two hours wandering around the garden. It is beautiful, the different trees species are well indicated and explained. You really feel immersed into a tropical forest, just off a MRT station."
,,Lots of walking trails and group exercise opportunities in the morning!,4.0,,"A place to unwind and enjoy the morning Breeze with opportunities to engage in different group exercises. There are a variety of walking trails and whether solo or with friends, there will be something that fits your exercise preferences!"
,,Great,5.0,,Used MRT right to entrance. Nice walk up to Orchid Garden. Our 12 plus visit. A must to see. It was a week end so locals out in force.
,,Great place to get away from the city,5.0,,"Once you arrive in this place, you will feel as though you left Singapore altogether and are transported to another place! You simply leave behind the city and the place is all green and well taken care of. I love the variety of plants. You can spend up to 3 hours in this place! But if you are quick on your feet, the lady at the entrance said you can complete it in under 1.5 hours."
,,So peaceful and beautiful,4.0,,I love these gardens as the are a tropical oasis. You must visit the exquisite orchid garden if you visit. The gardens are large so I recommend that you take water with you. The gardens are easily accessible via the botanic gardens mrt station.
,,Singapore Tranquility.,5.0,,"Whatever your pace - it’s your choice in this beautiful park.
The busy-ness of the city fades into the background as you meander through the paths, past sculptures half seen amongst the scrubs and listen to water from pools, lakes and waterfalls.
If you are seeking a haven from the city this is the place to go to."
,,Nature,5.0,,"This place is definitely worth visiting if you're in Singapore. Different types of plant species found all around the world are visible here. If possible, try visiting in the morning. There is no entry fee for this. And is easily accessible by bus, metro or taxi."
,,Beautiful but wouldn’t go again,4.0,,"The place is beautiful but we went in a very hot day which after some time became a rainy day. The orchid collection is pretty and the place is very clean. Cons: the exit signs are not placed right and we kept walking in circles for 30 minutes until we realized that. It was hard to get out. It is also hard to take taxis. I had to go to the street and start waving so they would notice us. It still took us 20 minutes to get a taxi. Kids would love the place, there are many dogs and places to run around and play."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Absolutely gorgeous gardens. Worth a look. Can get pretty hot go early morning or late afternoon. Got some fantastic photos. Highly recommended
,,Long time since last visit,4.0,,"Although we visit Singapore most years it has been a little while since we were here having concentrated more on the Gardens by the Bay and watching its' development. With the addition of the MRT station at the front gate we felt a visit was due. Sunday morning, not too crowded, it was lovely to wander through this garden. The rainforest walk, through the heliconia's, the sensory garden, quite delightful. Easy walking, cafes available for refreshment, plenty of seats for a break, it was well worth a long overdue visit."
,,Beautiful Park and its for free,5.0,,"This one of the first things we did in Singapore. And I can totally recommend this! You can stroll around the whole park and it is really beautiful, and it is absolutely free of charge. Only the specialised orchid part costs some entry free, but it is absolutely worth it! Go there when you have some free time in Singapore!"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"The best garden I have ever been to. If you like tropical gardens this is the one to come to. There was no entrance fee, but you can pay sg $5 to visit the Orchid garden which is inside the botanical garden , which is well worth it. I have visited the botanical garden in Kyoto in Japan and I thought this one was much better. It was very rainy on the day we went, but there is plenty of cover if you do get a rain storm . My favourite day in Singapore"
,,One of best managed garden,4.0,,In very true sense you see all type of forest found in worldwide It's a mini world It's collection of orchids in orchid garden is attractive You found close contact with beauti of nature here
,,Fantastic garden - enjoyed ever moment,5.0,,"Great garden, wonderful orchids, many named after famous politicians. Restaurant with wonderful drinks"

,,Worth Visiting if you love gardens and outdoors,5.0,,I always visit Botanic Gardens whenever I visit Singapore as I like the greenery of this place.It's rare to find such a big garden in the middle of the city.It's maintained well and has lot of things to explore.
,,Nice gardens,5.0,,"We wandered around the gardens for a few hours, they a nice, however they claim to be one of two gardens only in the world with rainforest, we have pretty spectacular gardens with rainforest at home in Nth Queensland."
,,A world of exotic plants and freshness,5.0,,"It is a place for a great morning walk and fresh air. Here people gather for morning Tai Chi, dance, and exercise. Birds, fishes and animal can be spotted in their natural environment. Small critters and strange insects can be discovered in the primary forest conserved for study and research. It has many stories that encapsulate one’s heart and imagination. A place I never fail to discover new things and learn about myself. A great place to be and return to nature, a place to have serenity and peace."
,,Sanctuary in heart of the city,5.0,,"Taking a stroll through the Botanic Gardens feels like a world away from the hustle and bustle of the busy surrounding streets of downtown Singapore. Just a stone's throw from Orchard Road, it's a great place to take a break from all the frantic shopping and really appreciate the island's natural beauty. The National Orchid Garden is nice if you're into flowers, while the rainforest walk is a great way to see what much of Singapore was like before development. An interesting mix of old English-style garden and Asian tropical forest, the history of the UNESCO heritage listed site - as explained in the numerous signboards posted around the park - is also great to explore."
,,Peaceful break.,5.0,,A lovely lush green place to wander and sit. Opportunity to take in the peaceful atmosphere of the beautiful gardens. We saw a goanna/ lizard digging for worms.
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,We spent several hours wandering around the gardens which were in immaculate condition. It's also free. Local people seem to spend a lot of time here and that's always a good sign.
,,No visit complete without seeing the orchid garden,5.0,,This visit to the National Orchid collection was a highlight of our visit to Singapore. Beautifully laid out with superb specimens at every turn. The plans for the future expansion look even more impressive. Much larger than I expected we spent three hours there. The botanical gardens were also a tranquil haven and we would have explored more if we had time.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"We have never seen so many orchids. Park is beautiful. Was a little let down that during our visit we as tourists had to pay yet huge signs advertised residents go in for free during December .....food expensive. My advice would be to take water, food with especially when going with kids. Well worth a visit"
,,Nature surrounded by high rise,4.0,,I searched for a place of nature in this city of high rises and banks. Finally found it at the botanic gardens. It’s a great park to take a walk or just relax. They also have an healing garden. Very interesting to see sadly too much to remember.
,,Beautiful park oasis in a busy city,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a large and beautiful park space in the heart of Singapore. Visiting is free and there is plenty of onsite parking for those wishing to drive. Toilets and food outlets are located at several points within the park. Several habitats coexist; from rainforests, to well manicured parkland lawns. There is a large lake and plenty of wildlife to be seen. The National Orchid Garden is located within the park. There were multiple plaques detailing the varieties of plants within the park along with signs educating visitors to the habitats. No visit to Singapore would be complete without a visit to this wonderful park; particularly for those with children."
,,The most beautiful place,5.0,,"An absolutely beautiful respite from the hectic city. There is a foliage garden, a healing garden, a herb and spice garden as well as the National Orchid garden (the latter is what you would need to pay to visit).

There are three cool lake areas and many shaded areas where you can cool off before you continue exploring. This place is very easy to get you regardless of your method of travel. You can either get a 7 or 77 bus from Orchard, MRT to Botanical gardens or a taxi."
,,Best Garden,5.0,,One of the best man made botanical garden. Lots of varieties of different plants brought from different countries.
,,WaterFall,4.0,,good place to visit and enjoy the walk thru around the garden. Interesting man made waterfall with all the plants.
,,Nature in its purest,4.0,,An amazing surtounding of flowers and trees in a grat garden architecture wirth of a day visit in nature
,,Interesting Experience at Night,4.0,,It was an interesting experience visiting the place at night.. Even quite scary had not expected it to be so secluded.. definitely had my heart in my mouth for a long time and would not suggest anyone going out there all alone late at night even though Singapore is one of the safest places
,,Beautiful. Worth a visit.,5.0,,Had a wonderful few hours in these beautiful gardens. Free. You have to pay to see the orchids house but it was really cheap. I think £2.50 well worth spending. Would definetely recommend.
,,Great visit,5.0,,"We spent several sweltering hours wandering around the Botanic Gardens - over bridges, sitting on swings, walking jungle boardwalks - and even then we didn't get to see everything. New views kept tempting us on, but tiredness and the humidity finally got the best of us, so we had to leave.
However, this is a great place to bring children to let off stream, particularly as the gardens had a whole area that catered for children. So plant lovers and families alike, there is something here for you all."
,,Truly a great spot for a picnic!,5.0,,"I celebrated my bf's birthday there in one of the sheltered huts. As it was raining very heavily, it was very gloomy but the garden itself was very beautiful. There were many sculptures and notice boards to guide us and give us additional information on the plants."
,,Beautiful spot,5.0,,"A peaceful and relaxing place for a stroll. Also a treehouse play area for kids. My 8 y/o loved the swan ponds and rain forrest walk, all in the city."
,,Oh Those Orchids!,4.0,,"This botanic gardens is one of the great tropical gardens of the world, ranking up there with Bogor's Kebun Raya outside Jakarta. It has been well-maintained since the 19th century, earning it a place on the UNESCO World Heritage list.

You could come here any number of times and find new nooks and crannies to enjoy. But the highlight is undoubtedly the orchidarium, which is well worth the $5 admission fee. The orchids here are stunningly arranged, with the collection including many rare and unique hybrids."
,,Excellent Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Came here with my daughters. It was hot and humid and still the Botanic Gardens are beautiful. I would certainly recommend it to anyone coming to Singapore.

,,Wow Rainforest in the heart of city,5.0,,"You cannot expect a place like this in heart of city except Singapore. True to there culture and heritage, they have kept this gardens with actual natural life of rainforest inside heart of City. Free to access except National Orchid gardens, this place has everything for nature lover. Flora and fauna of a Forrest with facilities of city garden. You have a MRT nearby, kids play area and a swan lake too. Birds paradise and wildlife photographer are not going for jungle safari here."
,,Singappore Botanic Garden,5.0,,It is great place to visit anytime I would suggest we can visit in the morning for a morning run. I feel the garden has to visited only if you have interest in flora.
,,Wonderful and relaxing,5.0,,"It was a pleasure to visit this place. Wonderful , clean , beautiful. Can easily spend a full day here."
,,Favorite place to walk my dog,5.0,,"I love walking my dog in the botanical garden. Our favorite spot is the swan lake. Sunrises are beautiful here as well. A lot of people come over to do yoga and tai chi. We usually just walk around and smell the flowers (be wary of the komodo dragons). Its free if you just want to walk around, I think the orchid garden costs money though. There are also shows on Sundays afternoons in the symphony stage, I think that at 6 pm. They have a beautiful Bonsai trees section."
,,Great Park Design,4.0,,"This is a great place to stop for photos however opening hours are during the hot parts of the day which means that it can become 'uncomfortable'. It is right next the train station, so it is easy to access. Apart from the flower display at the entrance, there is not much of a 'show' inside the park. Needless to say, trails are nice to walk and there is plenty of signage."
,,Garden visit,5.0,,"The gardens are a great place to relax, exercise and view various plantings. Wrong time of year for some flowers but the orchid displays were fantastic. Space is good for all ages."
,,Always beautiful; Many improvements from 20 years ago!,5.0,,"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful, Immaculately maintained, Lived in Singapore during 90's and Botanic Gardens was a must see for visitors. Hard to believe how much better, nicer, and beautiful from the 90's (when it was still a sight to see) . If you're visiting Singapore and not seen recently, do make the detour!"
,,Amazing orchid collection,5.0,,Beautiful botanic garden. Amazing orchid garden. It is marked as UNESCO site. Better go early in the morning. It can be very warm in the afternoon.

,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Each sign of a Singapore is 5 star rating. But this garden, oh my... I am coming second time to see these amazing orchids. Very peacful place for a walk, easy to reach via MRT. FLOWERS PARADISE. I LOVE IT!!!"

,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,These gardens incorporate not only wonderful displays but are a reflection of the history o Singapore itself. A must for anyone visiting Singapore

,,Pretty,4.0,,"We stopped here and looked at swan lake and around. Is very nice, great photo opportunities. Nice to relax"
,,"World heritage, a must-do",5.0,,"Not much more to say than make sure you visit these gardens, they will make any weak heart strong, allow a lame leg to walk, help you forget there is a world outside! It is absolutely beautiful and the presentation of the garden exhibits is really thoughtful. A tip...Raffles Food Court sells really inexpensive good quality food if you don't want to eat inside the gardens, which appeared a bit upmarket for shorts and t-shirts, and pricey. It is only 100m or so outside the gardens and marked on the gardens map. On recommendation by a Singaporean we opted for these gardens over the man-made ones at Marina Bay, we think a much better choice and the crowd is spread out. Highly recommend."
,,A must for orchid lovers,5.0,,"The is such a beautiful park, just outside the main tourist area but easily accessible by metro.

The park itself is immaculate yet full of wildlife. There are areas with specific planting themes and signposted walking routes.

Entry is free but there is a charge to enter the orchid gardens which were the main reason for our visit. Great value for ones and such a wonderful array of orchids."

The grounds are beautiful and it was fun to see local Singaporeans picnicking and relaxing with their families. Definitely be sure to check out the national orchid garden. The variety of orchids is incredible.
,,Day or Night a delight,5.0,,Again Singapore has such an amazing space which is a delight to walk around from the stunning water features to the amazing flora. Singapore is hot so take water and ensure you have comfy clothes.
,,beautiful garden,4.0,,"Beautiful place, you can visit for free, there are several parts. Nice for families with children, in love couples or lonely dreamers ! I went there in december, spent a nice moment discovering the amazing plants, trees, flowers :)"
,,Oasis in the city,5.0,,"We enjoyed several walks through the Singapore Botanic Gardens, which are quite large and seem equally popular with locals and tourists. There were lots of joggers, young families and picnickers on the days we visited. We kept returning to explore different aspects of the gardens. The sounds of the busy city outside are well muted inside this green oasis where you can walk behind a waterfall, gaze at water lilies with very large pads, attract the attention of swans and large fish who clearly hope to be fed and watch squirrels scampering up trees. There appeared to be plenty of dining options and transport links. While the main gardens are free, we'd recommend paying the SGD$5pp entry to the National Orchid Garden inside. We lost count of how many different orchids we saw. The colours were amazing. Allow plenty of time to wander these particular gardens and take lots of photos. They may warrant their own dedicated trip and come highly recommended."
,,Amazingly refreshing,5.0,,"Its an amazing outing venue, The orchid gardens are especially wonderful. Excellent for jog as well. You will need to walk a lot and ofcourse in humid conditions but its worth it."
,,An awesome garden,5.0,,A beautiful garden which also won the Heritage garden title. Lots of flora and fauna and a great place for picnics too.
,,It’s a real sanctuary!,5.0,,"It’s by far my favorite place in Singapore. The types of Orchids you see and the way the gardens are designed is just out of this world. Make sure you dress comfortably and light as there is a lot of walking but there are benches everywhere and you get to sit and meditate and just enjoy the beauty of this place while the birds are singing. Make sure you check the area where the orchids have been named after celebrities, you’ll be surprised"
,,Stunning scenery,4.0,,"Easily accessible by MRT, this garden is huge and you could easily spend a day here. We just came for a few hours and didn’t see the entire garden. The gardens are very well maintained and clean. There are several lakes and you can visit the ginger garden. There is a beautiful orchid garden with a $5 entrance fee for adults. This is definitely worth a visit. The orchids were spectacular - like a picture postcard. This is a lovely spot of nature in the midst of an urban concrete jungle! We went as a couple but this place would be suitable for families too."
,,"Lovely, quiet and reflective",5.0,,"It is such a lovely place to visit and so very well maintained. Easy to get to by either bus or MRT.

The National Orchid Garden has so much to see and should certainly be part of the visit, and for over 60s a mere 1SD to enter this part (I was not asked to proove age). There is a lovely area close by to Orchid Gardens called Palm Valley and others like Swan Lake so nice as well. I was nicely surprised that not long after getting into the park I could not hear the traffic (I had entered via Holland Road which is a busy road) plus you do not see apartment blocks for much of the time in the park.

Certainly good to allow at least a couple of hours and go round slowly to enjoy the nature.

BTW There is a map you can pick up to guide you round. I did see restaurant areas but did not visit any of them. Did take water of course."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Having seen the Gardens by the Bay - it was back to the Botanic Gardens for an amazing re-visit. These gardens are still the place to go for gardens in Singapore. For a delightful wander through tropical gardens we recommend these gardens. While the Gardens by the Bay need to be seen, it is the Botanic Gardens which tipify Singapore. A must to see and you will go back every time you go to Singapore."
,,Good day out with a lunch stop,5.0,,"We used the hop on hop off bus to get to the gardens. I took mum there to see the Orchid Garden which was $5 on entry (the botanic gardens are free). The orchid garden was breathtakingly beautiful and a nice tranquil stop with good information about orchids.

We stopped off for lunch at Halia which is not far from the Orchid Garden. You have to try their fresh juice combinations...very refreshing."
,,Morning walk,5.0,,"A must visit for nature lover. The surrounding is blissful, serene, peaceful, refreshing & wonderful, my favourite place. There's also a mini food Court & souvenir shop near one of the entrance. Also bring along some leftover bread for the large hungry fishes in the pond - It's a very therapeutic experience."

For nature lover, there are two nature forests. Overall this garden is worth a visit for at least half a day."

Truly the very best variety and number of orchids I have ever seen, and so many in bloom. A really delightful half-hour wander through artfully conceived vistas, with occasional places to stop off for family photos. Everyone in our family, from 8-47, loved it, and everyone took great photos. Than back on the bus, all very happy!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,A great place to visit while in Singapore! The flowers are beautiful and the greenery around is so very well maintained. It was awarded the UNESCO World Heritage site recently and I believe rightly so. Don't miss it while in Singapore!
,,National Park of Singapore,4.0,,"This is the national park of Singapore...the entrance is free.

,,"Amazing, sprawling world-heritage botanic gardens - something for everyone!",5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens really are impressive. Beautiful, tranquil, sprawling over 74 hectares (182 acres) with kids play area, fragrant garden, beautiful historic buildings, lakes, a performance stage and so much more. In a tiny island nation of almost 6 million people crammed into less than 720 sq.km you really don't expect anything like this - but once again, Singapore surprises and delights! With an MRT station at it's front door, it's also easily accessible. My friends, who live a couple train stations away, love to come down here and run. My partner and I loved taking our baby for a walk around the place. If I were there alone, I could have happily laid on the grass and taken a snooze. The atmosphere of the place makes you feel instantly relaxed and at ease, and you can put as much or as little energy into your recreation as you choose. Highly recommended! And free entry."
,,A lovely and well organized place to visit,5.0,,"This a free (except for the orchid garden) and lovely place to visit. Very well laid out, good information provided. Accessible by public bus. Probably it is best to visit early in the day as it was hot and humid when I visited in November."

a million miles away in its feeling. Lovely park and a lake packed with catfish and smaller fish. The orchids are stunning and although it’s a relatively small display.- a 10 minute walk through- it’s well worth the few dollars admission. Easy to get to by bus"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Such a tranquil place in the heart of a such a busy city. Arrived to a tropical deluge but after the rain had cleared the plants were vibrant and glistening.

Staff are very helpful and friendly. Thoroughly recommended.
,,A beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"Try a visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens, or go for a morning run here.

,,Convenient place to relax with greenery,5.0,,"It was a cloudy cool morn at the Botanic Gardens.

For decades, people of all ages walked, jogged alone or with others. Parents pushed strollers, owners walked their dogs.
A group of senior citizens led by an instructor warmed up with exercises.
Botanic Gardens is still a favourite backdrop for wedding couples.

I love walking under the cool shade of the trees of all shapes and sizes. The wide open spaces of greenery was a breath of fresh air. Swans were in the lake.
Squirrels and wild chickens could be seen on the grounds.

Information on the names of trees, shrubs and herbs were displayed- even some historical info was included.
It was such a learning journey for me. One can find some peace and quiet away from the bustling city. No one should miss this attraction.

With the Botanics MRT station nearby, it is so convenient."

,,Almost too perfect!,4.0,,Beautiful botanic gardens with separate orchid section (entry fee is 5 dollars for adults). The garden is almost too perfect for my taste. The landscaping is so meticulous and every blade of grass is cut to perfection. Looks almost artificial at times.
,,Jacob ballas children garden more for toddlers and up,4.0,,"Bring anti mozzie patches or spray! Good amount of nature. Restaurant is kind of crowded on weekends. Packing own food is good. Staff is helpful in giving directions, suggesting activities and providing first aid."

Try spotting all the sculptures in the garden for fun!"
,,Largest selection of Orchids in the world,5.0,,Very enjoyable. Met three people from England. One was actually going on the cruise we were going on. Nice way to spend some time.

Plenty of restaurants - as well as drink vending machines throughout. Very dog friendly (but dogs must stay on leash). If you go off the paved paths - do wear shoes suitable for soggy grounds. Also, good place for geo-caching. Open from 5am - midnight - and very well lit/safe after dark."
,,Wonderfully relaxing and beautiful,5.0,,My husband and I visited here on our first full day in Singapore. The gardens are stunning and we did not feel like it was crowded. We were able to stroll around for a couple of hours at our own pace and enjoy the park.
,,Fantastic Gardens,5.0,,"Being a keen gardener I visit national gardens and parks in all the cities I visit. This garden is one of my favourite. Pay the little extra and visit the orchid garden, it is outstanding and provides for many photo opportunities. Be warned though, the orchid garden can get a little busy during peak tourist seasons and weekends. They are currently upgrading the orchid garden. If you have children, the recently extended children's garden will keep them busy while adults can do an interesting walk through small section of regrown rainforest."
,,So very beautiful!,5.0,,This already is a very good reason to travel to Singapore! The gardens are so well kept and beautiful! Make sure you have a full day time to walk around!
,,lovely place and free,5.0,,The gardens are lovely and there are lots of different sections. You have to pay to go in the Orchid gardens but they are beautiful. The tour bus stops there or get a taxi
,,Nice garden,5.0,,Good to walk your dogs there. Nice and clean environment. Pet friendly. Not forgetting to mention the nice porridge at Casa Verde.
,,Beautifully maintained !!!!,4.0,,"Our Singapore Fellow members took us on a afternoon tour to Singapore Botanic Gardens. Within the Botanic Gardens, visitors need to pay an entrance fee of $5 to enter into The National Orchid Garden . From here the trail took us into the biggest orchid garden in Asia & Ginger Garden which showcases various varieties of Orchids & Ginger. It is amazingly beautiful with different floral pattern and colours. Some orchids exude a lovely scent. The ginger blossoms are also fragrant.
Inside the Burkill Hall, it displays some posters. The Hall is airy with high ceiling but
not with any sitting facilities. The rain came which gives us no alternative but to stay inside this hall while waiting for rain to stop. We would see more of this Unesco Heritage Site if not for the heavy rainfall. But surely we shall return to explore more in the future !!!!"
,,A Slow Stroll,3.0,,"As it was free entry to the orchid garden for Singaporean during the school holidays, my sister and I brought my mom to the botanic garden. We took bus and alighted at Gleneagles Hospital and walked in. We got to walk through the garden then reached the orchid garden. The orchids are really beautiful and gorgeous, my mom loves it. As some areas were having work in progress, we didn't get to see more as before. It will be very tiring to walk the whole garden, so it will be good to decide where you want to go."
,,Don’t miss the Orchid Garden,4.0,,"It is a pleasant walk from the SMRT station to the Orchid Garden. You will see plants that you don’t see often or don’t know they exist. If you like flowers don’t miss the Orchid Garden though you have to pay $5 for entertaining. (The Botanic Garden is free). The VIP section showcases new varieties especially cultivated for important visitors to Singapore. You might not find them elsewhere in the world. A reminder: if you come here from a temperate region, do go there in the morning or evening."
,,"A gentle stroll through beautiful, serene gardens.",5.0,,"We went for lunch within the Botanic Gardens and just the walk to the restaurant made us want to spend the rest of the afternoon there... it was beautiful, serene and large enough to wander around aimlessly for hours with lovely little hidden gardens and the special Orchid garden. I loved the lakes, with swans, koi and the flora and fauna were amazing. We watched a snake half way through eating a lizard and the turtles and enormous great monitor lizards just ambling along and going about their business in amongst the people wandering through the gardens. It’s a beautiful, serene place to spend a few hours."
,,Beautiful and extensive gardens,4.0,,"This is a well set out garden in the middle of Singapore. It is very extensive and I didn’t get to see it all. You do need quite a bit of time to get around it. I spent a lot of time in the orchid garden. They were absolutely beautiful. So many species of orchids. The signage can be a bit confusing and it did feel a bit like a maze when trying to exit this area. You don’t have to pay to enter the gardens, only for some of the displays and even then it wasn’t too expensive. A well worth visit. Just remember the humidity levels and take bottled water."
,,Very large; beautiful place,5.0,,"We didn't manage to get around the whole park even though we were there for a full day! From what we did see, we were really impressed! Beautiful flowers, trees, pathways, etc. We seen a wedding which was lovely, such a nice setting. We met a few large lizards which was really strange, but amazing to see wildlife enjoying the gardens as much as us. I would definitely recommend visiting in summer when all the flowers are in full bloom. If I were to visit again I would order a taxi to collect us later in the evening, so that we would see more (we got the hop on/off bus, which finished at 5pm). This place is perfect for families and small children. There is quite a bit of walking involved if you want to see all round the gardens so remember water and sunscreen. Wear comfy shoes!"

Bring a hat, some water although there is also a coffee shop there, sun screen and wear comfortable shoes - the garden is big."

Don't leave Singapore without spending half a day at least, in this lovely place!"
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"I had to work at the NUS Bukit Timah Campus for 3 days. I took the MRT there and had to walk through the Botanic Gardens every morning and evening. It was a pleasant start and end to my working day.

There is a wonderful Orchid garden as well as a garden full of edible plants, herbs and fruits which is fun to explore.

Not to worry if you get hungry as the wide variety of food options range from Asian to Western and from food court to fine dining.

Situated right next to Orchard Road, the city's mine shopping belt and with its own MRT station just outside, accessing it is a breeze for all."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Allow at least three or four hours to do the Botanic Gardens justice. Buses are easy to use to get there and take a packed lunch. So peaceful and tranquil. Make sure you have plenty of battery as you’ll want to take lots of photos. Stunning!
,,Refreshing Big Garden in Town,5.0,,"I guess this is the 4 times i visited sing botanical gardens and i still love tjis garden.
Location ia very easy to reach and this time i go with my 2 kids and they love the place which they can see swan lake, big garden, trees and play with many activties.
And btw this is free of charge entry...

#singapore should be proud of having this great well maintained public facility"
,,Green oasis in the urban jungle,5.0,,"Must visit place while in Singapore. Beautiful grounds, very good and informative gardens within the garden, so many different trees, bushes, plants and flowers. Amazing orchid garden. Did not get a chance to see all of it; this place is huge. Great way to spend the afternoon after a looooong flight."
,,Skip this place; don’t care about customers,1.0,,"Booked 30 people for a pleasant evening meal. The only positive thing is the nearby botanical garden. Meal was forgettable and poor. Service abysmal and they could care less about the customer. Tables not set up as asked; they argued. Then they served “family style” dishes for each table (nice concept) but NOT ENOUGH PORTIONS ON THE PLATES FOR EACH PERSON!!! For instance, at our table of 8 people, they served a basket with 4 rolls only and a chicken dish with only 6 pieces!!! When we complained, they only brought more portions for some of the food AND THEN CHARGED US EXTRA ON THE BILL. So we paid extra just to have one portion per person, when they knew exactly how many people we were going to be. The waiters and waitresses were totally disinterested during the meal and the manager at the end totally unapologetic. You could see that customer satisfaction was the LAST thing on his mind.
See the botanical gardens and stay away from the 2 restaurants in the park (same management and kitchen).
By the way, food quality was only average. Nothing special and certainly nothing memorable except the bad experience."
,,Very nice,4.0,,"I visited the Orchid Garden and really it was very beautiful. Also the way to the orchid garden was very quiet and nice. You can run here or just stroll and enjoy the beautiful plants, Trees, Bushes etc"
,,The Ultim,5.0,,The entrance to the garden was less than 10 meters out it the MRT Tube. I went from metal and concrete to the huge tropical garden just that fast! It’s a bit of a walk to see things but I don’t remember any steps. The orchid garden was the largest and most lavish I have ever seen. I have shown just a few of the photos. This is one of the prime jewels of Singapore. Many thanks for the treat!
,,See the orchids,5.0,,"We visited on a very hot day, but it was worth the walk. Parts are World Heritage site. The orchid garden alone is worth seeing, but the whole park is enormous and beautiful."
,,"Large, rambling park with special interest sections",4.0,,"The Botanical Gardens are mostly an expanse of lawns and ponds where families come for a picnic. There are special points of interest such as the ginger garden, bonsai display and the trail through rain forest that are worth visiting if you seek a special experience. There are a few restaurants and take-away services that can be easily overwhelmed by crowds."
,,A really good free thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a great afternoon out, weather permitting.
This is a big sight, so be prepared to do a lot of walking. If you arrive by train, you are on one end of the gardens, the opposite to the Garden shop. So if you want food you have to walk quite a way in.
A lot of people brought picnics with them and sat on the grass, which I would do next time we visit."
,,"Orchids, Orchids",5.0,,"A must go while in Singapore. So many varieties of plants, flowers and orchids. So many great photo opportunities. The Special Orchids are unusually beautiful. We didn’t have time but the restaurant looks great."
,,Amazing Gardens,5.0,,"A must see garden in Singapore, just expect to do a lot of walking to see it all. It’s worth the time. The orchid garden is amazing and worth the fee"
,,Wonderful gardens,4.0,,"The gardens are easy to get to on MRT or buses. There are many ways that you can walk through with about 2kms from the MRT entrance to the Orchard Rd/Napier Rd exit. Symphony Lake was beautiful, overlooking the theatre/stage was excellent, sculptures, animals/birds, Ginger Gardens, Orchid Gardens - all lovely. There's a shortage of toilets!"
,,Nice Park,5.0,,"Beautiful Gardens complete with Turtles , Squirrels , Fish and some amazing bird life , we saw a Hornbill up close.
Lots of people kicking back having a picnic with the family , Joggers and Dog walkers , Lovers and everyone in between just enjoying this lovely Park."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,Went to the Botanical Gardens last Saturday.....what can I say....absolutely beautiful. This is a must see if you visit Singapore!
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"We went to these gardens using the hop-on hop-off bus, a great way to see around a city for the first time. The gardens are magnificent, if you are a garden lover like us it is a must. Being so near to the equator the plants are out of this world, we spent a good few hours there and still did not see it all. Morning is the best time as it tends to pour down in the afternoons. A must see is the orchid garden, this is a UNESCO site and lives up to it in a brilliant way. If you need a rest the restaurant is very good especially for local food."
,,Best place in Singapore,5.0,,"Love this park! This is probably the best place in Singapore! A great place to relax, recharge and enjoy nature at it's best."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"My last visit was over 10 years ago when I used to live in Malaysia. A lot has changed since then! If you don't mind the heat, this is a great place to spend half a day."
,,Nice environment,3.0,,Relaxing environment in a garden setting. Lush greenery. Big place so best to view map online on the many exits in this garden.
,,My favorite Singapore stop,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens

I didn't think that I could enjoy yet just another botanic gardens, similar, I assumed, to others around the world, that I've visited.

Boy was I wrong. This is a beautiful, expansive, free, walk through 100's of immaculately maintained gardens and woods, complete with rolling walking paths, bodies of water and very happy people.

The entrance was a little disappointing at first with a small collection of flowers but this soon opens up to fields of grass and specialty gardens, also complete with fowl and the furry friends. The map does not do this place justice. I saw a mere 10th of the gardens and still spent an entire morning wondering through colorful and fragrant corners of this behemoth.

I believe they collected flowers, bushes and trees from every tropical corner of the world, and brought them here to amaze!
Everything is labeled......scientific names and places of origin.
Perfectly placed benches help folks with jet leg.

Even though this was a weekend day which made for great people watching, I never felt at all that this place could be crowded. I was always a few steps away from being alone and isolated, to enjoy the peace and quiet, save for the wonderful bird songs and a few planes overhead.

Go here. Take your time. Pack a lunch. And always have a few pieces of bread available for friendly birds of every shape, size and color. Out of nowhere a friendly chicken came up and befriended me or rather my pieces of bread.

Of all the places I visited during my week in Singapore, this was my favorite, hands down.

I WILL return to explore what I missed."
,,A family visit on a holiday,5.0,,"Visited Botanic gardens with senior citizens and toddlers. All enjoyed the visit equally. Childrens' festival was on .Kids enjoyed the visit and children festival was a bonus indeed.
Orchid Garden should not be missed by anyone. It is amazing to find vast variety of orchids in one place. A great learning and educative experience."
,,A civilized garden,5.0,,"I love Singapore and enjoyed the clean and matriculate environment. However I wish they could let the forest grow in freedom, not prune and trim to a define shape; let soil and dirt loosen a bit.The garden is just too Singapore (sleek and discipline). I love the orchid garden, it is so beautiful and covered with so much varieties. Worth the SGD 5.00 entrance fees. I highly recommend those visiting Singapore to spend half a day at Botanical and Orchid Garden."
,,Perfect for dawn or dusk walks,5.0,,"Recently conferred UNESCO World Heritage site status, this 75 hectare site is a gorgeous tropical landscape. But being tropical it also get kind of humid and muggy during the day. I like visiting in the early morning or evening to benefit from the cool weather. You can see Singaporeans and residents (this seems to be a favored park for the expatriate community) at their daily exercise. In the morning you'll see troupes of yoga, body pump and tai chi practitioners scattered over the various open spaces. You get the added advantage of nice sunrises and sunsets!

If you're coming by MRT the nearest station is Botanic Gardens which is on the bukit timah road end of the park. This part of the park is newer and less impressive than the core which is nearer the orchard road end. But it's a pleasant walk to the other end of the park with plenty of special garden and sites along the way. I like the orchid gardens and the newly opened Learning Forest which lets you walk through a forest canopy. Follow the signs to Tanglin gate and admire the trees which get more lush and older along the way."
,,Gorgeous,4.0,,Next to the gardens by the bay the botanical gardens have a hard act to follow but throughly enjoyable nonetheless. The areas are well thought out and I had a great few hours here.
,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,Beautiful place to walk or spend time. When in Singapore I manage to get work done here - it's quiet and inspiring. Worth paying to do the Orchid garden also.
,,I love Singapore/ botanical,5.0,,"Been before,will go again.Easy to locate using MRT ,so much to see and do .Spend an hour our half a day.Explore the many different areas ,of course the constantly updated orchid garden to the forest walk,herb garden,incredible tree planting’s,great path ways to explore.Bird watchers beware.All for basically free,small chard to see orchids,well worth it."
,,Awesome,5.0,,What a wonderful place for people that love gardening and beauty to see the varity of plants was awesome
,,Must in Singapore,5.0,,Beautiful garden in the city. The Orchid part is kind of expensive but it`s worth the visit. great space to walk around with the family.
,,wonderfull,5.0,,"In the heart of the city there is a small heaven. big and beautiful. noticed that people do jogging in the garden, people were walking with their pets feels friendly to everyone a must"
,,Large gardens,4.0,,Lovely place to visit. large area to walk. Easy to get to on MRT. Do go to Orchid gardens while here.A few places for coffee. Must people go to the centre.Busy at weekends with locals and dog walkers. I also reviewed orchid gardens as I would put them together.
,,"Pristine, Tranquil Gardens",5.0,,There is no better place to go for a walk in Singapore than within the Botanic Gardens. Entry is free and there are miles of surrounded by lush tropical flora. How the gardeners manage to make the entire place look like not a single leaf is out of place is extraordinary. If only I could do likewise with my pot plant garden at home.
,,Great Gardens,5.0,,Beautiful extensive botanical garden with nice orchid garden. Great to spend a couple of hours just browsing around.
,,Amazing,5.0,,If you like orchids there is no way you should miss visiting this place. It is an amazing park on its own but the orchid garden is spectacular.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,By far one of the most beautiful and breath taking things I've ever seen. I would Highly recommend this place as a Must do!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,this nature in a very artificial city. we learned about plants and enjoyed the walk. we will be back there again.
,,Dedicate a day to the gardens,5.0,,"Hot, exceptionally humid. Bring lots of water, leave your troubles elsewhere and relax. So much to see and convenient places to rest along the way. Very long relaxing walks and we started at the opposite end to the MRT as caught the bus, which worked perfect for reaching shaded and eating areas at the right time of day. The orchard garden very worth the few dollars of entry. The staff who maintain the gardens clearly are passionate with their jobs and always happy to answer any questions. A must do place when in Singapore. Strong suggestion to dedicate a whole day."
,,Orchids,5.0,,"The most exciting display of orchids I have ever seen. Well organised walking around the gardens. Fairly short on time so decided to concentrate on the orchids.
Absolutely spectacular displays. Descriptions on various species very interesting and loved the VIP section although couldn’t find Princess Diana’s orchid. Really enjoyable morning and a must for orchid lovers.
There is a cafe/restaurant in the grounds also."
,,SUPERBBBB ....,5.0,,A beautiful walk among the best of plants in the midst of one of the worlds most advanced and crowded city .. WHO THE HELL IS NOT GONNA LOVE IT ?? Every ounce of it was lovely .. well maintained .. There is also a lake in the area .. and refreshments area too .. you can spend hours and hours of walking ....
,,Picnic in the Garden,5.0,,Grab a basket and bring your favourite foods and friends. The best park experience in Sings. Otters and Hornbills a bonus. Delightful.
,,"Beautiful, huge and free",5.0,,"This is an amazing place but you cannot possibly do it justice in one visit. There is so much to see, and the heat can be dehabilitating. Take sufficient water. There is a huge lake with a massive stage that is used for concerts. Plenty of places to eat and excellent signage. You have to pay to go in the famous Orchid Garden but it is worth it."
,,Wow! Spectacular,5.0,,"After touring the main city, enjoyed my way around to hop on hop off to the Botanic gardens. They are so lush and beautiful, reasonable price and beauty all around- well worth the time fo visit. Love all the trees, flowers, water- so much to see!"
,,The pride of Singapore,5.0,,"Think serene environment with plenty of greenery, flowers, and huge patch of grasses. A good UNESCO place to picnic indeed! What I love is that the place is free to visit. I did not visit the Orchid gardens ($5 entrance ticket for adults), to which should probably be good, considering Orchids are like our national flower."
,,Super gardens,5.0,,"These gardens are very special, one of the best in the world. Entrance to the gardens is free and is a must see attraction in Singapore. makes a lovely contrast to the hectic CBD .

We spent 6 to 7 hours in the gardens and did not manage to see everything. We used the MRT to get here and picked up a free map at the entrance. Once in the gardens everything is very well signed. There is so much to see its best to choose which areas you are interested in. The gardens are large so wear walking shoes. There is a number of cafes and restaurants where you can get refreshments. We had a great lunch in the Halia Restaurant near to the Orchard and Ginger gardens. There is a small admission charge for the Orchard garden but well worth it.

One of the highlights of our visit was seeing a monitor lizard near Symphony lake."
,,What a wonderful place!,5.0,,We spent hours walking around the most amazing gardens. I don’t think I have ever been to such a magical place. Quite simply wonderful.
,,Absolutely Stunning!,5.0,,"I have never seen a botanical garden that is better than the one in Singapore. It is absolutely beautiful, and very well maintained. You could honestly get lost in it, it’s that large! There is also an orchid section, it does cost a small amount to enter that area, but it’s worth checking that out as well. The money goes to help maintain the entire gardens. There are many sections of the gardens to explore, so give yourself a few hours. This is a must do in Singapore!"
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,We enjoyed walking through the gardens. The orchids were amazing and the whole gardens in general are so green and well maintained
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Probably the nicest set of gardens I’ve ever visited, which apart from the Orchid centre, can be enjoyed for free. If in Singapore you simply must spend a couple of hours here."
,,orchid garden is beautiful,4.0,,"I went to see the orchid garden, which I found really beautiful (even though I'm not really a garden person). The other parts of the garden that I walked through to get there were also nice.
But I wouldn't suggust coming here for lunch - I went to one of the cafes (can't remember which one) and it was very crowded and rather overpriced."
,,Have to see in Singapore,5.0,,"This is something you just have to see when your in Singapore. It will blow your mind. So much to see , and some evenings there are events at the stage."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,We drop by during our Singapore trips - always a delight and the new section recently opened is a positive delight.
,,"Beautiful, relaxing place",4.0,,"Spent a lovely, relaxing couple of hours in the Botanic Gardens on a Saturday afternoon. Paid the $5 entry to the stunning orchid gardens which was well worth it. We were caught in a storm and enjoyed watching the rain from the cover of a restaurant at one of the gates, whilst enjoying a cold beer."
,,Orchids everywhere,5.0,,We caught the Red buses to the Gardens.It drops you off just outside the Orchids Gardens. The Orchids are beautfiul.
,,Amazing plant and flower displays!,5.0,,We spent the afternoon here. The various gardens and displays are huge. The main building has a good gift shop and snack bar. We enjoyed the Orchid Garden the best (small entry fee). Could spend all day here but we only had a few hours. There is also a concert shell in the middle of the park.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Love this place, well worth a visit cannot recommend it enough every things about it is truly wonderful"
,,City’s Green lung,5.0,,"Centrally located and easily accessible via local transports, this beautifully landscaped and manicured green lung with its 3 lakes is a must visit for all tourists to the island state. Locals also love this UNESCO heritage site and enjoy their walks, run and other activities like Taiji, line dancing, qigong, yoga, picnics, etc, within the gardens. The flora and fauna are varied and well kept with trails for everyone. Wild animals like squirrels, monitor lizards, etc, can also be spotted while swans, chicken, kois, etc thrive within. Heritage buildings like Burkhill Hall, EJH Corner House are located within its grounds and some served as upmarket eateries. A good place to relax and soak in the fresh air and sunshine anytime of the day with families or friends or even visitors!"
,,Early morning stroll best,4.0,,"Even at 8am the humidity had built up a little so we joined the strollers and joggers here on a beautiful wander. There are many areas to explore and relax in. We noticed walking tours and t/ chi groups as well as brown squirrels and swans. It may have been too early for birds as we didnt hear or see many.
There are many stops including Raffles Cafe/ ahop where we had to buy a last minute umbrella with the rain upon us. We spent almost 2 hours here walking briskly but stopping for drinks and toilet breaks."
,,Huge garden,4.0,,"This place was awesome, so much to look at from plants to reptiles, turtles and fishes. Really cosy to walk around there as a couple! The park is free of charge although there was an entrance fee for the orchid garden if you were not from Singapore. The park were so much bigger than I had imagined we didn't see everything but was still in there for a couple of hours. (2-3)"
,,The most beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Part of the hop on hop off, thought we would use this stop as one for lunch. It was beyond a lunch break. The most beautiful gardens with delicious smells and greenness. Add the many sculptures and the restaurant where we had lunch the gardens were certainly a wonderful area to stroll."
,,so much green!,4.0,,"Spent the morning wandering the paths with the family including a pram. It was quiet and full of amazing foliage. So much contrasting leaves of all shades of green, different sizes and growth habits- beautifully put together. There were tropical flowers too but we really enjoyed the green!
The paths are good and there are places to stop and sit. Best keep to the paths - the grass can be water logged and boggy. The Botanic Gardens shop is full of beautiful botanic things, not much tack ;) Good place to get quality presents."
,,Singapore botanical garden,4.0,,"I’m not much of a gardens person but went on a friends recommendation.
Probably only spent an hour and most of it at swan lake which was filled with all sorts of fish and even turtles!
We didn’t to the orchid garden.
We accessed here via hop on and hop off bus."
,,"Lush, Magnificent and Tasteful Gardens",5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are not to be missed. Easily accessible by taxi, the walk through the Gardens allows you to experience exotic flora and fauna rarely seen in the West. Strolling to the Orchid Garden or Ginger Garden, you will walk by rolling hills with giant lily ponds and all varieties of palm trees. Every inch of the Garden feels deliberate in terms of design so you are never in a corner that isn’t lush or beautiful. Plus, the plants and flowers are well identified in English so you learn quite a bit. For example, did you know Tumeric is a form of ginger? Make sure you see the orchids and be patient as tourists pose for selfies and group shots, because the visit is so worthwhile. And walk through the rain forest if you have time. It is a quiet, dark place where the only sounds you hear are birds and other animals."
,,Easy access from the train,4.0,,It's right on front of the train station so very easy to find. Beautiful park with calm atmosphere. Great for family.
,,Fabulous way to spend a couple of hours wondering in tranquility.,5.0,,"Beautiful grounds, well maintained and presented - highlight for us were the monitor lizards that allow us humans to share their habitat!"
,,Nice walk with some interesting scenes,4.0,,"Walked here from my hotel though got lost on my way which made for an uncomfortably sweaty walk. Still, happy to make my way in and around. Many trees, shrubs, vines, fish, etc. Rainforest was cool. Not too many trees in bloom that time of year (end of Oct)
Once I found the flower garden I was too tired and sweaty to bother (plus that portion had an entrance fee). So I had a snack and shopped at the souvenir place instead. Though I could see some nice flowers beyond the gates - probably worth the added $"
,,Singapore's nature,5.0,,Botanic Garden has been there several years with good care. It's like a mini forest where you can hide yourself from a busy city without spending much money. I love this place. People can fall in love with each other there.
,,Extraordinary,5.0,,Brilliant tube system and cheap and easy to use. Ultra safe with floor to ceiling glass walls on platforms to stop access to track. Trains are mostly automatic without human drivers. Great way to quickly tour the city
,,A perfect day,4.0,,"We caught the MRT to the Botanic Gardens and walked through following the signs to the bottom end of the park planning to catch a bus back to Orchard. Unfortunately there's roadworks on Napier Rd and we ended up on the wrong side of the road for the bus - so be careful! A perfect day in my favourite place in Singapore. Lots of walking but well worth carrying an extra pair of shoes for my sore feet! The orchid gardens are by far the best part for me, you could spend all day looking at the beautiful flowers and taking photos. All very well kept. Plenty of places for refreshments etc and the children are well catered for too. Thoroughly recommend."
,,"The Orchid Garden is in the Botanic Garden which is a paradise, bird life abounds and trees and lakes spectacular",5.0,,"We could not get enough of this place, it's free to get into and the Orchid Garden only costs a couple of dollars, well worth the money. Lots of interesting gardens and the children's garden is especially nice"
,,Take a stroll here,3.0,,You can take a stroll here I wouldn't say it's a must see but if you have time it's a nice place to chill. You can see monitor lizards and feed fish in the pond
,,Relaxing Morning,5.0,,"Can see why the SBG has won so many awards. Entry is free, an extra $5 to visit the orchid gardens. Don't miss this attraction."
,,Walk in the garden,5.0,,This is a beautifully done up garden. There are many parts to this garden and there are organized walking guide almost every weekend. Visit this garden and get positively charged up. Plan at least 2 hours of walk to enjoy. Many trails to walk with detailed trails on the website or on boards located in the garden.
,,Walking in the weekend,5.0,,"I’ve been here just walking through the park, on Sunday, during a business trip. This place is perfectly taken care of. Well organized, and clean. Although there is a lot of people visiting, it is a quiet place. Must see it."
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"Magnificent gardens, allow half a day to get the full splendour, but if only an hour, go to the Orchid gardens!"
,,A relaxing stroll,5.0,,Along with up-market attractions the Botanic Gardens provide an ideal place to stroll for a couple of hours to unwind.
,,"Beautiful garden, ideal for relax, jogging",5.0,,"Very beautiful and educational garden. Free of charge to enter so you can see many locals enjoying their free time here.
It’s worth visiting the orchid garden which is paid - I’m not a ‘plant person’ but I enjoyed it very much, the flowers are beautiful.
The garden is also surprisingly large, yet beautiful in every corner! Amazing."
,,Wonderful park,5.0,,The park is really wonderful and relaxing too with an amazing view and a very beautiful nature place for jogging and walking
,,#BestGardenInTheWorld,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens are the best gardens in the world.
Trees are as high as you can see. Some of them are as tall as 60 meters or older than 150 years.
We spent 6 hours walking around the gardens and national orchid park.

We highly recommend to visit this place."
,,Beautiful Gardens!,5.0,,"Really beautiful gardens! We arrived via the Hop on Hop Off bus and walked around for about an hour.

You don't need to pay to enter the main gardens but to enter the orchid garden you do have to. I am unsure how much this is.

Good information on all the plants and animals in the gardens and water points throughout.

Really recommend."
,,Simply Lovely,5.0,,"Another wonderful green space in a city that has many. This is probably the crown jewel of all of them. It’s a wonderful place for a morning walk. There’s an MRT station connected to it, so access, which used to be difficult, is now a breeze. As with all outdoor activities in Singapore, Early is better and water is highly recommended."
,,Merlion,5.0,,Nice park full of wonderful things The Merlion as it is known as That's one mighty pump running that thing...
,,Must see,4.0,,"Must see, definitely a must see. You can have a nice view at the end of the bridge, but the best spots are right underneath the trees themself. Would recommend iT to every kind of age group."
,,A magical place,5.0,,Always visit the gardens when in Singapore.The gardens are still being developed with some lovely new additions. Its hot but the scenery and landscaping make it worth while. A must if you are in Singapore.
,,beautiful,5.0,,"Finally visited here for the first time. Garden is a good size. The lakes are very pretty and offer great habitat to turtles, lizards and a huge abundance of dragonflies. Gets steamy quickly."
,,One of the most beautiful Botanic gardens,5.0,,"It is no doubt one of the most beautiful botanic gardens. Amazing huge varieties of trees, plants and flowers. Have 1-2 hours here and enjoy how beautiful and clean this garden is."
,,Awesome plsce,5.0,,Wow!! What an amazing place. These gardens are so beautiful. The whole place is kept so neat and every plant seems to be very lovingly cared for.
,,Peaceful distraction from City Life.,5.0,,"I revisited the gardens after 8 years to find a much improved and well managed oasis. The Orchid Gardens are $5 extra but worth it to view the VIP section and the lovely displays of beautiful plants. There is a little improvement going on until next year I believe so some areas are under work but this did not spoil the experience. Additional areas have been created, great, raised walkways and the gardens are always kept in beautiful condition. Such a lovely escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, well worth visiting if staying in Singapore for a few days."
,,a must if you like gardens or just need some peace,5.0,,a very well kept garden and very big. extremely clean and you feel at ease here. only 10 steps from the mrt system
,,Great walking trails,5.0,,Beautiful scenic walking trails. Perhaps one of the best maintained gardens. Went with friends for a long walk and then brunch in one of on-site restaurants. No entrance charge. Several drop off and pick up points.
,,Not a rainy day,5.0,,I went there a rainy day. You can inform yourselves and avoid it. The visit is really very interesting. Don't miss it.
,,The botanic gardens should not be missed,5.0,,"We loved all of the gardens which we got to on the hop on/hop off bus. The gardens are immaculate, interesting and stunning. Our favourite part was the rain forest."
,,Must visit place if in Singapore,5.0,,"When we arrived at this place, it started raining very hard for half hour. Just waited until rain stop and started our walk. We walked through for at least one hour enjoying the garden. Just walking through the lush green vegetation makes you new person when you come out of the park. Most enjoyable walk."
,,Gorgeous spectacles abound,5.0,,I didn't know what to do for a few hours so I decided to come here. I'm glad that I did the gardens were all very gorgeous and during the weekday during the afternoon it was a bit hot but I was mostly walking and exploring by myself. They're free too to top it off!
,,Great Picnic Spot-Orchid Garden is a must visit,5.0,,"Lovely walks within the garden, very well maintained, big picnic spots and small nature trails. Orchid garden had a huge variety of orchids!"
,,Jungle in the city,4.0,,"The SG Botanic Gardens is no doubt one of the best on the world, and I have seen a few! It is located very close to the city centre, yet step inside and within minutes you feel like you're in botanical heaven. The variety of plants and trees is huge and on a good day you may spot a python or monitor lizard crossing your path or having a swim in one of the large ponds. The ""jungle walk"" as I like to call it, is a boardwalk which has 3 entrances (at different parts of the park, the easiest to find is opposite the orchid garden) and is surrounded by huge trees, both standing and fallen. Once inside, you feel like you have left the country and stepped into the jungles of Sumatra! Bird life is abundant, with some rare species to be seen if you are lucky enough to spot them in the trees or scurrying away between the shrubs. There are a few restaurants speckled around the gardens, ranging from fast food to fine dining. Halia is recommended, but be warned, it is not cheap!

The BG has a recently added section with a sky walk where one can walk and enjoy arial views of part of the gardens and a marshland.

Overall a great way to spend half a day with or without the kids, in what is now also a world heritage site!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The gardens are beautiful, well designed. Worth a visit. Cheap entrance fee with a good senior discount plan"
,,Most romantic Garden in Singapore,5.0,,"Its free and the most romantic garden in Singapore. Morning and evening - popular for walks and exercise. Especially early morning, there are groups of tai chi and dance workout. Some other forms of exercises can be seen. The lake is emotion rousing and all the living things around are attractive to children's curiosity. Sunday evening has orchestra music to fill the cool air and bring peace and love to courting couples. Its good getaway from the orchard road menace. It is most suitable for all age groups."
,,Beautiful and peaceful,4.0,,Lovely gardens and place to visit. Need a couple of hours to see it all. Orchids are beautiful and worth spending the S$5 to see.
,,Lovely oas in the middle of big city,5.0,,"Me and my wife spent a half day just strolling around. Its real nature well maintained, beautiful and free. Only the orchide park has a small entrance fee."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,It's enjoyable here. Just sitting with family or moving around this place is relaxing. Feel freshness and eliminate fatigue..
,,Beautiful gardens ..... and more!,5.0,,Fabulous gardens with a wonderful restaurant serving the best Ho Fun! Outstanding orchids and all so accessible on the new MRT circle line.
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"An Amazing experience, many areas to walk around with plenty of space for families to enjoy the outdoors"
,,Definitely worth a visit!,5.0,,"The botanical garden is some 150 years old, with wonderfully well-kept grounds. One of the best botanical gardens in the world. As wonderful as the one in Candy, Sri Lanka except that here the gardens are more manicured. The Orchid Garden should not be missed as well as a walk through the Rain Forest. It was a true pleasure to wander around. Try to go early so as to miss some of the bigger groups. The fact that entrance to these gardens is free for everyone makes it an even more pleasant stay."
,,Nice,4.0,,Very nice walk round the gardens which is free other than the orchid garden. Would advise going early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat - and I can say that from experience.
,,Memorable,5.0,,"Everything in this place is breathtaking! They offer very informative and useful map for the tour and of course a shuttle,(not free) if you're lazy enough to walk but the garden is huge so it's quite reasonable. I would suggest you walk so that you could enjoy the tour from the smallest to largest details within :)."
,,Great flora,4.0,,"In the center of singapore, the garden houses great number of plant species. Clear air and well organised."
,,Orchids,5.0,,A must see- pay extra for the special orchid garden. Ok to skip the medicinal garden and the atomic garden too. The back exit doesn’t have cell service so no way to catch an Uber Home— be aware.
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"The gardens are a lot bigger than you think, so you'll quite a few hours. Enter at the Botanic Gardens MRT station end on Bukit Timah Road and you can stroll through the various parts all the way to Holland Road exit. Then it is 10-15 mins walk to Orchard road. There are a lot of different gardens, I particularly liked the Evolution garden and the ginger garden. Look out for a great little cafe in the ""The Bees Knees"" about 1/3rd distance from the MRT. Saturdays and particularly Sundays are very busy in the park, and mid week is much quieter"
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,We spent a good half day wandering through just some of the many themed garden areas within this lovely peaceful setting. We arrived via the MRT and got back to our hotel via bus from the other end of the gardens. Highlights were the rain forest walkway and the orchid garden. The latter is well worth the only small admission you have to pay for. We also had a very nice lunch at one of the restaurants (The Halia) in the grounds. There was lots more to see but half day walking in the heat was enough for us.
,,Visit,5.0,,My gosh this is the best garden huge as so awsome was the orchards the colours amazing there's a gift shop real nice We spent all morning there very worth the visit
,,Amazing,5.0,,"They are really taking care about nature, it's simple beautiful... you must walk there, to feel the nature, to see those colours.. to enjoy it!"
,,Orchid Garden very nice but not overwhelming,4.0,,"Lots of walking involved. Good 2/3's mile or so from Botanic Gardens gate entry to Orchid Gardens. MTR not any closer. On the way, you can pass by swan lake. Overall, very nice but overwhelming, like say Bouchart Gardens in Victoria, which costs a lot more to access. VIP orchids were a bit of a letdown, just orchids associated with famous people. Still the Botanic Gardens as a whole is a nice garden oasis close enough to downtown, etc, that it is a worthwhile 1/2 daytrip. But if you are in a rush, skip it because you won't be able to enjoy the tranquility of the place."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens are really great. and sooo big! I got lost in the Rain Forest because it was so big! A lot of cute places to sit and enjoy the silence.
,,Singapore Long Weekend,5.0,,We walked here from our hotel on Orchard Road. Really nice place to visit to find nature in the middle of a bustling city. Not much in the way of activities but we went there for the walk and found it to be very nice.
,,Garden amidst Skyscrapers,5.0,,This is a beautiful garden amidst the skyscrapers of Singapore. The vast expanse entails a lot of walking. It's simply amazing to stroll across the Garden with your family. I was there on a weekday.. probably the reason I couldn't find much crowd around.
,,In love with the Orchid garden,5.0,,I am a big orchid lover so could not possibly pass up the opportunity to visit the orchid gardens. Was a rainy day unfortunately so much of it was spent under an umbrella but still absolutely loved it! It is also really cheap for what it is! Increadible value for money! Well worth it and so close to town centre!
,,Well-kept garden!,5.0,,"The garden itself is very nice and well-kept. We visited at night time. The garden seemed very safe at night time (we saw several single females running through the park with headphones on). That being said, the park does have some isolated areas. So be careful if visiting at night time. Singapore is one of the safest places we have ever visited. But that should not be an invitation to abandon common sense."
,,Lovely,5.0,,Always nice to visit botanical gardens and this one in Singapore is as nice as any. If your in Singapore it’s really worth the visit.
,,Great place to spent the weekend with family,5.0,,Been going there every month with my husband and dog. It’s a great place to bring your dog out as they have a restaurant that are dog friendly .
,,World Heritage garden......superb,5.0,,Being a nature lover it is a haven for such people's Enjoying a lot very well maintained.. Facility of mobikes No entry fee except orchid garden (5$)
,,Best freebies,5.0,,"Well, actually it costs 5 SGD to enter the Orchid Garden, but it is free to discover other parts of this garden. Went there with hop-on-hop-off bus and the entrance I used is close to the orchid garden. As I had only little time to spend, I went directly there. It is obviously the best 5 SGD you can spend in Singapore. The orchid collection is enormous, and so are their other collection (like Ginger Garden etc.) but unfortunately I couldn’t visit all of the gardens.

The other landmark you should visit is the bandstand. It is located near the Orchid Garden. It is literally a bandstand, but it’s also the icon of this Garden. The view is good, especially at sunset."
,,Magical and a must go!,5.0,,Did not even originally plan to go as was here for a weekend only. By far the highlight of my trip to Singapore and cannot recommend enough! Just look at the pic.
,,Oasis of calm,5.0,,We decided to have a day away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The gardens are a wonderful place. You could spend a couple of days there and still not see everything that the gardens have to offer.
,,Very good afternoon walk,5.0,,"I had a very enjoyable hour or so strolling around these lovely gardens. Free admission other than the National Orchid Garden, which has a small entry fee."
,,Great place for a walk and enjoy the vegetation.,5.0,,Enjoyed our walk around these extensive gardens with its range of specimen plants. The Orchid gardens are the jewel in the Gardens and are worth exploring and appreciating even if you're not a gardening person.

,,Most beautiful botanical gardens in the world,5.0,,"Free entance except for the orchid garden and childrens garden (only accessible with children). You need the whole day to visit everything. It’s so clean, well maintained, very quiet in most of the spots and full of surprises."
,,Nice place with beautiful flowers,5.0,,"You can enjoy wide Verity of flowers here, and the most surprising thing is that this garden is man made."
,,Love this Place,5.0,,"This is the place to just go for a walk and to relax, the Gardens are so relaxing and so beautifully laid out and cared for. We stayed here for over 2 hours, still not enough time to take it all in, and seen quit a bit of wild life too, awesome place we will explore more of it when back in Singapore. Highly recommend visiting The Botanic Gardens, a great place to just relax and walk arm and arm with your significant other."
,,Garden of Eden,5.0,,I was intrigued on how this lush garden survives in the extreme heat and humidity. Its beauty is mesmerizing and what a lovely way to spend time with nature
,,Very knowledgable,5.0,,First I was not interested about going to this Botanical garden but after going there I find out it’s not only a botanical garden it’s a beautiful place too . Kids will also enjoy and they can learn about some very rare plants . So I recommend that all age group people can visit this place
,,what a wonderful Oasis in the big city,4.0,,Amazingly the Singaporean Government have kept this huge swathe of green for everyone to enjoy. Perfect for a total getaway and to see species of plants flowers and tress from all over the World.
,,Worth a visit. Very relaxing,5.0,,We needed a rest day and thought a walk around these gardens would be ideal. A good decision especially since my wife is a hobby gardener. It covers a huge area and is well signposted.
,,Green Lungs of the City,4.0,,"After adopting the Orchid as the national flower Singapore has elevated it to the next level with its gardens. The sheer variety there and the pain staking effort with which these are grown, cared for and presented to the public nearly renders this into an Art form.

Enjoy the walk in the gardens. I loved the archways the most.

Tip: Get your orchid pendant here if wish to get one. The largest variety for choice is available here."
,,"Hit me up with a helpful vote if you ""understand """,5.0,,"Went to the Singapore botanic gardens, nature as it is. Looked at all the trees, hills, grass, shrubs, flowers etc. Thought it was nice. Very peaceful. They have a rain forest section, and a ""waterfall "". Btw it was free. The orchid gardens (only $5) were truly amazing. Then went to Marina Bay and had a wonderful experience where we paid real money. So which is better, it's your choice, or go to both!"
,,150 yr old plants and Trees,3.0,,"This is not a flower garden. But you would find herbs and plants and trees some over 150 years old. Pales in comparison to Gardens by the Bay which is a recent attraction. However, a number of plants and trees are markers of a time when colonial powers rules Singapore and the British love of discovery and collectionnof plants. Most would just see this as a park and yes there are mosquitoes and wasps. If old llants and herbs are not your thing, give this place a miss."
,,Extensive and beautiful gardens - and free,4.0,,Just next to Orchard Road and also a Metro Station the Botanic Gardens offered a welcome change of pace during our stay. We particularly enjoyed the Rainforest coming from the UK.
,,Beautiful and relaxing place,5.0,,"If you love flowers and other types of plants and this is the best place for you. they have different kinds of garden in this place. They also have a huge lake and place to sit and chat with your friends. This place is very relaxing because you can just sit and smell the flowers.

And if you're into pictures. This place is picture worthy."
,,"Amazingly Beautiful Park, Visit It",5.0,,"Located right amidst the busiest neighborhoods of Singapore this huge garden is offering literally a breath of fresh air. Impeccably maintained territory, beautiful landscape, wide variety of trees and flowers. First time in my life have seen huge swimming lizards in the pond. Very nice animals which are fun to watch."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"My wife is a gardener and wanted to see this place for a while. We were so pleased to see it. We spent most of the day there, in fact. Completely inspiring and well worth it."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Gardens by the bay is absolutly beautiful....a must do when visiting Singapore....you won't be disappointed. Visit during the day and then again at night for the light show....amazing
,,Free to See delight.,5.0,,"In Singapore this is a must. The planting, the design, the flowers, the lakes, even the odd water monitor lizard. Easily and cheaply accessible by bus, taxi or underground. Do not miss this if you visit Singapore."
,,Just beayifull,5.0,,Im not much of a plant lover but these gardens are just wow ! Totally free 1 singspore dolar for orchits garden inside . Must see.

,,This Huge Garden is 2nd to None,5.0,,"Beautiful, peaceful and a must place to visit for nature lovers. Besides just trees and flowers everywhere, there is an Orchid Garden where you can see the different kinds of orchids that are named after royals and head of states from abroad. When you are tired, you can sit by the pond to take a rest or visit the eateries around for a cup of tea and snacks. The garden is so clean and well maintained that no one will regret visiting."
,,Hallelujah,5.0,,Everything green flora and nature right in the heart of this city ... this is it ... get totally amazed by the sounds sights and even touch in this beautiful garden . It has been recently awarded as a unesco heritage site so it is a must go destination for sure ... if you want to be mesmerised by the beauty of the Singapore national flowers - orchid miss vanda Joaquin .. need me say more ... do not want to be a spoiler - just head down ... have fun .. and please do buy the tickets to get into the orchid garden located within it... spend a little on the tickets but sure get spoilt by the experience ... totally worth it ... sensational

,,Interesting place,5.0,,"Most beautiful place I have ever been. It makes you feel as you are the part of the nature and responsible for everything you do because it makes a small step to make something amazing like this. And to keep it. I don't have many photos to add, I just enjoyed it and forgot about everything else."
,,Nice escape from busy citylife,4.0,,The gardens offer some nice escape possibilities from busy city life while being still in walking distance of Orchard Road
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"The gardens are quite beautiful and peaceful even though there were a lot of people visiting. Everything is very well maintained and each section has a different feel to it.
The free maps are great and we liked that you could put them back to be reused.
We had a snack at the cafe near the orchid garden which was reasonably priced and was delicious. We sat outside and initially I was concerned about how hot it would be but it was quite comfortable with the overhead fans and greenery surrounding the deck."
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,We went for a walk and ended up spending a good deal of our time in the gardens. The Orchid garden was the highlight for sure. Must see if you are in Singapore.
,,It is a UNESCO certified ! What more can I say!!,5.0,,"If you love nature, you should be there as it has the most beautiful garden and lakes in South East Asia!"
,,A unique place that well deserved the World Heritage listed,5.0,,"I had been living in Singapore off and on for nearly 15 years and am now living in Hong Kong. When I am here, whenever I have the time, I would consider visiting this magnificent garden. Sometimes, I just around the garden for an hour or so. When I have overseas visitors, I would bring them to the Orchid Garden. The tropical forest is also interesting. I also love the very matured trees that are ranging from 100 to 400 years old.
I would recommend to anyone, a short time visitor, or a long term stay resident."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"Seeing this lovely garden was a hihglight of my trip. It was so relaxing, beautiful and peaceful. Really felt like I'm in heaven. Just remember a waterbottle and good shoes!"
,,Singapore Botanic garden,4.0,,"A beautiful park, well worth visiting. Especially the orchid garden. Take the Singapore MRT to the botanic gardens, then walk through the garden. From the south end you can easily walk to Orchard road."
,,Good place for a family outing,5.0,,The garden is most beautifully maintained and host a रहा and of tropical plants. The collection of plants is interspersed with at read and grass lawns where people can sit. If you are a tourist it would be best to go on a weekday to avoid crowds. The garden is very popular with people who have come from other countries to work in the Singapore. They like to picnic on the weekend at this spot. The atmosphere is friendly and very good for families with young children.
,,Time to reflect,5.0,,"Spent several hours looking around. Fantastic plants and trees, as weel as wildlife. The Orchard gardens are a must, the love and attention given by the gardeners is plan to see. Recommended for a chance to relax and unwind for a few hours."
,,Fresh air amidst hassle and busstle city life,5.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens is a whole-day free admission attraction except certain attractions. I visited this Gardens in the early morning at 5am for exercise and mid-night walk at 1am when I could not sleep. Both are just great experiences as it is very serene and most importantly safe strolling in the park at odd hours. I saw security personnel a few times and they are very helpful and friendly. It's surely a great place to visit
,,relax place,4.0,,Went there twice with my kids on school outing. They were really enjoy the greens and play place. wanna visit again if there are any event.
,,Wonderfully versatile,5.0,,"Whether its a morning walk with your dog, some group exercise, an educational visit to learn about the various amazing plants and trees, a picnic, an open air concert, an up- close encounter with a monitor lizard or gazing at the beautiful swans, Singapore Botanic Gardens is a wonderfully versatile go-to haven in the heart of Singapore. The gardens are beautifully maintained and a treat for all ages. Entry is free to all except a few enclosures like the orchid gardens, which are also nominally priced."
,,Must visit beautiful and refreshing garden - my personal favourite retreat,5.0,,"I visit the garden every Sunday morning before 7.30 am to enjoy the fresh cooling air and long leisure pleasant walk.- enjoying the lovely flowers,heritage trees, plants, birds, fishes, terrapins, squirrels and many large groups of people doing various exercises,"
,,Beautiful orchids,5.0,,We were at the Botanic Gardens last week. We arrived on the MRT and walked about 1.3 Klm. The gardens were very nice. Passed a lake that was full of turtles. I saw what looked like a large fish but was very quick. On to the Orchids there were all colours shapes and sizes. Beautiful is all I can say.
,,A place to chill under a tree,4.0,,A good place for a picnic. Plenty of area to just sit down and appreciate the trees and flowers. Many photo spots. Perfect for a pre-wedding photoshoot.
,,Amazing garden!,5.0,,"Great place to meet, exercise and dine amidst beautiful flora and fauna. Well deserved of its World Heritage status and well maintained. No matter how many times you visit, you will be sure to see something new each time. Not to be missed."
,,"Nice, big, great garden",5.0,,I am walking right across the garden. I do go there for a breeze walk during lunch or after working hours. The walking trail is very breezy with all the tall trees. I love to see all the different flowering plants there. There are many sitting areas for you to relax after your walk and exercise. You would not regret going into this garden and it is not possible to see the entire garden within one trip.
,,A Place to Visit in Your Life Time - Singapore Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"During my stay in Singapore for a while, I visited and looked around more than 40 public parks in Singapore. Among them, Singapore Botanical Gardens is arguably one of the best parks, in my opinion. So I made it my routine place to visit every Sunday morning. Running through the park on Sunday morning, and occasionally, sitting down and look at trees, read and learn about them gave me a great pleasure of life."
,,Delightful gardens in this green city,4.0,,"A must see for tourists to Singapore. The gardens are quiet large so take time to wander through as many pathways and tracks as possible. From the old Tembusah trees to the arid cactus displays and bonsai so much to see and great vista's.
Another attraction is concerts in the park on Saturday evenings, so bring along your picnic basket."
,,When you have nothing to do,4.0,,"If you ever feel like you want to get out of the house, but don't know here to go, you should give this place a try. Given Singapore is always hot and humid, it might not always fit the bill fora walk, but there are enough vegetation and shadows to ensure you can just chill out for some time.
The facilities are well maintained and clean, it's well connected and there are quite a few eateries housed in the compound. Of course, it spans quite a hectare and it might take you over a day to cover everything, but it;s best for residents to visit one portion of the garden at t time, given it's mostly for pleasure. There are lots of different varieties of garden, spanning from orchids to housed rain forests. not all will be to your liking, but there are some good ones. My personal fav is the housed rain forest- it really humid, but cool and gives quite a respite from the outside heat."
,,Like the flowers and Chicken,4.0,,"I enjoyed going in the weekend morning, it’s a gateway from the urbanscape...and bond with the nature ..I like looking at variety of flora ... with names and specifies caption tag with most of them. In the morning, the chicken will cluck...and it reminds me of my home town"
,,Serene,4.0,,Flowers will always be beautiful and this place satisfy my eyes every visit i make. This garden is sooo serene that you will forget you are in a city
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,A nice place to spend time with family or overseas visitors. A park within the city. Our equivalent to London Hyde Park or New York Central Park.
,,Wonderful open space in the middle of a busy city,5.0,,The botanical gardens are a wonderful place to visit in the midst of a busy city. The entrance is right next to the Botanic MRT station and entry to the gardens is free. A beautiful open space with lists of interesting areas such as the rain forest section and the ecological garden. There are several cafes in the gardens and places to stop and get a drink of water. The height light though has to be the orchid garden. It costs 5 dollars to enter but is worth every penny. An absolutely delightful garden full the most beautiful orchids set in a wide array of wonderful settings. An absolute must on my list of places to visit.
,,Great place,5.0,,"Found this to be superior to gardens by the bay, better planting and layout and all free, small charge for orchids garden but this was worth it as orchids galore!"
,,Worth to visit,4.0,,Love the environment with tree and flowers. The 5sgd paid for the orkid garden is my personal favorite. There plenty orkid type available. How they organize it is also very good where very friendly to disabilities. There are few rest point available allow you to take a sit and enjoy yourself surround by flowers.
,,A gem,5.0,,"Part of the garden has been awarded World Heritage status and it is well deserved. I have visited the gardens many times and never tire of going back. There are many walks and welcome places to get a drink and a snack. In the Singapore heat it is difficult to see everything on one visit as it is quite large.

Access is quite easy via taxi or MRT and most of the garden is free to wander around. Many locals go there for exercise, which they do in sometimes quite large groups. For the most part these are very considerate to visitors simply there to enjoy the gardens. Among my favourite parts are the lakes, the Heliconia walk, the Foliage walk (all free to view) and the orchid garden (admission charges apply). When there with my grandson we purchase food from a vending machine in one of the lakeside pavilions and he squeals with delight as the terrapins and fish compete for it.

If you are lucky and the gardens are fairly quiet you can see sunbirds, racket-tailed drongo, kingfishers, hornbills, jungle fowl and glossy starling - among others. Of course the ubiquitous mynahs are everywhere and butterflies also add to the delights available.

It changes every time I visit as works are carried out, I never tire of it. In short, I love it!

One word of warning, avoid the gardens in Singapore's spectacular thunderstorms, some of the heritage trees are tall and may be struck by lightning or branches may fall in high winds."
,,Beautifully manicured gardens!,5.0,,Lots of locals find shady spots for a picnic in this beautiful green space of a busy city. The plants are all gorgeous and lush and labelled which is great. Everything is well sign posted and paths are clean and safe. We spent a few hours here but you could spend all day and even part of the night...it's open in the evening too.
,,Beatiful and magical,5.0,,Me and my husband gave this gardens a whole day because every part is well designed and organized. And it is very clean.
,,Indulge in Nature,5.0,,Beautiful walk in the Garden. There are some cafes if you need a pit stop. Leisure hangout place for some me time or a stroll with family and friends.
,,Nice for a walk,5.0,,"Really nice garden to have a walk in Singapore. Many places to sit and relax, and also possibility to buy food and drink. The orchids garden is beautiful, you can't skip it. Different atmospheres, from large lawn surfaces to jungle trees."
,,Well kept gardens,5.0,,This is a beautiful place to visit. The highlight is definitely the Orchid part of the garden. I have never seen so many different types of Orchids all in one place.
,,Relaxing walking and great for family picnics,3.0,,"I had heard rave reviews about this and after other gardens in Singapore I had high expectations. It did not deliver. Was nice to walk through. Some steep inclines, still manageable if in mobility assist. Would be great for a family, couple, group to pack picnic and relax on the groups. Fair distance walk to transport (and at x1 point we did get lost trying to get out - signage didn't help) carparks a distance away as well. Put your walking shoes on and get active!"
,,Beautiful walk & park,5.0,,"The park is in beautiful condition and it seems a lot local uses also the time there for a picnic. Nice details, good signs/ map everywhere and if you keep your eyes open: animals! And the best: it is for free!
You can easily spend two hours walking, feeding the water turtles and watching the squirls.
We would go anytime again."
,,A Oasis in Singapore,5.0,,"Being one of the oldest park/garden in Singapore, it is a wonderful place to visit when u are near by! With a orchid garden and many more fauna articulately planted in spaces, it offers many beautiful spaces for photo taking! Especially if there is an event (concert/performance) at the centrestage lawn near the pond, you will see many in picnic basket and lawn mats enjoying the sun with their love ones.
It is also a great place to run and walk with our pooches!
There are several good class restaurants within that is worth the visit!
Insect repellent Is a must! Take note!
Dempsey road is near the botanical gardens! It is also a great place to visit for food and wine to chill or have a great dinner with friends!"
,,Wonderful garden,4.0,,Spent three hours in these gardens. The orchid gardens are amazing. Keep an eye open for the black orchid. And the golden archways are truly magnificent at the moment.
,,Calming place to visit,5.0,,"This is a lovely place to chill out after a long flight and visits around the city. I especially enjoyed the rain forest walk, and the Marianne North exhibition. Plenty of places to get a drink or a meal, sit on the grass or walk as the mood grabs you.
There are themed gardens to choose from."
,,Green!,5.0,,Very big garden. The total garden is divided into different pieces. You have to walk to roam around the garden. It will take at least 2 hours to walk from one corner to another. This entry to garden is free. You have to pay to visit the orchid garden within it!
,,Fabulous Experience,5.0,,"Great place to visit to see specimens indigenous to a tropical climate which we do not see in Northern Europe, the sizes and variety of plants, trees and flower is amazing. Grounds kept in immaculate condition made for a very pleasant stroll for a couple of hours. The Orchard garden was also brilliant, a explosion of colour, saw the orchid presented to Charles and Camilla yesterday. The only cost involved was one dollar entry fee for the Orchard garden ( over 60's rate ). My advice is to take a bottle or two of water to combat the hot and humid conditions. Do not rush but take it easy, there is plenty to see."
,,Gorgeous Gardens,5.0,,Beautiful walks and picnics spots - Could easily get lost here for a day! The colours were beautiful and the grounds extensive - Would visit again!
,,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"We spent a whole day exploring these tranquil gardens. We spotted toucans nesting in a tree and monitor lizards wandering around.The stunning orchid gardens provided an amazing display of colours with excellent opportunities for photographers. The heliconia walk was spectacular and the gardens were immaculate with beautifully manicured lawns and a shady rainforest walk where we spotted a variety of interesting birds..
We had lunch at one of the restaurants (Bee's knees) and enjoyed large and extremely tasty pizzas, which were very reasonably priced and served by pleasant staff.All in all a truly wonderful day out.."
,,ORCHID LOVERS PARADISE,5.0,,"We used the double decker tour bus to arrive from the Marina area of Singapore. The Park was easy to access and not very expensive for admission. Bring an umbrella for sun block as most of the walkways are exposed throughout the park. I was truly amazed how such a small City-State like Singapore would use so much space for a park but I was glad they did. The views were breathtaking, around every corner something new and more beautiful than the last. The Rainforest walk was shaded and a great way to get a break from the afternoon sun. The Orchid area was by far my favorite area with little signs explaining the genus(?) of the orchid and usually some former or current dignitary(from the world over) for whom the that new variety was dedicated/named after. There was a wonderful giftshop on the way out of the park. The pathways throughout the park were wide and easily accessible. Truly a must see!"
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Beautiful grounds extremely well manicured and presented. Great to see wheelchair access a breeze for those that need it. Could meander all day there.
,,Day visit,5.0,,This place is amazing if you want a quite day wandering around in a tranquil place. We loved it and would definitely go again. Free access to the gardens. Paid access to the Orchid garden section.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Very easy to access, beautiful area, orchid gardens stunning. Lovely to see locals enjoying activities"
,,Peace in the City,5.0,,"Each time we go to Singapore, we make several trips to these amazing gardens. Easily accessible on the Metro or taxi, the gardens cover many different themes such as rainforest, Palm garden etc. A highlight is the orchid gardens which contain the best collection of orchids I have ever seen. Also a new feature is the Evolution Garden which takes you on a journey back to the earliest forms of flora. There are many different food outlets, and we enjoy the food court at the Raffles Building. Alternatively, just take a picnic and enjoy the quiet beauty of these stunning gardens."
,,Serene and beautiful fauna all around,5.0,,Definitely one of my favorite gardens to visit and relax in Singapore. There are many different hidden surprises/gems around the garden if you spend the time to explore. Our family set up a picnic at the open area near the grandstand and we had one of the most perfect family outing!
,,Diwali visit,4.0,,"great place to do timepass and pose for photos. But need to walk a lot, which is a pain. But beautiful flowers and nice cool place"
,,Lovely oasis in the middle of a bustling city,5.0,,"I visited the Botanic Gardens as part of a half-day tour of Singapore. It was my favourite part of the tour! The gardens are beautiful, relaxing, and quiet - a nice respite from the bustling city. The orchid garden is especially lovely. Highly recommended!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is a very beautiful place of Singapore the botanical garden has different types of flowers have never seen in your life beautiful
,,City of flowers,4.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens is a place where you can see all the type of flowers. you can feel lost in nature.
,,Its Green,5.0,,"The Orchid collection which is world class is reason enough to visit the Botanic Gardens. The rest of the collection is also interesting with Bamboo and Ginger plants being of particular interest.
The small piece of primary jungle is worth a quick walk round although it is spoilt slightly by the nearby busy road.
In a city quite as busy as Singapore tge Botanic Gardens gives you a bit of breating space."
,,Singapore botanic garden...,5.0,,Singapore botanic garden is an awesome example of the preservation of the nature at the middle of a busy city. We will feel the change from the busy city to a well maintained area of trees and the entry to the area is free. Orchid gardens is located at the center of the gardens giving an awesome experence of tenthousands of varieties of orchids. It's a fantastic place to celebrate your holiday with near and dear ones. Kids will love the place for sure. Highly recommended.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"My colleague and I booked a tour, and visited the Botanical gardens. The garden is so clean and well manicured. All the different orchids are amazingly beautiful, with vibrant colors."
,,New Section Added,5.0,,"There's a new section added to the Botanics, near the Ginger Garden and past the waterfall feature of that area. The formal name of the new area's entrance is Tyersall Gate, if you find signs pointed to that area.

Give it a visit - it has new spots for visitors to see. There is a large shelter by the two new ponds, a 'treetop' walk above the water, and if you walk deeper into the SPH Walk of Giants you'll find a net area where people can climb on and look down to the forest floor below."
,,Continues to impress,4.0,,The first time I went to the Botanical Gardens was nearly twenty years ago. Since then I have visited many more times (at least five in the last two years). They keep the place looking beautiful. It is fun for the family although the restaurants are either too expensive and the other ones for a normal family meal is not good. Despite this is a great day out. Make sure to take plenty of water and go in the early evening or morning to avoid the high heat. Best to do the botanic gardens in bits so that you enjoy it. Suggest you visit it over two or three days and enter through the different gates.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Well!! what a morning, heard so many things about this place in the past and decided to go and have a look for ourselves, what a wonderful place to go. in vast grounds and interesting all way around there, they have made this a beautiful nature reserve and this is a must place to go if ever your travelling to Singapore, It's also free entrance for everyone - from single people to families, couples it is a great day out, go at your own pace, you can also have your own guide to take you around also if you want one. unsure if there is a charge or donation though, but there are maps around showing where you currently are and there are also printed maps free when you go through the gates on your left.
The only thing I was a little disappointed though, this is run by donations and online, I am sure that if there had been donation bowls or buckets am pretty sure that these would have been filled up as I was more than happy to throw some money into these had they been around."

Some areas get quite busy with people eating lunch and playing music, but plenty of more secluded spots for some peace and quiet.

Definitely consider visiting the orchid garden ($5)"

,,Orchid Lover's Heaven,5.0,,These gardens shouldn't be missed - absolutely spectacular array of rare and unique orchid varieties. It was the first attraction we visited and our first visit to Singapore and set the scene for a truly beautiful Clean and Green city.
,,Great place for a daily walk,5.0,,"This is one of my favourite places in Singapore. The gardens are so beautiful and relaxing. My favourite time to visit is a Sunday morning, starting by having breakfast at Casa Verde and watching the world go by. This is followed by a brisk walk around both loops of the garden."
,,Fantastic location for a walk or family gathering,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens has so much to offer. The gardens have a range of smaller gardens like the children's playing area, or the rainforest walk, as well as the wonderful Orchid garden, (which is 5$ to get into but totally worth it). There are also free music events organised throughout the year. I go here often to walk through the greenery as I find it very relaxing. earlier this year, Bee Knees at the garage opened up, its a great spot to relax and grab a drink or some food. I tend to enjoy their vanilla milkshake. We always recommend these gardens to our visitors as they are definitely worth the time."
,,Average,3.0,,Could skip it if on a tight schedule. Good place for nature lovers to please and revive their senses. A very good Souvenir collection.
,,A real haven of beauty so close to the urban deveopments.,5.0,,"This is a wonderful place to just wander around, there is no need to be a botanical expert to be able to appreciate the calm and beautiful surroundings. Entry free. Our favourite ( outside of the Orchid Garden) was the Rainforest section, and we were also lucky in seeing a large lizard and squirrel. The Orchid Garden is simply a feast of colour, beautifully presented, and should not be missed for the sake of a couple of dollars.
Easy to get to and from, we entered via the northern gate and left by the southwest, via MRT and SMRT bus respectively, so no real need to retrace your steps."

Lots of different and interesting areas, but DO go to the orchid area, it is amazing and if you are over 60, it only costs you $1 (Singapore). Well worth the visit, you could spend at least a couple of hours there."
,,Green Day to stay ever green down the memory lane,5.0,,Reaching the Botanical Garden was the easiest by MRT and the whole place lives up its strata of being a world heritage site. The place was nothing but vast green expanses with every plant with a name board. Clean walk ways and sign boards at every cross paths gave us a feeling of security as if i always belonged just there. The heliconia walk is an experience unforgettable.The swans and monitors walking around the campus gave the feeling of being so close to nature.
,,Worth it if you like gardens,3.0,,"If this is your type of thing and you want to see all the different type of orchids, then this is worth a visit. There is a bit of walking and we went on a hot and humid day.

,,One of the best botanical garden that I visited,5.0,,One of the best botanical garden that I visited. It contains also a wonderful orchid garden. There are also 2 museums inside the garden. You will find peace and tranquillity in time of your visit. Various species of plants expect you in your journey through the garden. There are some shops specialised in products from Singapore related also to the visited garden. A wonderful experience for me. Don't miss it.
,,Good for relaxing and stroll.,5.0,,"wonderful place to exercise, jog and chill! Going in the morning and the evening will make it more pleasant as it would have become cooler. If you are just there to visit the orchid garden, make sure you go via the entrance that is closest to it, unless you enjoy walking."
,,One of the great wonders of the world,4.0,,This is one of the best botanical gardens we have been to in the world. We have been to more than 50. The orchid garden has a small fee but the rest of the garden is free.
,,Beautiful gardens a must see.,5.0,,The extensive displays from one end of the gardens to the other have something for every taste. We were there quite early one of the few places in Singapore that opens early so you can beat the heat. Very impressed by the place.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"They are so beautiful it is almost unreal. And they had trees growing on trees (I dont know how they managed that). The gardens are so well maintained (even better than the Botanical Garden at Mauritius); they must have a literal army of gardeners who all are specialists in Botany! Singapore does put emphasis on greenery and I have seen vines grow over pillars and freeways too. So this declared garden - definitely deserves this kind of effort - and it shows!

Our city tour gave us only 20-25 minutes there, but you need half a day at least to do justice to the place.

Certain portions of the garden have free entry and some specific gardens have a fee associated to it e.g. Orchid Garden, Flower Clock Garden.

Take your pick (and if you are in the city tour do not buy a ticket to any garden for you will not have enough time to do justice to your expenses). Rather plan for another day when you can visit here yourself at leisure."
,,Great way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,We walked to the gardens from Orchard Road - stopping for an ice cream on the way. We had a great time - fantastically well laid out gardens and an amazing array of plants Enthusiastic and helpful staff. Recommended
,,1 of d best I've been in~,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are great, one of the best I've been in . A lovely spot full of beautiful plants and lakes, turtles and squirrels and all sorts. You get used to sweating constantly in Singapore, so another bonus of this place is the fern garden with its misty water spray. A really nice spot, and a must see in Singapore whether you interested in botany or not. Worth every cent."
,,Beautiful UNESCO site-enjoy!,5.0,,"This is one of the stops on the Yellow Line and if you like gardens, it’s gorgeous! Probably even better earlier in the year- you do pay to see the Orchid garden, well worth it. Enjoy!"
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"Well worth the visit. Lots of walking, but so much to see. Catch the Hop on/Hop off bus(es), a great way to see and get around."
,,Clean & peaceful gardems,4.0,,"The Singapore botanical garden was a really nice and peaceful experience.

We walked around the gardens with hardly any other people. It was so quiet. However once we got the orchid gardens, we saw big crowds in and out but this was still enjoyable.

It’s a little out of the way from the city but still easy to get to by mrt and bus."
,,Allow plenty of time,5.0,,This place is huge and exceptional. We also managed to listen to a live symphony music performance followed by an outdoor showing of 'the sound of music' so consider what else may be on offer if it is a Saturday.
,,Wonders,5.0,,This Botanic Gardens is one of the worlds wonders in the tropics. Its founders and people making this UNESCO heritage site should be congratulated in preserving and maintaining this beautiful garden. Each tree is named neatly and a wonderful site to roam the gardens. I was with a tree lover and he could name me each tree with mush enthusiasm. He was in awe as well to see such a beautiful garden. He wants to spend more time but we had only 2 hours.
,,Great morning spent enjoying the gardens,5.0,,"Spent a lovely few hours here, but still only got to see about a quarter of the gardens they are so big. The Orchid section was really spectacular and worth a visit alone. There are all different sections and you would need to visit a couple of times to see it all. I would definitely go back."
,,Simply breathtaking,5.0,,Had a quick wander through the gardens as we were limited for time but oh my what an amazing spectacle of stunning gardens. Orchids that take your breath away.
,,Lovely afternoon spent wandering around the immaculate gardens!,5.0,,"Beautiful Singapore Botanic Gardens is a must for any garden lover.

,,Haven of greenery,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic garden is UNESCO World Heritage site which was found in 1859. this is set in heart of city and great place to walk, jog and fro picnic, here we can spend a day seeing different types of plants, trees and flowers. its a must visit place in Singapore with free entry."
,,Must visit for all,4.0,,"This is a great place to visit for both solo travelers as well as families. I liked the fact that they have put names of the plants/trees. They probably need to work on the street lights, as it gets very dark at dusk"
,,Went to see the National Orchard gardens,4.0,,"Botannical Gardens are ok, but if you have a photographer in the family, the national orchard gardens are a must do. For the non photographers, its just lots of orchards and walking up and down hills. You pay $5 SGD per adult and kids under 12 are free for the orchard gardens. The botannical gardens are free. MRT station is far away at the end of the gardens, otherwise taxis can be caught from various places, we caught ours from National visitors centre (Nassim gate)."
,,Such a cool and green place.,4.0,,I have been here many times and I love going there again. Such a nice place to walk around and shoot nice pictures
,,A good place to walk around...,4.0,,"Normally while visiting a new city I never go to a botanical garden or the zoo, but this time I decided to take for some hours to see this attraction as it was nominated as world heritage site by UNESCO. Besides that it attracts a lot of people as it has free entrance. The botanical garden is a nice one, similar to a park, with a lot of plants, so you can go there for a walk (plan around 3h.) if you have time during your Singapore's visit, but for my opinion it is not mandatory. You can reach the garden very easily by taking the train. You can spend 1h. In the Orchid' garden (the entrance fee is 5$)"
,,Go there,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are absolutely fantastic. Swan Lake is a must see as is the Orchid Garden and Ginger Garden. Be prepared for a lot of walking and get to the Gardens by Taxi. Not expensive at all. Look out for the Monitor Lizards and the Minah Birds. Only thing that puzzled us were the signposts. First one says to *** 159m and a little further on 200m. Rather confusing we thought
,,A green oasis in a hot and busy city,5.0,,"The perfect place to rest during a day shopping or visiting other highlights. Very well kept garden, clean. Nice restaurant (Garage) to eat or drink something. Impressive trees and plants."

,,A peaceful garden,5.0,,"About 1.5km from one end to the other. Free entry to main garden.( you pay a small entry fee for orchid garden)
Beautifully laid out with designated different areas. Gardeners were working hard to trim/remove dead elements/sweep and generally maintain the whole environment, to ensure the Gardens were pristine. The Orchid garden was magnificent, and well worth the small entry fee. Allow yourself enough time to do the Gardens justice."
,,Excellent,4.0,,"My wife had been here many years ago so was keen so revisit.

Pleased to say that it was still excellent, especially the Orchid Garden.

Only one complaint. I have mobility problems and there is absolutely no assistance to be had here if you get stuck. Singapore in general is not a place to visit if you are infirm."
,,Orchard Garden,5.0,,"If you only have limited time in Singapore, make sure you visit the Orchard Garden display at The Botanical Gardens as part of your trip. Catch the Hop on Hop off bus at The Botanical Gardens. Pay only $5.00 for this magnificent display. Only takes approx 1 hour to walk around the Orchard Garden. This is a must do in Singapore."
,,Garden paradise,5.0,,Just as expected in a tropical paradise. I strolled around early before it got too hot. Easy to get to on the metro. Bring water though. It's hot.
,,Yawn,2.0,,"If you are from an urban locale, sure visit. If you are Singaporean or here for an extended stay and have plenty of time to experience the city, sure visit. Otherwise, it just wasn't that special."
,,Excellent place,5.0,,"The botanic garden is a wonderful place. I was impressed by their orchids, not just within the orchid garden. While the orchid garden requires to pay a fee, the rest of the park that we saw was free. There is also a concert stage inside the garden. So look for advertised concerts to enjoy them in a wonderful environment."
,,Amazing selection of plants and flowers from 5 continents.,5.0,,This is a great place and a MUST visit when in Singapore. We loved it and we had the most wonderful time there! Can’t miss it!
,,A Verdant Oasis in the Midst of a Bustling Metropolis,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a must-visit place even if you have only a half a day in Singapore or are not fond of gardens. A UNESCO heritage site, the gardens stand with the best in the world (e.g., Kew Gardens). Planted sections are arranged thematically and include a significantly sized virgin tropical rain forest, an evolution garden that features plants you would have seen if you lived in the age of dinosaurs, an orchid garden with flowers in shapes and sizes you would see only in the wild tropics and a thriving desert scape. They are separated by wide and smoothly paved pathways which are ideal for early morning jogs or late afternoon strolls. Ample shade is provided by towering heritage trees that dot the wide swaths of green open space. The garden is impeccably maintained, nearly all plants are labeled for the professional and hobby horticulturalists and non-smoking is strictly enforced. I travel to Singapore often for work and never miss a chance to spend time in the Botanic Gardens. No visit to Singapore is complete without seeing what is truly one of the city-state's great wonders. (No entrance fees.)"
,,Spend some time here,5.0,,"For a city with the number of residents it has, Singapore does excellent job of green spaces. We were here twice - nice place for kids, adults, anyone (easy roads for wheelchairs too)."
,,"Tranquil, Serene, Zen",5.0,,"I'm gonna run out of synonyms to describe how peaceful this place is. We'll maintained, clean, and free for the most part.

,,Orchid garden is amazing,5.0,,Highlight of Singapore and thank you for the senior rate of $1. Very well cared for. I wish they had the age of the bonsai collection stated on the trees but this Is the only flaw in the whole garden
,,Fabulous place,5.0,,Huge well kept gardens with loads to see. Heaps of photo opportunities and well worth a lengthy visit.
,,Greenery,4.0,,"Should have known ,if things are green there is often rain about. And there was .it rained all during our visit.My partner was impressed as she is a flower fanatic.Glad we had an umbrella"
,,Excellent scenic garden,4.0,,"Excellent scenic views, selfie best place to take some good background selfies about you. Had an energizing walk round the gardens"
,,A nice and cosy pl for a great morning stroll,4.0,,This month we went there twice cos we are so in love with the new board walk n bridges just behind the swan lake. We went in the morning at about 7.30am and the moment you step I to the gate the freshness of the morning dew and air definally lift your spirit. As we stroll or jog around the garden we were greeted by charping birds and roaster. Your nose will be treated to a feast of fresh sence of different flowers and plant and of course the spices. If you are not a morning person. An evening walk will still refreshed you from a days work.
,,Free entrance to park but fee applies for orchid garden,3.0,,"Nice park if you want to have a quiet place to visit and even a small picnic with the kids. This place is free to visit but you need to pay for orchid garden entrance. Worth a visit if you are orchid lover.

There is an orchestra stadium in the middle of the garden, usually they have good orchestra at around 2pm or 5pm-6pm, depending on schedule. Feel free to check their website or google for schedules.

Good place to relax with family. Watching the kids running around while sitting on grass and listening to orchestra symphony. Watch the weather too if you are going. Not a good place to go if it's raining."
,,Very nice Gardens and Rain Forest,5.0,,Visited the gardens while recently on a business trip. Great way to see the tropical foliage and trees of Singapore. Really well maintained and enough to spend about 4-5 hours if you have time. We didn't do the orchid garden but the Ginger Garden was very cool. Definitely something inexpensive to see in Singapore

,,Amazing gardens in the city,5.0,,"Wonderful place to spend a day wonderful plants, trees and flowers hard to believe you are in the middle of a city"
,,Very nice,4.0,,"They are really nice and I would recommend a visit.
What really shock me is that you are not allowed to: play with balls, play with freebie, taking your dog, Rollerblading, using a bycicle plus other things that has more sense.
I mean try to imagine central park and not being able to do anything in it, except waking or running. :)"
,,Natural wonderland,4.0,,Beautiful gardens with outstanding nature and also enjoyed the wonderful statutes nestled in the gardens. More seating for the long walks would improve the experience.

People go there for its cool environment away from the hubbub of the city to exercise - jog, do tai chi, walk, walk the dog(s), picnic, have breakfast/coffee, or simply enjoy the greenery and tranquility of the place. The directions are well signed ditto the amenities available - all these for FREE until one goes into the Orchid Garden which is within the Botanical Gardens. But then, the entrance fee is minimal."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Went here on an excursion with tour company. It was a beautiful calming place and enjoyed by all. It was a pleasure to experience.
,,A break from the city,4.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens are beautiful to walk around and escape the busy city. These gardens are much more traditional and calm compared to the Gardens by the Bay.

I absolutely loved visiting the National Orchid Garden. Entry free to the garden is completely worth it! I was expecting something small, but the garden actually holds over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids, including the “VIP Orchids” which have been named after famous visitors to Singapore."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,This has become one of my favorite attractions. The gardens are extremely well kept and a joy to wander through. I can keep going again and again and not get bored. Definitely a must visit on your trip to Singapore.
,,The best botanic garden ever,5.0,,Getting lost in these picturesque paths is a true treasure. Being free is surprising and great. Walk and take pictures because you will never see something like this again!
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Loved everything about the Singapore Gardens. The Orchid Gardens are magical. A wonderful experience.
,,Great walks,5.0,,Always a good place to visit for a walk. Best times early mornings or late afternoon. Can get busy during weekends
,,The secret is in the looking,4.0,,"The botanic garden in most every city is an oasis of green, calm and quiet reflection. Singapore’s is no different - except the secret to this is looking for the little things.

There are no special exhibits to wow you. No shopping for you to consume.

But there are wonderful rainforest trails, some trees that were he Woodstock of building materials, the occasional chicken and birds. Gorgeous sun birds. These are the little things that should delight us.

Hints.
1. Bring water
2. A hat or cap
3. Comfortable shoes, shorts and t shirt
4. Slow down.
5. It can be quite busy. Take the off beat tracks.
6. Stop and observe the flowers - look for the birds"
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,"Despite the heat and humidity, these gardens are a lovely place to spend half a day. Just a few stops from downtown on the MRT drops you at the entrance. So many beautiful walking paths and fascinating flora and fauna. The famous Orchid Gardens are breathtaking! Pay attention to every inch because some orchids are tiny. There is a great gift shop as well."
,,A quite place to relax in the city,4.0,,"This was my third trip to Singapore, but my first visit to the Botanic Gardens. As with Central Park in Manhattan, Singapore's park is a gift to the people with free access. I couldn't believe how huge this development is. I was there two hours and only saw about half of it. The gardens are beautiful and immaculately maintained, and there was no litter in sight. There is also a great mix of wide thoroughfares and small paths. We saw people picnicking and biking, but this did not seem to be a place for more active pursuits like frisbee or rollerblading. My one critique is that this park seemed very ""managed"" with almost nothing that allows nature to show off on its own accord. I admit this is a personal preference. I give my thanks and appreciation to those who provide such a beautiful gift to the public."
,,Never cease to impress!,4.0,,"I love the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Each time I've visited Singapore I've fitted in a visit. The Orchid Gardens are jaw-droppingly beautiful. This time I visited with my husband - who was suitably impressed at the quality of the gardens. We spent a few hours admiring the beauty of the Orchid Gardens. It costs $5 for admission to the Orchid Gardens (the rest of the Botanic Gardens are free). The mist house and a few other parts of the Orchid Garden are currently closed until 2019 for renovation. If you love photography, the Orchid Garden is a photographers dream. The main Botanic Gardens and Orchid Gardens gift shops are nothing short of beautiful - you are bound to spend some money here. We were staying at Village Hotel Katong. It was so easy and cheap to get to the Botanic Gardens by bus and MRT. We caught a 10 or 32 bys to Dakota MRT and then got on the Harbour front bound City Circle line. The MRT dropped us a one of the Botanic Gardens gates and we walked about 1.3km through the gardens to the Orchid Garden. Take a water bottle. You can fill up at stations around the site."
,,Great place to see and listen,5.0,,"From the MTR Station your right outside the main entrance of the gardens which are free to enter and enjoy. There is a small tea room on the way towards the national orchid gardens, a very pleasant stroll for looking and listening to the large variety of wild"
,,Nice walkthrough specially at night,5.0,,"Went there during our stay in singapore both at day and night. At day time you hardly see any human around due to hot weather, but at night thousands of people get there to enjoy the nice environment."
,,Good garden,5.0,,A beautiful place for a walk. The gardener knows what he is doing. Great for all ages. Highly recommend checking it out.
,,A most beautiful garden,5.0,,"This is a very large garden with much to see. The landscape varies as you move from section to section. The main part (which is a very large expanse as-is) is free. A fee applies for the Orchid Garden, but it is worth it. The variety of orchids and the way they are displayed in an almost natural setting is most captivating.

There are several entrances, but I would highly recommend going in via the main entrance at Nassim Gate where the Visitor Centre is. If you are being driven there, tell the driver to go via Cluny Road at the junction with Nassim Road (just in case Nassim Gate doesn't ring a bell).

If you enter via this main entrance, you will have a good starting point for your walk. Upon entering the Garden here, keep to the left trail and walk along Upper Palm Valley Road which will lead you to the Orchid Plaza, the entrance to the Orchid Garden. As mentioned, I highly recommend a visit to the Orchid Garden.

To continue your walk in the open area, keep left at the Orchid Garden and take Maranta Avenue that will lead you to the Bandstand. Explore the various mini gardens around this area to eventually reach Swan Lake. At Swan Lake there are signs to the new Learning Forest section, starting with the Walk of Giants. If you have the time, explore that. Otherwise head towards the Ginger Garden and you will be back at the Orchid Plaza. As a variation, walk along Lower Palm Valley Road to head back to the starting point. If you do take this route, you will have the option to also explore the Evolution Garden, depending on how you do for time, before heading back to the Visitor Centre where you can have a drink or even snack at a cafe there.

Best time to go would be early morning or evening just before 6pm. During certain Saturdays or Sundays each month, there may be music performances on the Stage on Symphony Lake with crowds lazing on Palm Valley. It adds to the overall experience of your visit, so if you can try to go on one of those days. Search the Botanic Gardens website for their events calendar."
,,Fabulous Gardens and meal at the Ginger Garden,5.0,,The gardens are worth the trip out from the city on a metro which is efficient and a good experience. The orchid gardens are something else. The lunch time meal was fabulous topped off by great service from Alice Raja.
,,Wonderful visit,5.0,,We went to the Botanic Gardens using the big bus tour. The gardens are beautiful and should not be missed if you are on holiday in Singapore. My daughters loved the gardens.
,,Tranquility from the busy cut centre,5.0,,Too much to see in one visit Pick up a map and decide how to make best use if your time Wonderful experience!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We enjoyed our visits to the botanical gardens. The gardens were beautiful and impeccably landscaped. It was extremely congested during our first visit and we found it hard to maneuver around without bumping shoulders into other tourists. The following afternoon was significantly less crowded and a lot more enjoyable. We also enjoyed fabulous views of the gardens from our hotel next door to the gardens, the Marina Bay Sands."
,,The Botanic Gardens are getting bigger and better,5.0,,"The Gardens have lots to offer. It's oldest section is as old as Singapore and part of it comprises primary forest. The newer parts have children's garden, evolution garden and other educational areas. The National Orchid Garden is a must-see. There are also good eateries in the gardens. Lots of runners and joggers in the mornings and evenings."
,,Morning run,5.0,,"Accessible from Orchard Road, an oasis in the middle of Metropolitan. Enjoyed seeing a lot of people, young and old exercising together."
,,Dinner in the trees!,5.0,,"For any couple who want a bit of romance in singapore, go to the restaurant in the trees! Its so amazing!!"
,,Singapore Eden Gardens,5.0,,"I hope to don't sound heretical, but this place is what the Eden Garden should look like. All the flora and the viewscapes are intoxicating. Everything is so well taken care and simply perfect.
Entrance is free (not to Orchid section), so you don't have to pay to enjoy this beauty."
,,amazing plants,4.0,,very enjoyable to walk around these gardens with a wide variety of plants from around the world. a good contrast to the streets of Singapore
,,Singapore botanical gardens,4.0,,It’s a beautiful place to roam around and watch beautiful and different varieties of plants especially orchids ferns and many other plant which we only get to see books. It’s a paradise for plant lover ! But one sincere advice never but orchid grown in test tube firstly you pay through your nose and when you plant it after waiting as written it never survives atleast my heart broke when my orchid died!
,,Best greenery,5.0,,If you need to detress and spent a good time with your family and love one nice to take an evening stroll
,,Beauty in a concrete jungle,5.0,,Such a nice well kept place. Really nice plants and trees. Very peaceful. Would suggest a nice walk or a picnic.
,,Even in tropical down pour wonderful place to visit,5.0,,"After spending the morning at Jurong Bird Park we had about two hours spare before we headed to a pub to watch Aussie NRL Grand Final.

Arrived at the gardens and within about 10 mins the heavens opened and we were drenched. Still a lovely place to visit and we (2 adults and 2 teens) decided that since we were already soaked we should just keep wandering around.

I love botanical gardens so I could have spent hours there however we managed about 1.5 hours. Orchid centre really stunning and we all enjoyed our time there.
Definitely worth a visit."
,,Great gardens/park,5.0,,"Well recommend a visit to these gardens. We went on a Sunday morning and it was surprising how few people were there.

Large variety of plant/animal life to see. Allow at least 2 hours for visit but would take most the day to cover all the park. There are a few cafes/restaurants/shops in the park. Watch out for the lizards."
,,Take plenty of water & joggers,3.0,,A lot of walking with no transport options or supply of filtered water. Would like to see some advancements in moving around easier as walking up hills in humid conditions is not always part of a relaxing holiday.
,,The best place to be in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a Beautiful place of plants , flower and trees.there are many gardens here and it too hot to see them all. You have to pay to see the orchid garden but it's well,worth it. The city centre is madly busy, cars are definitely King , and it's rather sterile. Here there were actually dogs on,leads, birds, insects etc......first real animals we've seen. It's manicured rather than well maintained . The gardeners were very busy brushing up every leaf. People were having fun here. Of course no picnics , no food to be bought in , no smoking anyware .But Singapore is very controlled which you have to accept"
,,A Whole New World from Civilization,5.0,,"Definitely a must visit when in Singapore. I loved it so much and definitely going back there! Located nearby Orchard Road, if you love nature and plant's it would be a wonderful place to be at especially if you need a break from the hustle and bustle. It is a relaxing walk however, to complete the whole garden, it would take hours, it would be good to be hydrated and plan your visit or spots you'd like to see. There are many nice restaurants to have brunch or a cup of coffee when you need a short break from walking."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"What a wonderful place,near the mrt station. Have such a big area with a beautiful scenery. A nice place to visit."
,,Beautiful garden!,5.0,,"This is one of the most beautiful gardens I have been to. My wife loves botanic gardens and therefore, we always visit the local botanic gardens when we visit a city. This one gave us a great sense of contrast as Singapore is one of the most urbanized cities in the world, and we could not believe there were such a beautiful, huge and well maintained botanic garden in the middle of the city. Great for couple, families to simply walk around,"
,,An oasis in a garden city,5.0,,"This is truly an anoasis within a city centre location. The lake with turtles, the concert venue and above all the orchid garden are magnificent. There is a small entry fee charged which is well worth it to view the world famous orchids."
,,Fun times,5.0,,We had such a great experience walking around and exploring at botanical gardens with our children -place not to miss -in fact make it sure to count it in - family time with nature - what else can be better than this
,,Amazing gardens,5.0,,"We travelled to the botanic gardens by mrt. Entry is free. When we arrived helpful staff suggested highlights to visit based on the amount of time we had to spend there. We particularly loved the evolution garden, healing garden, palm valley, rain forest walk and walk of giants in the tree tops. It was tough going in the heat, but there are places to buy cold drinks. We love gardens so this was always going to be a must visit. I personaly liked it better than GBTB, but husband disagrees. We also visited the national orchid garden- amazing orchids to see, $5 entry. As we walked from one side to the other, the guide suggested to catch the bus on the other side to the mrt to get back to our hotel. We were a bit lost as we hadn't planned which bus- so maybe plan to start on one side and exit the other so you know where to go!"
,,Amazing setting,5.0,,"When in Singapore, you must take a few hours out of the city to visit these Gardens, you will not be disappointed!"
,,Beautiful and peaceful garden,5.0,,The whole place is sooooo well maintained. It is so unnatural but i like how clean and organized it is. :)
,,Lovely respite from urban Singapore,4.0,,"We spent a while in the rainforest. Soaked in the beauty of the greenery. For a moment, we were anxious we would not be able to find out way out and the clouds were gathering....Quite thrilling! Must go on their walks next visit to Singapore..."
,,Nice walk,5.0,,Its pic worthy Its so big i advice u bring along a pair of comfortable shoes I how singapore kept flora n fauna so alive and beautiful
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,I enjoyed my first visit to the gardens so much that every time I am in Singapore I make it a point to take time out to revisit. I particularly enjoy the stunning heliconia and ginger gardens. It is well worth your time.
,,a big garden filled with all sorts of trees,5.0,,"The place is full of trees and water ponds. A good place for jogging and children playing. Occasionally, you can spot some squirrels, fish, turtles, lizzards,etc.

there is a small children's park inside and kids can find swings and slopes. There is a small shop serving light refreshments.

at one of the entrance, you can find few restaurants and a souvenir shop."
,,Nice for a Sunday afternoon stroll,4.0,,"It's a pretty good, well maintained and kids friendly place. Free entrance to (most of) the park and plenty of nice things to do and see. Always a lot of people who just chill out, some playgrounds for kids to get rid of their energy and always groups of people having a picnic. Great place to visit and have some time away from the hustle and bustle of the city."
,,UNESCO site with easy access via MRT!,5.0,,Singapore's first UBESCO site! A must-visit place for tourists and locals! Free entry for most parts of the garden. Peaceful and beautiful
,,a source of so much joy,5.0,,"i used to visit the botanics in the early 2000s when my daughter was a toddler. then i forgot all about the gardens i.e. i would drive past but not venture in to partake of their delights. of late i've been entering from a different gate each time and walking in the botanic gardens. they are so beautiful and serene and i'm grateful to the powers that be for having created such a resort-like space in the middle of the city. the water features, lush plants, open verdant spaces all add up to magic."
,,A nice beautiful heaven,5.0,,"I had been to the garden and the place was spacious and can have many events like picnic, family gathering, performance by Arts and wedding. You also can do jogging, walking and strolling with your love one, family and friends. It covers by many trees and lots eatery within the garden for visitors and tourist as well"
,,Truly the best tropical gardens of the world,5.0,,This Botanical Tropical Garden in Singapore is indeed within the top 5 of the world. It is so clean and trimmed with a paved walkway through out. Many species of plants are labeled . It is so educational with common and unique plants of the tropics Anyone with interests in true nature of tropical plants at its best should stroll through this Garden .
,,Great place to exercise,4.0,,"A beautiful garden which is great for morning or evening walks as there are trees and shelters along the way. As it is just a short 10 min walk from the Orchard Road shopping area, I recommend allocating about 2 hours here if you are in Singapore for a visit."
,,Botanic Wonder,5.0,,"What is free, a great delight and right in the middle of Singapore? It can only be the Botanic Gardens. I live next door so know it very well. Go to the Orchid Garden if you want to see one of the world's finest flower gardens ( it costs a couple of dollars). Go to the Evolution Garden if you want to discover mankinds place on this world. Go to the treetop walk near the visitor centre and drop off if you want to want to view trees from an unusual perspective. Talk the jungle walk if you want to saunter through primary rainforest. Go around 8 am and join in with the Tai Chi or dancing - just volunteers so no cost. Or read the nameplates on the trees to learn more about nature. Count monitor lizards with your children - well have a guessing game. (Hint -You can usually see one) or just watch the giant fish. Jog around the three lakes if you want to exercise or stop off at the cafes if you want to eat or find the exhibition centre ( near Napier Road entrance ) to see what people have been painting. Enjoy. It is worth it."
,,Perfect picnic,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful natural surroundings. Many activities can be done with children. Good eating joints. Also educational
,,wonderful botanic garden,4.0,,"This huge botanic garden is a lust for the eye. People enjoy being there. Beautiful plant collections, great atmosphere. And after a nice walk there is a great restaurant with great laksa OMG and finally you stop at the bookshop boutique and select a wonderful gift for your loved ones. Every time I go to Singapore I must see the botanic garden. Easy to reach now with MRT."
,,A Must Visit - Dont Miss the Orchid Garden,5.0,,The garden is a great place for a leisurely walk and to relax. A bite at one of the excellent restaurant and the MUST visit Orchid Garden that is located within. Have been there many times and still love to go there.The access to the main garden is free. The Orchid garden has a nominal charge. Located close to Orchard Road.
,,Nice refreshing place,5.0,,"Beautiful nature place ...lovely green and flowers all around....nice place to go and relax all afternoon, find a not so busy spot and just read a book or have a nap❤️"
,,Stunning gardens,5.0,,"Whilst in Singapore I went running most mornings and found myself in the Botanic Gardens. Beautiful area, great paths for running and walking. Would also be an awesome place to sit back and relax, lots of different landscapes to see. Beautiful tropical gardens."
,,Oasis in Singapore!,5.0,,"A place for many occasions, from a romantic stroll to running, picnic and just amazing botanical exploration!"
,,Orchids Garden,5.0,,The walk to the Orchids Garden and the smell of the green grass makes the walk very plesant. There are many different and beautiful orchids. Unique orchids are created and named after VIPs. Try to find the orchid named after Princess Diana.
,,orchid display,4.0,,visited botanic gardens for the first time after 6 trips to Singapore. very enjoyable and the orchid gardens were magnificent. would highly recommend a visit
,,Beautiful weekend walks,5.0,,"We live in Singapore for last 11 years and funny enough we have only started visiting Singapore Botanic Gardens this year. We (my wife and I) typically go there on Saturdays for morning walk along with another couple, who are close friends. We absolutely love the place. It’s a really refreshing experience to watch the swans at the swan lake, greenery, walking on the bridges, and the rain forest walk etc.

The whole place is full of scenic locations everywhere you go and it’s a wonderful sight for the morning. There are plenty of eating places inside the garden if you feel hungry after walking around the garden. It’s buzzing with people on the weekends, who come for walks, runs, yoga or group exercises etc. The whole park is extremely beautiful with plenty of locations to click pictures, which is why you can see people coming for their pre-wedding shoots etc. to the garden.

We look forward to going there every weekend since we have started. It’s super refreshing."
,,GREAT PLACE,5.0,,Excellent place to feel you are really next to nature. Also a place to take a nice stroll with loved ones an friends from abroad.
,,Well maintained and spacious,5.0,,"Love this spacious and green environment. If weather and time permit, you may take a slow leisure walk from one end of the park to the other end. You may enjoy beautiful flowers and trees and even spot a few squirrels and swans along the way :)"
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,One of the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen. The Orchid Garden is not to be missed. Easy to get to - and well worth the cab fare.
,,Good place to chill n exercise,4.0,,"I like to to go there for a run to be close to nature. If there is concert performing, good time for picnic. You can check the NParks website if there is any such perf."
,,Exceptional Botanic Gardens,5.0,,We really enjoy parks and gardens around the world and this really ranks as one of our top picks. The extent of the gardens make it difficult to comprehend that you are still in the middle of a bustling city. Pay the small fee for entrance to the orchid garden. You won't regret it. The displays of rare and famous orchids are second to none. Take a camera.
,,Beauty and tranquility,5.0,,"Such a beautiful place to visit, whether to just amble around or sit and enjoy the tranquility. Definitely must be done when visiting Singapore. Free to enter the main gardens but a small charge for the orchid gardens...which is reduced for seniors"
,,Bringing back old memories.,4.0,,"Thanks to NPark, now the garden is not all green, there are beautiful flowers, Orchid garden (with entrance fee)，hopes can give Senior Citizen age 65 and above for free entrance.

,,Peace of mind,5.0,,"Broadly divided into three sectors – the Tanglin Core, the Central Core and the Bukit Timah Core – there are many beautiful spots of nature that both children and adults can enjoy within the garden. With more than 74 hectares to explore, there are plenty of green grounds for families and children to soak up. In addition to wandering the park, here are 15 of our favourite places and activities within the Singapore Botanic Gardens for families with young children.

The site is home to the National Orchid Garden (adult/child under 12yr S$5/free; 8.30am to 7pm, last entry 6pm)

As well as being a favourite recreation venue for jogging, dining or just lazing about, the sprawling grounds are also a leading centre for botanical and horticultural research.
Highlights include The National Orchid Garden, which boasts the world’s largest orchid display, with over 60,000 plants and orchids.

Kids will have a blast at the Jacob Ballas Children’s garden where they can play and learn all about plant life. A host of restaurants and cafes are also available to satisfy thirsty and hungry visitors after a day out in the sun."
,,Beck,5.0,,"Its a serene place to visit. Cool breeze. Its a forest in d middle if a financial centre.

Close to orchard road shopping.
Gleneage hospital,eateries.you get to see all kind of trees plants fkowers , orchids.

Opposite the
British & Australian embAssy.

Do viisit the place"
,,"no cycling please, can be fined.",3.0,,"Hot and humid and sunny visit, it was crowded too on a Sunday.
Didn't see the No Cycling sign either and was stopped by two unfriendly officers on a golf buggy - begged them for several minutes before they let me off with a stern warning.
Otherwise nice free attraction to visit."
,,Amazing Garden,5.0,,Great variety of plants and interesting places for family to visit. A place to get away from the city.
,,Beautiful oasis in Singapore,4.0,,A definite must for any visit to Singapore . The gardens are beautiful and varied with wonderful walkways throughout. It is a marvel to all your senses .
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"We spent several hours here enjoying different parts. Highlights were the Orchid gardens of course but we also enjoyed walking to the lakes and then through the wooded area over the raised walkway through the marshy areas.
It's easy to spend hours here, watching people and their dogs amongst amazing plants"
,,"Delightful, breathtaking, mesmerizing a must-go if you visit Singapore or stay in Singapore",5.0,,"I had being to Botanic Gardens on a few occasions when i brought foreign visitors to visit. However i really fall in love with Botanic gardens after i moved to Newton. With just 2 stations from Newton and as the entrance is build just in front of the MRT station it could not had being more convenient for anyone who travel by train. The Garden is so huge I would have to come here every week in order to explore thoroughly. If you do not have the time of the world then i recommend to visit Eco Lake, Rain Forest is a must, the newly open Learning Forest is a delight. I recommend to bring hat, sunglasses and fan in order to enjoy the walk. Bring along a mat if you would like to have a panic. Feel extremely alive whenever i go to Botanic Garden definitely a better place to explore compared to East Coast Park."
,,A national treasure in Singapore,4.0,,"We strolled the entire garden and absolutely enjoyed the visit.

We entered the park and were greeted by a team of staff who provided a map, overview of the park and were quite pleasant and humorous.

We started at the lake with the Black Swans. Were were probably too late in the day (it was hot and humid) and did not see the black swans. We did walk the entire park and visited the Orchid Garden, and concluded at the lake with the White Swans.

We saw the entire park in approximately 2 1/2 hours (including the Orchid Garden). You may see the park in a shorter time, we chose to take our time. At the end of the park, we exited with easy access to the bus system which returned us back to our hotel

The park is full of many species of plants. I am deducting points for lack of signage. The park could improve the experience by placing more signs and placards providing explanation and education for patrons about the plant species."
,,Seems ok,5.0,,Didn't stop here for long just as a way of getting to a restaurant. As with all of Singapore very clean and well signposted. Seems like a good place to visit if you are a plant person.
,,Gorgeous afternoon spent among the orchids,4.0,,Great value! $5.00 Entrance fee for adults $1 for student. Free under 12. This is only for Orchid exhibit. Walk among the vegetation for kms in a very peaceful setting. Designated UNESCO world heritage site
,,Great Gardens,4.0,,"Had an afternoon to kill so decided to have a wander through the gardens and take some pics. Wonderfully laid out and signposted, so no change of getting lost. Very well maintained with lots to see and do! A must see if you have some time to kill."
,,"Its FREE, Go visit!",5.0,,"The botanic gardens are huge we spent a good half a day here and probably only did about half of the site. There are various walks and little gardens spread out all over the place, well worth a wander around to see what you come across. Various cafe and toilet facilities around the site."
,,Brunch,5.0,,"Never a disappointment !! Good food !! Great ambience !! Must try local delights, one of the best laksa served in town. Even western dishes is a delight . The outdoor settings have shelters , away from the sun . Doesn't feel hot. Good for casual meals and family ."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Breathtaking landscapes, rare plants, gorgeous relaxing areas - and a beautiful orchid garden, especially stunning if you visit it in full bloom (around September)
I highly recommend going for an early morning walk - and maybe join one of the lovely classes, from yoga to tai Chi and qi gong."
,,Garden of Paradise,5.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens are that lavish that we visited it twice during our visit. Both days more than three hours. We´ve still not seen all.
,,Lovely gardens especially the Orchids,5.0,,Quite a lot of walking but plenty of tree shade. The National Orchid Garden is lovely (there is a charge for this). Seating and food available near the Orchid Garden. Easy access to the gardens from MRT or bus.
,,A picnic in the garden,5.0,,"We went to the garden using the MRT with our seven year old daughter. We spent around four hours in the garden, walking from MRT to a restaurant called Dolce Vita and back again. So, if you are not perfectly organised and have your picnic basked in your check in bag, here's an idea for you. We read online about a picnic basket the restaurant does for $30. Two pizzas and other things. You just go there after 11.30am, get your basked and go somewhere for a nice picnic. We really enjoyed this. On that day, we did 20,000 steps as of my Fitbit, another good result. My daughter was really exhausted. So, there are lot of maps and staff around to make sure you don't get lost. Plenty of little animals and beautiful flowers to observe, a good choice to spend an afternoon or morning."
,,Orchids galore!,5.0,,"There were lovely exhibits at the botanical gardens--ginger, bonsai, but the pinnacle was the Orchid garden. Absolutely a riot of color, shape and abundance, we could not stop taking photos. Definitely a must see for anyone who loves flora and color."
,,Beautiful and great for the kids,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens, easily accessible by MRT. Big area to walk around in. Loved the childrens playground and water area."
,,"Wonderful, well worth the UNESCO World Heritage designation",5.0,,"This is a place ranked exceptionally high on this site and in every tour book and online site. With good reason. It is simply wonderful.

Not right in downtown, but a 20 minute taxi ride away (it is past the end of Orchard Road). Worth the effort to get there, there is a MTR stop there also.

The Gardens were the first entry by Singapore to become a UNESCO world heritage site which is a huge deal, well deserved by the way.

I saw part of the Gardens including the National Orchid Gardens of course and the adjacent Ginger Garden with its lily ponds and waterfall.

The entry is stunning too and is well worth a panoramic photograph on your phone or two. There is a waterfall there. Admission is free except for the Orchid Garden.

There are several lakes, one called swan lake which was most memorable too. There is also a healing garden and a perfectly placed bandstand with a grassy area there and a small pond just by the stage which only further enhances an already brilliant setting. Also, there are several sculptures and other art features throughout the Gardens, some real cool ones from the visitor's center walk to the Orchid Gardens. There is a children's garden and a rain forest that I did not personally visit.

I loved the setting, unique greenery and flowers and flowering trees and plants. Spotlessly clean. Lots of families visiting the Gardens too. I went early which was recommended to miss some of the heat and humidity.

Oh, one more tip, getting out of the Gardens is a little challenging, even though there is a taxi stand, there were no taxis in sight, also, I could not get an Uber signal from there either. Also, there are phone numbers of taxi companies there to call for a taxi, right as I was calling, one pulled up to drop some people off so I was ok. Just please be mindful of this dynamic in your planning. As I said, there is a MTR stop within the one edge of the Gardens. Maybe that is an alternative also."
,,A lovely place to visit,5.0,,"Hot but beautiful, go early in the morning or in the afternoon. I especially enjoyed the Chinese pavilion/tower."
,,Beautiful and relaxing！,4.0,,Botanic Gardens is the perfect place to walk and relax especially when the weather is nice. I just hope I can see more flowers in the garden instead of purely trees and grass.
,,Wonderous,5.0,,"These Gardens are a National Treasure. The plants here are lush and abundant, with some members being many years old. The Orchid Gardens are a wonder, filled to the brim with so many varieties and colours that you will want to stay for hours."
,,Naturally Beautiful,5.0,,The Singapore Botanical Gardens are magnificent. So many works of art nature has to offer. The Gardens staff keep the facility spotless and clean. And of course we'll trimmed. So many countless works of art produced by nature.
,,Superb botanic gardens,5.0,,This is undoubtedly the best botanic gardens we have ever visited. We spent about five hours and still did not cover all the areas. Everything here grows so well and the place is kept very neat and tidy.
,,A beautiful garden,4.0,,"It's a lovely piece of green at the border of the busy shopping area in Singapore. Has a nice small lake, more like a pond and a it's a nice place to go for a walk in the morning or early evenings to get away from all the busy shopping in Singapore. It's very accessible by the MRT/public subway."
,,A must for lover's of flowers,5.0,,"We have visited the Botanical Gardens previously. The Orchid Garden is just wonderful.
So many beautiful flowers, it's such a pleasure to visit.
While we were in the gardens a huge thunderstorms hit and having a gabezo to shelter in was great. The restuarant in the gardens is also very good."
,,A Grate Place to Escape the City,4.0,,"This is a great place to spend a couple of hours and escape the hustle and bustle of the city.

There are amazing trails that take you thought many different parts and types of garden and the rain forest was a particularly favourite of mine.

There is also a large number of wildlife species that can be found her in you just need to be quite and look :)"
,,Amazing Running area,5.0,,Free entry and great running routes. Not too crowded on weekday mornings. So many wonderful things to see. Some minor construction occurring but it does not impact too much.
,,Pleasant walk despite lizards,5.0,,"My partner and I had a lovely walk in the Gardens. The grounds were so well kept and the various areas of the Gardens were great to visit. There was a symphony on during our visit which was nice to watch and listen to. I didn't appreciate there would be large reptiles (monitor lizards) on the grounds also which were in close proximity to humans, but they seemed harmless. We did not have time for the Orchid Gardens, but it was an enjoyable walk and I would visit again."
,,Tranquil escape from City bustle,4.0,,"If you have time - and if you like gardens, or walking, or both, plan a half a day here. perhaps longer if you want lunch. Entry is free, but don't miss the Orchid Garden which has a small entry fee.
It is on one of the HoponHopoff bus routes."
,,Traditional,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are impressive and extensive. After seeing Gardens by the Bay, all artificially implanted with random varieties mixed together, it's rather refreshing to see a natural progression of acclimated plants I'm their element. The orchid section is stunning and the grounds are huge. It's not immediately in the city, so plan how you get there and back. We'll worth it for the old, traditional collection of botanical specimens."
,,Huge one!,5.0,,"Very huge garden. It is amazingly beautiful. Of course you can not visit the whole park, but you can enjoy your time visiting waterfalls, Laguna, etc."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"My husband and I had a private tour to this site and I would highly recommend it.
Wear comfortable shoes and clothes. Definitely stroller and child friendly but I think adults and couples would find it more enjoyable. The gardens are beautiful and I wish we would have had more time to explore it. The orchid garden was excellent and beautifully landscaped. Entire area was very well maintained and groomed. If you like nature, time away from the hustle and bustle, gardens and nature this is definitely a must-see while visiting Singapore."
,,A must do if you love Gardens,4.0,,Great spot and highly recommended. If you happen to be here in peak Orchid season (August I believe) then the experience will be even better.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Another good place for plant lovers. You can spend a nice evening here with family n friends. Something not to be missed
,,Walk and relax,5.0,,"The bus dropped us out here and we arrived in time for lunch, had at one of the restaurants at the entrance. Armed with our map we set off to find the orchid house, but we needed to be a little creative when following it. There was a concert going on which you could just sit on the grass hill and enjoy the pianist.
We travelled at a quicker pace than I would recommend as we had to catch the bus back and wanted to see as much as we could. Definitely give yourself a couple of hours to enjoy this fully."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"We couldn't unfortunately visit the whole place but it is really beautiful, peaceful and well maintained."
,,Good walk.,4.0,,I enjoyed walking around Singapore and the gardens are a large park at the top of Orchid road it's a good space and takes about 2 hours to walk around bring some water and enjoy the trip.
,,Best value in the city!,5.0,,"This place is free! Get it? Free! You could spend 1/2 day here. Gorgeous areas and well-maintained. Saw white swans being fed and a black swan. Many people seem to enjoy this place in the evening and with children and dogs as well. Do not miss this if you visit Singapore. And if you want to pay $5, please visit the Orchid Gardens. Well worth it for $5!"
,,Lovely place,4.0,,"A humongous park with extensive grounds. Perfect outing for a family and suitable for baby strollers and wheelchairs. Several options for dining although it gets fairly busy at weekends. Lots of people walking pets, also the occasional wild rooster and chickens. A definite favourite."
,,Great morning!,4.0,,"We were unsure at first whether to visit the gardens due to their location (being out of the centre) but we are certainly glad we did. Entrance to the main gardens are free & €5pp for the orchid gardens which were beautiful. You are free to walk around at your own pace. The rainforest, swan lake and sky walk way (above ground) were the highlights. Would recommend a visit here to anyone interested in nature or anyone who wants a bit of calm oasis away from the main city buzz."
,,A good stiff walk (or run),5.0,,"Beautiful gardens, well manicured, with plenty of great botanical exhibits on offer. Plenty of wildlife too, terrapins in the lakes and we ran into a couple of quite large molitor lizards ambling along until they decided to slip into the lake and swim off.

I didn’t like the fact that you were asked to pay extra to visit the orchid garden, that wasn’t necessary, but still it is a great park to visit. The part is around 2.2km from end to end and there are various paths that you can take through the park.

Well worth a visit."
,,This place is amazing!!!,5.0,,A true one if a kind. A must see. Plan an entire day if you really want to see everything. Bring good shoes.
,,Absolutely beautiful-make sure you visit,5.0,,"Visited the Botanic Gardens on a rainy day, but this did not dampen our experience -The gardens are magnificient and the Nationl Orchid Garden has to be one of the star attractions in Singapore. The gardens are free with a small charge to go into the Orchid Garden. You need a few hours to really appreciate all that there is to see."
,,Must see,5.0,,"You can easily spend a day here. We were there for only two hours and we didn’t even cover half the park. Large open green space, with huge trees. It’s beautiful, spacious and relaxing.

With young kids in tow, we bought the fish food and walked around trying to feed fish. There were humongous catfish. They were pretty impressive. Some large carps and lots of turtles.

The orchestra was rehearsing on the Symphony Stage which was a welcome surprise. The setting is breathtaking.

Besides impressive trees, unique plants such as the cannonball tree and beautiful flowers (we didn’t even make it to the orchid garden, which is S$5) we also saw chickens and swans.

For kids there are lots to see too. There are swinging benches in the beautiful Frangipani garden.

The highlight however was seeing numerous monitor lizards roaming around. Impressive creatures."
,,Nice walk in gardens,4.0,,"Gardens are very nice with a lot of different trees, plants... you can also see varans, squarrels, birds... If you are in a hurry you only see a little bit, like we did."
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,"You could spend hours wandering through the beautiful grounds. Well maintained, gardeners working around every corner."
,,Beautiful and Romantic,5.0,,"Went on suggestion of someone we met and loved it. Lots of different representative environments. The orchid garden was the only cost but well worth the visit. The cactus and succulents didn't look very happy but the rainforest was definitely not out of place. Saw birds, lizards, squirrels, insects and fish so not only about plants. Had a lovely lunch in the restaurant as well. Definitely well spent half day there. Easy access to public transport."
,,Amazing heaven,5.0,,This is such an exquisite garden. In fact it is classified as UNESCO World Heritage Site. For the Nature Lovers a must.
,,Beautiful and interesting,5.0,,"It's been over 20 years since the last time I visited the Botanic Gardens in Singapore, and I was delighted to have the opportunity to come back. I was particularly interested in the rain forest with its indigenous flora and some of its fauna too. The sound of the crickets as you walk through the roped off walkways is wonderful; I felt like David Attenborough. The gardens have a truly lovely collection of orchids and many other exotic flowers and plants. It's so close the the busy, bustling city, but is a haven of peace."
,,A Heritage Site - Must visit,5.0,,"Very scenic and well maintained. One of the highlights of this place is the Orchid Garden located inside. Besides, they have many different unique varieties of flowers, trees of historical significance. A Must visit."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Spent hours there and still did not see everything. Not just a huge collection of plants but wondrous gardens with so many beautiful things to see. Great for walking, sitting, meditating etc."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Very large area and really beautiful. We saw squirrels, turtles, lots of birds. Good access to the MRT at the north end of gardens. Well worth a visit. Lovely flowers,trees and a herb garden."
,,Best botanic gardens I have seen,5.0,,"As a garden lover I was keen to see these gardens. They are beautiful and probably the best I have seen
Beautifully kept and maintained, the national orchid garden was spectacular. Good range of cafes and restaurants to suit any price range. Some areas are currently under construction, I am keen to return to see these when they are completed. Lovely spot to spend a few hours"
,,Beautiful and tranquil,4.0,,"Unfortunately, we arrived just before 6 pm, which is the time the orchid paradise closes. Nevertheless, this was explained clearly to us and we had a relaxing stroll through the gardens to a top quality restaurant in the centre. On our way, we met many joggers enjoying the tranquil and safe environment. We will definitely visit again, next time arriving earlier. Entrance to the gardens was free, but there is a small charge to enter the orchid area."
,,Nice for an outing,4.0,,Nice botanical gardens and you can see the tree that is on the 5 dollar Singapore Dollar. Also lots of monitor lizards. The orchid garden is beautiful. But it is like many other botanical gardens that I see.
,,A beautiful tropical paradise with lakes and magnificent features.,5.0,,"Entered the gate just seconds from the MRT station. Even with a guide map, I finished up doing a complete circle due to the maze of paths, still 1.5Km from the other end. Well worth spending several hours there, with the Orchid Plaza as a bonus."
,,Wonderful Gardens,4.0,,"Beautiful gardens with lovely grounds, plants and sculptures. Entry is free and best time to visit is in the evening before sunset because of hot weather. Please make sure you carry cold water with you and it will take around 45 minutes to 1 hour to complete the trail."
,,Garden 🌿🍃,4.0,,"green as green
loved the large variety of plants in the gardens, orchards, walk ways and the water features... it's really got it all!
It was beautiful... stunning
So well maintained clean and tidy.
It was hot and sunny but there is lots of shade.
I enjoyed this very much"
,,The Orchids won my heart!,4.0,,Fabulous gardens with gorgeous vistas and beautiful old rare trees at every turn. The orchid garden is stunning especially. Also enjoyed the cafe and the gift shops too. Very worthwhile!
,,Natural Beauty!,5.0,,"Easy to walk around, lots to see, very clean and well maintained. Orchid Garden in the middle of the gardens was worth seeing. Peaceful place in a fast paced city!"
,,Take Your Time and Enjoy,5.0,,You could spend a whole day to view all the gardens. We spent a few hours and covered as much as we could. Love the spice gardens. We didn't have enough time to view the Orchid Garden. That will have to be next time. Overall very scenic. We saw plenty of wildlife on our walk too and if you need a break there are a few cafes to pop in for a cuppa.
,,Geraldine Greenwood,5.0,,Great place to visit for plants and trees I especially loved the Orchid Gardens so many different varieties. A lot of walking involved here.
,,cool place to see plants and flowers !!!!!,5.0,,best place to explore plants and flower with family and friends the botanic garden is clean and well maintained and has all over ac in the garden recommend this place to all
,,Beautiful place for leisure,5.0,,"We spent 5 hours there. We watched a variety of fish, swans, turtles and monitors. The place was full of nature. The place was very peaceful. I should have brought a book to read, lying on the grass."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"As someone who was not a big orchid fan i was truly amazed by the display, the size of the flower heads and the beautiful colours was simply lovely. The camera was clicking non stop. Thius is another must see destination"
,,Must see and free,5.0,,Beautiful to go and visit. Lots of interesting species and photos to take and all free. Singapore really knows how to make sure a busy densely packed city can keep large green areas free of development.
,,Never boring,5.0,,"A walk in Botanic Gardens is a must for me whenever I visit Singapore. The place has good stopping spot every now and then for me to sit and have a bit of a break from the long walk. Facilities are well looked for and maintained. Mosquito repellent is a must, it's a tropical garden."
,,An oasis in the city,5.0,,"Wow !! Whether you want to walk, jog or just enjoy these tranquil gardens. .. you won't be disappointed. These would have to be amongst the most beautiful gardens you'll ever see ... meticulously maintained. A definite sight to see in Singapore."
,,Nice big flower !!!!,5.0,,I was there had new couple pre wedding I walking around very big flower I really love this place I wish walking long but my foot so hurt
,,Best we've been to,5.0,,Beautiful and well tended in every way. The Orchid garden (small charge) is spectacular. Whilst there try out the Halia Restuarant. See my review. You won't be disappointed.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,A lovely place to spend an hour or so walking around. Little wonder it is part of UNESCO. The gift shop is lovely and not over-priced.
,,Botanic garden,4.0,,"Botanic garden in Singapore is a beautiful garden that has many feature. Children Jacob garden. Healing garden, tropical garden, herbal garden and the most beautiful Orchid's garden . Must see. Some days has show ,play, movies... on weekends. Nice to visit all year around"
,,Stunning Plants to be seen,4.0,,If you have a few hours to spare jump on the local bus (the Hotel normally give you tickets) and go visit the Botanic Gardens - the bus ride takes you around part of the city which is interesting in itself and the Gardens are great to walk around and chill out whilst seeing some stunning plants - also a nice little coffee shop here for refreshments
,,Fresh air in the city,4.0,,"Great place for a run to clock steps and enough windy paths to keep you from getting bored. The landscapes change too asyou make your way from one end of the park to the other, so there's always something to look at. I enjoy people watching as I run through the park - from the large group of Taichi practitioners to the small groups of yogis to the crazy boot campers who zoom past as they do their uphill sprints.
End your run/walk at Food For Thought or at one the cafes at Cluny court for a perfect morning of fresh air and me time!"
,,"Green, green, green everywhere",5.0,,"Early morning walk through part of the Gardens didn't fail to disappoint. Lush tropical foliage, peaceful and pleasant. Excellent for access and pathways. Need to return."
,,Amazing gardens with spectacular views,5.0,,"Wish we had more time to spend here!

The gardens are beautiful and extremely well kept.

The signs are very interesting and informative for all ages, and don't disturb the beauty of this place.

Bonus point: Turles and monitor lizards live in the inspirational lake, which was a great sight to see!

Tip: The coffee shops make for a great break from the sun, and are around the same price was the rest of Singapore!"
,,A must in Singapure,5.0,,"Coming from a tropical country, we were not too enthusiastic about visiting the Botanic Gardens but we decided to include the gardens in our sightseeing choices since it was one of the top things to do here and it is really worth it. Its got a very briad selection of beautiful plants ftom around the world. The orchids collection is specially worthwhile. A must see in Singapure"
,,Orchard garden,4.0,,"The botanical garden is an UNESCO site. Visit to the orchard garden was very enjoyable. The variety of orchards is mind blowing, particularly the orchards for the VIPs. The Burhill house is full of old world charm. A very pleasant time visiting this oasis."
,,Take the time to visit its good for the soul,1.0,,"Give yourself enough time and wear really comfortable shoes. Then let yourself just wander and be immersed in this beautiful environment, it's easy to get to on the MRT"
,,Beautiful flowers !,4.0,,Must visit the orchid garden also which you have to pay for but is lovely. There is a very nice bistro here for lunch and is reasonably priced.
,,One of the Most Beautiful in the World,5.0,,"A friend and native Singaporean told me on my first visit that the most magical moment I could have in town would be to walk in the Botanic Gardens just before sunrise. Since then I have made a point to do just this on each trip, and my latest visit (in August) proved that it still is true. You can take the metro (it opens by 5:30 am), walk, or taxi there, and the gates are open around 5 am. This peaceful time actually becomes a symphony, as you walk through the special gardens (the Ginger Garden is one of my favorites), around the lakes, and listen to the birds rise up in song. People practicing tai chi and yoga soon join them, and you'll share the path with runners and walkers getting exercise before the heat of the day begins. Look for the hidden sculptures as well, and the Heritage Trees scattered throughout the park. Yes, a magical place, and free to visit."
,,Amazing Gardens,5.0,,Absolutely amazing! This is definitely a must see. So many beautiful flowers. The fall display was there when I went. They did a very nice job
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,Great tropical gardens - very extensive and an oasis of quiet in Singapore. Visit the orchid garden (although that is chargeable and the rest is not - while away a few minutes watching the turtles in the lake
,,"A glimmering sight by night; a brilliant, visual treat by day.",4.0,,"We went both in the night for dinner and to catch the Christmas lights, and by day to enjoy the verdant greenery. It's always amazing to think that the quiet and stillness of the park is just one tanglin gate from the noisy traffic headed for the bustling orchard road, a stone's throw away. One can stroll, sit and gaze, have tea at a cafe or a picnic on the grass, and just simply enjoy ... being. Don't miss the orchids enclosure while you're there."
,,Astonishing!,5.0,,Very beautiful park. And bigger then expected. Don't miss this! Try to go there on a more cloudy day for it can be very hot.
,,Refreshing walk,5.0,,This is a good place for people who love nature but do not want to leave the city. You can take long strolls in the midst of beautiful gardens. You can also have picnic or do sports activities.
,,Almost Bucket List-Worthy,5.0,,"This place pretty much blows NYC's Central Park out of the water. There are so many twists, turns and pathways, that even when there are many visitors, you feel like it's there just for you to explore. We spent 3 hours here just taking a relaxing scenic walk with small breaks. During that time, we saw a handful of exotic animals, tons of exotic plants, and a wedding photo shoot.

If you come here at a time other than morning or evening, I recommend an umbrella since it can get very hot/sunny. Near the center of the gardens is an outdoor amphitheater, which has some of the best spots for a picnic. The coolest thing about this place is that it's free to the public!

We recommend the swan lake, as well as the shops in the Esplanade (by the falls)."
,,Best place to go in Singapore,5.0,,"A beautiful park open from 5:00 am till midnight. Wonderful place to jog during the night or early in the morning, and so secure. If you want to escape from the city for a short rest, it s the place to go"
,,Peaceful and colourful rejuvenation !,5.0,,If you appreciate nature and it's peaceful surroundings this is the place for you. Beautifully maintained full of colourful orchids and lush greenery. It's fresh air is a treat for your lungs along with its calm and quiet. Never imagined Singapore was that GREEN !
,,Floral delight!,4.0,,"A must do if you consider yourself even slightly plant/garden enthused. Stunning botanical world class gardens. If you love orchids make sure you pay the 5 Singapore dollars to enter the VIP orchid garden. AMAZING (if your a student - local or abroad - you'll receive free entry!)

As a side note, the chilli crab pasta at the restaurant next door to the orchid garden is TO DIE FOR."
,,Beautiful gardens right in the city,5.0,,"A beautiful leisurely walk in the park. We are very impressed with the upkeep of this botanical Gardens. Very well thought out space that captures many beautiful settings. The creative landscaping to create gardens from around the world was very well done. Very nice way to spend a few hours or the day with single couples families etc. definitely recommend the botanical gardens and don't forget to visit the orchids section..really beautiful .
Take the SMRT leaves you off right at one of the gates and then you walk through to get to the main section or you could figure out how to take a bus that leaves you off at the other gate ."
,,Half Day Walk,4.0,,"We took a train out to the gardens from the city, wandering through the gardens down to the exit at the other end, and then up to and along Orchard Road. The gardens are beautifully kept, and have several ponds of varying sizes, attracting numerous birds (and also containing turtles). Well worth a visit."
,,Spectacular Gardens,5.0,,"A vast and colorful garden well worth the time exploring. The highlight was the Orchid Garden which does have an entrance fee but was worth it. The gardens are lush, colorful, fragrant and tropical. The bougainvillea garden is a riot of color and the path through the rain forest is lush. Just get there early as the heat and humidity can become oppressive. But it is all a welcomed green break from the city."
,,Beautiful place to spent half a day,5.0,,"Really beautiful and majestic place. It is really lovely, calm and peaceful. You can easily spent half a day roaming around and strolling. Make sure you bring water/umbrella, shades etc."
,,Expansive free area for walking,5.0,,"The entrance to the Gardens is free and it is a beautiful park to walk, jog or find a spot to exercise. The paid entrance admission to the Orchid area is well worth it and even though a large part was under renovation, the areas with flowers were stunning. Need lots of memory space for pictures!"
,,Great park for running!!,5.0,,We wanted a place to run and originally wanted to run along the water next to the Marina Bay Sands but the concierge recommended the botanical gardens. We took a bus 5 stops and it is a beautiful park!! Lots of signage about all the plants you see and each part of the park has a different theme and feel. Great for runners as the path is wide and there are so many twists and turns to keep it interesting.
,,Incredibly beautiful and worth a look,5.0,,"This is one of the largest botanic gardens I've seen and I've been to a few including Kew in London. It's amazing that it's so well kept and it's free! Except if you go into the orchid garden which is $5, still not bad. There are soo many areas to see, I really loved the medicinal gardens, so many plants to benefit your health! I went in the morning on a cloudy day so the heat was bearable. I wouldn't mind seeing this a few times to really take time to see all the plants but I tried to go through it at a medium pace and it took me 3 hours. Orchid garden is definitely worth the fee, it's amazing how the grow in this region and how well designed it is. Even saw a few kimono dragons wandering around."
,,Breathe it all in...,5.0,,A full day and a day worth it. So much to see and experience. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy dinner while you are there too. great way to end the day.
,,Very pretty,4.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a lovely place to visit, home to lots of various plants and flowers. I would recommend going and I am pleased we had the chance to visit this lovely place however if you had to choose between going here and gardens by the bay I would skip this one."
,,One of the best places in any city,5.0,,"Fantastic World Heritage Site.
Wonderfully maintained, peaceful and majestic.
A must visit on any trip to Singapore.
I always take an early morning run around the gardens from Orchard Road hotels and it is probably my favourite city run anywhere in the world.
Free entrance.
Restores the soul!"
,,Slow Down Your Day,4.0,,"Almost outside our hotel was a bus stop where one can catch a bus to the Gardens, but be warned the driver does not handle cash - the best bet is to go to an MRT station as you can get a train right to the back gate. We wanted to be in the outdoors and somewhere where we could find some shade and a little breeze, so we headed there after breakfast and wandered leisurely along enjoying what is a in anyone's language a special place. It covers a large area and includes, pathways, playgrounds, statues, lakes, pagodas, many large significant trees, gardens, park benches, eating places both sit down and takeaway, plenty of green areas to kick a ball or play chase and a lot more besides. Recognition as a UNESCO world heritage site is well deserved. There is no charge for the gardens but the National Orchid Garden inside the Botanic Garden does have a small charge - $1 for seniors."
,,"UNESCO, worth the visit",4.0,,"Maybe this is personal but I thought the place was too big, with no options of aided travel, no bikes no scooter, but then again, it's definitely a lovely place if I didn't went into it a 2pm under the scorching sun."
,,A must see!,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore you must see these gardens to get an idea of the lushness of the tropical vegetation test must once have covered this whole island. The National Orchid garden is here and is classified as a World Heritage site. Walk here early in the morning before it's too hot and see huge mahogany trees, orchids and other spectacular tropical flowers whose perfumes waft through the air."
,,Well kept and worth a visit,5.0,,"It houses the Orchid Garden which is worth a visit. Its well kept and clean. Take a picnic so that you can spend time to explore, relax and eat."
,,Transformed Gardens,5.0,,"More than 10 years ago, I used to jog twice weekly in the Botanic Gardens with a friend or two in the evenings. We'd start out from the current university campus, head to the rear of the gardens first before stepping into the garden grounds and ending our runs at the main gate near Holland/Cluny Roads. At that time, the rear of the gardens (where the Jacobs Ballas Children's Garden is situated) was not part of the Botanic Gardens.

It was never that crowded in the gardens. There was space, serenity and quiet. Occasionally, we'd bump into government ministers and political leaders doing their walks. It was in recent years after the Gardens was recognised by UNESCO as part of the world heritage site that it became more popular with tourists, not just with local and foreign residents. Even an early walk at 6:30am, one will see quite a number of enthusiasts indulging in their stationary and momentary exercises.

I must say that tremendous efforts have been put in to ensure the Gardens is kept and maintained to tip-top condition; perhaps some aspects are overly done. For example, workers are constantly clearing fallen leaves from the walkways. Otherwise, the authorities have constantly introduced diversity and innovative creations to make the gardens comparable to make it comparable to other well-known gardens across the world.

Visitors to Singapore should make an effort to visit the Gardens one of their destinations. The best time to visit is early in the morning when the air is cool and crisp, otherwise the early evening is the next best option. Entry to the Gardens is free to all. Payment is required for visits to the curated orchid garden. There is Botanic Gardens MRT station which is located at the rear of the Gardens."
,,Stunning as well as a great place for walk/run,5.0,,"It's a beautiful spot to go for a family trip, hang out with friends or for a jog. It's a huge area, so there are plenty of things to see and do. There is an MRT in one exit and Tanglin Mall in another, so it is very convenient to get to public transport. I recommend going in the morning (it's cooler than in the afternoon)"
,,Superb,5.0,,Never get bored of this place. Spent more than 3 hours here with my friends get fresh air to refreshing my mind after hard work.
,,Visit with Tourists,4.0,,Clean. Well done and laid out. Beautiful nature despite of the tropical climate. Definitely ideal for family and couples.
,,Loved the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"I did not expect to spend all day at the Botanic Gardens, but I did. Came for a quick look, but stayed to see the Healing Garden, rainforest, Orchid garden and everything else. Was glad to arrive early in the morning, to see all the Singaporeans doing sports on the lawns."
,,A must if your in the area,5.0,,"We visited the Botanic Gardens so many times I lost count on our recent month long visit to Singapore, as they were in walking distance for us.

We took advantage of the over 60s $1 entry to the Orchid garden they are breath taking there is so much to see.
The Botanic gardens are free entry, and are so big we found something different on every visit its such a lovely place to just chill and enjoy nature at its best.

We loved walking through the gardens to the swinging seats then rest there for a while its a very quiet area surrounded with (I think) frangipani trees its so beautiful and peaceful."
,,World Heritage Garden..must see,5.0,,"As a Singaporean I would like to introduce the Sungapore Botanic Gardens with a long history behind it. It was declared as a World Heritage site few years back.
The garden had change alot as u could see new attractions like the Orchid Garden.
Many world leaders never failed to visit it and have a Orchid will be name after them.
Yiu can also see the official Singapore Orchid called Vanda Miss Joaquim.
The trees are huge with big roots. They are there for more thrn 100 years.
There also other spice exibits and a open concert area which holds many mudic perfromances.
On sundays is best for families with oicnic baskets. Its very polpular too with those who loves to walk and jog.
There are many buses from the cities and the best way to go there is by the undetground train. You can take the yellow circle line or downtown blue line straight to the Botanic Gardens Station.
Go for it.... Cheers"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"A huge garden with many different types of smaller gardens within. Well worth a whole day to stroll around. The orchid garden was just spectacular. The gardens are free entry with a $5 fee for the orchid garden ($1 for over 60s). Some nice looking eating places. We ate at the local food court in the Raffles bldg. very cheap and food ok.
I would say this garden is far better than Gardens by the bay except for the domes and super trees."
,,Gigantic Garden,5.0,,"Gigantic Garden, you will need half day to explore the whole garden. You have to make full use of the map provided to plan your day or you might be exhausted. Select sections of the garden that are of your interest.
I strongly suggest to visit National Orchid Garden. With additional $5, you will get to see endless of orchid varieties. It is definitely better than the gardens at the Gardens by the Bay with only a fraction of its cost.
Better to avoid very hot noon, try to reach the garden at around 3 or 4 pm when the sun has receded."
,,Beautiful and relaxing,5.0,,"Very beautiful and a great place to go for a leisurely stroll, as well as the botanic gardens, also go to the Orchid gardens. Botanic gardens were free to enter and only $5 to enter the Orchid gardens. Family friendly and a fantastic day trip out! We got an Uber from Bencoolen street, which only cost about $10. The gardens also had fantastic wifi, a cafe and lots of benches. So you could even enjoy a break from the city, enjoy the fresh air but still get some work done!"
,,A great way to spend the day.,5.0,,"We lived in Singapore for 14 years and regularly enjoyed the colours, tranquility, open space and performances afforded by the Singapore Botanical Gardens. They are beautifully maintained with some wonderful special features including the orchid gardens and the small tract of rainforest."
,,Trip to Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Well laid out & maintained. The plants particularly the orchids are really very beautiful & seeing them 'live' was a joy. We also were intrigued by the naming of orchids after some VIPs.
,,a must go in singapore!!!,5.0,,you can easily spend half a day there with children: try the playgrounds and water splash! a must_go: the orchid garden even for not-flower-fans: incredibble! take the botanic garden mrt on the orange line helpful? enjoy it!!!!!!
,,Oasis in city,5.0,,When I got married we went to the gardens for photographs. Some 32 years later the gardens are still as lovely.
,,The best part of rainforest in Singapore,5.0,,It's a must to feel the best part of rainforest in Singapore with the delicated arragnment and presentation. The kids would love to feel the birds as one of the fun. Also good for jogging.
,,Next To Nature,4.0,,Huge nature park to relac with freinds n loved ones.Has a rustic yet neat look with some activities going on..cycling jog walk or simply gazing at the plants trees ponds etc..
,,Very beautiful gardens,5.0,,"The gardens are huge, we didn't see much of it and were there for half a day. Our toddler enjoyed the children's garden with the sandpit and water play areas. And just walking through the gardens and looking all around was very relaxing."
,,Great for a long stroll,4.0,,"FREE; 5 am to 12 midnight daily. It's a beautiful place full of different paths that lead to all sorts of different gardens. WEAR SNEAKERS. It takes about an hour just to get halfway through, and that's if you're walking through each different area along the way. This is easily accessible via the MRT and is about a 30 minute ride from the 'Orchard Road' red line station. As you walk off the MRT the Botanical Garden entrance is right off to the right with foldable maps of the garden's layout. However, the botanical garden station is the only MRT station near the garden so if you're looking to walk through the entire garden you'll have to walk your way back to the same MRT station (or take a bus at the other end).
*Near the Orchid Garden are restrooms and snacks."
,,A nice to unwind,5.0,,"If this is your first visit to Singapore go to the Botanic Gardens before you visit the Gardens by the Bay, The gardens a beautiful and will take you must of the day to wonder around, the is a lot to see. If you visit the Gardens by the Bay first you may be disappointed with the Botanic Gardens."
,,Morning Walk along Botanical Garden,5.0,,"This garden is really impressive with lots of different flowers, and nice places to rest after a tired walk. Best garden ever."
,,Amazing,5.0,,One of the most beautiful places to visit in Singapore ! Very well priced and easily accessed ! Don't miss out while visiting !
,,Peace and serenity,4.0,,"The Botanic Garden of Singapore is Singapore's first UNESCO heritage site, it is a place with plenty of history having been started before World War 2. The collection of plants and the architecture of the buildings in the park is amazing.

Entrance to the park is free, however if you want to explore the Orchid Musuem within Botanic Garden, there is a sperate charge.

Taking a stroll through the entire park will probably take around half a day. On certain Sundays of each month the Singapore Symphonic band plays at the pavilion concert stage at the Swan Lake.

The park is clean and inviting, one can bring their children there for a picnic or to walk their dogs. Highly recommended as a place for a date or to have a gathering with friends and family."
,,Don't miss the orchid gardens.,5.0,,"As visitors the Singapore Botanic Garden was on our list to see. It was a terrific experience and very much worth the 2 to 3 hours we were there. The orchid gardens are truly spectacular with hundreds of varieties viewable on a paved, meandering walkway. Fountains and flowering arches enhance the walk. As we were leaving around 6:00 PM, a free concert was beginning in the valley of palms amphitheater.... a great way to finish off the afternoon."
,,Botanic Gardens. A must do in a three days visit to Singapore,4.0,,"Early in the morning or late in the afternoon is enjoyable. The variety of orchids are unbeatable, and the setting, colors are unique. Sundays you can also enjoy concerts. Ride your bike and park in any of the entrances, free admittance, except the orchids garden. But is only 5 dollars and is worth much more than that."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"well worth a visit, the most colourful collection of orchids that I have ever seen ,the surroundings are to be seen for their dynamism, cafe and shop both good"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"It's hard to believe you're in a city as the Singapore Botanical Gardens are so peaceful and quiet. There are so many different gardens that you could visit several times and still find gardens you hadn't visited. The National Orchid Garden is definitely the highlight although at present it is undergoing improvements so quite a lot of it is inaccessible. It is still worth visiting to see all the beautiful orchids. There are plenty of cafes, restaurants, gift shops and toilets throughout the Botanical Gardens. We found it easy to get to using the MRT. There is no charge to enter the Botanical Gardens and just a $5 fee for the National Orchid Garden."
,,Great place,4.0,,It was nice to have a sumptous meal at the restaurant and enjoy the lush greenery. I will definitely do so again soon.
,,Botanical training,4.0,,Nice spot with some lovely places to relax. We sometimes do running and its great. No cycling allowed :(
,,Calmness in a the busiest of places.,5.0,,"This is well worth a visit too. The tourist buses stop off here, so it can be part of your day out. It really is a calm in the middle of a thriving densely populated country and gives a chance of recharging the batteries before returning back into the hub bub of Singapore. There are several parts to these gardens, with a healing garden, and other tranquil places. There are handy places to eat and take shelter when the heavens open - which of course can be quite frequent. I visited with my year old granddaughter, and there are good facilities for children. There was tai chi going on which was great to see, amongst all the beautiful plants and landscape. If you see any ants they are huge, we were fascinated and watched them being busy for ages in a flower bed. We also came across a massive lizard - most likely to be an Asian water monitor, which was brilliant to be so close to this amazing creature by a small stream. We loved this place, we loved Singapore."
,,Singapore 's first UNESCO site,5.0,,"As with all things in Singapore , if it's award winning it's going there be worth visiting. The gardens are lush and well laid out. They are also educational. Make time Hor this beautiful exotic green lung in our garden city ."
,,World class garden,5.0,,"take a walk through Botanic Garden before the sun rises at 7 am. The morning dew, smell of nature and beautiful river flow is the most zen way to start your day."
,,worth to spend a day,4.0,,"A beautiful man made garden cleverly arranged by Singapore government, I spent many hours through paths and steps to explore the nature and found out that without natural rainfall it would be difficult to maintain the garden. Visitors can enjoy an relaxing teatime in many coffeeshops at different locations. We should not forget to visit the Orchid garden and ginger garden. The best time to visit is early in the morning before 9 or 4 in the afternoon. One disadvantage in the park is lack of children playground."
,,UNESCO world heritage site,5.0,,The only one here. With easy access via Botanical Garden Station. Do check out the orchid Garden as well. Love feeding the swans here :)
,,Clean park for family.,5.0,,This is a green and clean park for every one who need to have fresh-air and relax. The park locates beside MRT station which is convenient to go. There is a orchid garden with more than 100 species inside Botanic Gardens.
,,Amazing effort done on a spectacular scale,4.0,,This is an amazing garden. The various sections are well laid out and the Japanese gardens were beautiful. Well organised and well thought out. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Lunch,1.0,,Took the trouble to drive there for lunch and was disappointed the the two restaurants at the sheltered basement carpark was recently closed!
,,one of the better botanic gardens,4.0,,bring lots of water as taking a tour here will make you sweat. for nature lovers and if you want a quiet place to visit in singapore
,,"Beautiful, relaxing place to be close to nature",4.0,,"It's a beautiful garden. A good place to have picnics, take a walk, or listen to live bands (they arrange such performances pretty often), and be close to nature."
,,Only saw 10%,5.0,,We visited the Gardens for the second time today. despite spending three hours there we felt we had only skimmed the surface of what was on offer. Definitelt y worth at least two visits.
,,Visit to Botanical Gardens,4.0,,"I invited some of my overseas friends for a walk in the Botanical Gardens. The duration was about 3 hours. The visitors were very impressed with the level of detailed layout planning undertaken by the authorities. Very educational, recreational, socialising event and most importantly a memorable trip. Strongly recommended to visitors to Singapore."
,,No entry fee,4.0,,If you are looking for free entry fee. This is the one. It's surrounding by plenty of trees. I feel fresh. But I don't recommend that visiting the orchid garden which located inside the garden. It has to pay for the entree and it's quite small. I don't think it's worth to visit.
,,Morning walk/exercise,4.0,,"A good place to have a casual walk and exercise with good varieties of scenery. From jungle like to tree top and floral garden one will be amazed with what this garden can offer. Of course not forgetting the varieties of orchids in the, never to be missed, Orchid Garden."
,,A serenity place within the city,5.0,,"1.5km from Orchard road with multiple paths and beautify fauna and greens. A great place to recharge. Early morning lots of Taichi and other exercises, as well as popular run throught for joggers."
,,Great place to read a book or just enjoy a calm evening,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens (free entrance, open 24/7) is excellent for an early morning or late afternoon visit (any other time will probably be too hot anyway), to read a book in the many benches, or to have a coffee in the various cafés, or to just have a stroll through the garden and admire the magnificent heritage trees. Also look out for free organized visits, which are great to know a little bit more about the gardens and Singapore!"
,,Flowers n foliage,4.0,,A great place to chill out in the shady walks around n a good orchid n plant Nursery which houses one of the most exotic flowers. There are nice n inexpensive cafes n pavilion to take in the greenery n fresh are at the same time indulge in a nice cuppa..highly recommended to visit on your stop over..
,,Quieter During the Week,4.0,,"The park is lovely and extensive but tends to get very busy on weekends, and especially on Sundays. Mornings are busy with people waking dogs and exercising. Evenings are usually pleasant there."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"My third visit here, and I'd go again. Lovely lakes, gardens, rain-forest areas with restaurants and refreshment area. The MRT is a short walk away."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Great place to have a lovely walk. We paid extra to see the orchid garden and it was well worth the money only $5.00 each. Lots of lovely restaurants and cafe to buy ice creams which on a very hot day is a must. Have a lovely garden for the children to play in also which is safe. The plants and flowers are lovely and certainly worth the walk around and see.
,,Enjoyable place to explore,4.0,,"We went as part of the hop on hop off bus - enjoyed the walk around, the ""walk with the giants"" was good, seeing a forest from the canopy makes a big difference. Lots of different sections in the garden to explore and enjoy"
,,great garden for walk and pretty quiet,3.0,,"this garden was so big garden, you can walk with your pet or just relax, have picnic with family. i love the grass, so green and i can sit there. so clean, and naturally.. i feel like in jungle over there because i can find a big lizard, turtle, bird, monkey. if you need a relax and moment to..you must go here but dont forget bring cap haha"
,,"Very interesting, worth another visit",5.0,,"This free to visit garden contains lots of different areas of interest from native tropical rain forest to a bonsai garden and most things in between. Fantastic range of plants, beautiful vistas, and lots of wildlife with very few people as soon as you got away from the hubs. We stayed all day and were only driven away by threat of thunderstorm and lack of energy! Brilliant. Note that you pay to see the orchid collection, but we didn't get there -too much else of interest to see first."
,,Paradise in Singapore !,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful ! Make the time to visit ! Relaxing atmosphere friendly staff eager to help . Signage could be better if aiming for specific area . Amazing orchids watch out for squirrels and large lizards in undergrowth !
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"I have not been to the garden in the last 1 year. Going there for a morning walk with my friends was a delight! We were lucky that it was a cool morning and the garden was not extremely crowded for 8am on a Saturday. I really enjoyed my swing ride in the park too!

Found the food in one of the eateries - mei-ji, a bit crowded and pricey. So after our walk, we went across to the food court in the nearby hospital for a simple and reasonably priced breakfast. That was great.

Highly recommended for morning walks."
,,Mad Dogs and Englishmen,3.0,,"Was there on a public holiday. Very crowded, freaking hot, not much shelter. Best avoided in the day. Bring an umbrella.

Plenty of tourists, foreign workers on their off days gawking at the tourist and some locals out to ""exercise"".

Lots of trees but same can be said of a jungle. Limited car parking space and it is not cheap."
,,Super lovely,5.0,,Had a really lovely experience walking around the gardens was so relaxing and peaceful so glad we did it.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"The history and all the different plants that you can see and snap photos of. Most of the area is free, but if you want to see the orchids that will cost you money. I didn't do it, so I don't know the entry fee. The gardens is so large it could take you a day to go through it. I think there's a rail stop, but I got there by sightseeing bus."
,,Mesmerized,5.0,,"What an amazing visit to Singapore's Botanical gardens. I took so many photographs I nearly wore my camera out. We visited it on a Bus City Tour and from the minute we walked in until we left it was breathtakingly beautiful at every turn. From the orchid gardens, the palm gardens the lily pond....oh I could go on and on....you must visit to see for yourself."
,,Nature trip in SG,5.0,,"After the beatiful garden's by the bay , sentosa etc. I think this is a nice place to relax. There is no entrance fee but it is quite a nice place to experience nature."
,,Great place for a walk,4.0,,"Visited Singapore for 6 days with my husband and parents. We caught the MRT to Botanic Gardens station and did a circuit around the place before training back to our hotel. The Orchid Garden was really great (only $1 for students and seniors). Other areas had nice places to sit and have a picnic - signs say no playing sports or frisbee, so just sit down and enjoy! It has a few places to eat as well. We got coffee at a cafe in the centre, it was more expensive but nice enough. Hot out so remember to drink water!"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,We spent a most amazing morning in these gardens. Even though a weekend there was plenty of space to roam and enjoy all the elements. A highlight was definitely the orchid area.
,,What a garden,5.0,,Excellent day trip. Lot of beautiful flowers. Relaxing place at mid Singapore. Worth of visting and cost only 5 SGD
,,Morning walk,5.0,,An excellent place to meet for a walk and talk. I like to invite friends to join me on a Saturday morning to catch-up and still have a healthy walk. Sometimes it follows with a local breakfast at the nearby Adam Road food centre. Not this time.
,,Very Good,5.0,,We love this garden. Trees have planted very well in the garden. Very clean and pleasure to walk in this.
,,singapore stopover,5.0,,"Free entry , nice easy day viewing well ,maintained gardens . Café available or you could take a picnic"
,,One Of A Kind!,5.0,,"You won't see a magnificent garden as the Singapore Botanic gardens. There a various routes to reach it, but the Botanic gardens MRT station would be the widely used means to reach there. The gardens are a hundred and fifty eight years old and it is the only tropical garden honored as a Word heritage site by the UNESCO.
It spreads across 202 acres and has more than 10,000 species of flora. It is a good romantic time spent with your loved one, a fun family picnic and also a great school excursion. Although it is free to enter the BG, you have to pay 5 dollars to see the orchid gardens, but it is actually worth it. Don't Miss IT!"
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,So many wonderful flowers in a extremely nice environment. A place to see and 3 hours in not enough. We will be back 😀
,,Outstanding,5.0,,A truly wonderful garden full of exotics and tropical plants. The different palm trees are a wonder to behold.
,,A Must See.,5.0,,"Even if you have limited time in Singapore, you must spend at least a couple of hours (better still, half a day) in the Botanic Gardens. The National Orchid Garden, in particular, is fantastic."
,,Wonderful botanic gardens.,4.0,,The botanical garden is a very nice place to make av breakfast on you hop on hop off busstour. Don't miss the jungle walk.
,,Theme park garden,4.0,,"Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful and well worth a visit. It just feels SO tidy and SO neat that I didn't feel at ease because there was not a single leaf out of place. My partner wanted to have a lie down on the grass but he wasn't even sure if it was allowed because it's so pristine. Still a great walk around and be sure to find the swing benches for the opportunity to feel like a child again."
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,"If you love gardens, then you will love this place. It is beautifully laid out, beautifully planted and beautifully maintained.

Divided into zones, each one following a different theme, and each one a treat for the eyes or the nose.

The orchid garden is the royal icing on a very fine cake!

Simply put, this place is like a tropical Kew Gardens. And, to me, there is no higher praise.

The gift shop at Nassim gate is probably the best gift shop I've seen in Singapore. We got several Christmas presents (in August) for the folks back home as well as holiday souvenirs for ourselves and friends.

We had a snack and drinks at the Bee's Knees, and that was high quality too.

I cannot fault this attraction and wish I was staying closer to it so i could walk it's paths every day!"
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"The whole huge area is well cared for and beautifully green. he Orchis Gardens are superb and we had a wonderful, relaxed afternoon, enjoying the ambience."
,,Nice and bigger than you thought!,5.0,,"We concentrated on the Orchid Garden, which costs S$5 per adult. The Botanic Garden is bigger than I thought, it is 1.3km from the MRT station. The Botanic Garden is beautiful, and the Orchid Garden is well worth the visit."
,,a great place for relaxation...,4.0,,"great place for relaxation especially with family and friends. If you're into nature photography, a good place to visit."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"From mediterranean sea to african shores, from australian lands to asian gardens, simply amazing. A must do visit!"
,,Gardens,4.0,,Its so great experiencing another culture/country through nature. the gardens were designed nicely and clearly. The orchids garden is a must do!
,,Enjoy the lush foliage and peaceful setting,5.0,,Make sure you allocate enough time to stroll through the series of landscapes which make up the botanical gardens and include the National Orchid garden. I spent 4 hours and there was still plenty more to see. My tip is to study the guide you pick up either at the entry or the information centre to determine priorities that interest you such as orchids or the healing garden because there is plenty of walking between exhibits.Entry to the gardens is free and look out for the wildlife.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I personally love visiting gardens, forests, and parks when I travel, and have seen my fair share of botanical gardens. I'm rarely disappointed by botanical gardens, and this was no exception. In fact, I think this has to be one of the most beautiful I've seen.
The gardens were huge, with so many different elements to explore (we didn't actually have enough time to see the whole park), big enough to spend many hours strolling and relaxing. There were enough trees and shady spots to provide some refuge from the sun, and it was nice to see that it's animal friendly with pet dogs roaming around in some areas.
I would definitely recommend making a visit to the National Orchid Garden whilst inside, that was absolutely stunning."
,,A beautiful walk in the park,5.0,,Just stroll around in the beautiful setting of the Botanical gardens helps you to destress and enjoy nature.
,,Best Botanic Garden ever!,5.0,,"Wow! As a lover of gardens and one who rates the Melbourne Botanic Gardens as definitely the best in Australia and one of the best in the world I must say I was blown away by the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Almost impossible to view in one day simply because of its sheer size, it is chock full of the most interesting plants I have ever seen. Access is good with well signed paths and overhead walkways taking you around the grounds. Within the garden is the amazing Orchid Garden which even for non-garden lovers is simply mesmerising; a kaleidoscopic cornucopia of colour that almost looks unreal....except it isn't. A must see."
,,Sunrise and the birds sing,5.0,,"We awoke early to arrive by the immaculate metro system to catch sunrise and the birds sing, as recommended by a local, we were not disappointed. We walked for miles taking in the splendor of the fauna and flora. Endangered species of trees, one that was the only remaining sample in Singapore. This was one of the highlights of a quick business trip. Not to be missed!"
,,"very beautiful place, i loved it",5.0,,"quite place full of trees great for children to run and play, it is free unless you want to visit Orchid garden than you have to pay. it is very big we couldn't finish it."
,,Really Lovely and Relaxing,4.0,,"We loved the Botanic Gardens in Singapore, a lovely place for a stroll. Beautiful flowers and leafy shrubs and trees, and a blissful escape from the heat and humidity of downtown.
Singapore is a gorgeous city and though the Botanic Gardens are somewhat overshadowed by the Supertree Grove and Cloud Forest and the Gardens By The Bay, they are still well worth a visit. We really enjoyed our couple of relaxing hours here."
,,Special Trees,5.0,,"Never thought I'd wax lyrical about trees, but the UNESCO Botanical Gardens is v v special. Lovely soup too !"
,,Always worth a visit,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are UNESCO listed and for a very good reason - they are just wonderful. Filled with beautiful exotic species of plants - flowers, orchids, palms, trees and so much more. It is worth spending a few hours strolling through the gardens and taking it all in - sights and scents. Wonderful!"
,,Lovely Gardens and Parklands,5.0,,"We took a bus to the Botanic Gardens, which was great as we were able to see more of Singapore as the bus drove there. Lovely gardens and parklands to view, take photos or just walk around and relax. Worth a visit."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"This is the place if you love walking around and surrounded by the green nature. If you took the MRT, prepare to walk for about 1.2 KM to reach the orchid garden. It worth the walk. There are a lot of gardens in this area. Spend around 2-3 hours to enjoy the nature. It would be wise if you carry umbrella for heat and rain protection."
,,what a scenic spot,4.0,,"we enjoyed our visit and walk through the gardens , was a warm day so you sweat it out but that meant to be good for you , gardens are very well kept and a nice place to visit"
,,lovely place,4.0,,Lovely botanical garden I have visited in Singapore and definitely recommended for traveler who wants to visit.
,,Beautiful and a moment of calm,5.0,,We visited the Botanical Gardens and we were not disappointed. A beautiful spot and an amazing array of orchids. Take time to walk through the tropical rainforest and have lunch at the cafe: the burgers were amazing. A great spot to visit and very good value. Our children (16 yrs and 12 yrs) were just as enraptured as us!
,,"Great place, easy to reach and easy to visit !",5.0,,"That's probably one of my fav places in Singapore... it's so wide that you can almost get lost there and you can easily walk around for many hours without ever passing twice in the same place !

Very suggested... but remember to bring a small umbrella with you... if it start raining you will be glad to have it with you !

PS: entrance is FREE"
,,It's a pleasant visit,3.0,,"The gardens are very beautiful and well kept, it's a pleasant place to walk, very relaxing to sit by the lake and enjoy the scenery. Best to go early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the scorching sun,"
,,Urban forest,5.0,,Beautiful flowers everywhere. Also a runner's dream as the paved roads provide a great trail. The signages are helpful since it's easy to get lost in that literal urban jungle.
,,Great place for a walk,5.0,,"This is a great place for a walk and enjoy some peace and nature away from the hustle of city life. Best part of all- it is free!
The newly opened space is the learning forest where you have a chance to experience fresh water swamp. Bring a camera along if you like to take some pictures of wildlife. There's the common monitor lizard foraging for food in the hot afternoon and singing birds (i managed to capture a pic of the common redflame woodpecker) for the late afternoons or early mornings. A great place to spend the whole day just taking pictures and a leisurely walk. Do bring a bottle of water along because it can get very hot from 11 am onwards. Pack some lunch along too. Avoid eating at The Halia (it's overpriced). Unfortunately the restaurant Food for Thought at the Visitor's Centre (near Tanglin Gate) is closed but the other visitor centre (near Raffles Bldg) has an eating place too. I am uncertain of cost there because I have never been there. But I often seen a crowd so the prices must be reasonable. The Garden can be accessed via MRT or public bus. Sorry can't provide more info because I drived there most of the time."
,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,"Very nice to stroll through and take pictures of the flora. Recommended if you enjoy being outside, the orchids garden was beautiful, and the rainforest walk was peaceful."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"In a city state so busy and bustling, the gardens are a wonderful place to lose yourself. Superb to walk around and beautiful to see. Well worth a visit to relax before heading back out into urban SG."
,,Walk about in the morning,5.0,,"These sprawling established gardens are now listed in the world heritage list , the first such listing in Singapore. Free entry makes it very popular for those who exercises early mornings from 6 am onwards . The first rubber seedlings were planted here before being introduced to many Asian countries that are now the worlds biggest rubber producers. Other historic or heritage trees are protected with lightning conductors . The orchid Gardens host many beautiful and rare orchids. The herb gardens grow many medicinal herbs."
,,It's a beautiful relaxing zoo,4.0,,Big enough for several hours of relaxing walking. Trees provide some shade. Highlight was the large lake which was teeming with huge fish.
,,Very pleasant,4.0,,"Walked the gardens yesterday and probably one of the best gardens I have visited. Need dome good shoes, water and a good 2hours. Worth it."
,,"If you're thinking about it - do it, it's worth it",5.0,,It's not UNESCO heritage site without a reason. One could easily spend a whole day here though I've only been for a few hours. It's free but inside there is another attraction worth visiting - the National Orchid Garden and that one is only 5 SGD to get in and also worth visiting. You can just relax and loose yourself in this vast green area and enjoy the tropical plants in their natural environment.
,,What a City park should be.,5.0,,"A huge park/gardens in the city. Used by locals for jogging, yoga, walking and just relaxing. Very well kept grounds, visitor centre, shops and cafes all very good. Well worth a visit when in Singapore."
,,"Wow, this was amazing.",4.0,,"Visited with elderly parents. Thank you to the taxi driver who took us to the entrance at the top of the hill, so we walked through the gardens downhill. Very informative, orchid garden, skywalk, history of botanical gardens and information on Marianne North. Well worth taking the time to read."
,,The pride of Singapore,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens is truly the pride of Singapore. There is so much to discover in the beautifully landscaped gardens with the myriad of heritage trees and thousands of species of plants. The new Learning Forest is fast becoming a kids favourite with the canopy web allowing kids to get up close to a tree without having to climb it. This is one of the most beautiful places in Singapore and is arguably curated nature at its best.
,,beautiful place to relax,5.0,,"these gardens are diverse and well kept, with plenty of interesting tropical plant species to view. we also spotted plenty of local wildlife. We spent an afternoon and walked most of the paths.there was an orchid exhibit on but it had an entry fee."
,,Good even if not into orchids,4.0,,We walked only around the orchid garden. We did this as part of a tour. I was pleasantly surprised as to how I found this interesting. The beautiful orchids really were special- especially the black one.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"This is a must-see attraction in Singapore, and even better, it's free! Also large, figure 4-5 hours to really see everything, and be ready for some walking. Actually there is an extra $5 SGD charge for the orchid garden, but it's worth it. Extremely clean and well kept. Mostly tropical and lush, but there is even a section with cactus. There is also a rainforest section."
,,A little oasis of calm,5.0,,"We spent a happy couple of hours escaping the heat and hassle wandering through these world heritage gardens. Perfectly manicured, free and vast. Comfortable shoes a must. The additional $5 to get into the orchid garden is a steal, I'd have paid double, it's so beautiful."
,,A tranquil setting.,5.0,,A very peaceful Garden in the heart of Singapore.Makes you forget the city bustle.Be Prepared to walk a lot to explore this place. Carry food and drinks to last long enough.
,,Great Park for Family Outing,5.0,,"The park with lots of open space & greenery & small waterfalls provides an ideal place for kids to enjoy outdoor activity . They feel free to run about & cycle around or just sit by the lake to feed the fish.
There were lots of interesting trees & plants & a beautiful orchid garden . The place is kid friendly & suitable for family & elderly people.
Highly recommend this place for family outing or for just a walk around the Gardens to enjoy the greenery or for group morning exercise"
,,An oasis in a busy city,5.0,,The photo provided for this site is inside the Orchid Garden rather than the Botanical Gardens itself. The Botanical Gardens are vast with lots of different formal and informal gardens within it. Lots of sprawling lawns with ponds and lakes... and a number of sculptures. It's very peaceful and a great place for wander for a couple hours.
,,Wonderful day out,5.0,,"An amazing peaceful place in the middle of a hectic city. So much to see and well looked after. You could spend the day there, make sure you take insect repellent!"
,,Just park,3.0,,"It is a good place for taking for a walk. If you are interested in plants, you may enjoy there. But for me it was just a big park."
,,FLOWERS...FLOWERS,5.0,,"I am not in to gardens, but I have to admit it was an incredible experience to see all these variety of species of tropical flowers and plants....very relaxing walking in this ""organized"" forest !!!"
,,just lovely - but go when it's not hot,5.0,,"the orchids are stunning and we were able to see a monitor lizard wandering around.

,,Excellent place to escape the busy city,5.0,,"Beautiful park, where you can easily spend 2 hours of walking on the trails. Definitely worth a visit when in Singapore. Make sure to visit National Orchid Garden for a small fee. I also recommend the free walk through 'rain forest'."
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,"Gardens were beautiful, especially liked what has been done with the Prisoner of War bricks, the only downside was the signage was not that great, therefore a bit hard to find your way around in the gardens & they are huge."
,,"Beautiful, you will not want to leave!",5.0,,"The Singapore botanic gardens are advertised as a main local attraction and it is so by all means. Beautiful nature, very clean and organized, convenient to walk through. It contains also part of Singapore natural heritage and educational material for kids. If you are an orchid fan, the national orchid garden is an amazing experience at a small cost of 5 dollars (overall the entrance to the gardens is free). You will feel the need to take a lot of pictures! And surprisingly no insects at all. Definitely a must for a Singapore visitor."
,,"beautiful, well-tended gardens. many many varieties of orchids",4.0,,"We were with a tour group, so don't know about admission costs or other details. But the gardens are beautiful. Well-tended, and with so many varieties of orchids and other beautiful flowers, including some named for famous people who have visited the gardens."
,,Never seen so many Orchids!,4.0,,"We spent the entire day here, we got really lucky that it only drizzled a bit during our visit. It was a really awesome day trip, i had never realized there were so many different types of orchids, i think i took 1000 photographs! And the Orchid teas from the gift-shop are so tasty, they make for perfect gifts and souvenirs. Recommendation: buy those amazing tiger balm patch mosquito repellent and like any trip outdoors in Singapore, make sure you have an umbrella (even when the weather forecast claims no rain) Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk around a lot - there's just so much to see."
,,Acres and acres of greenery!,5.0,,We were completely inspired by the gardens. Layout is easy to navigate with maps and directions provided everywhere and helpful staff to guide you through.
,,"Relaxing, beautiful and a city escape",5.0,,It's a perfect escape from the city and heat. It's a beautiful and well kept park near Orchard Road and Bukit Timah so a lovely place to visit. There are often open air concerts and other events organised so keep an eye on the national park's website
,,Lovely,5.0,,Beautiful place to visit. We could/did walk around here for hours. It is beautiful and clean. It was even raining on our visit but it didn't matter. Only catch is you do have to like plants!!
,,I could not stop taking pictures,5.0,,"I personally love nature and flowers, so I was amazed by the Gardens. The are probably all the species of orchids and I literally could not stop taking pictures. There are so many interesting and different forms and colours of flowers. It is very relaxing."
,,Peace and tranquility,5.0,,"The gardens are connected to the National Orchids Park. It is a beautiful space for a picnic and relaxation. I wanted to get away from crowds for a bit, this was PERFECT! Plenty of green space!"
,,Botanic Beauty!,4.0,,"Got off the ""hop-on-hop-off"" bus to visit these gardens. We were not disappointed with various interesting displays including the orchid area. A nice leisurely stroll through the rainforest area was satisfying. The Gardens were well sign posted and points of interest on special or unique trees and plants well explained.
Worth a visit."
,,"Nice place, though the humidity got the better of us!",4.0,,"It's a lovely natural space, with fine displays and interesting gift shops. The orchid garden with details of famous people who have been there, made for interesting viewing. Our mistake was that we chose the wrong time of the day to go there - the overhead sun kind of brought us down."
,,Sunday outing,4.0,,It is good for taking a quiet evening walk in the park. Best part is that if you like giving foods to the fishes then you can savor your favorite hobby by giving them the food for hours n hours on end
,,Fantastic place,4.0,,"Love the botanical gardens amazing place for relaxing , food , workout , meeting people , and staff are very friendly

This place reminds me of how we should take care of nature.

,,The most beautiful place I have ever seen,5.0,,"No words can describe this place. It's simply amazing. You can relax, walk, look at the beaufitul nature surrounding you and be just a small part of it. Singapore takes care of it's people a lot by having something like this. Kudos!"
,,"Pretty, well-manicured (perhaps too....)",5.0,,"We are on vacation in Singapore and wanted to take the kids where there are places to roam and play. Not being a stranger to gardens and parks, this botanical garden certainly deserves its Unesco Heritage status. Lots of greenery, footpaths and arches make it a nice place to explore. Would have been nice to have more types of flowers and wildlife against the backdrop of green.

I am certainly impressed with how well kept and manicured the place is. Being Singapore, you would expect this, but perhaps as a garden/park, some elements of ""rawness"" would certainly not go amiss, less man-made structures more natural ones.

Overall, a great place to visit, especially on less warm days."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Botanic garden is really big! There is a metro station named Botanic Garden but it is really far away from the other entrances. Free admission but you have to pay to get in orchid garden that is inside of the botanic garden. There are a lot of thematic gardens too. A good place to rest.
,,Nice to walk around at night time,5.0,,You most visit night time..it's so nice see all the lights with different colors. Kids was so happy to see
,,Lovely afternoon,4.0,,"Formally laid out, it's great to come straight out of the MRT to walk in to the entrance. I was aiming for the orchid garden and found that they had closed off nearly half of it for renovations the week before. Not many blooms were out at this time of year which was also a bit disappointing in comparison to my first trip 7 years ago. I didn't stay long there and was glad to get a free buggy ride back to the MRT entrance and two fun guides to take me back...."
,,Try to go there during an event,5.0,,"These gardens are very beautiful and huge!One can easily spend half a day strolling around the entire place..The orchid garden is also very pretty and colourful.
I would suggest to go on a day when they have some event in the open area called the symphony stage.
The place is vibrant with people laying on the grass , having a picnic and listening to good music."
,,To do list on a dry day,4.0,,Really lovely gardens and amazing orchids. Lovely to walk around. Good amenities. Would be a 5* apart from the renovation works being carried out.
,,always beautiful,5.0,,this is perhaps the best botanical garden in the east..a;ways a delight for the casual walker or the serious botanist
,,Beautiful and serene.,5.0,,"The Orchids were gobsmackingly beautiful. Other parts serene and interesting. Sporadic downpours added to ambience. Adequate shelter or, like us- s raincoat made it fun! Area around leading to Orchard Rd has wonderful large buildings- now embassies."
,,Peaceful oasis within a bustling city.,5.0,,"Directions: I took the subway to the station 'botanic gardens' on the downtown line.
Majority of the park is free to access. A small charge of $5 pp would be charged to see the orchard- well worth the small fee!
The entire park is very clean, very peaceful and very beautiful. Lots of information to read and nice little exhibitions (I enjoyed the Evolution Garden).
It a very good place to sit down and relax. Suitable for non-screaming children and you can take pets here."
,,Orchid garden is the highlight,5.0,,"Very beautiful garden, orchid garden is a must visit place, ticket is 5sgd. I bought this sticker holder from the souvenir shop for about 20sgd."
,,Orchard extravaganza,4.0,,"Great place for families to visit. Several hours of enjoyment to satisfy the orchard enthusiast. Many varieties and colours of orchards, ground and tree dwelling. Lakes and garden environment and several lawn areas to visit. Great restaurant in centre for scold drink or meal, or both. Access by train or cab."
,,Relaxing evening stroll,5.0,,"A beautifully manicured garden pampered with lots of TCL. A beautiful garden located in a green city. Just a stone throw from bustling shopping strip known globally as Orchard Road, a shoppers' paradise. The garden showcases different charm during different time of the day. A wonderful garden to chill with a book and a cuppa. The Singapore Botanic Garden is a gem sitting quietly in this bustling island paradise. Great place to visit alone or with friends and family. The well manicure grounds and various dining options means this is a park you have to visit several times to be able to fully experience her beauty and manifience."
,,Pleasant Park,5.0,,The Singapore Botanical Gardens is simple amazing. It's a mix of park and research center with some historical value. Worth the visit.
,,Awesome gardens,5.0,,One of the best botanic gardens I have visited. World class. Great variety. Just make sure you book a return taxi. It s quite far out of town.
,,Wonderful strolls without a charge,5.0,,No doubt this place is a marvelous gem in Singapore. The botanic gardens are very large and well maintained. They have great plants and trees and even a rainforest area where you can see lizard and squirrels.
,,Wildlife you can nearly touch,4.0,,"Walking around the botanic gardens is a real pleasure, and will take a whole day to do properly (in about 6 hours we still didn't see everything). Some of the cafe's are a little slow and disorganised, so we just kept going!"
,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,"Spend all day here this place is absolutely beautiful.
Don't miss the Orchid Garden it is a must.
Take plenty of water, sunscreen, hat and good walking shoes are a must.
You can get lunch here anything from sandwiches, fruit or a sit down dinner.
This big garden so close to the centre of the city is amazing."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Such a magnificent half day spent here and certainly not long enough to see all it has to offer. What we saw was absolutely beautiful. Do not miss the Orchid Gardens - well worth the $5? we spent to experience this section. So many stunning varieties of orchids created here. Loved watching the fish and turtles being fed at Symphony Lake. Very easily accessed via the MRT
,,A beautiful garden,4.0,,A beautiful botanical garden kept in stunning condition. The orchid section is something truly special and well worth the SGD 5 entry fee.
,,My Secret Garden,5.0,,I come from upstate NY so I see a lot of green and valleys. This was just a different kind of beautiful and felt so peaceful. My only regret was not spending more time soaking up the atmosphere and enjoying the beautifully manicured grounds. A must see!
,,An absolute must!!!,5.0,,"The gardens are a fantastic place to visit peaceful, well kept and a joy to stroll around. We were there for nearly 4 hours and only saw about half. The restaurants we had drinks in were very nice. The staff are all extremely helpful as we found everywhere in Singapore."
,,Wow,5.0,,My partner and I loved this place. It's a 'real' botanical Gardens with an amazing array of plants. Loved the palm and cycad zone. The 20 minute thunderstorm added to the experience. Allow at least 4 hours if your a plant/ gardening but! Chris J
,,Amazing,5.0,,A must for anyone to visit. So much to see and explore. Beautifully designed and a peaceful haven in the heart of the city. Could easily spend a whole day in the gardens. The orchid garden is spectacular
,,Garden of Eden,5.0,,"What a beatiful garden...one could
easily spend a whole day here, just take a packed lunch. MRT stops close by and gardens entrance is free. Great ponds and walkways, waterfalls and nature. Enjoy feeding the terrapins and watching the monitor lizards feast on the insects they dig up. Amasing flowers and plant life.....wish we had given more time to this garden to reallg savour the area."
,,Large well-developed gardens and paths,5.0,,"This is a good place to see greenery, lovely plants, including lots of orchids, and escape some of the crowds. Also, you can often see turtles, swans, fish, and monitor lizards. Nicely maintained and safe."

Truly enjoyed the walks, and also good rest stops for food and refreshment.
Thank you for taking such great pride in your botanic gardens that we can enjoy with very little cost."
,,A tropical Jungle in the modern city,5.0,,"I never imagined such small nation has so much to offer, the Botanical garden is an example of that, well maintained , very clean, you feel like you are in the Amazon forest once you enter the Garden, I went there every day for a long walk for almost 3 weeks, A great nature filled with green and beauty. A must visit location if you are in Singapore."
,,relax in the heart of singapore,5.0,,"in proximity to the citys central town area, Botanic gardens is well known for its calm and peaceful gardens. Not just for the botany enthusiasts, this place is mostly visited by people for relaxing walk through the greenery. it also houses a orchid garden with a nominal fee. the place is usually crowded in the weekends."
,,Facinating range of plant life,4.0,,We visited the Botanic Gardens on a day tour so we didn't have a lot of time. The Orchids were excellent and the overall ambience of the areas we did see was very good. We visited on a weekend so it was pretty busy. Next time we will visit on a week day and allow much more time and do a thorough walk though of all of the gardens.
,,Probably my favorite getaway in S'pore,5.0,,"About 6 months ago, I decided to try to loose weight... and hence needed to start some (moderate) exercise. And so my love story with the Botanic Garden started. From just doing a small loop to crossing it both ways, and discovering ""new"" paths, the Gardens are slowly becoming ""mine"" and are an integral part of my adventure.

The grounds are beautifully kept, some of the trees are simply magnificent, walking in the Learning Forest or the Evolution Forest or the Rainforest makes you even forget you're in a 22nd century city.

The Orchid Garden is absolutely worth the 5$ entrance fee, the concerts are also worth the trip. I just love this place."
,,Leisure Walk or Run,5.0,,Great place to walk or run and enjoy the beauty of well maintained gardens. Just minutes from busy Orchard Road.
,,Nice collection of plants,4.0,,"Always good for a walk or some other activities, solo, as family or as group. Good experience. ....."

,,One of the most lovely botanic gardens,4.0,,"A really different botanic gardens, a lot of activities and different types of flora.. They also have events every weekend. I think one of the highlights in Singapore! Make sure you go either REALLY early in the morning or night because it is way too hot..."
,,Relax in the city,5.0,,"From time to time walking there you can see very nice view. A lot of different flowers, trees and shrubs. We seen a black swan on the lake. Also people can sit on benches and just relax"
,,One of the best botanical gardens in the world. (Mobility access could improve.),4.0,,"One of the best tropical botanical gardens in the world. Return visit after an gap of over 20 years. Much have improved for the visitor experience, especially since the UNESCO award recently.

Great retreat from the hubbub of the city. Almost feels like a different world. Tip would be to go early in the mornings before the heat of the day. They open very early (530am?) It is an amazing experience wandering the trails and listening to the jungle wake up!

As fair critique, signage and access for the mobility impaired could improve. For example, there appears to be only 1 elevator from the underground parking garage. Was out of service during visit and no alternatives were provided. Spent a lot of time wandering the warm and humid garage with poor signage. When this was pointed out to the staff, the response received was ""but there are stairs you can use"" ... In the garden trails, mobility access routes could be better signed and ramp\step edges marked."
,,First day fun at a spectacular site,5.0,,Exquisite site with exotic species full of information and great shop. All free so very worth a visit
,,Lovely place to stroll,5.0,,"It's very vast and would take you about half a day minimum to get around. The rain forests are lovely and very dense. There is an orchid garden inside that has vast types of orchids, some were bred in the name of the head of the states. There is a souvenir shop in the middle where you get amazing teas and orchid necklaces!! Great spots for clicking pictured especially the wood turned into rocks area"
,,UNESCO HERITAGE SITE - NICE WALK,5.0,,Review by Dr Sim. UNESCO Heritage Site. Good place for a tourist. Visit during the early morning or late evening when it is cooler. Nice walk through the gardens. Been there a few times over the years. Regards Dr Sim
,,amazing gardens,5.0,,the best botanic gardens i have ever seen. the orchid's area is unbelievable. if you come early in the morning it is also very quite and peaceful.
,,Come with your picnic basket!,5.0,,I'm on a solo mission for my photography journal. Came during noon hours because I'm shooting landscape only pictures. But to my surprise there're quite some visitors at this hour too (2pm). Most of them stayed in shaded area enjoying their picnics. Children playing around on that spacious greens. Very very friendly environment for a family outing.
,,Must Visit.,5.0,,One of the best attractions in singapore... and possibly the best botanic gardens in the world..... the orchid gardens are incredible
,,Beautiful open spaces to wander aimlessly...,4.0,,"If you are the kind of person who enjoys an aimless stroll in the middle of a gorgeous park slap bang in the middle of the city, Botanical Gardens is the place for you! More so if you love wandering in pouring rain......silent pathways with curious twists and turns, lovely water bodies and chilled out cafes and eating places, a few shops for souvenirs, after which you could pretty much get back to your city life."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Very good location and nice & quiet place in Singapore. Entrance fee is free but if u want go orchid garden charges will apply.
Good place to do activity and sport. Different kind of flowers and rainforest are oasis of this country. I highly suggest this place to go after you visited other places because this place will give you relax and peace of mine."
,,A walk,4.0,,Very pleasant walk around the gardens. The learning forest probably needs awhile to settle in. Landscaping could probably be better organized to use the name learning.
,,Relaxing to walk around,4.0,,"This Garden is just huge. Ive been here for several times and its just so relaxing to walk around (except when its hot). You can find many things inside the gardens as you walk around. Don't worry though, some may have labels so that it can be informative.
Theres also an orchidarium which have a wide varieties of orchids and flowers which are very beautiful. But getting inside might you have to pay for the ticket."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"The gardens themselves are a beautiful place to wander around with lots of interesting gardens The highlight is the orchard garden and it would easy to spend half a day just there alone well worth the price of admission.
If using public transport it would pay to do some homework, there is a MRT station at one entrance but a long walk if leaving from the other side of the gardens to Orchard Road MRT."
,,The far east Central Park,5.0,,"I love walking, and i love flora. With this expansive green dot in the city, i can combine the two. It has its own Orchid garden inside it. The collection is quite vast and is very well maintained. Interesting landscape and different terrain made to make you feel you are in the middle of little story book ""lil jungle"" :)
Free admission, you are warned to wear nice comfortable shoes, have plenty of water in a hot sunny day, and ready to take loads of pictures. There are restaurants inside the garden, and few gift shops for little trinkets and souvenirs.
I've been to few Botanical gardens in the US, and this one is stealing a place in my heart. If you happened to be back again and again in Orchard road, you might want to continue down the road and reach this garden for a change, your lungs and eyes will thank you!"
,,Beautiful open space,4.0,,"Nice place to get away from the very busy city. Loved the open space and large lawns that opens up from the Shop/Restaurant area. Everything very neat and tidy. Good paths with clear signage. Was nice to see that, even in a garden, my country's legendary president is honored here, Wheelchair friendly."
,,A must visit place,5.0,,Went here for our first time in the city and it was so fantastic! I live gardens and I really appreciated the place.
,,Beautiful gardens that live up to its name and heritage site,4.0,,"A good place for morning walks/exercise, beautiful flora/orchids and trees. Also, you see different groups of friends coming together for chat/catch up. The orchid gardens is a must visit albeit, there is an entrance fee charged."
,,Very well-maintained,4.0,,"It's been a while since our last visit. The Gardens is very well-maintained and though there is quite a lot of visitors, the place still somehow managed to retained its serenity. Nice walk around the lake and also the Orchid Garden (paid entry)."
,,Unesco sponsored beauty,4.0,,"This park is supported by the UNESCO and is host to a variety of animals and parks. We were able to walk around Swan Lake, the Heights of the Trees and saw some water animals as well."
,,local loves it,5.0,,"have not been there mabe 30 or more years, went again 2 weekends back, cant even remember wht it looked like before but surprised to see really nice gardens with lots of trees, plants, flowers to see, nice gift shop, good choice of local food, still noticed a high end french restaurant.. never been there but know about it... lots of people... locals and foreigners..."
,,Is Botanic Garden worth it?,5.0,,"Whether its for a brisk walk, stroll or picnic, this is a favorite among Singaporeans.
Air is fresher - walk through the rainforest. Exotic plants - Tiger Orchid (largest orchid in the world), Buah Keluak (Asian truffles) etc etc are all available. Gazetted UNESCO heritage. Suitable for everyone - family, solo, friends. Entrance is free except a small fee into the Orchid Garden."
,,A small forest in the middle of the city,4.0,,"It is a gem in town. This was the first visit in as long as 4 years. We did not walk around the garden previously. The most recent visit was really nice. There are so many unexpected sightings of monitor lizards, rare birds and others in the garden that was nice. We can really get up close and personal. The faunas are great and there are so many to list. It is really peaceful and a great get away from the hussle and bustle of city life."
,,The best place to go for a walk or jog,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Garden is huge. It takes me an hour to brisk walk just the circumference. To go by bus, you can enter via the Tanglin gate at Holland Road or take the MRT and enter via the Bukit Timah gate exiting Botanic Garden Station (downtown line). To drive, you can park at the Botany Centre's basement car park entering Cluny Road, or further in turning at Nassim gate. There are the 2 shaded car parks. More parking lots around the whole garden; but if you want to visit the Orchid Gardens then the nearest car park is at the new Tyersall gate on Tyersall Avenue. That's where all the tourist coaches go to.
Think of the garden as a lying down figure 8. On the left bottom is the Tanglin gate and you'll walk in and pass the Swan Lake on your left and on your right the Heritage Garden. Straight ahead you'll have the new learning forest on your left and the ginger garden on your right. 50 more steps you'll reach the Orchid Plaza, the entrance to the Orchid Gardens. Tickets are required for entry but it is worth the while if you enjoy orchids cos the enclosure is rather huge and you can spend a minimum 30 mins just to cover the area.
The symphony lake where the week end concerts are held at the Symphony stage is just a little further to the right past the Orchid Plaza.
Now you've only covered the left circle on the figure 8.
The Visitor Centre & Nparks HQ is at the centre of the ""8"" where the Nassim gate entry leads to.
Now on the right side of the figure 8; you'll find the Evolution garden,
Fragrant garden, healing garden; all having plants with different scents, colours, shapes and sizes. There are explanatory signs to the plants and you can spend another hour just to explore.
Further to the other end past the Cluny Park gate you'll find the Jacob Ballas children's garden , the Eco lake and spacious greens to do your tachis, yoga or Pilate. You'll find different groups of people doing just that in the weekend mornings.
So on the upper top of this right side is the Bukit Timah gate where the MRT station is.
Come here to walk, jog, picnic, exercise, eat at the few food outlets, take photos or just lie on the green lawns, the Singapore Botanical Garden is a good way to relax and bond with your loved ones."
,,Singapore's iconic garden - The Botanical Garden,5.0,,"It continues to be one of the best gardens in the world & I've even attended free demonstrations & classes through their newsletter program. Classy restaurants & event halls within the garden, makes it even more exciting for evening visits."
,,Lovely place for an evening with family,4.0,,"I have been to the Singapore Botanic Gardens numerous times with my family that includes 3 kids. It's a green gem (emerald, I suppose) in the shopping district of Singapore.
Rolling lawns, lotus lake, orchid garden, swan lake, amphitheater (check site for performances) - that covers it, I think.
It is not a touristy place and does not figure much on rushed itineraries of tour operators or those who blitz thru Singapore in 3-4 days.
You can have a small picnic with snacks on the lawn or eat at some of the restaurants that are on the grounds.
Given Singapore's hot and humid weather, it's a great place to spend a quiet evening, watching your kids (and others) at play."
,,Worth visiting.,4.0,,Very beautiful. You get to see different varieties of plants from rare flowers to cactuses. Well maintained.
,,Beautiful!,3.0,,"The botanic gardens are more than 150 years old. Very established and well worth spending some time exploring. The orchid garden is a highlight but worth spending time exploring the rest of the gardens, if you have the time."

People were here for picnic, playing some light games or just lying on the mat chatting."

,,I fell in love with Singapore Botanic Garden the moment I visited for the first time,5.0,,"Back in November 2005 I had visited Singapore for the first time and I fell in love with Singapore Botanical gardens , love at first sight. It is a place of great tropical beauty, British colonial tradition, lush greenery , posh restaurants and shops, incredible orchid garden, early morning Tai Chi groups and Sunday evening concerts"
,,Invited my buddhist teacher to botani garden,5.0,,"We had the most joyful time together. My buddhist teacher love nature. Singapore as a modern city, nowhere is as naturally beautiful as botani garden. My teacher lives in a beautiful mountain and forest but she found many species of plants she never see before in usa. Im glad i managed to impress her. We love the orchid garden although we have to pay to go in it is really worth it. Many species are specially breeded by our national patk expert. Unique coloured orchild grown and i have never seen it anywhere too.

,,A Piece of Tropical Eden,5.0,,The Singapore Orchid Garden is a well-known place of beauty. It houses thousands of species of the exotic flowers. A walk in this park is a visual treat.

,,The orchid gardens were very much worth it,5.0,,"Had a lovely day in the gardens, and really enjoyed the Orchid Gardens: just gorgeous! So many varietals and so handsomely displayed. Had a nice lunch in the park too, which was a pleasant bone. The landscape design of the park is breathtaking."
,,Worthwhile walk about,4.0,,"A good place to visit for those who enjoy the outdoors and a walk through nature in an otherwise concrete jungle lifestyle. You catch the MRT to Botanic station (orange or blue line - circle line / downtown line CC19 /DT 9). as you come out of the station, its clearly marked which way to exit to the gardens. It was drizzling a bit on the day we went, but an umbrella did the trick and the walk was most pleasant - it may have been rather humid without the drizzle. Shortly after walking in, there is an enquiry area, which provides a map of the gardens, so you will be able to go to those area's that you want to see, otherwise it will require a whole day if you want to see everything, and you will be exhausted after that. An amusing part for us, but also something that is seen as good, was that a young Chinese girl approached us to ask for directions to the exit - amusing as we are also tourists, but at least we had the map, so could assist, while the good part is that due to the younger generation learning English at school, the parents are now able to become more mobile by travelling to other parts of the world and not being restricted due to not being able to speak English. The walk is around 2.3km, and when you exit at the end of the gardens, you can catch a bus to the MRT station and then use the MRT back to your hotel. They are currently building a new station at the exit, but it may be quite a time period before it is completed."
,,A little boring to be honest,3.0,,"Kinda boring. Just trees, trees and trees. Endless trees. Nothing special. The restaurant inside is quite cool though. I liked the decor a lot. The staff of the garden were also helpful."

There are multiple sub gardens like evolution garden and healing garden etc. The whole place including the UNESCO world heritage garden can all be visited in one day, if you start early in the morning. The place has water points and resting places available at comfortable distances. The temperature on a hot sunny day can be inconvenient. Place is worth a family picnic and learning."
,,"Very diverse and enjoyable Garden, plenty to see",4.0,,"In a way the title says it all. Personally I would go lateish afternoon - but check the timings of the Orchid Garden (Extra Admission) if you have bothered to go to the Gardens do not miss the Orchids. These is a short track through ""Jungle"", well worth while Keep your eyes peeled there are things to see. It gives a good feel of what Singapore was like."
,,Could have spent the day here!,5.0,,"This place took my breath away! I don't think I have ever been to anywhere so beautiful. Open from 5am till midnight. I went in the morning and spent 3 hours there and I could have easily spent more. The orchids were breathtaking. It is maintained to perfection .... not even a leaf out of place! A definite must see ..... cannot wait to go back and visit in the evening for a completely different experience again. Oh, and free entry too!"

This place definitely worth the trip !"
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,Not normally my thing but the wife loves gardens so we went. Have to say was enjoyable and would be easy to pop in with a book ad watch the world drift by for a few hours as well as the sights to see.
,,Pride and joy,5.0,,"This is Singapore's only UNESCO world,heritage site and rightly so. A wonderful lush space any time of the day. Spend your morning walking or running along the shady paths in the company of dogs, birds and other early risers. The air smells so fresh and clean in this green lung. Afternoons are walkable too, just keep under the shade or go to the swan lake and watch the fish and birds. My favorite tree is the giant kapok. When the kapok is released it feels like a fairyland. The heliconia, orchids, banyans are all magnificent too. The Orchid garden is colourful and some of the blooms are truly stunning. Moving around the garden provides lots of opportunities to see and hear friendly insects, spot a water monitor lizard and even see jungle fowl and water hens. Plan to have a meal here - casual at Bees Knees and Casa Verde and Michelin star fine dining at Corner House (worth at least one visit although I recommend at least two). I am a regular visitor."
,,Fantastic Gardens,5.0,,"Even if yo do not enjoy a visit to garden attractions, you will enjoy the beauty and neatness of these gardens. It does not take long and is very worth !"
,,UNESCO Beauty of Sweeping Landscapes,5.0,,"The gardens are in easy reach via the MTR system, but we decided to hire Lee of “Avenue Link Transport” to pick us up directly from the cruise ship centre. Lee was there to meet and greet us, in fact, he found us vs. us finding him. It was less than a 30 minute drive to the Gardens and Lee dropped us off at the gate near the Orchid Garden. We split off into two smaller groups and agreed to meet back at the same spot by 1:30 pm (with Lee scheduled to pick us up by 2 pm). All aboard was announced to be by 2:30 pm, but we confirmed with staff on board that we could technically come back as late as 4:30 ish (as some of the Celebrity excursions wouldn’t be back by then); but as the ship had to collect all passports for the immigration officials, they had posted the time of 2:30 pm.

The Singapore Botanic Gardens was founded in 1859, following the initial botanic garden at Fort Canning (1822) by Sir Stamford Raffles. Since 1859, the Singapore Botanic Gardens boasts 82-Hectares of beautifully groomed grounds and varying landscapes (rainforest to orchids, for example) and over 150 years of history. The Gardens were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site at the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee (WHC) on 4 July 2015. The Gardens is the first and only tropical botanic garden on the UNESCO’s World Heritage List.

We explored the gardens at a leisurely pace, enjoying the carefully groomed landscaping, majestic trees, gorgeous flowers, and small lakes and ponds abounding with life of its own. We finally rested at a gazebo overlooking the Eco Lake, just in time, as a monsoon rain soon came upon us. We waited out the rain before heading back towards the Orchid Garden. We saw much wildlife along the way, but as birders found the Eco Lake a haven. From a stork-billed kingfisher, to white-breasted water-hens, to the migrant blue-tailed bee-eater – we were treated with a lovely selection of birds in one small area.
We would highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore to visit the Botanic Gardens, a very natural and tranquil setting for a leisurely day with easy walking trails through varying botanical treasures.

Our group of five reconvened at the Orchid Garden for 1:30 and to our delight, Lee, our driver was also there to greet us early.. We decided to leave a half hour early, given the opportunity. Upon boarding the van, Lee presented to each of us a nicely chilled bottle of water. How thoughtful!

We arrived back to port just prior to 2 pm and in plenty of time to go through immigration and board the Millennium."

,,Go early in the day,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a delight but it is definitely best to go early in the day to beat the heat! The information desk was VERY helpful, there's lots to see - keep you eye out for the many sculptures that are scattered all over the park and check out the restaurant when you're finished with the gardens. Refreshing."
,,"Just say the words ""botanic garden"" and I am there - lovely!",5.0,,"The gardens here were beautiful. But, hey, it's Singapore and I expected no less than beautiful! It is a big place, but well laid out. We paid to go to the orchid garden, but the rest was free! And, since I had JUST turned the big six-oh (!!!), I asked (I am proud!) if they had a senior citizen discount (which is for 60 plus). I so wanted to show him my driver's license to prove it, but I could not find it at the moment, but I guess he saw my gray hair and thought, ""don't worry, move along"". So, because my husband was 61, we got in for $1 each instead of $5. It would have been worth far more. The orchid garden is fantastic."
,,Beautiful park,4.0,,"Is open daily and you can see in lakes, animals, flowers and plants.
It's a great place where the plant life is awesome.

,,Unesco Heritage Garden,4.0,,"I visited the Gardens last month with my cousins and their children who were visiting from Australia. As I had stopped going for about 2 years (as they where undergoing massive renovation) I was pleasantly surprised with the changes at the Singapore Botanical Gardens.
As it opens at the crack of dawn (5:00 am) I suggest that you visit early so as to avoid the heat. I found that even though the renovation has been really well done, a few of the paths are not well marked and the pamphlet maps that the Garden provides are not entirely accurate. It was fortunate that I know the park fairly well if not I am sure that we would have got a little lost."
,,Nice place in center of the city,3.0,,Really nice place where you can take your mat and rest for some time. It's nice until 6-6.30 pm. After that flies will eat you. But please note that it's in the center of the city and worth a visit with family.

,,UNESCO World Heritage Site,4.0,,This site was easily accessible by MRT with a stop right outside of one of its gates. The gardens are well thought out and maintained. There were so many nooks and crannies that you can really visit it over several days. I'm sure we missed a few turns.
,,A great FREE activity in SG!,5.0,,"These gardens are so well planned maintained. There are tons of different plants and trees and the space is peaceful. As with anything in SG, it's hot, so it's best to avoid the mid-day heat. The gardens open really early, though the restaurants and the orchid garden open later).

The gardens are well-used by locals, including many people working out in the morning in both western (boot camp) and asian (tai chi and other basic morning aerobics) groups and running/walking.

If you visit, make sure to check out the orchid garden (entrance fee to this part) because it is amazing."
,,Singapore Botanical Gardens,5.0,,Along with Gardens By The Bay the Singapore Botanical Garden which also incorporates the National Orchid Gardens is a MUST SEE when in Singapore. The Botanical Gardens is free to walk around but the Orchid Garden only cost S$5 - well worth a visit . They are constantly replanting different types / colours of orchids.

Otherwise you may also visit the restaurant there. Inside the park there is also a paid section where different kinds of orchids are displayed. It also includes a variety of different plants from other countries. The collection here is smaller compares to the Garden by the Bay, however it is more affordable.

There is a large grass patch delicate for users to enjoy picnic. However, do remember to bring mosquitoes or insects repellant as so part of the botanic garden has mosquitoes.

It is a place for nature lovers as there many different species of floras and fauna. It is a place for hipsters as well, cause the place make it an excellent background for photo taking! Evidenced from the number of couples taking wedding photos there."

We lived within walking distance to the Gardens for ~3 years so we were able to enjoy them very often. You will see many fish in the ponds and even the occasional large native lizards! You can stroll along the paths alone or with friends and family. There are a few places to eat (snacks and sit down meals) and relax. On the outskirts of the Gardens is one of my favorite restaurants. Jim Thompson - a fantastic Thai restaurant serving lunch and dinner.

It's also a good place for morning walks/runs if you are the kind of traveller that never gives up on your fitness even on your holidays.

Again, it is hot and humid in Singapore so your visit might be short if the weather does not suit you."
,,Botanic gardens green thumbs up,4.0,,"As a unesco world heritage site, this is a must visit place in Singapore. Best visited in the morning or evening with cooler weather to enjoy a brisk walk round the park. Takes around 45 minutes to 1 hr to cover the park.

Not sure I would go back..."
,,Clean and Green,5.0,,"Clean and green. The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a beautiful park free to locals and guests from around the world. If you wish to see the world-class orchids in the Orchid Garden, the entrance fee is a small S$5.

There are many amazing sculptures to look out for during your walk. I love the one with the marble ball ""floating"" on water. You can spin the heavy marble ball. It is all about the physics.

The Gardens has an outdoor amphitheater where you can take in free concerts put on by the Singapore Symphony orchestra.

There is a diversity of plants and wildlife. I love watching the various waterbirds that take advantage of the ponds in the gardens. There are exotic birds like the hornbills. I also love the adorable squirrels with the handsome black stripes.

The best time to take in the gardens are the mornings and evenings when it is not too hot and the crepuscular wildlife are out."
,,Best in Singapore,4.0,,We really enjoyed our visit to the Botanic Gardens. It was free and beautiful. We also had a delicious lunch!
,,Delightful to wander and incredible to photograph,5.0,,"The Gardens are a wonderful green area in a bustling high-rise city. They're easy to get to, with MRT subway stops at each end of the area, and they're close to a major shopping/tourist area, Orchard Road. You see the people of Singapore enjoying the area, doing Tai Chi, running, and bringing children to enjoy it. The Orchid Garden is unbelievable, and, if you can get a tour, take it. But other areas are also lovely. We took two long mornings there, one for orchids and one for the rest of the Gardens, and wouldn't have minded more time. There is a small charge for the Orchid Garden, but the rest is free. There is a variety of places to eat within the Gardens. Signage is plentiful, in English, and there is a useful map distributed at the gates. There are two lakes and a bit of wildlife--birds and lizards--also."
,,A place to enjoy with family!,5.0,,"When I visited my sister in Singapore recently we visited the Botanic Gardens with the kids. It's a lovely place to walk, relax, play and see the beauty of nature. It's green all over and very a beautifully maintained park. We spent around 2-3 hours there and still felt that it was less time.
It's a huge place with garden all through. The flowers were amazing and there were such a huge variety of plants. There were birds, ducks and even turtles. Our kids too enjoyed a lot.
The entire place is well connected and there were signboards and information boards all over.
There is no admission fee and the garden is open for a long time. A great place for photography too.
It's a great place of attraction. We will come back again."
,,TJ,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens and a must when visiting Singapore. Caters very well for tourists and signage is very clear if your a tourist, we spent two hours here and would have stayed longer but the humidity and heat made is uncomfortable."
,,"For short time, just choose Orchid Garden !!!",5.0,,"If you have only short time, don't walk in garden as there are many ways to walk and cannot finish in a day. So, just go directly to Orchid Garden. But Botanic Garden is one of the most relaxing place for everybody who has plenty of time."
,,Lush gardens on the edge of the city,5.0,,Classification as a UNESCO Heritage Site is well deserved. No doubt that the climate contributes to the luxuriant vegetation. Setting does not disappoint.

,,Visit after the Rain was refreshing n cool,4.0,,"Has been a while since I last visited the garden. Was there with Colleagues n was worried about the forecast of thundery showers. Thankfully the rain was only a drizzle when we were done with the indoor visit of the botany center. It was nice n cool. Walking with my umbrella, it's was quite a pleasant experience.

Due to the forecast, there were few w family so the garden was nice n serene. The best part is the leaves n flowers looks fresh n luscious after the rain. Great for photos.

Admission to the botanical garden is free. Parking available.

National Orchid garden is a must visit. There were countless breeds planted all over n we had a chance to take a peek into the burkill hill to see all the heritage orchids. A rare occasion that they r open to public. Admission to the orchid garden is free for Citizens. All you need is your NRIC. All others will have to pay a fee.

It helps to appreciate the garden better by visiting the museum at the botany center. Enjoy the greens after the rain!"
,,Free entry except for Orchid pavillion,4.0,,"Nice gardens. Would be a great place for a picnic and big grassy areas for kids to run around in.
There was a free concert at the ampitheatre the day we went, so look on their website to see if any events on if you are interested.
Free to enter except for Orchid pavillion which is $5 and I think it's worth the entry fee as the display is large and very beautiful.
Good food available in restaurants on site."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Used hop on hop off bus to get there, made it very easy. Beautiful place, the orchids are stunning. Well worth a visit, although hot and steamy"
,,Good place but not much to see,3.0,,"Botanic gardens is free to enter and has a large area to cover. There are many sections/areas for various types of plants but not much flowers to see. In a botanic garden, one would expect to see a lot of flowers of various kinds. But here you can't find many varieties of flowers. Just a lot of trees and gardens like Ginger garden etc. But National Orchid Garden which situated within Botanic garden is a great place to see many types of orchids."

,,A true retreat,5.0,,"I have been to the Singapore Botanic Garden many times over the years and it’s still one of my favourite places in Singapore. It is just wonderful treasure in the centre of town even with the hot daytime weather. Nevertheless, it is a tropical garden. It had been a magnificent site since founded in 1859 during the British Empire occupation and today the care and commitment to the UNESCO World Heritage can be seen everywhere. The ideal time for a visit is on a cloudy and cool day after an overnight downpour. Entered from the Bukit Timah Gate which is next to Botanic Gardens Circle Line MRT Station exit.

There is so much to see and explore, from heritage designated trees to flowering shrubs and orchids. A few lakes dot the gardens and provide scenic opportunities. In between walks, there are wooden benches for rest. There are snack and dining options throughout the garden and occasionally there is a performance by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra or other performances on the weekends. Don’t miss out on it!"
,,Mini Forest Bathing @ Singapore Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Forest Bathing @ Botanical Garden & National Orchid Garden
Botanical Garden is a nice and safe place for my mini forest bathing and walking in nature. I walked 1km from Tanglin Gate to National Orchid Garden to see some rare Orchid as well.

During the walk, I slow down to see lovely and big trees, the calm lakes, bench for resting, swings for swinging, sculptures, small streams, hens and chicken roaming around freely. So peaceful and wonderful.

Simple pleasure yet felt fantastic after spending 1-2 hours there."

It really take a day for sure and you will really feel like out of the world refreshed with clean air between the trees and plants. Many variety of plants and flowers around. A very good restaurant area and its bliss for the photographers for sure"
,,Ginger plants and orchids,5.0,,Such a mesmerising garden of thousands of varieties of orchids in a myriad of colours. The ginger plants were incredibly breathtaking. All set in a magic rain forest!
,,Our Favourite Retreat In Singapore,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens is more than a wonderful park in the midst of the city state of Singapore. It is among its most endeared treasures of its citizenry. It was founded well over one hundred years ago. The care and commitment to this UNESCO World Heritage site by the government is everywhere. The plants are lovingly tended to by a large staff. The arrangement and organization of the various tropical plant species is done with great care. There is an orchid section with a number of varieties that were cultivated to honour the diplomatic and royal luminaries who have visited the city and the gardens over the years. The man made features of the gardens harken back to its British founders. I walk to the gardens four times a week to luxuriate in the vegetation. A must see in Singapore for one and all. BTW there are lots of choices for snacks and dining in the gardens and occasionally there is a performance by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra or other performances on the weekends. Go for it; you won't regret the visit.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is possibly the most beautiful garden I have ever seen.

,,"Beautiful to walk through, and picnic in, and maybe even see a free concert",5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are beautiful to stroll around. Bring a picnic and relax. Take a look at their website before you visit and see if there is a free concert, they often have them on Sat/Suns at 6pm (lasting 1 hr).

There was also concert in motion to keep you feeling good and relaxing mood. You can lie down or walk with picture taking."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"We took one Morning to visit the Botanic Gardens as we read on the internet it requires 1/2 hours to see everything. Easily to get there by either bus or subway MRT (station Botanic Gardens). Free admission. You can get a flyer at the entrance with the different areas and paths to follow. Ginger garden is beautiful as well as the rainforest one. The healing gardens (divided by head, reproductive system, ...) are also very interesting. We didn't know Toxic plants would require scheduled visits but we understand this safety measure. Swan lake is gorgeous! Perfect place to rest for a while."
,,National Orchid Garden,4.0,,"I would recommend to pay a visit to the National Orchid Garden. It is located inside the Singapore Botanic Garden. Once you enter the Orchid garden, the most noticable flowers are orchid hybrids displayed everywhere. Plenty of photo and video taking opportunities here.

It is here where the some of hybrids are given names by those important VIPs whom visited here."

,,Beautifully landscaped!,5.0,,"I love this place! It is so beautiful and it's free! Such a nice little oasis in the middle of the city where you can walk around, see the beautiful flowering plants and trees, hear the frogs, and just sit on one of the benches and relax. Its really beautiful at night when the lights shine on the tree trunks making everything feel magical!"
,,A Greeny space beyond the downtown Singapore.,3.0,,"I went because it may be different than other busy and crowed places in Singapore.
Have MRT take you in front of the site. Not too many people, May was a raining season in the Island. Nice to take a stroll in different sections in the Garden. Go for the Orchid garden, which you need to pay extra to get in. Well, not to bad but not enough to Wow me. Beautiful but nothing too impressive. It is a good place to relax and appreciate the Beauty of the Natural for sure."
,,A Treat,4.0,,An amazing oasis well laid out. Beware in the ginger garden as there are biting insects. Found Ballia restaurant a very welcome place to cool down. Would recommend the cocktail Heavenly Hallia
,,a little piece of history,5.0,,"do walk around the orchid garden ans venture behind the scenes to know how samples are cultured and speices are identified. i found my walk to be very pleasant in the morning. it does get a little crowded though. i think afternoon it just gets too warm. nice cafes allow for a pit stop to refresh and refuel. be warned that the current mrt station is at one end of the gardens. once the other line is open, there will be a mrt station at either end, which would make it so much more convenient to go to the Gardens. and oh did i mention, it is a UNESCO heritage site!"
,,Must See,5.0,,"The variety of plants throughout and the design of the gardens makes it east to walk through, pause, relax and admire the work that has gone into this stunning area."
,,great place,5.0,,"super chill, lots to see and great to walk around. just pray it doesnt rain as the nearest shelter may not very nearby in certain parts of the gardens"
,,worth to see,5.0,,Amazing! Green and big! Really worth to see. A great way to spend a day is wondering around different gardens and enjoying nature
,,Amazingly held our 16 year olds attention!,5.0,,I've wanted to visit the botanical gardens in Singapore for a long time but always worried about how much it would appeal to kids. Well good news our 'mostly-loves-to-shop' 16 year old thought it was great. The large lizards caused a bit of welcome early excitement and the air conditioned buildings were great to get out of the heat but the Orchids stole the show. Beautiful! It's great to get away from the shops. Loads more to see another time.
,,Huge,5.0,,"Well, it takes at least 3 hours to visit this garden. It's free for public. The orchid garden inside the botanic garden are paid. The gardens are nice and huge. There is an equatorial rain forest trail inside it, do go for a walk on that trail. Overall nice and green. Don't miss the orchid garden."
,,Stunning gardens - well worth a visit,5.0,,"Really beautiful gardens, particularly the orchid garden. It's really worth the visit - free to get in (you have to pay for the orchid garden but it's not much and definitely worth it)."
,,"It's huge, green and free",5.0,,Perfect for a picnic or a nice stroll. Be aware though - this place is huge. Make sure to check out the hammocks at the forest highwalk.
,,Definitely a Place to Visit!,5.0,,"I went to the Botanic Gardens not really expecting much. However, I learnt a lot through the visit. Not knowing so much history about the gardens. An overall wonderful place to get to nature but close to the city. A good place to be on a clear day."
,,this is beautiful garden,5.0,,we can enjoy this with family .Kindly note that this is optional place to visit during singapore visit.
,,A lovely place to visit,5.0,,"A S$10 cab fare from the city centre. The Botanical Gardens are free to enter, though there is a S$5 to enter the Orchid Garden. It's a wonderful landscape of trees, shrubs and a nice lake and everywhere is immaculately maintained. We spent about 2 hours strolling around the gardens. The lelevated rainforest walkway is excellent. There's something to suit everyone here and I'm sure if I was a local, then I'd come here very regularly."
,,"Worth a visit, can be humid!",5.0,,"Be sure to pay a visit- may be a bit underwhelming compared to other UNESCO World Heritage Sites, but it's one that incredibly accessible and visited by everyone- from locals to expats and foreign workers.

I'm particularly fond of the Swan lakes, which are nice to go to at night. I'd still recommend going in late afternoon to evening, as it can be quite humid otherwise. Sandflies come out at night, too."
,,Thumbs up for Orchid Garden!,5.0,,"If you need some exercise in between your tour program in Singapore, do spend a few hours at the Botanic Gardens. You can jog or walk briskly along the many paths and maybe like we did, come across a monitor lizard (I think), and drink in the clean air.We actually walked for 8 km without realising it. Really love the Orchid Garden, especially the Cool House which is air-conditioned! Best of all it's open from 5am to midnight! On public holidays, admission to the Orchid Gdn is free."
,,"Lovely, colourful and spacious!",5.0,,"Visiting friends in Singapore while en route to Europe, we spent a leisurely morning at the very popular Botanic Gardens. It's beautifully laid out with scenic paths to take in the many sights. While it's the gardens that attract most visitors our young sons were most impressed with the resident monitor lizards (some are huge and very good swimmers). As impressive as any botanic gardens we've encountered on our travels. Definitely worth a visit."
,,A Visit to the Singapore's Amazing Park,5.0,,"Situated at the heart of the city, enjoy the wonderful stroll at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The park was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and offers a lush and tropical garden experience which Singapore is known for. The park is known for wide range of flora. Dine at the famous Halia restaurant or any of the F&B outlets in the garden. Come early in the day or later in the afternoon to experience the relaxing stroll or picnic at the open spaces."
,,amazing,5.0,,"Botanic Gardens have something for everyone - small lakes, walking trails, grass parks, a performance theatre, multiple restaurants, orchid gardens, bridge walk, list goes on.

It's a lovely garden which spreads from bukit timah road to tanglin/holland roads. It's very accessible from MRT, bus and taxis. I see myself going here many times in future."
,,Learning forest - a new experience,5.0,,"You can take a walk in a rain forest, on elevated walkways and come closed to the canopy layer and emergent layer and not only on the forest floor."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Go early or later in day as it is hot - worth the visit - food places or pack a lunch for a picnic - don't forget your camera.
,,Amazing Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Spend some quality time at this breathtaking garden. Picnic, relaxing, jogging, nature seekers, you can do almost anything in this place surrounded by thousands of species of plants and trees. Do not miss out the beautiful tree which is featured in Singapore's five-dollar note."
,,Glorious,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens were spectacular! Especially the Orchid House. Colours like you've never seen. Flowers as delicate and perfect as is possible. Do yourself a favor and next time you're in Singapore, go visit the gardens."
,,Nature Lover,5.0,,Gardens are beautiful and well kept. There were constantly workers on the grounds ensuring the plants were top notch. Bit freaked out by the monitor lizards walking around. But they seem friendly enough. There should be more cafes and restaurants maybe kiosks for snacks tho people might litter lol.
,,An absolute gem,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens are a fantastic place to visit. Lovely pathways, beautiful layout and a total escape from the city. The orchids are especially special. Well worth a visit."
,,Amazing flowers in orchid gardens,5.0,,"New access off Tyersall Ave, makes it easier to get to orchid gardens for those with walking difficulties, took taxi and had map to show him new access, much easier than walking up from original gate. To leave go to info desk and they will ring a taxi for you. A much better and more enjoyable experience"
,,Embraced by nature!,5.0,,"This is a great garden notwithstanding the hot daytime weather. After all, it is a tropical garden. On a cloudy and cool day after an overnight downpour, it was an ideal time for a visit. We entered from the Bukit Timah Gate which is located besides the exit of Botanic Gardens Circle Line MRT Station, and we proceeded to cover and enjoy the expansive gardens.

Open fields play host to carefree children and free-ranging feral chickens. Black swans preened themselves on the Eco Lake at a distance from visitors while terrapins scramble up the banks. Tree-lined and landscaped pathways meander through the different garden zones.

There is so much to see and explore, from heritage designated trees to flowering shrubs and orchids. A few lakes dot the gardens and provide scenic opportunities. In between walks, there are wooden benches for rest.

This is an inspiring garden. Seeing is believing! Very likely that you will return for more!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A fantastic beautiful place where you can see the beauty of flowers - perfect place to come and relax - only disappointment was the food
,,Nice walk around the gardens,5.0,,Nice botanic gardens to walk around. A lot of nice plants to view and there is even a herb garden with plenty of herbs from around the region.
,,Best view,5.0,,Its really peaceful and natural place must visit here all the people who come sg got restaurant also inside u can take long walk with u r partner
,,oasis of well being in the middle of a busy city,5.0,,"Wonderful place to walk through and relax when in Singapore. No shopping overkill, no air-con freezing, no cars everywhere: simply nature! Did you know that there are more than 50 different types of plants that belong to the ginger family? Go to the botanic gardens and find out!"
,,Must do !,5.0,,"Walking around the Rainforest here was fantastic. Watching all the young families walking around and taking in the natural surroundings was great. Do it early we just beat a cracking thunderstorm. But hey, that's Singapore! !"
,,Slightly disappointing,2.0,,Perhaps the botanic gardens were slightly disappointing because they have been so dramatically upstaged by the Gardens on the Bay. It was also disappointing to discover that there was a charge for entry to the orchid section.
,,"Orchid Garden, Botanic Gardens",5.0,,"A wonderful display of orchids in a beautiful garden. It is a very peaceful, tidy and colourful place to be. There are shady parts to be in, and so many varieties of orchards. Amazing place to visit. A very good shop also."
,,A nice stroll on a hot day,4.0,,"These gardens are big and many areas are shaded which makes it nice stroll on a typical Singapore hot day. The highlight of the gardens is the orchid garden, which is an additional charge."
,,Impeccably maintained,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens. We went late morning, so was starting to get a bit too hot. Good signs, not too crowded, and various types of gardens."
,,A botanical bonanza,5.0,,What a great place to visit. The orchid garden was absolutely magnificent. Loved every minute of the visit. Took heaps of gorgeous photos.
,,The Gardens on a Sly,4.0,,"This is my nth time in SG but my last time was when the Esplanade was just being built. That's how long ago it was.

I booked a cheap flight for a 4-day trip, went to the new areas I've not been to - that's the Marina area. Then, on the 3rd day, decided on a sly to take a quick detour to the Botanic gardens.

It was sooo hot and humid but I was ready with my old reliable rubber shoes, a hat, cotton shirt and sunblock.

It's within easy reach by train - you literally get into the gate right out of the MRT station. I just walked around, took pictures of the first lake I bumped into and decided to head to the Orchid garden. This one is a must see - it's bursting with all kinds of orchids in varied colors. One can get lost just taking in all the blooms! Very pretty indeed!

It's a good thing I went again this time. It's still a go to place for a breather from the concrete steel modern jungle of SG"
,,Good day out,4.0,,Was warm but we managed to get around in a couple of hours with the kids. They got bored fairly easily
,,Glorious refuge from the city bustle!,5.0,,We've visited the Botanical Gardens before but you simply can't get enough of this wonderful refuge. There is so much to see - numerous visits are necessary to gain the full benefit of discovering all corners of this beautiful place. One never tires of wandering through the gardens and sampling the beauty of the flora and fauna. Relax a while by the Swan lake or saunter by the Symphony lake and become aware of the wildlife lurking close by! Get a map of the gardens to make sure you get to see the most significant parts of the park. A visit to the Orchid garden is recommended! There is a charge for the Orchid garden but it is well worth it (seniors = over 60 S$1!!).
,,Great Garden,5.0,,It is a large garden with restaurants inside. There are ponds in the garden that give you nice landscape.
,,Great day out,5.0,,I spent a very enjoyable day here walking around ( it is very hot so come prepared) and shooting pictures. There are so many wonderfully exotic plants to see.
,,Great gardens,5.0,,"Very large with lots of open space and many different smaller sub-gardens such as the ginger, sun and herbs and spices gardens. Large lake with swans and big fish along with some type of lizard which will join the group when fed. Everything is free except the orchid garden which is well worth the S$5 fee. In 2 hours, I only saw half of the gardens and will go back. Go early or late as mid-day is very hot, humid and energy draining."
,,A pleasure to walk,4.0,,"The Gardens are easily reachable by the Metro and are vast, you could spend a significant amount of time. Our goal was to get to the National Orchard Gardens, it was about a 20 minute walk from where the Metro station is. Admission to the park is free, but you pay to get into the Orchard Garden."
,,Suuuuper,5.0,,"I spent there about 5 hours and saw only half of it. It was really great adventure. You have to see rain forest and orchid garden. In that part there are also great views, lakes and trails"
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"Visited the Orchid Garden and the Bonsai Garden. Orchid Garden is really beautiful and well worth the price they charge of SGD 5 for adults and SGD 1 for senior citizens. Must walk across the bridge over the rain forest. Bonsai garden is quite neglected. Better to walk across the other parts of the garden. If you're lucky, you can hear an orchestra group practising on the symphony stage. I was."
,,"So much to see, beautiful gardens.",5.0,,"Our family of four (Mum, Dad and kids aged 5 & 8) visited Singapore Botanic Gardens on a Monday in June.

We originally hoped to visit the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden, however this is closed on Mondays. So our taxi dropped us at Tanglin Gate so we could visit the Orchid Gardens.

To get there we walked through the rainforest area, which is a boardwalk style walk, and on our way back, via the large pond and symphony stage.
Learnt about Johore Figs which start in the canopy of another tree then grow down, and were wowed by the huge lily pads on the pond.
We also saw some large lizards .
We finished our visit with lunch at the cafe, which was reasonably priced and refreshing to relax in under large fans!

We would visit again, perhaps on a cooler day to see the many areas of the gardens we just didn't have time for in one visit."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A beautiful and peaceful spot to get away from the hussle and bustle of Singapore. Gorgeous gardens and sulptures scattered throughout this tranquil precinct. Most areas are free and you can wander at your leisure - small lakes and ponds see bird life and serenity.
,,Fantastic place,4.0,,A great place to visit. We particularly enjoyed the fragrant garden and the spice garden as there are so many wonderful plants and flowers to smell. It's a very big place so I'd recommend wearing comfy shoes. I'd also recommend mosquito repellant or covering up as this is one place in the city where you are likely to encounter mosquitos.
,,Variety and beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Well worth going to, there is such a variety of displays and settings to see, we went on a reasonable hot day so l recommend you take an umbrella as this gives better protection than just a hat and take plenty to drink one of which l suggest you take frozen firstly to keep your other drinks cool and then you have a cool drink when it thaws. There are lakes go sit at under trees, the well known Orchid gardens definitely worth a visit, covered walkways to sit and take a break. Recommend you visit the information centre on entering to get a map as the paths can be a little confusing. There are at least two eating spots and bathroom areas plus a few water fountains around. Takes longer than l thought so go early morning and wander through at your leisure completely safe to do on your own . Don't miss the rainforest area or the evolution walkway plus the ginger trail. You could spend as little or as long as you like, The orchid gardens shut at 6:00pm but a lot of families seem to be taking a picnic around the 5:00 to 6:00 time. Gift shops were lovely but as usual pricey. I caught the train which was great as you come out of the station and the enterance borders the train station you can also come from other directions which invoke walking or buses. Gardens are free Orchid Garden was 5:00 don't miss it ."
,,Enviroment,5.0,,"Great layout snd easy walking trail. No bicycles allowed so is very safe for children to run around. Look up times for free concerts, there was an orchestra playing with some singers, great entertainment."
,,Simply beautiful!,5.0,,Another 'must see' in Singapore. The gardens are beautiful. Every turn brings a new view. I imagine the place changes considerably with the seasons too. Take your time to explore. Not a place to rush...
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Free so you can't really complain. The gardens are nice to have a stroll around and the River is filled with small turtles you can feed. Wouldn't bother paying the 5 dollar to see the tulip garden.
,,Nice garden,4.0,,Very scenic place .. nice greenery with huge variety of plants .. however seems to have a lot of noisy people picnic and dirtying the place ...
,,A Must Visit & A Photoshoot Place!,5.0,,"Great flowers, great atmosphere, nature surrounding yourselves and along with that no entry fee, just enjoy the views! Don't forget to grab your cams and shoot as much as you can. It is nearer to MRT botanic garden station. You can take a walk to the garden from station itself."
,,Peaceful place for locals,5.0,,"A peaceful getaway place to escape from the tourists and the crowds. More suited for locals, not recommended at all for tourists who would like to cover and its other attractions in the limited time."
,,It's free,5.0,,"Walk outside Botanic Garden MRT station and you're at the place. And, it's free, very beautiful garden, suitable for a walk, photography, the orchids garden is beautiful and worth a visit (SG$5/Adult)."
,,Nature at it's best,5.0,,"Don't miss walking along the reflexology path or a visit to the VIP Orchid garden, two special spots in this very beautiful and diverse botanic gardens. Allow a couple of hours at least and take your time to wander along the shady paths."
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,"I find this garden is beautiful, beside the humid weather, its scorching hot. Its big with a nice restaurant that sells expensive crab pasta in the middle of the garden. Posh."
,,Walking,5.0,,"We walked from Great World City to Botanic Garden. They have so many plants & trees. Beautiful gardens and plant grouping. From bamboos, Wild gingers & variety of bamboos. Some parts are quite shady too. Very educational & well kept gardens. Very clean and lots of map to guide you where to go. They also have a visitor centre and a cafe... good amenities & you could get there by bus or take MRT..."
,,A great day out,4.0,,If you love your garden & flowers this the place for you! The orchid gardens were the best collection in one place we have come across & we live in Thailand! If you walk through the botanic gardens too take plenty of water with you!
,,Great place for a nice walk!,5.0,,"Even though it was raining when we went the place was still just as nice for a nice walk around the trails.
There is no entrance fee so that is a plus!
Good for a walk, photography, picnic, or just for waiting for your late flight out of Singapore :)"
,,Relaxing Day,5.0,,What a great place to spend a day with friends and family. So enjoyed being in a quiet and peaceful place.
,,A beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"Visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens at a leisurely pace, and be at peace with nature. There is so much to see and absorb. There are various sections with a variety of plants and flowers. Do not miss the Orchid Garden! Though the entry to Singapore Botanic Gardens is free there is a small fee to visit the Orchid Gardens (Senior citizens get a discount).
A beautiful place to visit."
,,Hotel Stay.,5.0,,It was great place to stay smelt a little mouldy but i think is due too the humidity and also haggle at the hotel for a better price for breakfast.
,,Botanic gardens,5.0,,One of the most beautiful places you could ever visit it was stunning beautiful flowers and wonderful arrangements well worth a visit
,,So much to see,5.0,,"Take your time to wander through these gardens to see well landscaped gardens, a vast array of plants, and to just take it all in. Not a place to sprint through."
,,Very tranquil,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens just a short train journey outside the city. Free entrance and you spend at least half a day there. Visit the orchid gardens whilst there,such beautiful flowers. So much work goes in to keeping these beautiful gardens maintained."
,,peaceful,4.0,,was a hot and humid day so didnt see the whole place and not many flowers out but was still peaceful
,,A Beautiful Garden Near City Center,5.0,,Here is my favourite route to visit the garden. Enter the garden from the Bukit Timah Gate (which is at the exit of Botanic Garden MRT). Then head east to visit the NUS Bukit Timah Campus. It's a tiny campus with elegant white buildings. After that walk towards south. Take the east trail in the morning and west trail in the afternoon if you want to stay away from the sunshine. The orchid garden and the gazebo are the highlights of the garden.
,,Very Calm & Very Beautiful.,5.0,,My wife loves exploring new places while travelling and we love exploring the city on foot so this was a must visit attraction for us. Entry to this botanical garden is free except the Orchard Garden. It was pretty sunny when we went but it started drizzling midway so it made the experience all the more amazing. The garden is huge with a lot of entries inside. Visit if you have a lot of time in hand so you can relax and don't need to rush.
,,Highly recommended place for leisure walk,5.0,,"Visited National Orchid Garden with my pals in the afternoon. Nice!

Enjoyed the rainforest walk most, listening to the chorus of crickets and drawing in fresh air.

Felt relax and refresh with lots of vitamin D.

Do remember to bring your cap and wear a good pair of walking shoes to enjoy the beautiful garden.

Will return to explore this place again."
,,Hot,5.0,,Bring an umbrella to shade you from the sun! The orchid garden was amazing and worth the $5 admission.
,,Too hot and big,3.0,,Too too hot to go during the day time. A bit boring just trees trees and trees. Sign are quite clear. Shops are no need to visit.
,,Lot of runners,5.0,,Spend time walking around and toke some photos. Make sure that you have water with you. Also there are no public toilets
,,"Beautiful, could and did walk for ages..",4.0,,"We went to the gardens by MRT, well signed when arrived. There are maps by the gates to use, very useful, but plenty of signs also. The gardens are beautiful and varied. It was lovely to see that it was well used by tourists and locals. a lovely place for a picnic lunch if you had one. The lake by the amphitheatre was great with giant waterlily pads, and we saw a very large water monitor swimming across - so ancient looking! there were also visible turtles and fish. I would happily go back again, I am sure we did not see everything. We were there for a good 3 hours but could easily spend more time there."
,,Make this your Singapore priority,5.0,,"What can I say?!! We spent several hours here and feel we barely scratched the surface of what these truly awesome gardens had to offer. The accessibility, the layout and the general,ambience were all amazing. Entry to the gardens is free, with a minimal payment to go to the National Orchid Gardens. We visited both but in reality could do justice to neither. What was particularly impressive was how simultaneously there were a lot of visitors but it remained a calm tranquil place. Next time I visit Singapore I'll plan several trips here!"
,,Beautiful (and warm) gardens!,5.0,,This place is worth a visit! Our favourite place was the rain forest part. You should bring an umbrella or make sure to drink a lot of water since you have to spend a lot of time in the sun!
,,Proud Heritage,5.0,,"This is quite a huge area to visit thus I suggest to those who love to take long walks or just stroll leisurely, take time to visit this area for a whole day. You can even make a picnic here and relax by just sitting or lying on the grounds anywhere."
,,My Favorite!,5.0,,"I explored this beautiful gardens on a sunny sunday afternoon with my leather shoes on. I didn't mind getting blisters and sunburn, i just enjoyed my instant favorite place in Sg. I especially loved Symphony Lake where a high school orchestra was actually performing that very day!"
,,Great day out,5.0,,Beautiful setting. This was a good day and seeing Orchid garden was magnificent. Set in wonderful surroundings with very nice walks around it.
,,So big.....,4.0,,"We visited the gardens last September and we did not cover much ground through the heat. Overall the gardens is a fantastic place to visit there is so much variety of plants and exhibits to see, it is a very serene place. There was a band playing some smooth songs whilst we walked around the pond, a perfect way to spend in the afternoon of the bustling city."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"This garden is really great and worth visiting with your family, children or with your friends. It is a heridity of Singapore. You can just walk and enjoy this huge amount of Orchids. It will be your best excursion ever because you will be filled with emotions and energy. I really adored this place and I'm ready to come there back again and again!! Strongly recommended)))"
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,This is a must visit for anyone is Singapore. The gardens are very well maintained. Lots of different areas to explore. I would definitely recommend spending some time in the Orchid Garden.
,,Full of wonder and praise,5.0,,"What an amazing place this is. You could walk for hours, have a picnic, sit on a chair, wander or jog through the gardens. This is my first visit and I was not disappointed by what I saw and experienced. This is a great place to take photos. The gardens are immaculate and stunning. I adored the outdoor sculptures and wished I could take a few home with me, but they would not fit in my suit case. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There is no entry fee. You can push at button at the entrance and get a taxi. It said it would take 10 minutes, but it only took 1 minute before it arrived - service or what. Thank you for a lovely morning."
,,Lovely walk for everyone,5.0,,Excellent place for a stroll or brisk walking. Well-maintained and signage are installed at strategic places.
,,Amazing,5.0,,A must see when in Singapore one off beautiful gardens that could take all day to inspect Very relaxed atmosphere and stunning surrounds
,,Where were the flowers? 🌺 🌹,3.0,,"Took the Hop On bus here, full of excitement - well apart from the Orchid Garden,( Paid entry) we could not find any flowers. Perhaps it was just the time of the year."
,,First visit. and hardly could finish 40%,4.0,,"My third visit to the country and I had not been to this place in my last two visits. Of course having recently found an added interest in bird photography, and having purchased a telephoto lens, I was adamant I will get some birds to pose for me. Googling for birding spots close to where I stayed during this short two day trip, I pounced upon Botanic Gardens. It opens at 5am and closes only by midnight. I overslept though having had a tiring previous but managed to reach by 8 am at the Tanglin Gate. With able advice and guidance from the Security officer and using a map I set out armoured with my Nikon D7200 and Sigma C 150-600mm. Within a matter of an hour I knew what was in store. It was a very humid and hot day with monitor lizard strolling around jogging paths early in the morning and retreating into the swan lake as the temperatures rose. This was more of a me getting used to my D7200 and shooting birds. Of course the heat was a mood killer. By the time I traversed the swan lake, the rainforest and right up to the orchid garden, I was famished. So I retreated as I was also running out of time."
,,wonderful,5.0,,"We did this twice and it is lovely to walk on a nice day, A ginger drink is a must and the food at eating area is great."
,,Peaceful oasis,5.0,,"Beautiful, peaceful oasis away from the hustle and bustle. Plenty of walking to be done and many things to see. Kept in immaculate condition."
,,Worth a visit only needs an hour!,5.0,,"Did this as part of a morning city tour. Definitely worth trying to fit in, even if you are just here for a day, only needs an hour. The Orchids were incredible, very immaculate throughout."
,,Reminiscent long-winding pathway in Wizard of Oz,5.0,,"This is a magical place. The warmth of the tropical climate encompasses the scenic rest enclaves, Such beauty and peacefulness not to be missed."
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"This place is mind blowing. Not only it's architecture, but it's whole set up. The amounts of orchid species and how they are set up is just beyond beautiful! If you are in Singapore it is a must to visit the orchid garden!"
,,Oasis,5.0,,"The first thing to say is that the gardens are huge, so plan your visit. Secondly, go early in the day before the heat builds up. After that enjoy this wonderful oasis in the busy city. The trees are magnificent, there are shady walks, and the jewel is the national orchid collection. Be warned, it feels longer than it is to get to the orchids unless you go before the worst heat of the day. The orchids, of course, are magnificent, with so many that can only be grown so well in the tropics. Well worth seeing, after all, an orchid is Singapore's national flower."
,,"Well worth a visit, especially the orchid gardens",5.0,,"The park is free to walk around, and you can enjoy the formal areas as well as a more informal walk through the rain forest. All paths well laid out and easy to walk along. However, it is the orchid garden that is the true spectacle to see. A small cost to get in is worth it. There must be hundreds of different types and colors of orchids."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A magical place, a must go. Impossible not to like a place of such beauty. One of Singapore's brightest jewels!"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"If you love orchids, this is an absolute must! Absolutely amazing orchid garden. Loved every second of our visit."

,,Botanic Garden Bliss,5.0,,"These gardens are really a nature lover's dream when visiting Singapore. There you'll find birds, butterflies and of course awesome tropical plants., pathways and water features and streams. When in Singapore escape to this oasis in the middle of this modem metropolis."
,,Probably the largest Equatorial Botanical Gardens on the Planet,5.0,,"Easily accessible from the Botanic Gardens 'MRT' Metro station. Look for the gates (see photo). Carry plenty of drinking water as the site is enormous (74 hectares). Time your visit to reach the café for pasta and coffee before the daily downpour (2:30pm). Also, visit the National Orchid Garden (see elsewhere) and VIP Orchid Garden on the same site."
,,Only a short amount of time,5.0,,Was using the hop on hop off bus. Got off here for a wander around the gardens. Didn't really do it justice as we were on a tightish time frame. Really enjoyed what we saw during the time we were there. A fantastic space for this city.
,,Too hot and humid for comfort.,3.0,,"The gardens are located far away from the city's center.
They can be reached via the Metro (Botanic Gardens station).
The gardens are huge and include an endless array of grass and trees with several ponds with birds and turtles.
However, the weather during our visit was almost 35 degrees with 80% humidity, so it was too hot and humid for comfort, as there's almost no shade at all.
You should only arrive here on a cloudy day or close to sunset, when the whether is more acceptable.
We left after just 30 minutes, exhausted by the heat and humidity."
,,Definitely to see!,5.0,,The heat didn't matter....what a stunning variety of orchids and bromeliads and other plants. Well worth seeing. And unique among gardens.
,,A place to relax,5.0,,"This is a must visit place in Singapore. Even for those people who have no interest in plants. It's hard not to be impressed by the fabulous range of orchids in the Orchid Garden. As well there are a number of different sections such as rain forest plants and trees, a bromeliad section as well as a healing garden that displays medicinal and dangerous plants. Part of the gardens has been declared a UNESCO garden. To add to this attraction there are several places for drinks and snacks as well as a restaurant that is reasonably priced. Wear good walking shoes as there is plenty of walking to be bone. Alternatively pack a picnic and relax by one of the lakes."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,This is a very large green space of at least 2klm in lenght and it is free. Paths criss cross the gardens where trees and plants grow. Particular areas of the gardens specialise in a particular variety. There are lakes and streams and wide areas of mowed grass if you wish to relax. Also there are restaraunts scattered around this very large area. You could spend hours wandering around. In the middle of the gardens is the orchid garden which has a fee of $6 for adults. A must see.
,,Simply stunning singapore orchid gardens,5.0,,The VIP orchids are almost out of the world. I saw the rare blooms named after Mr and Mrs Barrack Obama. Very beanutifully manicured gardens. Nice bromeliads even saw a bird nest. Definitely worth many hours of enjoyment.
,,Scene,5.0,,"There are scenes that are beautiful and there are some statues of Tanks. Is a good Place to go to learn all types of flowers, is like Garden by the Bay. Only it isn't enclosed."
,,Enjoy a walk through these gardens,4.0,,We caught the MRT to these gardens and enjoyed the walk through them. Keep an eye out for the wildlife both in the foliage and on the ground. It didn't rain the day we were there but take and umbrella because shelter is limited.
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"I've been here a number of times and it never fails to make me feel good. For a small, densely populated island, Singapore has managed to incorporate a great deal of open space and park areas and this is the crown jewel. It's a lot easier to access now with the expanded MRT lines."
,,One of the best places in Singapore,5.0,,"The place is vast and it will takes around 1-2kms to walk from one end to another. From the MRT station, it takes around 20-30 mins walk to the National Orchid Garden. It's a long walk and there's a fee going inside the orchid garden but don't miss it. Lots of beautiful kinds of orchids. I recommend going to the cool house where you can see some exotic plants. A UNESCO heritage indeed."
,,Beautiful and captivating,5.0,,"As we were walking through the botanical gardens we already were planning how we could go back and visit again! It is an environment that is fragrant, captivating and lovely. It is not to be missed."
,,Beautifully serene gardens with good restaurant,5.0,,"We walked around the gardens for a while before going to lunch. It is immaculately kept and I would definitely go back for more walks. There is a restaurant inside that serves good food as well,"
,,Historical place yet worth the visits.,5.0,,"I was walking around Tanglin area and chanced upon this place. My partner and me went around to explore. Although it was a humid day, it was ok to sit down at the shelter and enjoy the surroundings. My partner and me had a mini picnic for 3 hours and we enjoyed ourselves."
,,UNESCO Heritage gem indeed.,5.0,,"Serene, peaceful and beautiful. A definite attraction to visit with your family. Learn about the fauna and flora of Singapore."
,,Oasis in the city,5.0,,"Give the skyline a break and head to Botanic gardens if you are looking for some peace. Big and green it has multiple entrances, a kids play area, themed gardens, a lake and a performance areas where if you are lucky you can also attend a local band playing in. Look for various meditation events and free guided tours to match your dates."
,,One of the best,5.0,,"My friend and I stayed at the orchard hotel and would walk to the botanic gardens. Great place to exercise, be with the family, enjoy the greenery and even have a nice meal in one of the eateries there.

Appreciate this place more especially now I live in Jakarta. No pollution and fresh air. For those who enjoy the day with the family, this is a great place for picnic, the kids and dogs can run around freely!"
,,a must Visit,5.0,,Just an awesome experience. Great walk through and all people were enjoying. Wonferful variety of things to see. Highly recomended. Lots of Christmas trees and decorations... made me happy. Only down side was a smal cafe with limited seating

,,One of the most beautiful gardens in the world!,5.0,,"I'm a local and I've been going to the botanical gardens since young. It has never failed to impress me. I've used it as my jogging gardens in the mornings. I've taken my family there for picnics during the weekends.

,,The SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDENS - Since 1859,5.0,,"The SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDENS was founded in1859.

Its first scientific director Henry Nicholas Ridley was an English botanist and geologist who lived much of his life in Singapore.

He perfected the technique of rubber extraction (still in use to date) and promoted its economic value to planters in the region. Rubber output expanded rapidly in the Malay Peninsula.

Now, the BOTANIC GARDENS has very huge amount of tropical plant collection of more than 10,000 species in its 74 hectares of land. Unlike FLOWER DOME & CLOUD FOREST which are both temperature-controlled glass-house conservatories, the BOTANIC GARDENS is naturally tropical.

Within the GARDENS is the NATIONAL ORCHID GARDEN with its largest orchid collection of more than 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids.

The BOTANIC GARDENS has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2015.

Whether you're botanist or an ordinary being, you will enjoy being in the BOTANIC GARDENS.

,,Stunning garden,4.0,,Went for a stroll in the morning before leaving Singapore. The view is stunning especially the area near to the small little white hut. Recommended for family outing.
,,Perfect place for a picnic lunch,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are easy to find via the MRT which brings you right to the entrance gate. The gardens are free but you pay for the Orchid Garden. There is a discount for seniors so remember your ID.
We enjoyed a picnic lunch before strolling through several theme gardens en route to the orchid garden. Each one was well established and informative. We particularly enjoyed the foliage garden and the rainforest garden. The orchid garden is truly spectacular and should not be missed. A comprehensive collection of the most beautiful orchids all beautifully maintained.
Everyone will enjoy a visit here."
,,Nice evening walk,5.0,,We walked around the garden around 8pm in the evening and although we couldn't see that much it was mostly lighted where we walked and it was very peaceful walking around. Unfortunately the orchid garden was closed but would probably come back during the day another time to see that as well.
,,Friendly welcome!,5.0,,Lovely visit to the Gardens helped by an informative member of staff at the gate meeting visitors and telling them what there was to see!
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,I visited the botanic gardens with my wife. The gardens are very nice. Do not skip the orchid part. this is the topic of the garden !! it cost 5$ to enter and worth every sent !!
,,A Wonderful Place Should Visit in Singapore,5.0,,"When I have plan to visit Singapore, my friend said to me that if you visit Singapore, don't forget to visit Botanic Garden, It so amazing! When I came here, I know my friend was right. I really love it, the fresh air, so cool, very comfortable and I look many beautiful flowers. I and my family have a great time in there. I also would like to recommend Botanic Garden to you."
,,Botanic Garden and National Orchid Garden,5.0,,Stunning set pieces at every turn - beautifully laid out to give the wow factor. Beds of tulips were being planted as we wandered. My sister grows orchids and I recognised several varieties of phalanopsis. Photo opportunities everywhere!
,,Great place to visit!,5.0,,We loved wandering round these beautiful gardens. It was the perfect opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. It rained a lot whilst we were here but it was great to be in the cool.
,,Lovely quite place to visit,5.0,,"I really went to see the orchid gardens which were fantastic, but the rest of the gardens were fantastic as well. I will have to go back and spend more time looking around."
,,Place of tranquility,5.0,,"In the Botanical Garden you can refresh yourself in the cool shadows of magnificent trees, play hide and seek with a squirrel, walk in a real rainforest, lose yourself in the colourful Orchid Garden, or just find a spot for yourself to sit in the grass and enjoy the warm sunshine. ( But be careful not to get burned.) And of course learn a lot about the vegetation found there."
,,Wonderful park & gardens,5.0,,"It is worth taking plenty of time to explore all the grounds of this huge complex. Grab a map when you arrive and take a leisurely stroll all over the gardens to see trees, plants, flowers, herbs, orchids, and animals. I saw lizards, a snake, lots of birds, insects. It can get very hot so be sure to bring water and sunscreen. There are food and drinks available at different places in the park. You can bring a picnic and enjoy it on the lawn by the palm trees. There is a cool house featuring epiphytic plants and ferns - it's a wonderful respite from the heat outside!"
,,Awesome gardens,5.0,,Botanic gardens has always been a joy for the family. Never ever felt it was too small and always had different types of people.
,,Stunning Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"We spent the good part of a day wandering the Singapore Botanic Gardens. We could have spent longer, however it was a very warm day and we were beginning to tire! The rainforest walks, the National Orchid Garden, plants from across the globe were all on magnificent display. It is easy to see why the gardens has been listed an a Unesco Heritage site. We broke up the day with a very nice lunch at one of the garden's cafes and the women who run the Botanic Gardens Souvenir shop are delightful. Yet another 'must see' experience while visiting Singapore!"
,,Oasis in a big city,5.0,,"As a lover of orchids and plants of all sorts, this is a real treat! The exhibits are beautifully done, yet you get to see excellent replicas of natural habitats."
,,Beautiful Park to walk around,5.0,,"Lovely free gardens to wander round, though can get quite hot. The Orchid garden is the only section you have to pay for but well worth it."
,,Orgasmic Orchids!,5.0,,One of the best Botanic Gardens that my wife and I have visited and the National Orchid Garden is a wonder to behold and puts our plants to shame! A great day out.
,,Wonderful way to start the day,5.0,,"We were recommended to visit the Gardens during our 1 day lay over and it was a perfect way to start the day. Beautiful, peaceful and full of locals practicing Tai Chi. An absolute must!"
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,"It was just a breathtaking trip. I got to see tropical plants, living swans, and the iconic Singapore orchid garden. And it was extremely fun to talk to the local gardener and got to know the technology efforts they have made for this. Don't forget to visit the museum as well."
,,Lovely stroll!,4.0,,"I do recommend a visit to the Botanic gardens! Many informative signs along the track we walked, which I really appreciated."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Gardens are beautiful as everything in Singapore is lovely , like walking in the future . I would go again if I was visiting Singapore"
,,Too big to see in couple hours but BEAUTIFUL gardens!,5.0,,"Only saw part of Gardens due to time constraints and weather - while we were there it was pouring rain but we were still glad we went - saw the Bromeliad, Orchid and Ginger sections - gorgeous!"
,,Superb,5.0,,"This, and the adjoining Orchid Gardens should not be missed. Having visited this site a few years ago a return visit was a must. Not disappointed. Easy to move around, clear labelling. Intend to return and view the orchids in the evening light on our next visit. Spotlessly clean and maintained."
,,One the spot to visit in Singapore!,5.0,,"It is a fantastic attraction, very well located at the heart of the city. Take a walk from the hotel you are staying, or a cab, if it is too hot, and enjoy a beautiful garden. Bring with you some water, as you will be enjoying a quite a long way, overseeing a very well kept botanic garden."
,,Beautiful place to relax in nature,5.0,,"Singapore botanical gardens are huge.. You can easily spend half a day walking around the different sections here. The sections explaining different types of plants were well made and informative and it was enjoyable to walk through them. This park is a good picnic spot too, with huge lawns where you can spread out a blanket and relax. It is close to the metro station - about a five minute walk to the entrance which makes it convenient to reach. Do visit when in Singapore if you have some extra time (I wouldn't recommend this park if you are in Singapore for three days- it would be better to visit Gardens by the Bay then). But if you have some extra time, do visit and you will enjoy the peace and quiet this park offers in the city :)"
,,Worth visiting as well as Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit as well as going to Gardens by the Bay as they are two very different experiences. The Botanic Gardens are historic and are really beautiful classic botanic gardens. The tropical forest section is the last remnant of Singapore's original forest environment and the national orchid garden is really interesting. And that is only the beginning. We had limited time on this trip, but you could easily spend a whole day here."
,,Good Place to Escape the City,4.0,,"There is no getting too far away from buildings in Singapore, but the huge and historic botanic gardens are one place you can get into the green and leafy areas while still quite central. So much to see, and plenty of places to wander. You are almost certainly bound to come across a great variety of wildlife too."
,,Beautiful Botanic Garden,5.0,,Beautiful botanical garden. It is so huge that you need ample time to cover all over. Neatly maintained with different species of trees and plants. The Orchid garden in this campus is another gem added to its crown. Don't miss this gardens.
,,Relaxing and beautiful,5.0,,"The garden is HUGE! If you have ever been go to Kew Garden, you might love this tropical version.
This garden is well divided into different parts, including healing garden, fragrance garden, evolution garden, etc. This garden isn't just a showcase of different species of plants and a resting place for animals, but also an education to tourists about botany. Meanwhile, you can see lovely animals everywhere in the garden, including squirrels, cocks and hens, and also a big lizard! As a nature lover, it is happy to see how animals are living freely and harmoniously in a park or garden like this, but not in a cage or a fenced area.
There was a jazz show while I visited in the evening. People just sat and had picnic on the meadow and enjoyed the jazz performance. You can check the events out from their page and have your wonderful evening. However, do bring along with your mosquitos repellent if you plan to do so.
The garden is huge, it may take you a half day for a healthy leisure walk."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Do NOT go there wearing flipflops :) There are cobras and pythons apparently although I didn't see any. Although Gardens by the Bay is artifical, I still prefer those because they are more beautiful to see."
,,Huge,4.0,,"I visited the botanical Gardens as I needed to pass through to reach the Orchid Garden. The gardens are huge and contain different themed sections (bamboo, rainforest etc), which have information boards educating you on what's around. What also impressed me was how clean and well maintained the gardens are. Lots of locals relaxing here on the weekend"
,,Absolutely huge,4.0,,"Pretty gardens with much to see, it's a free attraction and is good for kids. When we went it was sunny and out of no where rained like a monsoon non stop so had to leave unfortunately but worth a look."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I recommend going in the AM, as it heats up quickly out there in Singapore! The gardens are beautiful and entrance is free except for special gardens (like the orchid garden). You could spend multiple days here or enjoy a picnic there! Plan well according to what you desire!"
,,Great place to walk around,5.0,,"We spend half day at Singapore Botanic Garden. It was lovely. A lot of paths shaded by plants. So it wasn't too hot to walk around. Orchard garden is well worth the price! So many different varieties of orchard.

Took the cab back to City Hall. Around 10 Singapore dollars."
,,worth a visit,5.0,,"lovely to stroll through early in the mornings although of course the heat at all times is there, restaurants are expensive and service slow but food excellent"
,,Serenely beautifully,5.0,,"Spend most of an afternoon there. Nice restuarant, enjoyed the live classical music from the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, which was impressive."
,,good to get away from the crowds,5.0,,"A peaceful oasis in the heart of Singapore, just the place to go to if you want to get away from the crowds in the city centre. A variety of different displays and you could spend many hours here walking around and enjoying the beauty of it all."
,,Loverly Place to Chill,5.0,,"Great Botanicals, Orchids are better than mine great walks this place is a gem, l would come to Singapore just to visit these Botanic Gardens the must be one of the best in the world."
,,Botanical garden is magical !,5.0,,"OK, botanical gardens are a bit artificial - but they are also a well of peacefulness, away from the crowds and ... so clean and colourful ! We love botanical gardens!"
,,it is always nice to be back,5.0,,"weather you come in the morning, afternoon for a cup of tea or in the evening .......weekend picknick or for one of the shows this garden is just amazing. For me it is the right mix of curated, non curated, selvage. Before I came by bus ( close to Tanglin Mall) and went home by subway MRT. In this way I was sure to be eco friendly and I did the whole park. But recently a friend of mine indicated to me the car park at Cluny Road ( Nassim Gate) close to the shops and Casa Verde. I will use Nassim Gate and the car park only during the week. Some of my friends practice Yoga in the park, some come for running ....I just love the flowers, the big space and being right in the middle of the city without paying anything!
The atmosphere in the evening is also very nice but keep in mind that only the main paths are illuminated.
If you are a flower geek don't miss the Orchid Garden .....the small entrance fee is worthwhile!
There is even a new cafe, the Bees's Knees at the Garage. Nice hidden place for a rest, chat,...
Ah, forgot as Singapore is a safe heaven you can also go by your own."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Bigger than we realised, you could spend all day here but due to this mornings heat we gave up only seeing 1/2 of it. The gardens are immaculate, plenty toilet and refreshment facilities. Orchid garden was $5 pp entry and well worth it."
,,A huge (free!) garden for wandering and enjoying the plants,5.0,,"Singapore is not really about travel: it's a shopping-and-eating kind of place. The botanical gardens, free on the north side of town, are really exceptional and beautifully done. The orchid garden (fee for entry) is inside, but everything else is free with great plantings, explanations, and even spots to eat and drink. In between shopping and eating: visit the botanical & orchid gardens!"
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,"This place is magnificent, the Orchid Garden is just beautiful and so many varieties. Visited the Gardens twice and still did not get around the complete Gardens."
,,A must-see during any Singapore trip!,5.0,,"We had visited this attraction three and a half years ago, but decided to return since we had thoroughly enjoyed the trip last time. These gardens are simply beautiful, but visitors MUST pay the little extra to tour the Orchid Gardens. These have to be my most favourite gardens IN THE WORLD! The orchids are amazing and the displays have you you gasping at every turn. This was another memorable day in Singapore, and I could never be bored meandering the paths, admiring exquisite plants in such a stunning location."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"First of all it's free - so it's worth a try with your kids. Second it's pretty easy to get to with its own stop on the MRT. Third it is stunning. It never ceases to amaze me how meticulous and clean Singapore is. A few words of caution for families: the children's portion is closed on Mondays, it takes a little work to get to right now since you have to weave through all the construction, and it does get hot and stay hot until 4 or 5 pm so the kids may or may not run out of steam. Try going in the morning instead."
,,Orchid garden is the best,4.0,,"The orchid garden gets 5/5, the rest 4/5. The halyconia and gingers are great, the bonsai somewhat neglected. Free entry so worth striking through on the way to the National Orchid Garden."
,,Great day out and mini picnic with kids,5.0,,"We are regulars here, love Botanic Garden and kids love it as well.

You can walk around for hours and find lovely little hidden paths and places. Swings, feed fish, admire swans in the lake and have ice cream at one of the number of coffee shops

So good and so relaxing."
,,Orchids Par Excellence!,5.0,,Love the different mix of orchids and how they were grouped together to complement each other's colours and shapes. They do stand out so wonderfully even those planted in large pots. They happily bloom and speak volumes of the time and care and the garden staff's creative handiwork as these are well organized into a community of lovely and lively colours! And the orchid arches are amazingly intertwined with delicate Dancing Ladies! A must to see!
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,Really really well maintained garden with some amazing spots. Shows the great tradition and care. You can see orchids in all color and sizes.
,,Morning walk,4.0,,"Always a surprise even after walking in this garden for the pass 30 years, the new learning forest with beautiful Keppel Discovery Wetlands was a new experience for me."
,,Best botanic gardens in Asia,5.0,,"Best evening or morning jogging, walking dogs or weekend picnics. Botanic Gardens is a perfect place for local resident and tourists. I love the orchid garden very much ! You never know that there are so many different kind of orchid named after President of countries, head of the states and super stars."
,,"Singapore's ""Hyde Park/Central Park""",5.0,,World Class! Beautiful gardens with lush flora and fauna. Many themed sections with something for everyone. It has recently been named a United Nations Heritage site. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Amazing tropical paradise,5.0,,"I spent a whole afternoon walking around, the gardens were immaculate and really beautiful. The garden has different sections such as the rainforest walk (one of my favourite parts) or Swan Lake and a plantation house Burkill Hall, unfortunately it was under maintenance when I was there. Depending on how you set your pace you can explore all day or it is possible to walk through the garden, without stops, in less than 1.5 hours. The National Orchid centre is a must see you must pay to enter. I also had a nice lunch stop at a lovely trendy cafe called The Bee's knees which is located inside. It was delightful to watch a live performance from an orchestra sitting on the grass by the open air stage at Symphony Lake."
,,Eden Found,5.0,,"Excellent way to spend a day in Singapore. The many themed gardens are beautifully cared for and the landscaping is perfection. If you are a garden lover, remember your camera!"
,,Favorite Garden,5.0,,"Totally got no idea how to describe this. Was an amazing place and everything is so nice over there. You can literally do anything you want. Picnics to jogging, taking wedding photo. Well, should visit if you come Singapore."
,,Amazing garden for strolling aroundllll,5.0,,"If you like to see how green Singapore can be, Botanic garden is a must-see place. The air is so clean and the scenery is really comforting. I just really enjoyed the wonderful of the nature there. Even if this is a man made garden, it still feels so good to be here. The rain forest is very educational as the foresters try to simulate the real forest and its feature here, even the decomposition process. It is really great to take a walk around, take tons of good pictures. This place will definitely neutralize all the dynamics that you experience in Singapore."
,,Beautiful gardens and very spacious,4.0,,We visited the Botanical gardens and although a very humid and hot day we really enjoyed it. There were plenty areas for shade and although we didn't go the orchid gardens there was plenty to see. We were even fortunate to see a few large monitor lizards which pleased the kids
,,Getting in touch with nature,4.0,,"Great for nature lovers, as there are many different plants and flowers that can be found there and all of them are very well taken care of. Do remember to bring an umbrella, a poncho or a rain coat as there are very little shelters around and Singapore weather can suddenly turn from being very sunny to raining heavily. Sunscreen is also a must, as with water to keep yourself hydrated."
,,Lovely gardens in the midst of a ebulient city,4.0,,A trip to the botanic gardens is highly recommended. Went as a family including our 14 yr old daughter. There was plenty to see. An impromptu performance on the stage in the gardens was delightful.
,,My Must,5.0,,"Each trip to Singapore, visiting Botanic Garden is a must for me, is like walking into the heart of Singapore :) You can reach there by Circle line or Downtown line and take a slow walk and exit at Tanglin Gate.
My next aim coming back is with my picnic basket and mat :D"
,,Gardens are the best,5.0,,"There are two sections of Botanic Gardens: Chinese and Japanese gardens. I've only been to one of them. There are lots of green and colourful flowers. A lot of people like to picnic here but sports are not allowed here. Some paths are decorated with vines. When you walk through it, vines block most of sunlight and there're a few rays shining on your palm and cheek. It always feels surreal."
,,Lush Garden Oasis,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Garden is a really amazing spot to find space from the crowds. There's heaps of great themed gardens like the Healing Garden (medicinal plants) the Evolution Garden (showing various rock formations, as well as just a general gorgeous lush ambience. I used to walk through it every day on my way to work and at lunch times - great place to de-stress and get a way from it all! It's super easy to access via the MRT, or via bus. If you love nature then this is for you!
If you're planning on walking around then I'd recommend a hat and a water bottle to stay cool and hydrated!"
,,"good place, not a fan though",3.0,,"good place, not a fan though, orchids collection, butterfly area big place to roam around, but i suggest going to gardens by the bay instead as this place is secluded & farm from any establishments, unlike Gardens by the bay which has marina bay sands beside it."
,,must be nice in the blooming season,3.0,,"I was here in January 2017, and the park is big, with a lot of trees and bushes, but we night have been there outside the high season for blooming flowers, it was a experience but not a super experience. but can image it will be very beautiful later on."
,,Visiting Singapore's first world heritage site,5.0,,"The iconic national gardens created during the early days of Singapore's founding. It is as natural yet orderly as you can envision. Many old trees, palms and tropical plants as well as medicinal herbs are grown here. It is a great place for a morning or evening walk amongst nature in the heart of a busy city. Best of all, it's free except for the National Orchid garden enclosure which is worth a visit for a few dollars of entrance fees."
,,Best place to off load,5.0,,"In spite of the crowd, it's the best place to be alone and soul search. Albeit a garden in the city, you hardly see any tall buildings. The different scents from various plants and flowers wafting adds a tranquility that serenades the otherwise humid atmosphere"
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"Went to the botanical gardens on the afternoon during a business trip. Amazing. You can see why it's a unesco world heritage site with the gorgeous trees that have to be hundreds of years old. Walked around for about an hour, but in the afternoon heat, that was all we could manage. This is probably a better early morning stop if you are ok being outside. We were not accustomed to the weather so it was rather uncomfortable but there was some shade in the gardens. Don't miss the swing area and the rainforest. There's definitely monkeys in there."
,,Amazing Afternoon,5.0,,"A must see in Singapore, the place is amazing and the orchids stunning. Its a bit warm walking round but worth the sweat."
,,Fantastic Heritage Gardens and a must see in Singapore,5.0,,"A must see when visiting Singapore. At the time of this writing, 158 years old and a UNESCO Heritage site. A perfect place for a walk or a picnic. Dress as light as you can as it will get very hot.

If you're visiting the Gardens, make sure to bring plenty of water and some food. Refreshments at the Gardens are cut throat tourist prices."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"It's very well designed and managed. You can find a lot of tropical plants there. All you need to pay is only for the national orchid garden, very much worth the price."
,,Walking Tour,5.0,,Fantastic and Free! You can spend hours walking the pathways through this large outdoor botanical garden. The National Orchid Garden requires a separate fee. Easy transportation by bus or taxi.

,,Good place to take a walk.,5.0,,"Large garden, entrance is free, lots of trees, pond with tortoises, everything you need to relax. Some of the walkways are near to the ""tree wall"", you won't feel any breeze and it will be hot even that sunlight is blocked. Drinking machine available near Orchid Garden entrance."
,,exquisite gardens and installations,5.0,,"The gardens have a wonderful biodiversity of trees that I have not seen anywhere else in my travels. The trees are all beautiful and some are towering and exceptionally fine.

The gardens also have wonderful installations that look very artistic and creative in the way they blend nature into the scenery. Walking through you have the wonderful rich smell of the flowers and trees. It is a feast for he eyes, a wonderful urban escape."
,,A wonderful place for a lazy afternoon,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is an excellent hangout place with your friends on a lazy weekend afternoon. You can pack some snacks, sandwiches, a couple of drinks and head down there for a nice late afternoon picnic under one of the many huge trees. There are also plenty of free performances."
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"Came as part of out tour, and didn't really have enough time to take in the beauty of the orchids. Well worth another visit."
,,Do not miss this (the Orchid Garden in particular!),5.0,,"The Orchid Garden was fantastic! You can spend an afternoon wandering here easily. There was a free concert so remember to check the schedule. You can take the MRT to Botanic Gardens and then walk through to Orchard Rd (we got too hot so just did a circle to the Orchid Garden and then went back to the MRT). A lot of the paths are shaded so it is ok even in the heat, though you may not be able to walk as long."
,,Well Worth a Visit !,5.0,,"Do Go to this great garden ! Obviously with the Hot sun and tremendous down pours ,the growing conditions are perfect . But the hard work of all the staff and the "" mindset"" of the Singapore people make this Unescoe sight a "" must visit "" . We travelled by the excellentvalue "" Hop ,On Hop Off "". Bus , great value,very clean, as everything is in Singapore ( why can't everywhere be ) . Taxis are also cheap ! The Orchids are superb. and grow every where,many colours ,a real treat ! Because it was hot in mid May ,we did not have the energy to do all the Botanical Gardens ,it does deserve a visit , 5 $ or 1 $ for Old Folk . The staff are enthusiastic and friendly and deserve your visit ,you will not be disappointed !"
,,perfect for a family visit,4.0,,"Please do this if you are a nature lover and someone who wants to enjoy a nice walk in green environs. Lovely trails, lots of people walking and jogging, has a beautiful pond and an open theatre where you might get to see some free entertainment as well. Has themed gardens like herb garden, healing garden etc."
,,Not highly recommended,3.0,,"I personally do not recommend Singapore Botanic Gardens in the evening. When it got dark, it was difficult to see as there were not many lights around. May be better off as an early morning retreat."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Visited on our first day in Singapore, beautiful flowers from around the world. Very peaceful location and worth a visit if you like unusual flowers.

Inside there are a few places to eat as well if you wanted lunch or a coffee break etc.

Takes around 45 mins to an hour to look around and see everything."
,,FAbulous visit,5.0,,"Entering this garden, we seem forget that we were in modern country. It was pretty, peaceful in a green place, enjoy fresh air and made our trip more special"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Incredible place to visit. Orchids rain forests it has it all. Could spend hours wandering around. I would even suggest they hire out golf carts to save your legs
,,"Accessible, beautiful, serene.",5.0,,"Free entry and right at the MRT station for easy access. We were there on a recent public holiday and it was not overly busy. Pick up a map on your way in. Open spaces for picnics, gazebos and many places to sit and rest or view the surroundings. Bird life and different plants/garden sections and foliage is very interesting. Take some time to stop and just look around rather than always be on the move - you'll be amazed at what you see. TAKE WITH YOU - hat and sunscreen, some water if you're on the move, a light umbrella or poncho to avoid the rain and good walking shoes. It's easy to stay for just an hour or take more time to explore. The only charge is an entry fee to the Orchid Centre inside, $5 which is very well worth it."
,,The most fascinating experience,5.0,,"We thought to take a short stroll through the botanic Gardens, but ended up staying there for hours. Breathtaking for all the senses. The smells, sounds and views took us by surprise. Probably not a single plant missing that grows in these climates. Some hidden or well preserved in the healing section. Catering to the smaller visitors they built an evolution path that starts of with the beginning of time and the ferns as first plant inhabiting the planet. It's a fun walk through.
All the plants always with explanations to them and origins.

Well kept, very clean and a place to dwell away from the hustle and bustle. As everything in Singapore it is easily reached by the MRT."
,,An Oasis of Green,5.0,,"This is my happy place in this city. Beautiful, calm and a place where you can go and find inner peace"
,,More like patk,3.0,,Free and open to the whole public the botanical garden are more like a park as you have in many main cities. Due the tropical setting of course a large variety
,,Replaced somwhat by Gardens by the Bay but still worthwhile.,4.0,,One of the best Botanic Gardens anywhere and its free. There is a nice restaurant for lunch and then I recommend going the the National Orchid Garden within the Botanic Garden. Its worth the $5 SD admitance.
,,Amazing place in the middle of the city,5.0,,"I walked over from my hotel with a group of colleagues not knowing much about the place, and turned out to be quite interesting - a highlight of my visit to Singapore.

Walking past the gates you step into a haven from the bustling city, and almost immediately start seeing some really interesting trees and plants. There are trails everywhere for walking and running, and some trees simply make you stop and admire.

The gardens are free to enjoy, except for the National Orchid Garden within the botanic garden itself, which has a 5$S entry fee. We did it, and it was well worth it... some really nice and interesting plants, plus great places for a photo shoot with intricate backgrounds.

There is also a part of the park that has been preserved since the late 1800's, with really unique trees on the verge of extinction... makes you imagine how the whole island must have looked like centuries ago.

In addition, we visited an area displaying bonsai trees that were phenomenal.

All in all, a really nice place to go for a walk or jog, and to disconnect from city life."
,,garden in the town,4.0,,"coming from the subway entrance
you will find a small lake with a meadow where many people were eating ,discussing or have a nap
you have to walk about ~1 km to reach the orchid garden which is the best attraction here
to enter you have to pay 1SGD for senior people
after that we went to the medicinal garden plants very interesting , the fragance garden and the toxic plant garden .you have to follow the red brick pavered path which isn't easy to find
Notice that the toxic plant garden isn't open . you must be a part of an accompanied tour to enter in this garden
the fragance garden was poor ( the season, may 2017?)
the weather was too hot for this kind of visit"

,,Beautiful gardens to relax in!,5.0,,"Spent several hours in the gardens with my partner. We really enjoyed it. The highlight being the Orchid Gardens which only costs $5 for adults to enter otherwise the rest of the gardens are feee. Plenty of trees for shade and some cafes to buy food or cold drinks however bringing your own food is a good option too for a picnic. Some wildlife could be seen such as beautiful birds, squirrel and even a giant lizard wondering through the garden! Apparently monkeys come in too occasionally."

,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"Impressive even on the way until you get to the main spot with the orchids. Very good and the small souvenir shop. Green very, huge variety of plants in the area, careful and clean environment. Try to get early in the morning better due to humidity and heat. Easy access by metro line."
,,Marvellous!,5.0,,"A large expanse of gardens with lots of winding walkways, a huge variety of trees, plants and shrubs and despite the number of visitors it didn't feel overcrowded apart from one exception. The orchid gardens (fee charged) are a must see if you visit and this is the busiest part of the complex. There are plenty of places to sit quietly and contemplate and rest for a while as you are walking around and there are also places to eat and drink.
Well worth a visit and easily accessible via the MRT."
,,Is it for real,5.0,,"This place is awesome for any person. No tour guide recommend this place as it's entry is free to the garden.

I would highly recommend this place!"
,,Great place for anyone,5.0,,"Botanical garden is a fantastic place to visit. Lovely surroundings, good places for having a coffee- or a fancy dinner if you want that. Jacob Ballas Children Garden is a must do for younger kids. Here's something for anyone!"

,,Regular visitor - I bring friends here all the time,5.0,,"It's just a lovely place - well maintained, diversity, a world class garden park by any other name, with a history of significance to the agricultural development of Malaya (introduced rubber to Southeast Asia and the madman director HN Ridley) to match. The orchid garden is also lovely.

Best to stroll in the early mornings and evenings after 3pm into closing time."
,,The Kew Gardens of Asia! Stunning,5.0,,"We visited the gardens for a morning, on the day we were flying out of Singapore, and our time limitations didn't fully allow us to do the gardens justice. The whole place is pristine, and extremely good value. At the time of our visit it was 5 Singapore Dollars (SGD) approximately £2.50 and 1 SGD for over 60's. The gardens are well signposted and around every corner you can find stunning displays, ponds, lakes, fountains, arches, structures and amazing vistas that provide repeated photographic opportunities to snap some incredible photos. Singapore is a very green city and the botanic gardens exemplify the skills and expertise of their gardeners. We were told that the Singaporeans have undertaken an innovative project to connect all the parks by walkways, for the benefit of the city which gives you some idea of the pride they rightly have in their amazing parks and gardens. If time permits, visit the Botanical Gardens, you will not be disappointed."
,,Part of the Orchid Gardens,5.0,,Checked the Gardens and the Orchid gardens at the same time. The bus drop is in the gardens so easy walk
,,A beautiful garden,4.0,,"Beautiful garden. Walk, jog and run made my day every time I am there. Feel healthy as the air is good though it is in city."
,,Large Gardens in which to get lost !!,4.0,,"These gardens seemed very popular with the local population so it was quite busy. Direction signs were at times misleading as in some cases ""all roads lead to Rome"" !! However, the experience was worthwhile just to spend time in the Orchid Garden - which was SUPERB."
,,Wow what a garden,5.0,,"The gardens are so big and you could spend days walking around here.
It's such a beautiful place and when we visited here was a massive downpour, shortly after it cleared there was a tropical mist all over making it quite spectacular.
The kids loved feeding the turtles and fish in one of the large ponds
Great place for a little excursion and enjoy some very beautiful gardens"
,,Free Botanical Gardens,5.0,,Huge place with hundreds of floral species - you could easily spend all day here ! Very relaxing. Fabulous.
,,Spent half a day at the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens that make you forget you are in the heart of a bustling city. Getting
there is easy as the MRT takes you practically to the gate. Plenty of shady spots to sit
and relax .The lakes have terrapins that are just as curious of visitors as we are of them.
The orchid garden is well worth the small entry fee ."
,,Beautiful oasis in a busy city,5.0,,"A must do activity whilst in Singapore, so much to see and do. don't miss the orchid house which is only a nominal fee to view"
,,Wonderful botanic gardens,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed the stunning botanical gardens. A magnificent diverse range of tropical trees, plants scrubs to enjoy . A must see in Singapore to escape the busy and hectic lifestyle of Singapore. The colors and display of the Orchid house are absolutely divine..."
,,Natural Beauty (MRT Botanic Gardens),5.0,,"With a MRT station directly outside this is an easy place to get to. It is free to enter and you can spend 2 hours here easily. If you chose to eat lunch here you can make it much longer. Prices at the food places here are higher than elsewhere, but they are in a beautiful setting and the gardens have to make money somehow.

If you do not have time to visit both the Gardens by the Bay and this place I would say visit Gardens by the Bay. However if you want somewhere that is quieter, with fewer tourists (the Gardens by the Bay is not touristy) you should come here. Both places have plenty of local people and more Asian tourists than Western tourists. Both places maintain a feeling of quiet beauty and definitely don't feel like tourist traps (both are free).

The Singapore Botanic Gardens feel like they have grown naturally this way, where the Gardens by the Bay (which are amazing) feel like they have been built by people (and are incredibly well thought out). These gardens (SBG) despite being well maintained feel more 'wild'.

There is a much smaller, very beautiful specialty garden within Singapore Botanic Gardens, if you have a student ID bring it, as you get a significant discount off the ticket to the National Orchid Garden. Students: 1 Singapore Dollar, instead of the normal 5 S Dollars for an adult.

It is the kind of place you can bring a picnic. Everyone... definitely bring plenty of water!"
,,Tranquillity,5.0,,"Within a few minutes the noise of the traffic disappeared leaving you in a quiet tranquil garden. Sitting beside the lake we spent time watching fish and turtles, before walking around the well kept paths. Look for the huge mahogany tree suprisingly only planted 30 years ago. A visit to see the orchids is a must."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"A wonderful relaxing day spent amongst beautiful plants and wildlife that will remain with you forever. The gardens are well manicured, with trees and flowers of a huge variety. Humming birds attracted to the flowers and terrapins in the lotus ponds. Keep your eyes open for a pretty yellow and green snake amongst the plants. The orchid centre is well worth the 10 dollar entry fee to see the different colours and shapes of flowers and interesting garden designs."
,,"A beautiful, tranquil place in the heart of the city.",5.0,,"It's hard to believe that these gardens are in the middle of the city. Free to enter - other than the orchid gardens (which are only $6!) - which is pretty amazing really. A huge variety of vegetation, well worth a visit."
,,Must see in Singapore,4.0,,The botanic gardens are a lovely escape from the bustling centre of Singapore. Free to walk around. The orchid gardens are a must! Go in the morning or late afternoon though as it's too hot mid day to be walking around.
,,Singapore's treasure,5.0,,"One of the best places to visit with family, friends, couples, kids and for sport/leisure activities."
,,A glorious garden,5.0,,The botanic gardens are well laid out to give one an experience of the diverse types of trees and floers etc that can be found in that part of Asia
,,Walking at night,5.0,,Beautifully lit in the evening and surprisingly not too 'buggy' - lovely walk at night with dogs. Added bonus of casual restaurant at Nassim Gate
,,Nice Gard,4.0,,A lovely walking track all around the garden. A very well kept nice sorroundings and great atmosphere. I love the pure nature and embrace the cool breez. It was a very well designed credit to everyone who was involved.
,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens, a place that good for relax and exercise.",5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens, a place that good for relax and exercise. Can go with family, friends or even alone. See the trees, small insects, flowers, sunshine, wind blow, cool!"
,,Beautiful gardens in the city.,5.0,,"morning walk, exercise, and dining too. Go chill and relax. early morning 7am or 730am, or later evening 6 pm. prepare to sweat and wear comfy shoes. and bring sun block. Worth it."
,,Back for another visit,4.0,,"We haven't been to the Botanic Gardens for quite a while but decided on another visit this morning with the kids. Unfortunately it was raining so we spent a good proportion of the time feeding the fish near the entrance (which at least has some rain protection). Once the rain stopped we were good to resume our usual route, seeing the swans and the the usual attractions. I'm sure we will be back for more."
,,Singapore 5 day visit,5.0,,"Free entry to wonderful gardens, trees and flowers room for picnics on grass areas, some wildlife, monitor lizards and birds. Entry to Orchid Garden requires payment, not much, (forgot) but well worth it spectacular plants.."
,,A place to visit for locals and tourist alike!,5.0,,"Situated in the edge of Singapore's shopping districts, Definitely a place to your itinerary to break away from the buzzling shopping and encounter nature."
,,Stunning Orchids,5.0,,Walked around on a Sunday afternoon. Main area of interest was the orchid gardens - really amazing. Spend a long time gazing and taking photos. The rest of the gardens are nice but pretty typical botanic gardens.
,,amongst the most beautiful in the world,5.0,,"If visiting Singapore the Botanical gardens should be amongst the top five attractions , The variety of flora is above world standard, the gardens are miticulasly maintained and a great place to spend at least a half day ie 4-5 hours"
,,"Must see, even if you don't like walks or gardens",4.0,,"The Botanic gardens are a man-made and meticulously groomed garden with a wonderful assortment of trees and plants. The walk around the varying areas is fascinating and a refreshing break from the concrete landscape surrounding it.

There is also a pond with many species of fish and terrapins - as someone who is not really into walks, I would highly recommend visiting this in Singapore.

There are also restaurants and bars within the gardens if you get bored or need a break."
,,Nice additional,5.0,,"There are new part of the park being open to public, the bridge to walk over the rain forest is very good to walk around to see the scenery."
,,Welcome Shade,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful trees, flowers, sculptures, waterfalls, ponds, etc. A piece of tranquility in a very humid city!"
,,"A lovely place for a walk, something we have done often.",5.0,,"We often went there for a walk. It is peaceful, there are restaurants but it is mainly for adults although it does have a very small area for children to play, with water fountains and very little else apart from a slide and a couple of things kids could enjoy. Plenty of grass to kick a ball, which incidentally doesn't seem to be allowed but you can have a picnic and let the kids run around too. The gardens themselves are very pretty, the lake lovely too and our sons have seen the wild life we have missed so far apart from the birds. The orchid garden is beautiful and the walk exhausting but very good exercise. Plants seem to be well cared for and with the almost every day rain in Singapore, they thrive. Well worth a walk through if you want some exercise."
,,A walk in the gardens,5.0,,"If after a few days in Singapore seeing all the sights I suggest try a visit to the Botanic Gardens, you won't be disappointed. Set in beautiful laid out designs of different plants .trees and many areas to relax and just take in the splender of this very green parkland/Gardens. Within the Gardens is the most delightful Orchid Gardens which there is a entrance fee but believe me it is worth every penny of this small charge. All in all definitely a must visit to relax and enjoy the tranquil atmosphere."
,,You could spend all day here,5.0,,It's a great place which is amazingly well maintained. The number and variety of flowers in the orchid garden is just beautiful but even if you don't want to pay the 5 dollar entry for this the main gardens have plenty to offer for a relaxing day
,,Beutiful Gardens,5.0,,The Singapore Botanical Gardens are a lovely relaxing place to spend a few hours.

There are also a number of eateries in the gardens so it is easy to spend a whole day in there.
,,"For tree-lovers, diversity could be overwhelming",4.0,,"True to self, the name says it all. It's a one of a kind botanic garden. You can walk around in the park for free and it could take half of the day to enjoy and relax. There's a small green house to plant all the temperate trees and flower where the air-con is kept on all the time. Admitting its the coolest literally in the whole garden."
,,Disappointing,4.0,,"My spouse and I have visited botanic gardens around the world and were expecting much from this one. Perhaps too much. The grounds are large and well maintained, but the labeling and descriptions were sparse. (Note: this does not apply to the Orchid Garden located within the Botanic Garden.)"

,,History in a garden,5.0,,"This botanical gardens is more than just a collection of native plants. It is the source of the beginning of the rubber industry. It's where rubber tree seedlings, germinated in London's Kew Gardens were brought and grown to become the earliest rubber trees that could be tapped for latex to be turned into rubber products, from car tires to surgical gloves.
The gardens also has one of the best collection of orchids, including many hybrids named after visiting world leaders, royalities and show business celebrities.

,,Delightful,5.0,,This was a little bit of a surprise. We walked to these gardens from our hotel in Orchard Road and what a pleasant surprise it was. Some beautiful gardens and interesting sculptures. And the Orchid Garden was beautiful. You will pay a small entry fee for the Orchid Garden. It is so worth it. Enjoyed every minute.
,,Botanic Gardens,4.0,,Beautiful place to escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore. No entry fee to The gardens but worth paying the $5sg to enter the orchid exhibit

,,Cant believe its FREE!!,5.0,,Enjoyable stroll through the gardens...the signage seems a bit off...we got lost!!:) The staff was very helpful:)
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Went on our day using the hop on hop off bus. A gorgeous place to visit if you like gardens. Free but need money to get into the National Orchid Garden which I would recommend. Lovely waterfalls, check what's on as there it is a concert venue too."

There are parking facilities at the front of the park.there are two parts of the gardens a small garden and then the large area but you need a good day to walk around the whole place the pathways are ok and it is very accessible around the gardens for able body's and wheelchairs users alike. There is also a small gift shop at the exit."
,,Worth a isir,4.0,,"The gardens are very well kept, and very easy to walk around, very peaceful, very good for a day out. Lots of interesting history of different dedicated Gardens, one of which to Princess Diana. Also a magnificent Orchard garden, with the most amazing Orchards"
,,Relaxing Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"My wife and I took our 4 and 7 year old grandchildren on a walk through the gardens. All of us enjoyed the variety of plants and the play areas for the children. The playground that looks like a treehouse and the knarly tree trunk with holes large enough for the kids to stick their head through were fun. We stopped at the Bee's Knees for a little refreshment, which was delicious. It was a great way to spend a few hours, even if it was hot. But that's Singapore."
,,Excellent picnic venue,4.0,,"Enjoyed a weekend afternoon with friends and families thereof at the Botanic Gardens.

Found parking easy by going to the entrance and Cluny / Evans Road and then the car park A behind the back of the visitor center. It was a good central location from which to explore the park.

We settled down at the palm valley which had a big grassy area for playing ball games and lots of shady spots for picnic. It seemed to be near the orchid garden though we did. It go there this time.

As the afternoon went by the area became quite popular there were lots of other families and quite a few well behaved dogs being walked around. It was a nice atmosphere around 5-6pm when the heat of the day was behind us and lots of shade.

Living in the East I often go to East Coast park at the weekend. This was less crowded than East Coast park and the surrounds were much more peaceful and tranquil. Will return."
,,So much to see,5.0,,"These gardens are fantastic - great for walking, plenty to see and explore, and good facilities throughout. Also easily accessible by MRT. Be sure to check out the National Orchid Garden. To be sure to keep well hydrated on hot and humid days (i.e. almost everyday!)"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A must. Great place for a stroll but make sure you go to the orchid garden as it is gorgeous Take plenty of water !!
,,"Waste of time, waste of money",3.0,,"Nothing is there, its so empty compare to other gardens around the world. Except night time laser light show. As said other reviewers they using it for walking and strolling. Spend time on others before considering this."
,,Found peace & serenity and help with jetlag,5.0,,"After checking in to my hotel, coming from the US, the first place I visited was the Botanical Garden and so glad I did. The fresh air, aromatic scents from the flowers and beautiful colors really helped me both appreciate Singapore and acclimate to the time change. Went back two other times over the week and it is really a great place."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"You must visit here if in Singapore the pictures do not do it justice, well worth a visit you should take cold drinks with you as its very hot & long queues at the shops/cafes"
,,Magnificent Setting,4.0,,What a beautiful setting in the middle of a very modern magnificent city/country. You stop on the hop on/hop off bus.
,,Beautiful public space,5.0,,"Whilst it seems that Singapore is a bustling city the Botanic Gardens are a peaceful haven of tranquility.

Get away from the hustle and bustle for a few hours. You can jog, walk or just sit and take in the magnificent vistas of trees, lawns and flowering plants."
,,Manicured and lovely,5.0,,"Great variety of specimen and lovingly cared for. Feed the fish, watch the goannas and discover new species (the cannonball tree was new to me). Do not miss the orchid garden within it: it is a treat!"
,,Breathe of fresh air,5.0,,The botanic gardens are free to explore and is easily accessible by public transport. The SMRT stops right near one of the many entrances to the gardens. There is much to see and it would probably take between 3 and 4 hours to fully appreciate what it has to offer. The rainforest is a peaceful place for a stroll or to take some time out with the sounds of nature. It is also a great place to exercise as all of the paths are paved and there are many grassed areas to either lay back and take in the world or exercise some more.
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,These are definitely beautiful gardens and they are free to walk It's nice place to relax and bring kids Would recommend having at least a short walk!
,,Oustsndibg,5.0,,"I could have spent the entire day here given more time. Visited midweek and just loved the peace and serenity of the Gardens and variety of plants and wildlife. A highlight for me was seeing an iguana.
A beautiful mix of natural and tended gardens. The orchids were at their best. Stunning. Eager to visit again and explore beyond the Orchid and Ginger Gardens."
,,Huge gardens,4.0,,Get ready for walking. This garden was huge and really needed a golf cart to get around. Enjoyed the gardens until we got sore feet and needed a break. Great food places
,,Beautiful Visit,5.0,,The Gardens are simply beautiful. Easy to walk around and to access. Only the Orchid Gardens ( beautiful!!!) requires a admission fees the rest of the park is admission free. Very helpful staff and willing to help. We arrived by taxi 12sgd and come back to hotel (marina bay) via uber. A must see of Singapore.
,,Best botanic I have been in.,5.0,,The design and layout are absolutely first class. Staff were friendly and helpful. The orchid garden was amazing - a photo op wherever you looked. Our whole group loved the place and thought it considerably better than Gardens by the Bay.
,,UNESCO listed,5.0,,Beautiful location- worth paying the extra to visit the Orchid gardens. Staff very knowledgeable and willing to help and guide you.
,,Lovely way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,We arrived at lunchtime and the first thing we saw was the restaurant. We had a surprisingly good meal at a reasonable price. We wandered round it was free to enter. We didn't do the orchid section as this was not free and we are not interested in orchids to justify paying to enter.
,,One of my things to see,4.0,,"The Gardens are a must it can be enjoyed by all ages, I cant help it I just love plants, flowers it is inspirational - I cant wait to go back home and try again to achieve what they have captured here. Easy walking and good paths."
,,Absolutely wonderful,5.0,,"Lovely oasis of greenery in a city that takes great pride in its gardens The orchid display is incredible, well worth the visit. Lots of seating so you can stop, sit and enjoy the views"
,,One of the best,4.0,,If you've got the time (too many in S'pore don't) this is a great place to enjoy S'pore and a great park setting.
,,Variety is the spice of life,4.0,,"I'm not a 'plant' person but ended up at the Gardens by chance and was certainly glad I did. The whole area is beautifully manicured, well set out and there was plenty of information available. What really impressed most was the huge range of plants and then the varieties of those plants. I could see how someone 'plant-minded' could spend many, many hours here, if not days. Being so large, even though there were quite a few people around it was not crowded."
,,Botanical gardens,5.0,,These gardens are fabulous and most of them are free. They are very large and it would take several hours to see all the different areas. The orchid garden is well worth the admission charge with hundreds of flowering plants and the rain forest and evolution garden were fascinating.
,,beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful place, nice for a few hours walking and enjoy quite surround by nature place, free of charge."
,,Outstanding Gardens,5.0,,"This is a must do attraction if you like gardens, flowers or in the case of these gardens they also have a Rainforest which is one of only two gardens in the world to have one! The Orchard Garden is spectacular and costs just $5 to enter. It is worth every cent! The Gardens have just opening a Learning Forest which is also spectacular. The only cost is for the Orchard Garden and the rest of the garden is free! You might want to take an umbrella as Singapore is predictable in its weather- it often rains@"
,,I love this place,5.0,,"Close to National Orchid Garden, this place is a world heritage site by UNESCO. It is spread over 72 hectares and there are many species to observe and take pleasure in the act. If you are in Singapore or planning to visit Singapore then you definitely must visit this place."
,,What a lovely walk,5.0,,"First day in Singapore, weather was amazing. So we quickly went to the gardens and they did not disappoint. Lots of wildlife, lakes, a waterfall, scenic bridges and plenty more we no doubt didnt see. Its free and easy to get to. There are water fountains, just ask someone at the cafe if you dont want to buy bottles of it."
,,Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"Very beautiful place to visit, and the flowers are bueatiful. Orchrid Garden is worth the visit itself even though it is not free."
,,one of the very best,5.0,,"plz visit it...no entry fee...UNESCO heritage site...nicely connected by bus and train ..easy to access....clean, green, beautiful place...do carry ur umbrella...mosquito repellent might also be helpful....at least give 2-3 hours...and be prepared to walk"
,,Oasis of calm and botanical interest,5.0,,"I have visited these beautiful UNESCO Heritage gardens several times over the years and it is a welcome contrast to the busy city. It is a vast area and you could easily spend 2 or 3 hours strolling around. It is open from early morning to midnight. Take a waterproof or umbrella as it rains a lot. There are various small gardens within - sensory, perfume, childrens, ginger. The orchid garden is stunning and requires a small entry fee. There is also a small restaurant at the ginger garden and toilets. A small area of rain forest remains too. The gardens are popular with dog walkers and runners. Look on the web site for events like concerts, talks and tours. There are several exits so get a map - available at some entrances and the small restaurant. It is well signposted."
,,Great Gardens,4.0,,An amazing place to take a stroll and feel like you are away from the city! Particularly enjoy not bumping into many people!
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"The most beautiful botanic gardens I' ve ever seen. The Orchard garden is really spectacular!!! It has all kínd of orchards from all over the Word. In general, all the plants are pretties. Ir you go to Singapore you have to visit the botanic Gardens"
,,Well laid out but lots of walking in the heat,4.0,,"The gardens are lovely, and nicely set out, but be prepared for lots of walking if you arrive by public transport. I caught the MRT and one of the garden entrances is next door. However as I wanted to see the orchids, they were 1.3 km into the park. The walk however was lovely and partly shaded. The orchid gardens were beautiful but not as large or as diverse as I expected and took half an hour to wander round. The gardens are free except for the orchid gardens which are 5 dollars."
,,The Botanic Gardens is a great space with many walks to choose from,5.0,,"I saw the Victoria water lilies I had wanted to see for so long, surprised to discover they were spiny before they unfold. The orchidarium was unbelievably large and filled mostly with many types of Dendrobiums and Vandas. Yellow Oncidiums were bordering the alleys, even at one point forming arches. Some of the Dendrobiums were about 2.5 m high and some Vandas almost 2 m. I was amazed at the numerous sorts of banana trees. I also went leisurely through the bamboo garden and the evolution walk. I did not see everything but was bushed by the end of the day. While taking a picture in the ginger garden I almost stepped on the tail of a monitor lizard. They seem to be plentiful and not afraid of people. I had stopped for a short rest and a drink of mineral water when the woman next to me got up for a few seconds, 3 birds swooped down on her plate and started stealing her stir-fry noodles. I did not even have the time to take a pic. Common Mynas are plentiful in India as well. They are dark with a yellow beak and legs. When flying they display a flash of white at their wingtips and tail. The top of the head is flat and sometimes there is a small ruffle of feather above the beak. Those birds are as brazen as the squirrels at home in Canada."
,,Relaxing and beautiful.,5.0,,"An oasis in the city. It's a nice place to walk and explore, and it's free. I was trying to find the monitor lizards, but they seemed to be hiding. But I did see a fair amount of bird life, which was nice."
,,great weekend visit,5.0,,"I only wish we had a bit more time to explore the gardens further, what we did see was beautiful, clean & lush. I will visit again to see what we missed this time. A great place to go on weekends when the tourist places are too busy."
,,Lovely Park,4.0,,"My favorite park in SG. You can have a walk here. Spare one to two hours for visit. My favorite garden is the one near by orchard area. There's also kids garden area, but it's only for kids. Adults visiting without kids are not allowed to enter this park."
,,"The best botanical gardens I've visited, including great birdlife",5.0,,"A large, beautifully kept garden on the city outskirts ~ not to be confused with the Gardens by the Bay which is a some miles away.
The garden has miles of well laid out and surfaced paths and the magnificent National orchid centre (small entry fee).
As a first time visitor, given the heat a leisurely visit to the Garden could easily take 4 hours.
During our visit, there were a number of local birdlife experts who were engaged in viewing at close quarters a rare bird and we saw this, and a number of other birds including a highly visible pair of magnificent fish eating owls and a tiny purple heron. We were also lucky enough, along with other visitors, to see 2 separate monitor lizards harmlessly moving through the vegetation.
The only downside to this visit was the lack of easy public transport to the Gardens. The new subway station being built and due for completion in 2020 is badly needed; Singapore is behind the times in lacking this much needed transport infrastructure."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"These gardens are huge and have some really beautiful spots. On weekends they also have concerts around one of the lakes. For a free attraction, this is well worth a visit. Toilets and drinking water are available in gardens and there is an area in the middle with a cafe and shop. There are several exits, so make sure you remember which one you used to get in, though there are signs to the metro station within the gardens. There are sections with a lot of insects, so wear insect repellent. Because of the size of the place, i'd recommend spending 2 hours here."
,,Lovely parkland but it's Singapore so be prepared for a shower.,4.0,,"The gardens are more of a park land than a standard Victorian garden experience. The area is vast with large ponds, wooded area's rolling grass land and even an auditorium for outdoor converts. We found it a lovely contrast to the city, strolling around you seemed to be miles away from the city sky scrapers. One word of caution take a 'pac a mac' if you have one, when it rains in Singapore is rains heavily and at very little notice."
,,Nice day out,4.0,,"If you like gardens then you will enjoy these gardens though bear in mind that you will need comfortable shoes and plenty of water in the hotter months.
We found that the gardens were a nice way to spend an afternoon and although it rained during our visit, it didn't detract from the gardens...though we were stuck under a sheltered sign for some time while we waited for the rain to clear."
,,Stunning,5.0,,We traveled to the Botanic Gardens on the hop on hop off bus. The gardens are stunning. Plants breath taking. We enjoyed every aspect of these gardens. We encourage every Tripadvisor reader to experience them whilst in Singapore
,,A perfect day,5.0,,"We spend almost a day at these beautiful gardens. Saw a lot of birds and other animals (even though some I would have preferred not to see) and had a great day. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is wonderfully designed and maintained, with small lakes and green meadows, rainforest, severall collections like Gingergarden, Frangipani collection, Bonsai and so much more. Could easily spend another day there."
,,Quiet & beautifully maintained gardens,5.0,,"Entry into the botanic gardens is free. They cover a large area but you can take in as much or little as you wish. A detailed map outlining each distinct section of the gardens is available at the entrances and can also be picked up at various spots throughout the gardens. The paths are paved and wide and you will find people jogging, pushing strollers or just there for the purpose of learning about the local vegetation. An entrance fee of $5 sing is charged for the orchid garden which is located within the botanic gardens. I definitely recommend seeing it. Hundreds of orchids of all types are displayed in beautifully landscaped areas. The orchid garden gift shop located at the exit is a great stop for some quality souvenirs. I did not find the prices to be too bad. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes. There are also vending machines and a few spots for drinks and food in the gardens."
,,My Favourite Boctanic Gardens Singapore,5.0,,"Once I am free, I will always stroll at this natural and lovely gardens.
To relax after a busy hard day work, I can't help going there again and again.
You can always find a small pavilion nearby to rest when you walk and feel tired. At the same time you can still enjoy the trees and plants around.
Boctanic Gardens is the Best place for lovers of the Green Scenery.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
There are a great varieties of plants and trees in the Gardens. Whether you are an ordinary or a botanist, you WILL benefit from being there."
,,fabulous,4.0,,the flora and fauna is really eye catching. coupled with the fact that you can take long lazy strolls aroundthe gardden. the large trees are shady enough for a quier afternoon snooze and the restaurant out there is unbelievble in terms of food quality and design. The orchid garden is a peach. Well done singappore
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Amazing trip, best botanical garden I have been to. Clean, well maintained, big well layer out and marked. First class"
,,Beautiful & serene,5.0,,"Beautiful and serene Garden. Great place to relax from the rush of daily life. It is very well maintained and has a massive collection of plants of natural environment. Once there one can even visit different themed garden. The Garden has been certified as the Unesco site.
Singapore Botanic Garden is the only Botanic Garden in the world that open at 5 am. The entrance to the Garden is free except for the orchard Garden. One of the best public places one could ever go to."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Local are so lucky to have this in the city. A stunning place to have a walk or a run. Beautiful with clean facilities and places to eat.
,,Magnificent orchids,5.0,,"Travelled here by the hop on hop off bus. It's a lovely walk through the gardens to the orchid displays. We particularly liked the orchids that are growing on the trees. Vibrant colours, a lovely way to spend a few hours."
,,Beautiful garden which brings peace!,4.0,,"As I am a nature lover, I love the animals and trees. This place is full of beautiful trees, plants, flowers and so many kinds of species I even don't know. I enjoy walking along the gardens and visiting ""Orchid Garden"" which represents the symbol of the Singapore. Every time I visited Singapore, I never missed that place to chill and take photos."
,,Free and an absolute joy,5.0,,"How wonderful it would be to have this place on your doorstep! Look out for monitor lizards and the terrapins in the lake. Beautifully kept and fascinating, especially the orchids. Whether a family, singles or couples, well worth a visit."
,,For nature lovers,4.0,,Amazing place for people who love to picnic on green grass beside the lake and interest in plant biodiversity. All area are free of charge except the National orchid garden where you can explore a lot of beautiful orchids.
,,A lovely place to chill,5.0,,The gardens are very well preserved. It is a good place for nature lovers to relax and enjoy the flora. The varieties are unbelievable. Carry water.
,,Spend a day outside the mall. Give your selfies a new filter.,5.0,,"Attended a Insta-meetup here and met some nice people. At first it was difficult to find the group, because it seemed every local was busy taking pics of the well kept gardens, striking poses, pouting for some selfies. The expats are sitting around having picnics, their kids playing frisbee. There is a stark difference in how the two groups interact with nature.

What nature?

Fauna-wise: a rooster. A lizard. A squirrel. Some butterflies and dragonflies. Flora-wise: plenty of tropical plants. Landscaped and taken care of, find some shade and eat your cheese, or get up on the skywalk and capture your next viral snap. A lovely day out either way.

The only downside is that bicycles are not permitted. Backwards policy, really."
,,Nice landscape,5.0,,"Very beautiful place, and pleasant to go for a light run and see the view! Clean and tidy, and well maintained, that's the best way to describe it"
,,Had a nice afternoon at the Gardens,5.0,,If you like to spend an afternoon relaxing with lots of plants and flowers visit this place...the only thing is that food is not that great. Had a nice afternoon with a local friend.
,,Must see while in Singapore.,4.0,,"The Botanic gardens are a great place to stroll around, have a picnic, or head for a run. The orchard garden really is a must see, and it's entrance price is low so won't break the bank."
,,Stunning diverse gardens,5.0,,"A taxi driver told us not to bother coming here after spending a day at marina gardens by the bay... so instead we walked around China town. That didn't last with two young kids so we stuck to our guns and jumped in a taxi to the gardens. So glad we did!! What a surprise... these gardens are amazing. Waterfalls, rainforest, orchids, frangipanis, cacti all in a serene and cooling environment. The kids loved the old swings and just chasing each other around the grassed open space ways. We only spent about one hour but easily could have relaxed for the whole day exploring this beautifully maintained and well established garden. Well done Singapore!!"
,,A nice leisurely stroll,4.0,,"We walked around these gardens for a few hours in the morning. Make sure you bring plenty of water because the humidity really does have impact. They are lovely gardens, very big and free to enter."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"One could easily spend a whole day here. The gardens are huge, you will need to wear comfortable footwear (I would suggest running trainers to be honest as my plimsol trainers didn't cut it) as there will be a LOT of walking involved!

Take a camera with sufficient memory as you are likely to take a lot of photos! The maps/signs are very good for navigating around the park and the Botanic Gardens MRT station takes you right outside.

There are drinking water fountains at every toilet so if you have a water bottle you could refill it there. There are a sufficient number of toilets within the park too.

The Orchid Garden is a must see! It was absolutely beautiful.

Also, take a trip to the Canopy where you can grab some lunch at a cheap price.

Overall, I would say this is a must . It was a great experience and I would certainly go again if I ever venture back to Singapore."
,,Peace and Tranquility!,5.0,,"A place well worthy of its world class status. The gardens were spotless, beautifully maintained and attention given to every details in the park. Well presented signboards give interesting historical background to the flora as well its history and development. The National Orchid Garden should not be missed either."
,,Nice morning walk,4.0,,"Botanic Gardens are a nice place to walk and chill for a few hours. I would not say is the best experience of my life, but definitely is worth the time, free to enter and cheap exposition. Beautiful gardens to walk around."
,,Singapore's Capital Garden City,5.0,,"This garden really lives up to its name. 158 years old, spanning 78 hectars and a UNESCO heritage site, it houses many different types of plants and it houses the largest orchid collection of 1,200 species and 2,000 hybrids. A great place to relax and recommended for all tourists! Be sure to check it out when visiting Singapore!"
,,Excellent botanic gardens!,5.0,,"Singapore botanic gardens was the highlight for me when returning to Singapore after 10 years. In a nutshell: lots of tropical gardens, tall leafy green trees, shadey spots to chill out, green grass, beautifully landscaped terraces, lots of different tracks heading into forest or through different gardens, a stunning collection of orchids! Start your trip early in the morning to catch a glimpse of some stunning birds - you'll sometimes see hornbills, kingfishers or golden orioles passing through."
,,Peaceful and serene,4.0,,"We spent a lovely peaceful morning walking around the Botanical Gardens. It's probably best to visit early before the main heat of the day kicks in as there is a reasonable amount of walking. It's easy to get to using the MRT or ""Hop On / Hop Off Bus"", so don't believe the reviews that say you need to go by taxi. The Orchid Garden is a must see too."
,,Emotional,5.0,,"The exhibition at the garden was magnificent. I never thought of myself as a flower enthusiast but this experience nearly brought me to tears! The music combined with the quiet was the best soul food ever.
Not too full, though I'm glad I went early 9 am. Easy to find in the MRT, very reasonably priced too"
,,Green and large garden in the city : à Must do!,5.0,,"Must see : the orchid and the rain forest . Very well kept and clean garden with exceptional trees , flowers ... very quiet and nicely displayed paths through the greenery ! After heavy workday : the place to enjoy calm and beautiful park where you can walk at peace .
The orchids are exceptional in number, Colour and forms : don't miss the cool greenhouse where mountains orchid from South Americas can be seen : very nice indeed !"
,,Breathe deeply here and enjoy fresh oxygen!,5.0,,"I can only imagine how old the trees are as I am deeply breathing and enjoying fresh air! Walking through the rain forest or looking at the swan lake I am grateful to be here. It is obvious you will need walking shoes if you decide to do this but I was surprised to see people wearing heels. We arrived here late in the afternoon having already walked 17,000 steps so my feet were ready for a leisurely stroll and the benches that enabled me to sit and enjoy the fresh air."
,,Two for the price of one,5.0,,"The title relates to the review and the fact that the orchid gardens are part of this attraction. Although it is worth noting there is a small charge for visiting the orchid collection. Nevertheless, if you are into walking, plants and gardens, you will find this a relaxing and enjoyable way of spending some time.
The big draw back are the levels if humidity, but what's a bit of perspiration between friends. Well worth a visit away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
The orchid collection is amazing and the beauty of the plants and the planting is spectacular."
,,"Beautiful, specifically when it rains",4.0,,"In a romantic environment you could enjoy watching a wide variety of plants and flowers. Although you get complete wet when it rains, but it is worthy to visit the place"
,,Lovely place,4.0,,Botanic Gardens are one of the must places to visit in Singapore. There are lot's of things to see. Remember to take a water bottle with you! It get's hot!
,,Beautiful Botanic Gardens,4.0,,"A 150 year old botanic garden with incredible tropical foliage. The garden is immense and the number of specimans to view quite large and varied. The park is free except for the orchid gardens which carry a fee of 5 Singapore Dollars per adult.
The disadvantage is the gardens are totally exposed to the elements and this means het, humidity and rain, as occurred during the latter part of our visit. However, we had covered a good deal of the park before the deluge began. The blending of water land and botanicical specimans is breathtaking.."
,,"Beautiful gardens, tropical to pretty.",4.0,,"Cool air conditioned diner at 'The Garage', most welcome after a walk about the gardens. The Orchid garden is a must, pleasant walks all around."
,,Lots of walking but worth it,4.0,,It's open from 5am.to midnight so go early or late if you want to walk the whole gardens. The Orchids were beautiful and 5 dollars was worth it to look around them. The rest of the park is free with wide open spaces. Take bikes or trikes for the children to scoot round on. It's easy walking distance from Orchard Road or the MRT takes you to the other end of the gardens.
,,Tranquility in the City,5.0,,"I love the Botanic Gardens. If you like to walk and visit nature, the trails here are great. There is a variety of walking paths. Along the main ones, you will see lots of people, leashed pets, and even some exercise classes. There are others where you may only see a few other walkers. There is always something interesting to see like flowers, orchids, lily pads, tree buttresses, etc.

There are several restaurants here at each end of the park, and also in the middle of the park. There is also a great gift shop. Lots of people picnic in the area near the symphony stage."
,,Birds a humming and dragons a swimming,5.0,,"We viisted the gardens twice.Once with a tour guide who was very informative and the second time on our own.Initially we went around the orchid gardens which were resplendant with colour an with numerous different species of orchids. We saw several humming birds feeding off the nectar which was amazing. The gardens are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and we can understand why. During our second visit we saw swimming/basking water dragons which were superb, shoals of very large catfish and a rare bird which had attracted a lot of attention from local twitchers, l believe it was a blue peacock, but not as we know it as it was the size of a songthrush but beautifully marked.We had to cut short this visit due to a thunderstorm, more's the pity as there is so much to see."
,,Breathtaking and beautiful gardens,5.0,,We walked around the botanic gardens which were absolutely stunning. The grounds are very clean and there are so many interesting things to see. The gardens are immaculate and it's free to go see. It's $5 to see the orchid gardens but you don't mind paying that when it is free entry. Plenty of helpful staff around and very easy to get to withnplenty of taxis or a quick walk to the mrt.
,,"Rainforest walk, learning garden walk, SwanLake",5.0,,"Trees that are so majestic and older than 100 Years old! The Johore fig with its tall aerial roots look like so many trees. It is good to get a guide to walk you along so that he can tell you amazing facts about the trees. For example, we learn the the Jambu tree is so moist that it actually can block or delay a fire. The Kempas tree in Perak can have as many as 20-30 beehives and how the people will beat the tree trunk and get the bees to fly off before they climb up to get the honey fr the hives, etc

So happy to see unique flowers and the wild colourful cockerel that flew up the visitor centre.

Enjoyed the walk and I will go back for more walks there, coz really wonderful to be in the midst of nature. Absolutely love it."
,,Great & Relaxing,5.0,,That was a very good experience! We spend 3 hours here and enjoyed the style of this garden. Take a relaxing walk especially in the rain forrest area. It is fascinating to see this old trees and botanic.
,,Nice Garden,4.0,,"If you enjoy greenery, perfection and peace you should go there. Children's may not enjoy much.

Its a huge park and walking could be tiresome sometimes. No transportation inside. Nature is at its best inside the garden. Require atleast 2 hours to take a fast round."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"No words to describe the unique experience of six different exotic natural environments in one shot. If, as me, you don't have big time for working reasons and you wanna live a Botanic shok learning, go to Singapore Botanic Gardens. Beautiful."
,,Pleasant Trip,5.0,,A nice place to relax and spend a few hours wandering around. Its fairly easy walking with good footpaths. Plenty of different garden areas and a nice cafe.
,,Enchanted forest,5.0,,"We visited the newly opened forest section of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It is perfectly integrated with the rest of the gardens and takes the UNESCO world heritage site to a new level of excellence and originality with its instant giant trees that have tree top walk ways with trapeze netting in the sky, amazing views and beautiful tropical ponds below! The Botanic Gardens have always been my favourite place in Singapore to escape the maddening crowd and have some peace and nature. Now there is so much more to see and explore!"
,,Fresh and relaxing,5.0,,"A ""havre de paix"" in Singapore. On week end its a good place to do a casual pique-nique on the grass."
,,"Plants and Trees, and Vast Area. We only",4.0,,"Beautiful and clean. And we were so lucky because we came at the day where they held a program named Heritage Week 2016. But we almost can't tell anything about the program. The only thing we know is that they provided a van to travel to other gates, because this place is so vast."
,,What a delight!,5.0,,"We loved these peaceful, lush, green gardens. A great place to walk and see a wonderful collection of plants, including magnificent orchids and gingers, as well as interesting sculptures and other pieces of garden art. Highly recommended."
,,Whats not to like,5.0,,We got caught in a thunderstorm after visiting the Orchid Garden. This should be on your list especially when the new subway opens.
,,Great Tranquil Place,5.0,,We enjoyed a walk through the Botanic Gardens admiring all the lovely trees plants and features. Even though it was showers we had enough shelter from the trees
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,"Established in 1859 the Singapore Botanical gardens are an absolute joy. From the historical black & white colonial buildings to the incredible orchid garden, amazing paths and walks that take you on a journey of discovery. Loved the herb gardens that have everything for natural health and well being, great educational signs and boards to read and learn. Love the tropical gardens, water features, and simply just walking around taking it all in. A must when visiting Singapore to walk, learn, relax. Enjoy!"
,,a best way to witness a massive collection of plants,5.0,,"plenty of green green green everywhere , you need to walk a bit.but totally worth . very well maintained . make sure you carry a bottle of water if its sunny :)"
,,Beautiful park in the city,5.0,,"Wonderful botanical gardens, amazing plants. Orchids are spectacular (need to pay for this section)."
,,BEAUTIFUL AND PEACEFUL,5.0,,"Tranquil,beautiful gardens - good to get out of the sun and walk among the trees and shrubs.
Lovely to spend a day wandering and marvelling at the plants,their foliage,tree trunks etc with the odd stop for a drink.
We saw a very sleepy lizard (1 metre long) basking in the sun on one of the paths."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Great kept gardens and nature reserve. Turtles, catfish and Komodo dragon can all be easily seen roaming this park."
,,Relaxing rest in nature,5.0,,"Its very nice walk among tousends of flowers and trees. I visited also Gardens by Bay, but recommend Singapore Botanic Garden, and not because its free :-). I liked part with herbs organized in groups based on part of body they are possitivelly affecting."
,,Simply a delight,5.0,,"For somebody who comes from a pretty dry continent, the lush abundance of leaves and green things and flowery things and humidity was just amazing. Or should I call it ""colour and form""? Anyway, just take the word ""lush"". And wear comfortable walking shoes - I couldn't stop walking and looking, even with heat and sweat dripping off me (you didn't want to know that, did you!). Go and see it."
,,A wonderful place to visit weather rain or shine.,5.0,,"Typical of Singapore, this place gets quite busy but thankfully is large enough that you can find brief moments alone and some real relaxation if you are willing to venture off the more typical paths that people take.

There are a few opportunities to picnic etc in this garden and also a wonderful lake filled with many turtles and catfish.

Lots of breath-taking and well-presented flowers, it is very easy to spend the best part of a day here."
,,Amazing orchids,4.0,,We spent a few hours here until a heavy shower cut it sort. It is quite spread out and a reasonable amount of walking. The orchid garden was amazing.
,,Definitely worth a vidit,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens, free entry, great for a stroll. Look out for the white swans and plenty of turtles and fish on Swan Lake.

The main attraction is the Orchid Garden -well worth the $5 entry, while the newly opened Learning Forest is modern with a fabulous treetop boardwalk. There's even a small mesh canopy walk you can go on around two large trees. Scary, but good!

Shout out to the great park customer service staff - a warm welcome on entry and one even helped me to walk across the rope canopy walk (because I was a bit of a wuss!)

For me, the easiest access was via MRT to Orchard then a bus from Bus Stop 3 (it's right opposite Bus Stop 4, which has better signage!) The new Tyrell gate (which gives you the closest access to the Orchid Garden and the Learning Forest) is accessible by bus (the same lines that get you to the Tanglin gate, although it's a 5-10 minute walk up Tyrell road and then through the car park.)"
,,A photography experience at Botanic gardens,4.0,,We went to Botanic Gardens during last weekend to enjoy a photography session with family. It was raining a bit so the weather was not so hot. The weather and the location was really splendid for a perfect photography session.
,,Needs more time than you think.,5.0,,"It's quite an in depth Botanical garden and larger than you imagine. Easy to get to on the bus but ask
the driver to tell you when to get off, it's not obvious from the road and a lot of road construction work was taking place at the time of our visit. The Orchid garden is amazing and has a huge variety. We highly recommend a visit here if you have time it's very beautiful."
,,Very Peaceful and Orchid Garden is Amazing,5.0,,Free to wander round the quite extensive gardens and a nominal charge for the Orchid garden. It's all great but the orchids are just fantastic - great to see so many varieties growing au naturel. Definitely put this on your itinerary for any trip to Singapore.
,,Green!,3.0,,"If greenery in the big city is what you are looking for, this is the place to come. Be prepared to come with a bottle of water as in the hot humid days it can get tiring walking around the gardens."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"I didn't have much time to spend here, but I'm glad I made the effort. The Gardens are beautiful; it was my first day in Singapore, and not having seen so much greenery at this point, I got a real thrill out of seeing what we're to me exotic species growing in their natural habitat. It's free to enter the Gardens, and open from 5am until midnight. A great resource well worth the visit. If I go back to Singapore, I'm definitely headed here."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Beautiful gardens with lots of different areas to appreciate. Well worth a visit and accommodates all age groups of visitors.
,,Relaxing walk through different theme garden settings,5.0,,"I love to take my dogs to the botanical garden or just go for a relaxing stroll, there's so much to see and the air is fresh in the early mornings and late evenings, there are 5 different gardens,, the healing garden, jacob ballas children's garden, ginger garden, evolution garden and the orchid garden
It is so refreshing to smell the nice fragrance of the flowers and to learn the different spices of plant , lovely and relaxing and if you are tired from walking, there are cafe you can stop by to have a cuppa or a meal !"
,,very hot,4.0,,we went there when the weather is not good. it's really hot and there are many people so kinda crowded
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Really well maintained gardens covering vast space, peaceful to walk around and the orchid garden is a must visit part. If only it wasn't raining"
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,I visited the botanical gardens including the orchid garden...if in Singapore it is a must see! They are fantastic! The layout is wonderful and the colours of the orchids are breathtaking!
,,Relaxing stroll with ponds and wildlife.,3.0,,Relaxing walk through. Nice restaurant for cold drinks.and nice loos 1/3 way round. Started at the bottom and ended up in little India.
,,Beautiful - worth strolling around,5.0,,"Even if you don't have much interest in botanical collections this is well worth a visit. Stroll around and enjoy the tall trees, water features and wildlife."
,,A real Jewel!,5.0,,"Give yourself plenty of time to explore the Botanical Gardens, as they cover quite a large area. I had visited the gardens during my youth and the further development has been quite extensive but sensitively done. If you like gardens, then don't miss it."
,,Singapore best Garden,5.0,,"Great place to visit. So many flowers, plantations and species you wouldn't find anywhere else in Singapore but in the botanic gardens."
,,Tourist,4.0,,What a gorgeous place. We visited in the afternoon and it was so very hot! Also I have a disability and wasn't aware until we were leaving that wheelchairs are available . We visited the Orchid and Ginger Gardens. Despite following the signs we couldn't find the Healing Garden. Plenty of places to have food and cold drinks.
,,"If you like greenery, do not miss this gardens",4.0,,"I have been here several times with my family over the years. Be it the Jacobs Ballas for children, the Orchid gallery for orchid lovers or just simply the Symphony or Swan lakes pond area to watch the swans, turtles or fishes (sometimes even dragonflies), l am proud of our Botanic Gardens that is a heritage on its own with a few hundred years old trees and plants. Though it could be a little humid and warm during certain parts of the year and l may have to bring more water, beverages and even my cap or a hand held paper fan or towel to cool down, this place has not failed to get me back in touch with the greens of our tiny island. The many beautiful species of orchids within the Orchid gardens gallery would have me happily snapping photos away.
You could even have a small picnic on any available green patches of grass or lawn by just spreading out a picnic mat or plastic sheet and spend a relaxing morning or afternoon throwing your frisbee and have some sandwiches and fruits.
There are 2 main entrances l know if you are taking public transport, one end is near Botanic MRT station on Downtown line and the other end is nearer Gleneagles hospital with public buses. If we drive we will get nearer the middle entrance where it is accessible via cab or private car. Either way you come or go, each section will have its own beauty to be explored."
,,Busy but well worth the visit,5.0,,"There is an MRT by 1 entrance and on the guide it says that Orchard Rd MRT is the closest to the other entrance. Be warned you need to take a bus to get to those MRT! This is easily done but the buses are rammed I have never seen quite as many people crammed onto a bus since Vietnam! Plenty of places to get a bite to eat not exactly cheap though, then everywhere seems a tad pricey these days for us Brits."
,,My favourite garden in Singapore,5.0,,"The Botanic Garden is so near to Orchard Road and the city but the moment you stepped in you felt like you are in a different world, perhaps some tropical forest somewhere in a rural area.

I had enjoyed the evening stroll, looking at the orchids, the mature trees or just people watching. Time slowed down when you're in the garden.

If you are traveling to Botanic Garden by public transport, the Botanic Garden MRT station (Circle Line) is right at the door step (Bukit Timah Road).

However if you are traveling by bus from Orchard Road, I will suggest that you take the bus that stops at Napier Road and enter via Napier Road / Holland Road Gate. That is a more convenient route."
,,Great place for taking great nature shots,5.0,,A great place to take the edge of hours of shopping in Orchard (you can get there by walking). You can spot lots of wild life wandering around the place. Make sure you take a walk into the orchid garden - amazing collection of orchids there. Very family friendly and not too heavy on the pockets. Try to go on a cool day - take hat/umbrella - sun might be harsh at some spots.
,,Makes Kew gardens look like an amateur project,5.0,,I have been lucky enough to visit about 30 major gardens around Europe and England. This one leaves the rest wanting. The sculptures are just beautiful and all over the gardens.
,,Don't miss this attraction!,5.0,,"These beautiful botanic gardens are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a must-see. Go early in the morning when it is still relatively cool and stay for a few hours, although they are open from 5 a.m. to 12 midnight every day of the year. If at all possible, try to visit the orchid garden first,before tour buses start rolling in around mid-morning.

The botanic gardens are laid out nicely (started back in 1859!) so it appears that they cover a much larger space than the 82 hectares, about half the size of Central Park in NYC. Most of the vegetation is tropical, although they also have a desert garden. Some of the mature trees are over 100 years old and 50 feet or more in height. A few are over 250 years old. I have been in botanic gardens in many countries, but in typical Singapore fashion this garden is spotlessly clean.

The largest attraction in the park is the incredible orchid garden with an amazing collection of orchids of every possible color. There is also a splendid bromeliad collection within the orchid garden. The orchid garden is the only place that requires an entrance fee, and it also has a lovely gift shop.

Bring a bottle of water. You can refill it in the orchid garden gift shop."
,,Lovely Gardens,5.0,,"Take a couple of hours and browse through these beautifully layed out gardens, definitely worth a visit while in Singapore"
,,A worthy visit,5.0,,"Have been coming here recently, and it's always nice to explore new corners of the garden. It is so big and constantly in renewal, there is always something new to explore!"
,,Always very nice,5.0,,"My favorite botanical garden. I have been here three times. And every time I discover something new. The trees are wonderful, but the Orchids Garden is the absolutely best"
,,Great place,5.0,,"For lover of flower and nature in general. The orchid garden is a must see!!! Though a bit outside the center it is highly recommended to visit the botanical garden.
Aroumd rhe lake watch out for lizards...up to 1m in length!
And dont miss Gardens at the Bay!!!"
,,Great walk with the family,5.0,,Nice walk in a very tranquille environment. You can spend hours in the garden. It is huge. We will come back.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,These gardens are absolutely fantastic. Wonderful maintained. The variety of plants is huge. The orchid gardens are a must to visit and need time to view. The pathways are all in great condition and make the gardens wheelchair friendly. Would recommend a visit but don't rush it.
,,beautiful orchids,5.0,,Never visit Singapore without visiting these beautiful gardens. The orchids are so beautiful and the gardens perfectly laid out and maintained.
,,Spectacular Gardens and free too!,5.0,,"I love these gardens - there are plenty of open lawns, miles of paths, shady areas with benches, gazebos, and more.

It is much like a Central Park, with many joggers, folks with dogs, families with children, and touring groups. Even on a weekend it doesn't feel crowded, since the park is so large.

The flora is primarily native and is mature and well-maintained.

There is an MRT stop right by the park, so you can easily get to the garden from nearly any location in Singapore.

One of the top places to visit in Singapore, for sure."
,,Walk for hours,4.0,,"The botanic gardens are another free and beautiful thing to do in Singapore. There are lots of little subsections to the gardens, a bonsai tree section, a rainforest section, a ginger section, an orchid section, and many more. Everything is well mapped out so you know where you are going.
There is a pond where I saw huge monitor lizards swimming in the water, and little ones digging in the leaves. There were other birds and lizards that I saw as well.
Bring water and snacks, as the restaurants and shops in the park are expensive and not that great, in my opinion."
,,EXCEPTIONAL!,5.0,,This is a must visit destination if in Singapore. Would recommend visiting early in the day as it gets very busy by late morning and it is a little cooler and allow two or three hours to enjoy especially the orchids which are fantastic.
,,Regular gardens with a few little gems.,4.0,,"The garden are very beautiful and immaculately maintained. However; they are not really different from any other nations version.

I spent four or so hours wandering the grounds.

The National Orchid Gardens ($5 entry fee) was the best part and well worth the money.

The Gardens are right next to the Botanical Gardens MRT station so they are easy to get to."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Nice garden with an incredible flowers and trees selection. The access is free in the main garden around the lakes etc , only some particular places like orchids garden have payed access 5 dollars by adult."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Excellent in the midst of the city. I would choose the botanic gardens over Gardens by the Bay, any day. Would've spent longer, but the rain threatened & came down quite a bit. Quite a few walks and ""gardens"", including a national orchard garden (SGD5 adult entrance fee). Came across quite a few restaurants also. Only downside was the extremely long wait for a taxi."
,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,"Spent a lovely afternoon walking through the gardens. The Orchid Gardens which is has an admission fee,was a real highlight."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are huge and beautifully laid out. There are a wide range of different areas to visit and enjoy, including the Orchid Garden. It is so large that you never feel crowded. We visited for almost 2 hours which is long enough in the heat, but you would need far longer to see it all, so it easily allows a number of visits to fully explore all it has to offer."
,,"Very big garden, you can spend the whole day here to relax",4.0,,"The garden is very big, you can spend the whole day there to relax. The entrance is free, one small part of the garden is 5$. Be sure to have 2 or 3 hours available to visit it."
,,A wander in the gardens and the Orchid Garden,4.0,,"Free to enter the gardens and a small price to enter the Orchid area, but well worth it. This is a clean, beautifully maintained and seemingly ever flowering spectacle. A myriad of flowering orchids of all shapes, colours and sizes. Meandering paths. Pleasant vistas. Peaceful places to sit and contemplate. And the cafe was fine too."
,,Lovely nature,5.0,,Peace peace peace. This is what I felt when I was here. The environment very clean. That why so many people came here for a picnic. Spend wonderful time and enjoy the nature here guys.
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,We only paid a short visit as part of City Tour and would love to go back and wander through the gardens.
,,tropical paradise,5.0,,"These are the best gardens we have been to. As all things in Singapore it is meticulously designed and very well maintained. The orchid gardens are a must see, so many varieties & the colours are amazing. It would be easy to spend 3 to 4 hours at the gardens and it is accessed by the very efficient MRT with the station right at the entrance."
,,A wonderland,5.0,,So well maintained. So diverse. What a pleasure. Hard to top this beautiful place. A real wonderland. Don't miss this treasure.
,,Beautiful Expansive Gardens,5.0,,One of the most beautiful collection of gardens I've ever visited. Had lunch in one of the restaurants (The Halla) which was lovely. Definitely a treat all around.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"These gardens are lovely and there is no charge to go in, a lot of walking around lakes but all on good footpaths."
,,Orchid section is stunning,5.0,,"Due to the high humidity we didn't get to visit all of these gardens, but the orchid section is a must see. Lots of different colours and sights, the orchids are rotated through what is flowering at the time. There were a number of schools visiting at the same time, but generally the area is big enough for all, definitely a must see if you are into plants."
,,Hidden Gems,5.0,,"It is sheer bliss to walk around this beautiful gardens. Well maintained, the gardens are spread over a huge area. Involves a lot of walking around so be sure to wear comfortable footwear. Not to be missed is a visit to the National Orchid Garden which requires a entrance fee to be paid. Couple of hours required to leisurely walk around the place. Limited food options are available. Proper Signage's are present but sometimes it gets a bit confusing"
,,Learning Forest is a real treat,5.0,,"We read in NZ before our trip to Singapore that the Botanical Gardens had recently opened a new tropical forest area called The Learning Forest - what an experience. The gardens are very easy to get to via very reasonable taxis and the gardens are free to enter. The new Learning Forest is amazing and includes many tropical jungle trees, flora and fauna including an amazing array of butterflies and birds. On the day we visited a photography club was there trying to ""capture"" pictures of a rare Sun Bird. Best to visit early morning of a clear Singapore day as the temperature rises from 11.30am. A must visit while in Singapore."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,This place is very relaxing. Lots to see and do. There is a large grass area where you kids and run around and sometimes you can see lizards wondering around. You can buy food and a sitting area. Dogs are permitted.
,,It is gorgeous!,5.0,,My friends live in walking distance of the gardens so I visit every time I go and see them. I always love walking around the gardens and seeing what new elements or exhibitions are currently on.
,,Tropical flora and fauna,5.0,,O' yes very nice to get some sweet smells and to see some green tropical flora and fauna. You must see the Orchids !
,,Breakfast and walk the dog,5.0,,Great eatery at the Botanic Garden (Casa Verde) with nice ambient listening to the sound of water fountain. Perfect place to walk the dog after sumptuous meal and enjoy the botany in the surrounding of the Garden.
,,Loved the Botanic Gardens BUT,4.0,,"We visited the Gardens really to see the orchids but the grounds are extensive and wanted to check out more, especially the fragrant garden but the signage directions were non existent and we never found it. Meant to go back as we'd run out of time but other attractions took over. The floating band stand has to be seen. Lots of water and shade about which made the gardens feel cool."
,,Large and quiet garden area,5.0,,"These are very large gardens, with many trees to see rather than flowers. Everything is spotless, and beautifully looked after. Well signposted."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"Went with my wife and loved the almost 6 hours we spent there. The best place to spend a day (well this one and Gardens by the Bay). The spaces are beautiful, Orchid Garden is a blast and even if you are not a huge fan of plants, you will love this place. So peaceful, so much variety. Totally recommended."
,,Too much walking for me!,4.0,,"This place is huge but all the same beautiful! Loads to see wear comfy shoes! It will get hot so be aware and prepare! There's a little jungle path too! Worth checking that out!

Free entry only place you pay is at the orchid garden which is well worth $5.

We ate at a place called Halia and wow I would definitely recommend you eat there!"
,,very good place to visit,5.0,,"such a good and pleasant place to visit in Singapore.There're many big trees which you can lay down under their shade and enjoy with nature among yourself.There's a music in the park on sat-sun in the evening which was very good activity that people can gather with each other.Moreover,this place you don't need to pay any fee,all area are free except orchid garden that you have to pay for more SGD 5"
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,Went here to run as our hotel is nearby. Such a beautiful place. Very relaxing. I would love to visit again and again.
,,"Coulorful,clean and easy walking",5.0,,The place was a little tricky to get to. Pretty place to walk around. Lots of space for my kids to run around and explore. Was reallly colorful. Not many food outlets to get into wothout waiting though.
,,You are not going to see a bigger and more diverse Botanical Garden anywhere else,5.0,,"Wear comfortable shoes and get ready to sweat a little, of course don't forget your water. The garden is beautiful, diverse and you can spend the whole day there if you enjoy taking pictures."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The orchids are gorgeous. Every kind of orchid imaginable. Even has the rare fragrant varieties. Not a place for children unless they enjoy plants. Nice casual leisurely place to wonder around and enjoy the beauty. Not to be confused with Gardens by the Bay which is on the other side of town
,,Good place to excercise and walk around in fresh air greenery,5.0,,"I visited the park few times a week for morning walk, the garden is clean and fresh. The scenery is good and attractive to explore."

,,A stunning tropical garden,5.0,,"You would never believe that you were so close to the centre of Singapore. This is a wonderful place to visit and has been described as Asia's Best Urban Jungle. There is an enormous number of specimens on display as well as plenty of opportunity to see birds and wildlife. You'll need to set aside plenty of time to do the gardens properly, including the various themed gardens - the ginger garden, the healing garden, the fragrant garden, the foliage garden etc and not forgetting the incredible National Orchid Garden which has over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids - the largest display of orchids in the world. The gardens are open from 5am to midnight. Entrance is free but there is a $5 fee to see the orchid garden."
,,Nature lover's delight,4.0,,A scenic place to take a nice afternoon stroll and immerse yourself in nature. You can truly get lost walking around the gardens. Do check out the Orchid garden and forest walk. Try to spot the monitor lizard in the swan lake. Also keep a look out for red jungle fowl and monitor lizards that walk around the gardens.
,,A perfect workout on a Sunday,5.0,,Very big place with a lot of sceneries. Excellent place on a cloudy day. Worst when visiting on a hot sunny day. Very neatly maintained and the transportation available at the entrance is a plus. Better to spray musquito repellent while visiting this place.
,,Singapore botanic gardens,5.0,,"Give yourself plenty of time in these gardens. These are the original gardens and should not be missed. They are calming and tranquil. Look out for the knit or lizards, harmless as long as you don't get too near them or provoke them."

,,Lovely and extensive gardens.,5.0,,This is a nice and relaxing place to visitif you don't mind walking and its free. Pay a little and visit the Orchid Gardens. It is well worth it. We saw lots of wildlife here as well as the great trees and flowers.
,,Suitable for Exercise,4.0,,"Wear your exercise outfit to this garden since its' had tracks for jogging and rest area in open spaces. It's also good for family recreation. Go there in the morning or afternoon, since it will be quite hot on noon (10am-2pm)."
,,A place you can visit again and again.,5.0,,The best thing about the botanic gardens is that you see something new each time you visit. Friends and I often go walking in the gardens during the week. If you are visiting Singapore and a place to walk it does not get any better than this.
,,Good for relaxing stroll,5.0,,"A very refreshing place in the middle of busy city like Singapore. Once you're inside, it's very peaceful and calm. You can walk as short or as far as you like. Nice restaurants and coffee shop inside."
,,Amazing Gardens Lived up to Expectations,5.0,,Along with Raffles Hotel this was a must see on my Singapore stopover and it didn't disappoint. Allow at least half a day but could easily take longer if a warm day and a few refreshment breaks. So many beautiful areas to wander and good range of places to eat/drink. Just loved it and will definitely return.
,,Great place to enjoy nature and have a picnic/stroll,5.0,,"I see a lot of travellers when I visit Botanic Gardens. Check out orchids, herbs and stroll through different themed landscapes like the herb gardens."
,,GORGEOUS COLOURS,5.0,,Orchids are stunning and this is a great place to visit during the heat of the day. Some areas and pathways slightly on an incline but you can just take time and wander.

,,Enchanting!,5.0,,"I love taking a slow walk through the Botanic Gardens, this really is a special place nestled close to the Singapore CBD. The array of flora is amazing and there are lots of interesting birds, butterflies and I even saw a very large monitor lizard!"
,,Nice to visit in the early morning or late afternoon,4.0,,"Too hot to visit during the day time. Besides that, I strongly recommend this place for the walk and chat with your beloved people. Enjoy."
,,Garden in the City,5.0,,"Right outside Orchard Road with easy access by train and bus, with a wide variety of trees. Walk on the newly open board walk to enjoy the fresh air and views from a different angle, have fun at the Giants kids and adults. Highly recommended for visitors and locals, family with young children, friends (to exercise) and there are nice eateries too."
,,"Ingress/Egress. Visitors, even local needs information for pleasant visit.",3.0,,"I am local and stay round the corner from the Gardens. Management of the Gardens should really look into how to make our visit pleasant.
Brought my friends from overseas. Singnage leading to entrance very poor and misleading. Management should look into directions form and to the various entrances.
Very long walk and not enough help from park personell.
On that particular visit, I finally met a very kind park officer who instructed the buggy driver to send us out seek the taxi. Thank goodness for that.
It has been nearly a year and sad to say things have not changed. I was there just yesterday. Still the same old problem. Someone should really look into this.
The MRT and other construction work does not help. In the meantime, temporary measures should be made to make visits pleasant and not a hassle.
This is my personal observation and I feel it needed exposure for visitors and management. April 2017"
,,Tropical gardens,3.0,,Good place to rest and recreated yourself in this garden even it was located in city center.Quite and peaceful place. Of course there has a lot of flowers and trees.
,,Haven,5.0,,"We discovered something new each visit, whether it was a new plant or a monitor lizard or a new dish to eat at the café. The seasonal rotating exhibits were sometimes a dreamy wonder, such as the retro lawn swings in the Frangipani Orchard... ah, so wonderful."
,,DELIGHTFUL ORCHID GARDEN,5.0,,The Orchid Garden inside the Botanic Gardens is a wonderful assault on all the senses. The Botanic Gardens are an experience not to be missed.
,,A Singapore Gem.,5.0,,"Enjoy a relaxing walk around some of these beautiful gardens for a few hours.
Be sure to visit the orchid garden. I bought a Vanda 'Miss Joaquim' culture in a small bottle in their shop, also known as the Singapore orchid. I followed thier instructions and it's doing very well here back home."
,,Orchid garden,4.0,,It's a beautiful garden to visit. Although on a hot day it's very uncomfortable because of all the walking it takes about 2hrs to see the whole place. Beautiful pics.
,,Great Place for Kids to Enjoy,4.0,,"The garden is quite huge and spread across. The first time we visited we entered from the entrance next to Bukit Timah Station. This entrance is easily accessible from the MRT. Its a nice place to walk around, sit and relax or jog around the track.
The part where my son enjoys the most is Jacob Ballas Children Garden. You can walk to the Children's Garden from Bukit Timah Entrance, but its quite a walk. So we usually take a cab to the entrance of the Jacob Ballas. The entrance is free. There is a water play area and also sand section with big slides. My 4 year old boy can easily play for 2-3 hours in the garden. Its a great place for the family to enjoy and relax."
,,Nature in the heart of a garden.,4.0,,"The meandering foot paths lead you through various different types of vegatation. Flowering trelleses for that romantic moment or watching the majestic swans move effortless on one of the numerous small lakes. Bring an umbrella to ward off the sun as you will want to make this trip last once you see what is hidden inside the gates. Oh and bring your camera and the kids, you won't regret it."
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,We loved walking through the gardens beautiful and well kept The variety of trees and plans are amazing Suitable for family and picnics
,,Great place to take a break or exercise,4.0,,"The park is free so you can pop in for a quick walk, take a jog, walk the dog or have a picnic. It's also open well into the evening with lighted pathways.

NOTE - the restaurants are good as well and the gift shop has some nice items."
,,It is an escape from concrete jungle,4.0,,"You can reach this place by MRT (Bukit Timah station) or bus. This place is huge garden dividen into various specialty garden with Orchid garden as its main attraction. The entrance to this botanical garden is free (Orchid garden has SGD5 ticket). You can bring your pets or try jogging around the track. It is beautiful and also there is hardly any bugs around. There is a lot of photo spots as well. However, use your walking shoes since the walking distance will be very long and tiring. Make sure you have your baby pram or wheelchair if you bring your children or elderlies."
,,Time in transit made easy,5.0,,"This was a cheap, effective way to move around Singapore. An amazing system which was well organized, clean, safe and everyone knows the rules. Remember to offer your seat to someone who needs it more...."
,,It's nice but I would not recommend it to friends or family,2.0,,It was nice. I can appreciate the effort they put in to the gardens. But they are not anything I can really write about. I would definitely go to gardens by the bay over this. I have been to beautiful botanical gardens over Australia and they are 10 times more exciting then the Singapore botanic gardens.
,,A great place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,You can experience and see all exotic plants here. Its a must visit place for every traveler visiting Singapore
,,Very Nice Garden,5.0,,We visited it on our way to Orchirds Garden and this garden is pretty huge. There are so many attractions inside.
,,Beautiful!!!!,5.0,,Couldn't get enough of this place I spent a whole day here admiring the well thought out plant placement and experiences at each of the different parts of the park. It rained the whole time and I still stayed for 4.5 hours just taking my time admiring the landscapes. Highly suggest and very accessible for all!!!
,,Beautiful and huge garden,5.0,,Be prepared to walk a 1.3 km if coming by metro and want to get to the orchid or ginger gardens. The park is free with the exception of the two gardens just mentioned. I visited the orchid one and it is beautiful and very peaceful. It gets very hot so an early visit may be better. The park is very beautiful series of gardens and does not feel crowded. It is a stop of the hop on hop off tour but beware they only take Singaporean cash.
,,Stunning national orchid garden,5.0,,"We stopped here on a city tour. Only a short stop, but the orchid gardens are simply stunning. Could have stayed all day."
,,Foc Attraction,5.0,,"Title says it all.. Its a public space which is fairly large, able to spend at least 1 hour/ an hour and a half here taking photos, enjoying the view and feeling the breeze. Check out the plant species and prepare a basket to picnic if you would like and head over down Orchard road just a kilometer west by foot after for a delicacy of your choice for lunch or dinner. Another touristy area worthy of our mention and visit. And did I mention I once spotted Peter Lim, one of Singapore's Richest Billionaire jogging along over at the Botanic Gardens ?"
,,My santuary,5.0,,"To have a nature shower, wash away all the negative energy of the week. Botanic gardens does that for me. There a section of pristine forest that you can walk through, a performance arena, children's section..."
,,Free admission,5.0,,"You can enter for free and stroll thru the Botanic Garden. They only charge a small amount for the Orchid Garden. Get you cash ready, because they only accept credit-cards for more than SGD 20"
,,Huge botanic garden with exciting themes,5.0,,"Probably you need a full day to discover the whole garden, but it was also very interesting to stroll around for just some hours seeing different types of plants and getting to know about their use. Just the Orchid Garden has an entrance fee which is worth it to spend."
,,Wonderful botanical gradens,5.0,,"Visiting Singapore? The Singapore botanical gardens should definitely be on your to do list, the gardens are beautiful."
,,Nice Garden,5.0,,We had great time here to take some photos and little bit work out as we walking around almost half of the garden and coming back to main gate total maybe around 4 km? Unsure. But very recommended to visit here.
,,Orchids,5.0,,What a wonderful place to visit especially if you love gardens and orchids. They are everywhere you walk along the guided path plenty of opportunities to take photos shop outside is nice as well especially on a warm day when you need a cold drink the price to get into orchid garden very reasonable $10
,,You should Visit,4.0,,It was a very hot day when we were here. But we saw amazing orchids and the gardens are beautifully laid out. Information center on entering were extremely helpful.
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,Superb botanic gardens. The Orchid Garden is an absolute must. The grounds are so well maintained. Hard to believe that entry is free (except for a nominal charge for the Orchid Garden). Beautiful location for weddings
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Well worth a visit to this beautiful garden in central Singapore. Variety of plants is impressive and the orchid garden was worth paying for
,,Not your average park,5.0,,"Very well designed garden park full of interesting collection of tropical plants. One day is not enough to see all the exhibits but that gives you a lot of reasons to come back and best of all it is free. It is a very functional garden park with lots of walking paths, man-made lake with an open auditorium for special occasions. We took a short cut at Cluny Rd where the opulent people live and it is nice to see architect designed residences and manicured gardens."
,,A beautiful place!,5.0,,"Just saw its name in the MRT map and not aware of it, got curious and went there. Just use the connecting trains and platforms of the Singapore MRT and you will get there! Unluckily was able to take photos as my cp went empty battery. The MRT to alight is also named as Botanic Gardens."
,,Fantastic day out,5.0,,"The Botanic gardens can be a full day out if you want it to be. So wear something suitable to walk in because the gardens are huge and you will be walking for hours if you want to make the most of it. I walked for 4 hours and loved it. So much to see and I didn't pay a penny. Lots of great photo opportunities. The rainforest was particularly good for spotting wildlife, so keep your eyes out. Maybe bring a picnic to sit and relax with in the middle of all the walking."
,,Great Way to Spend a Couple of Hours.,5.0,,"Superb gardens, very relaxing. We took 2 hours and you could easily spend more if you love tropical plants. The Ginger garden is very memorable. Good cafes available near the Orchid Garden."
,,Singapore botanical gardens,5.0,,"The botanic gardens are a beautiful and enchanting place to see the cultyral flower of Singapore, the Orchard.
With bubbling water features and easy access for wheelchairs. Book a guided tour for the best information then botanic gardens are all topped off by visiting the gift shop."
,,This is a must when here - the Orchid Garden alone is fantastic!,5.0,,"This place costs nothing to enter - they are pricey for drinks and food, so don't get them here - it will cost you $5 for the entrance to the Orchid Garden, but well worth it. A side note, you can only go in the dangerous plant area in the healing garden with a tour guide."
,,The Orchid Garden is not to be missed!,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens in Singapore is an easy train ride on the blue/Downtown line. The park is simply Fantastic yet our favorite was the Orchid Garden. Seeing this beauty of a flower in so many colors snd species was truly a feast for the eyes!
The Botanic Gardens are free, but there was a small charge for the Orchid Garden and well worth the small fare."
,,Beautiful space,4.0,,We only touched on the Botanical Gardens as we were visting the Orchid Gardens but what a wonderful green space and all free right in the heart of the city. Would have liked to have been here much longer.
,,UNESCO World Heritage sight -MUST SEE,5.0,,"Perfect for picnics, perfect for a first date, perfect for dogs, perfect for young children. Lots to see, lots of green spaces to sit down and enjoy the sun. Just such an enchanting garden."
,,A calm surprise in the middle of town,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a stunning, calm oasis in the middle of bustling Singapore. Lush and green and perfectly manicured, it's a beautiful vista of lawns & lakes and separate garden areas.
A UNESCO World Heritage site, it's definitely worth a couple of hours of your time. It's also free unless you wish to visit the National Orchid Garden which has a nominal ($5) entry fee."
,,Haven of peace but close to city centre,5.0,,Beautiful peaceful gardens within walking distance of the city centre but can also accessed by the MRT. Paths are clearly marked and there is a visitor centre with light food and drinks available. Singapore's National Orchid Gardens are also accessed from the visitor centre and well worth a visit. The Botanic Gardens are free to enter and when I was there so was the Orchid Gardens.
,,So much to see,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Garden was awarded UNESCO.
It is a beautiful place to while the afternoon away.
So many beautiful plants, the place is managed well and it's free for all except if you want to visit the orchid room.
It cost $5 for entry but it is worth your money.
So many different type of orchids named after famous people.
They are air conditioned souvenir shops to take the heat off while shopping.
Places to eat.
The swan lake is very beautiful.
Highly recommended if you love plants or just live walking in very tranquil surroundings."
,,Tranquility Amid The Bustle,5.0,,"For those times when the hectic pace of Singapore gets just too much. a day wandering slowly an peacefully around the botanic gardens is just what is needed. Beautifully maintained and a living encyclopedia of flora (and some fauna). Chill, stroll, relax, enjoy and maybe even learn a little if you so desire."
,,Wonderful free park,5.0,,There is so much to see and do throughout the Gardens. There are a wide range of habitats and also the Orchid Gardens and all so close to the City Centre. The cafe I visited was great and it's easy to pick up drinks as you walk around. There is also a free app to help you find your way around the different trails.
,,Fabulous place with many views and shady resting places,5.0,,"We visited in the heat of the midday sun but found shade when needed. The 2k round trip to see the orchids was well worth it. There is a small fee to get in but don't miss them they are amazing.

We loved everything about this place where we saw birds, turtles and lizards in the wild. Beautifully maintained and easy to get around with plenty of disabled access (not that we needed that but I always like to see a garden inclusive of everyone regardless of their nobility).

I would return to these gardens when next in Singapore!"
,,Very good site for walking!!,4.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens are very old and big gardens close to Orchard Road. It's consists of variety of different gardens - Orchid, Ginger, Learning, Swan Lake and many more. Different parts of the gardens looks completely different. There is nothing so extremely outstanding about these gardens, but it's free of charge (except Orchid Garden), beautiful and very well maintained. Highly recommended for quality family time, kids and sport activities!"
,,Best Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"We spent several hours at the gardens, there are many walkways with a lot of shade (needed because it was very hot!) The gardens are beautiful, with many pieces of sculpture throughout. It can be reached easily by the Hop On Hop Off bus."
,,Fabulous place to visit with children,5.0,,"We were in the Botanic Gardens today and it was a beautiful place to visit, even with small children.
Big variety of Flora and even a bit if fauna as we saw different birds, fish, turtles and a nice large Waran if about 1 m size.
Very recommendable to spend a morning there and disconnect from City life."
,,Nice place for relax,5.0,,"Beautiful garden full of picnic spots, palm valleys, orchard gardens and calming places for relax. I can recommend to use the hop-on-hop-off bus to reach is as the garden is bit far away from the centre."
,,Quiet in the frenetic pace of Singapore.,5.0,,Walked from one end to the other but would have preferred to potter. The Orchidarium was a delight and we would go back again.
,,A place where you can spend your whole day,5.0,,This place has multiple entry gates and quite a huge in size. There so many variety of plants and tress you would love watching them. This place has a restaurant and a resort in the middle. Different kind of water falls and rocks.
,,Scenic in the City,4.0,,"Hard to believe a bustling metropolis like Singapore can afford so much land for these outstanding gardens, and an absolute must see. Easy to spend much if not all of your day here. Easy walking but can be long distances depending which gate you arrive and which specialty gardens you want to see. Free to enter, but the stores charge a bomb for water and drinks. We especially enjoyed the orchid garden ($5 Singapore $$ to enter)."
,,Calming experience,4.0,,"Nice garden easily accessible by MRT, perfect for a quiet, calming walk among the plants. The café inside (Bees Knees) also has an offer giving the materials for a pic nic, which seems a cool idea but we did not test due to a sudden rain."
,,My Number 1 attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are my favourite place to visit in Singapore. I would recommend a morning MRT ride to the Botanic Gardens station, then walk through the gardens downhill towards the Tanglin Road gate, from where you could catch a cab to Dempsey Hill for lunch, or it is a very short walk to the main road for buses to Orchard Road. The gardens are peaceful and well-developed. There are so many different aspects to explore that one visit won't be enough to experience it all. I'd recommend the Evolution Garden and the walk through the rainforest. We saw a pair of nesting hornbills just off the path that enters the rainforest just past the Visitors Centre. There are plenty of good quality centres for resting with a drink or a snack, and the shop at the Visitors Centre is excellent."
,,Happily Lost,4.0,,"I do not know if it is intentional or not but the signage in the Singapore Botanical Gardens is terrible. The map looks easy but the signs don't always coincide with the maps and you see people at crossroads completely confused. It is an amazing place so I was happy to be lost and wander about. I have re-visited many times. The information plaques are very interesting. They have lots of activities going on and free tours. I would totally recommend a visit when in Singapore, especially the Rain forest trail and the National Orchid Garden trail."
,,Beauty in a tranquil setting,5.0,,We spent a whole afternoon walking around the gardens and wish we could have had more time to spend there. The gardens are beautiful and the number of different species of plants is astounding. We highly recommend the Botanic Gardens as a must visit when you are in Singapore.
,,Beautifully laid out gardens...,5.0,,"Lovely gardens. Full of wildlife too - we saw monitor lizards, turtles and hornbills. Paid extra for the orchids and was worth the 5 dollar. Perhaps a bit too manicured but this is Singapore. Decent cafe."
,,Chilled and beautiful,4.0,,Great afternoon spent in this botanic garden. The place is really big and it takes a long time to go around. Shame there was no concert on the day I visit as I would have been lovely to see something on the stage.
,,Surprised how good,4.0,,Hab3 been to singapre many times. A local friend took us and it turned out to be delightful. The orchid garden is a highlight. A great place to take a stroll.
,,Wonderful way to spend a few hours.,5.0,,Since Singapore is such a vibrant bustling city we found a free walking tour of the gardens a beautiful change. We booked a free Heritage walking tour on line and were escorted by a very knowlegable mature lady who moved at a cracking pace and filled us with a huge amount of information. We had our own personal guide which was lovely. The gardens are beautiful and well worth a visit .
,,One of the best horticulture displays I have seen,5.0,,"The flowers and plants were beautiful. There were two younger travelers and they were not all that excited, but I thourghly enjoyed every minute. I guess these sort of sites are enjoyed by the older crowd. They claim there are more than 10,000 types of plants. The Orchids were spectacular. If not a lover of beautiful plants and flowers then perhaps your time would be better spend some places else. I would return and I think enjoy it as much as this visit."
,,Singapore Botanical Gardens,5.0,,It was a good trip. All plants well labelled and maintained well. The orchidarium was simply superb.
,,Relaxing stroll,5.0,,"Lovely, well laid out gardens with extensive walks through excellent botanical specimens. The orchid garden is a delight too. Pleasantly surprised by the monitor lizard and catfish in the lake. Good to see Singapore residents enjoying the gardens too."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Stunning gardens well kept, eateries pump out some great food and quickly as it gets extremely busy, my one wish for watching some elderly is to have a golf buggy service for them"
,,A national treasure,5.0,,Well worth a visit or perhaps more appropriately several visits. Go early in the morning for maximum enjoyment.
,,Comfy shoes needed!,5.0,,"This is a vast area to walk! Wonderful colours and foliage. Look out for geckos, squirrels and birds. The main Gardens are free, only the Orchid Garden has an entrance fee which, for over 60s, was 1 S$. Make sure you use sun cream and take an umbrella for the sharp showers that can hit at any time."
,,Beautiful Gardens.,5.0,,We visited the botanical gardens combined with the orchid gardens. The botanic garden is just beautiful. there was so much to see and the whole experience was just exceptional. A must for anyone visiting Singapore.
,,Great gardens!,5.0,,"If you are even remotely into gardening you should see this wonder. Huge varieties of plants all arranged in a gorgeous setting, easily reached by the MRT. It has its own stop."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"We walked for miles through these beautiful gardens. There is so much to see, and everything is pristine. Don't miss the orchid collection."
,,The Best Place in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are into nature and history then there is no better place to spend some time than the Gardens. The place seems huge, especially given its downtown location, and is immaculately maintained. Now with the recent addition of the marsh forrest area there is even more to do and see. This is the perfect place for a tranquil wander to de-stress from the tourist traps. And best of all, entry is free!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Fantastic but prepare for the walking. Stopped at the bees knees for a drink, excellent cool lager after a long walk. Take your camera, lots of photo opportunities."
,,On our way to the National Orchid Garden,4.0,,"You need to walk across the Botanical Garden in order to get to the orchids. The Garden is a real delight with ponds, an infinite variety of trees and plants. Not to forget the wild life you might encounter."
,,Lovely for an evening stroll,5.0,,Wow this park is right by the MRT so unmissable and is a beautiful place for an evening stroll with restaurants inside and as with everything in Singapore safe and clean. I wonderful patch of nature in a busy city.
,,Great place for shirt or longer time visit,4.0,,"Spent a couple of hours on each day of our visit. Plenty to see, well laid out, accommodates all types. Lifts/escalators for people who struggle with stairs. Restaurants in the gardens, plenty of viewing platforms and places."
,,An Amazing Place For Tourists & Nature Lovers!,5.0,,"It's a must-visit place if you go to Singapore. There are so many different gardens (such as the Evolution Garden, the Rain Forest Garden, among others) to explore. But the National Orchid Garden, in my opinion, is the best among them all! Even if one is short on time, visiting the National Orchid Garden only (paid entry), will be an amazing experience and totally worth your time :)"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The botanic gardens in Singapore are a beautiful place to connect with nature :) Even though the place is really big, it is user friendly."
,,A great walk for some serenity out of the city,4.0,,"Could spend the best part of a day here if this type of thing is right up your alley. Free to enter, stunning. A lot of different areas to see. Includes the National Orchid inside which attracts a fee of $5 adult and $1 for 60 yrs and over. Definitely worth it. Nice way to spend time out of the bustling city without going too far. Take some lunch or places to eat are there."
,,Trees and Orchids,5.0,,"The tropical foliage is mesmerizing. The facility is well-maintained, and the trees almost compare to the botanical gardens in Rio De Janero. The orchid collection is one of the best anywhere. Do not miss these orchids! Drink plenty of water as it is a steam bath, even for visitors from Miami. Senior admission is a bargain at one dollar for 60 plus. Regular adults pay $5."
,,Amazing,5.0,,It's my second time to explore the Singapore Botanic Gardens but I am still amazed at the lush greens. Best to explore late in the afternoon or very early in the morning for it gets pretty hot mid afternoon
,,Incredible gardens,5.0,,Went on a business trip and stayed in a hotel close by the gardens. Went for an early morning run to the gardens. It is quite large and really beautiful with a lake and orchid garden (entrance fee of $5). Do not miss the orchid garden when you go. You can do a quick trip or longer visit; depends on your time available. A visit including the orchid garden can take up to 90 mins if done at medium leisure.
,,Like Heaven,5.0,,If you are a gardener like me this is like Heaven so many plants and flowers it will leave you with a smile on your face!
,,Well worth a visit.,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens. Very clean and well looked after. Garden is split into several areas, all very colourful. The gardens are free to visit but there is a smalll charge for the orchid garden. Well worth seeing."
,,A nice relaxing walk after a long flight,4.0,,"Nice relaxing walking in the gardens and a cool drink at Bees Knees was a nice way to chill out after a long flight, Turtles and monitor lizards were a highlight for our 5 year old. Was a bit hot and humid but was located right by the SMRT so was a easy trip back to our accomadation."
,,Very nice Gardens,4.0,,Everything is clean There is a big variety of plants Plants are named and described There are theme-ways as eg evolution path
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"Such a good opportunity to move from all the city noise and enjoy the nature. There are many interesting things to see, especially for someone who is not from around here and has never came across with this type of vegetation. The place is very clean and big, filled with cheerful people who instantly put you in a good mood as well."
,,a real getaway that one forgets it's part of a highly urbanised setting.,5.0,,"go early before the sun comes up.you'll bump into solitary joggers ,couples walking together and any number of exercise freaks almost daily . great spot to bring children there too.and it's so peaceful and quiet. splendid place."
,,"A beautiful, tranquil oasis",5.0,,"Have been here many times. Huge trees, giant lizards, lots of space to play with kids and pets, and great food. We always eat here. At the up market restaurant Halia, or the middle segment pasta/pizza place. I also always see many joggers. If you live or are visiting Singapore, a must see."
,,Amazing plant life.,5.0,,"We ran out of time at the gardens, so make sure you allow at least 4 hours plus travelling. Spectacular plants and many varieties of orchids. Take plenty of water with you. Lots of walking involved."
,,Good Place To Mingle With Locals,4.0,,"We went there in the morning and had a good time mingling with the locals who were walking their dogs, jogging, and playing about in the fields. Has some great themed areas in the gardens and is a great place to go in the mornings before it gets too hot."
,,Well with a visit,5.0,,"Although it was very hot and humid we walked around the gardens and were so impressed with everything there. The orchid house and ginger garden were particularly good and the facilities were what you expect in Singapore, spotlessly clean. A beautiful place to spend a day."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful walk. Nice to watch squirrels monitor lizards and pretty birds. Nice and relaxing. Could spend a few hours here as lots to see.
,,A nature lovers garden of choice,5.0,,"If you like nature then this is the place to visit. Come here and visit the natures splendour and the diversity at its best. The greenery is so soothing to the eye and the diversity simply bowls you over. There is also the orchard garden with a small entry fee of $5.
If all this excursion makes you feel hungry then outside the garden one can find the food stalls"
,,Nice garden,4.0,,Take a walk at the early morning that you can breathe the fresh air. The swan lake is a best place to take pictures. Yet you need to wait for the two pretty swans come put.
,,Can't say enough about this awesome place!,5.0,,In StLouis we have the most versatile and best gardens in the world. One of them is in a round glass dome called the Climatron which houses tropical plants from all over the world and to experience tropical without a dome over me....Awesome!! I absolutely loved the Ginger gardens/ Healing gardens and the Frangiapani trees. The Lifeless Earth exhibition was a great experience on how this earth was before green growth.Our Evolution of the history of plants was fantastic.We could hv spent a whole week here....soooo much too see. Don't miss it!!!
,,"Amazing,stunning, beautiful!",5.0,,Worth a visit if you have time. We had an exciting visit as a thunderstorm broke out while we were there. There's lots of work going on but this didn't deter us from a great visit. We only had a morning but I would happily have spent the day there.
,,Well worth seeing,4.0,,"We did not have time to cover every corner of the botanic gardens, and it was very hot, but we did cover the whole of the orchid gardens within them. These were very interesting and well kept. I was a little surprised that the orchid gardens themselves cover quite an area and only a small part is indoors."
,,Tranquil and beautiful.,5.0,,Very close to the busy city of Singapore is the Botanical gardens which is peaceful and tranquil. The gardens are meticulously cared for and managed with ample signage to allow you to meander from one area to the next. Although you do need to be prepared to walk a fair distance to enjoy the full expanse and variety of trees and flowers. It is a must place to visit when in Singapore.
,,A day in the nature,5.0,,"We absolutmy loved this place! Even it was hot, was so nice to spend the whole day in the nature admiring the plants and flowers and trees and what else! Really recommend and take time to go there!"
,,beatifuuuuuuuuuuul,5.0,,it's so much beautifull with good tips on every tree or flower or every things that you see in it really you don't want to leave but you should:))
,,Loved the trip. I enjoyed their local dish in casa verde called Mee Siam,5.0,,I enjoyed their local dish in casa verde called Mee Siam. I also enjoyed the view and greenery in the National Orchid Garden. The tour didn't take more than 3 hours and it was amazing! I hope to visit Singapore Botanic Gardens again in the future.
,,Great outdoor activity,5.0,,"Beautifully planned, meticulously maintained gardens. Do not miss the rain-forest walk, cool house and carnivorous plants."
,,Beautiful and serene,5.0,,"We had a lovely morning in the gardens. I recommend you make your way to the national orchid garden, if visiting the botanical gardens. There is a small entrance fee to the orchid garden, approximately $5 USD. There are restrooms and toilets in the orchid garden and a snack stand just outside of the gardens. They also have a nice gift shop that has air conditioning."
,,Escape the hustle and bustle,4.0,,"Escape the hustle and bustle of the city and find a shady spot to refresh, revive and restore your soul!"
,,Big beautiful peaceful and interesting,4.0,,"I visited the gardens on a quiet monday and what was meant to be a short ramble turned into an almost full day of exploration. The gardens are west of the city centre and are surrounded by busy roads and residential areas but feel like an entirely different place - peaceful, empty and relaxing. Though to visit all the different areas would possibly require more than a day you can get a very good idea of the variety of plants, flowers and environments just walking from the metro station entrance to the National Orchid Garden.
If you have a bit more time the sections I recommend are the Evolution Trail, the Healing Garden with its surprising collection of medical plants and the rain forest to try and spot the giant lizards.
And try to go early in the morning to avoid the humid heat."
,,One of the most beautiful gardens in Asia,4.0,,"A welcoming point of rest and nature in a busy city like Singapore. Beautiful gardens with a wide variety of flowers, plants and trees. Undoubtedly one of the best botanical gardens in Asia.

,,spectacular oasis in bustling Singapore,5.0,,"Beautiful, spectacularly designed garden. The walks, ponds (check out Swan Lake, ) orchids, trees - all of it beautiful and redolent. It was a crazy hot day and we saw signs for the cold room (actually about the plants, not the people, but welcome nonetheless.) Sculptures worth seeing throughout. Fragrant and revitalizing. Decent restaurant in the gardens too. Totally worthwhile. Enjoy."
,,"Don't miss the Orchid Gardin, Must see",5.0,,It's a must see if you love nature. Amazing trees & the orchid garden was amazing. You could spend all day there. We did not have too much time we saw part of it.
,,UNESCO heritage gardens! That's pretty impressive,5.0,,"The gardens are arranged to be toured or strolled at your leisure. It is mostly free, except for a few attractions, like the orchid garden. A very worthwhile place to visit. Spend a morning or afternoon there."
,,a beautiful place ........,5.0,,On the last day of our SE Asia cruise we had the best part of a day to spend in Singapore before our night flight home. We decided to go to the Botanic Gardens which is a lovely way to spend some time. Entry to the gardens is free although there is a small charge to enter the orchid garden. Both are well worth visiting and gave us lovely last memories of Singapore.
,,A must go place for family and photographers,5.0,,A regular place for photo shoots .. wonderful location for family picnics .. lot of greenery and with its vastness a place for good exercise too!
,,nice place for picnic,5.0,,"Very big, clean, nice place for family picnic.

However, signs was confusing. Got lost finding the water splash playground for my baby. And we couldn't find the way out when it was dark. Accidentally found a restaurant inside the garden and ask the staff to call for a taxi and took us outside by some back gate."
,,beautiful gardens to visit,5.0,,"i travelled to the Botanical gardens by public transport, it is as all Botanicla gardnes very large, a lot of walking but also a lot to see, plenty of spots to sit and rest and take in the views of the trees and gardens and shrubs from all over the world. Take an unbrella and or poncho incase of rain and always water, stroller and wheelchair friendly also"
,,Skip Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Come here instead! Exploring the (free) Botanic Gardens are a wonderful way to pass an afternoon. Also worth visiting at a nominal fee is the National Orchard Garden. And Food Canopy provides a great and inexpensive lunch option-
,,Nice place for a couple of hours.,4.0,,There are plants and trees from all over the world. Most of them are exceptional. You can find a good cafe in nice atmosphere but very pricy.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We could stroll to the gardens from our hotel which took 10-15 minutes? We saw large lizards in the trees and swimming in the lake - small turtles in the lake and squirrels in trees. Highlight of the gardens would be the orchid garden - never seen so much variety of colour! Could easily spend a whole day looking around. Has playground for children and is wheelchair friendly. It's free to enter and does have restaurants if needed. There are recyclable maps or you can purchase a new one.
,,A must visit!,5.0,,My friend and I spent the day in the Botanical Gardens and enjoyed ourselves immensely. You should not leave Singapore without seeing all the varieties of plants and range of species of flowers! It was truly a highlight of our trip! The Lego plants were very creative.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"We were just looking for someplace to get out and walk and get some sunshine after our long flight over to Singapore. Wow, these gardens are beautiful. Do not miss!"
,,Wow....check out the Orchid Centre,5.0,,"We've visited lots of gardens and this is very certainly among the best. It's bigger then you'd think so make sure you have good shoes and try to aim for cooler part of the day. We didn't manage to see everything in the park, would probably take more than 3 hours to do it justice, but make sure you visit the Orchid Centre, you have to pay to go in, but it is wonderful..... don't decide between the Marina Gardens and the botanical gardens.... do both!"
,,Lovey this place,5.0,,I am sure there are many botanic gardens around the world that are lovely and chilling but after the hustle and bustle of Singapore life this is a super calm haven . It's such a tranquil place to go and is so so beautiful. Each path is an experience where you just walk into great surroundings. You have to do the orchid garden. I am not a mad lover of flowers but these are spectacular and you will see the most beautiful plants you will probably ever see. It's all free and for me a 'must' if you visit Singapore. My wife and I love this place.
,,Excellent! Beautiful !,5.0,,"Amazing botanical gardens right in the heart of Singapore. The orchids are beautiful, the lakes delightful particularly Swan lake with its sculptures. The grounds are clean and tidy. Were saddened to hear of the recent tragedy of the falling 200 year old tree."
,,Cannot believe I have never visited this place,5.0,,Having a few hours at hand waiting for the delayed doctor appointment at Gleneagles Hospital my feet took me to this serene and lush garden. It was so peaceful and calming few hours spent there. The shop by the Orchid Garden has little unique trinkets; a must visit.
,,So beautiful but so hot!,5.0,,Great morning out but factor in going back to your hotel to refresh. It was a drizzly morning which added to the humidity when I went and after walking 2 kms I was feeling exhausted and I am very fit! Take water and plan where you will enter and exit the park first. I walked from the MRT to the orchid gardens and then got a taxi to Orchard Rd but I did not have energy to shop afterwards!
,,Very beautiful place!!!,5.0,,Botanical garden - very beautiful and peaceful place. Here are like in Paradise. Forget about time and pressure. I highly recommend to visit the cafe. Especially tasty was the salad with aloe. Also good and an Orchid garden. The entrance to the Botanical garden is free. In the Orchid Garden it is necessary to buy tickets. But a Botanical garden unlike the garden of orchids is very large and spacious.
,,must go,5.0,,"very large, you will see so many different tropical plants. it's well managed. we also saw some water monitors which were pretty cool. wear comfy shoes and enjoy it! can be pretty warm though."
,,Interesting place,5.0,,A very good place to visit but try and go in the morning due to the humidity factor. A well laid out garden with lots of interesting things to see. As with anywhere in Singapore it can rain without warning so ensure you go prepared. There is a shop if you do go unprepared you are able to purchase umbrellas etc.
,,Very nice and Orchids Superb,4.0,,"We had a very nice walk in the gardens which is well set out, the highlight was the Orchids which were just superb."
,,Beautiful Park!,5.0,,"Walked through the park on our way to look at Orchids. It is a beautiful park, clean and well run. Totally unexpected just metres from the underground. And so big! Could easily have spent much longer just wandering around. No charge for access. Great!"
,,Go see the turtles,4.0,,There's a big lake with an area full of fish and turtles that's really amazing to see. Bring some coins so you can buy food to feed them with. Also bring an umbrella...it can unexpectedly rain and there's not a lot of cover
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The gardens are a lovely way to walk about out of the city life
I would highly recommend a visit to the Orchid Gardens as well (there is an entrance fee) but it is worth it - some of the most beautiful colours I have seen"
,,"Large, wonderful collection, especially orchids",5.0,,"The National Botanical Garden is a great place to visit. Set aside a couple of hours at least. Long walks, wonderful collection of plants, trees - and orchids. The Orchid Garden is a must visit. They have a couple of Black Swans at the Echo Lake, unfortunately could not see them, seemed to be hiding!!
Must visit when in Singapore"
,,Nice stroll,5.0,,"Pretty cool place to check out for a morning or afternoon. It's free so if you're on a budget this is a good activity to keep you occupied. It's huge so be sure to wear some decent walking shoes. Beautiful place, definitely worth a visit."
,,"Nice, but not extraordinary",4.0,,"The garden is nice. If you have a longer stay or live there, it is a great place to relax. If you compare it to other botanical gardens it is not an extraordinary beautiful park/garden. You have to pay extra for the orchid garden"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Very well thought out and kept. It was such a beautiful place and very professionally done. Lots of walking (allow at least 1/2 day), but definitely worth the visit.
Make sure that you have a look at the labs near the main entrance. The library also has a comprhensive collection of pressed plant specimens."
,,Get nature right in the city,4.0,,"A well laid out lovely nature escapade right in the heart of the city. The pathways are clean and easily accessed with plenty of themed gardens such as Ginger, orchids and so on. Some portions require fees to enter but otherwise, there's plenty to see even if you don't plan to spend a few dollars. Check with the reception at the visitor center for which gardens or plants are flowering and you'll be in for a treat.

We went with young children and there were plenty of sights to catch their interest - beats hanging out al the mall in my opinion. 1-2 hours is plenty but if you can afford 2 or more hours, it would be good to cover more."
,,Always Worth a Visit,5.0,,"This is my second or third visit to these gardens, and I spent a beautiful few hours connecting with nature here in the middle of a big city. These gardens are so well designed and the upkeep is magnificent. The Orchid Garden is always a special treat, with a riot of colour, and beautifully arranged settings for use as backdrops for photos.

There was a Band Bonanza being held on the Bandstand at Symphony Lake – an added bonus. There were lots of families enjoying their Sunday having picnics and playing on the large lawned areas within the gardens. I caught a bus directly from my hotel in Katong, so for $2.20 and 38 minutes, it was so easy to get there. It is equally serviced by the MRT as well."
,,Beautiful Orchids,4.0,,The orchid garden was the most impressive of the areas we walked. Everything was beautifully maintained. Took quite some time to get a cab afterwards back to our hotel...the line was long.
,,Beautiful and Insightful,5.0,,"We had a very insightful private tour of the place where our group learnt a lot. We especially love that the gardens is now allowing leave little and letting ,mother nature do what it knows best."

Was a very nice day. We then carried on our walk to the ginger garden and then to the swings. Was really relaxing. Highly recommended.
,,Fabulous and free,5.0,,"As a world heritage site, the gardens are everything you might expect. Very well done, quite informative and well worth the time."
,,Beautifully Botanical,5.0,,"A great free (almost) attraction to visit. Fantastic views and planting. The small fee for the Orchid Garden was most definately worth it. Whilst the temperature and humidity may put some off, with perseverance you will take away memories and photographs you will not find anywhere else in the world."
,,An expansive park with remarkable foliage,5.0,,"This free-of-charge destination is a jewel for Singapore. Well laid out with a variety of sections devoted to particular types of fauna. One of the many areas of interest was the ""healing garden"" growing many plants that have been used medicinally for ages. There are also a couple of places to grab an inexpensive lunch on the grounds."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,4.0,,Entered from the Botanic Garden MRT station side and a long walk to the Orchid Garden. The place is nicely landscaped and the orchid garden was fabulous. I have never seen so many variants of Orchid in my life.
,,Nice,3.0,,Large leafy gardens. Well sign posted. Orchid display beautiful. Overpriced souvenir shop. Well maintained. Worth a visit when its not too humid
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Beautiful, peaceful and well worth a visit. We visited here together with the orchid garden and just wish we could have spent longer walking around. We missed the rainforest section as we didn't realise it was there until we go home so don't miss that as it looks amazing and we will not miss it again when we return!"
,,nice visit,4.0,,the unesco botanic gardens are clearly a worth vist while in singapore! Mainly but not only the national garden of orchards! Also some concerts are performed during weekend here
,,Beautiful tranquility,5.0,,Huge botanical gardens that are largely free to visit (you have to pay $5 to visit the orchid house which is a must). The gardens are beautifully set out and there is a feast for the eyes at every turn. If you have the chance to spend a few hours here then don't miss it.
,,Nice gardens,3.0,,THe gardens was a leisurely Walk and was very nice to see.Was nice to see for first time but nothing special
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"So natural and a peaceful haven in the city, wonderful planting and specimens. Visit the orchid garden as well so lovely"
,,Great Photo Opportunities,5.0,,"When walking around the Botanic Gardens you just have to ignore the humidity as it can get quite hot and sometimes uncomfortable. Throughout the gardens there are many photo opportunities such as: pond; orchid garden; band stand; and bonsai trees. I really had a great time using my macro lens to take up close and personal pictures of the flowers and plants on view. Overall, great place to visit."
,,An escape to the busy city life.,5.0,,"Singapore has a lots of places to relax in from its busy life and Botanic Garden is one of them. A wide area where you can be one with nature, enjoy the breeze, and just nature tripping, this is it. I like to go here with my friends family, bring our own lunch and just have a picnic near the bamboos. Its also good for bikers and runners to train here because of the nice air you will breath in."
,,Beautiful orchids in tranquill gardens,5.0,,"Took the MRT from city centre, fast efficient, clean and cheap. What a wonderful place this is, the space and layout is excellent and then you find the orchid gardens. $5 gains entrance and wow is it worth it. I am not a flower person but this place was awesome.

If you have to make a choice between here and the gardens by the bay do not hesitate to go here.

Superb day out."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"Worth a visit especially if you are a flower lover. We were travelling with friend who loved it.

While my husband an I weren't quite so enamoured, we enjoyed strolling around the gardens and lake.

The National Orchid Garden (within the Botanical Gnds) is really impressive with a vast array of these beautiful flowers."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Coming directly from the UK,this was a total eye opener. Beautiful plants in a park environment is the perfect antidote to a cold UK. Apart from the Orchid section,this is a free attraction and well worth a visit."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,This is a must-go place for anyone visiting Singapore. The Orchid garden is spectacular and well maintained. The gardens are near downtown and easy to get to. There is also an outdoor stage area with performances regularly. I saw a rehearsal for Swan Lake while I was walking the gardens.
,,I want to go back!,5.0,,One could wander this spectacular garden for many many hours. Every vista is lush and peaceful. The plantings and walks promote such a feeling of joy in nature. Highly recommend
,,Large,4.0,,"Thought the place could have more signage on the plants. Very large area,be prepared for miles of walking!! Orchid gardens underwhelmed. Was some re-doing going on. Tour was very slow, too much non-plant information, more for average tourist, not plant people. I found paths not to be labeled well, got lost, didn't see the whole thing by any means, came out at entrance with no transportation, must know what you're doing, and I found maps and signage lacking."
,,Great space,5.0,,"With singapore being so small - a touch of freedom and sanctuary in the heart of the island - great for stroll, run or picnic"
,,Relaxing place amid the city,5.0,,Beautiful gardens with wildlife. A chance to relax and take in the beautiful gardens. A break from the bustle of the city. Free and we'll worth taking the time to visit
,,"If you have time, a great place to visit",5.0,,"We stayed in Singapore for 6 days last year and we are back again. This is a marvelous city to visit. We took public transportation to the botanical gardens and spent a wonderful morning there. The gardens and huge and have the most beautiful grounds and flowers, especially the orchids. You won't be disappointed."
,,do it,5.0,,perfect place to see a must the gardens are amazing trees flowers ever where is a big walk but a must to do
,,Oasis in Singapore,5.0,,"Wasn' planned, but simply walked passed and decided to go in for a visit, what a joyful trip, maybe it was weekday, not too many people, wonderful trees and foliage, just strolling along the pathways cleanse your body and mind totally, must say if you have time do make an effort to go whenever you are in the beautiful city of Singapore, you won't regret it."
,,Garden Delight,5.0,,Went though the Gardens they were great then went though the Orchard display this like other attractions in Singapore are worth seeing.
,,Nice and big,4.0,,This botanical forest and garden is very nice but a little difficult to found a logical way for the show
,,Awesome Garden in The City......,5.0,,"Never thought I would be that impressed with a garden. This garden was really made my day. I love being here even though it was quite hot. Me & my family were taking a bus from Bugis. It took 30 minutes bus ride. But if you take MRT, you can get there and alight in MRT Botanic Garden (take the blue line MRT route). After we arrived, we walked for 5-10 minutes to go to garden's entrance gate. There was a guard who is very helpful (he gave us many information regarding the garden).

For your information, there is no entrance fee to enter and visit this garden but there are several places inside this garden which require you to pay entrance fees.

This place is a good place to take a long walk / run with awesome surroundings (trees, lake, wild animals, unique plants, etc). If I'm not mistaken, it takes 2.5 km from one side to the other side of the garden. If you enjoy the garden, you will not noticed that you have walk that long. By the way, when we went to the toilet, it was surprisingly very clean and no bad smells. FYI, mostly the Singapore's toilets weren't clean and sometimes very smelly.

Whilst travelling this garden, I found & saw 2 big lizards climb up the big trees. It was a rare moment for me and my family. Also there is a swan lake but I only saw couple of swan.

If you get thirsty, there is a place (Orchid Plaza) which you can buy drinks and souvenirs. It is nearby the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage.

Overall, I love this place and will visit it again if I travel to Singapore again. A highly recommended place to visit in the heart of the city of Singapore."
,,An indulged eve,4.0,,"Been here with a some relatives in end of last December. Christmas decos was also there. Even though the air was little hot, we really enjoyed the ambiance. Evening at the swan lake can make any one relaxed.
It is normal that humidity is little high in this area. Take some extra water if you plan to go there at morning or afternoon. we'd love to do some cycling though we did not see any. But you can do some jogging."
,,Best orchid exhibition,5.0,,"The gardens can be easily reached by MRT. Simply exit the station and you are at the gardens entrance. Lovely landscaped gardens and parkland. Several restaurants and cafes available. There are many locations for family picnics. The orchid exhibition is unbelievable. Entrance to the gardens is free however there is a small charge , $2 for seniors and higher for others, to enter the orchid area. Pay the money and be entranced.
Highly recommended ."
,,Stunning an Oasis in the city.,5.0,,"The gardens are all beautifully planned and maintained. The layout is expansive and you could spend a day there easily. We spent 2 hours one visit and an hour to do the Orchid garden separately. Overall, I would recommend these gardens to anyone as a great place to relax and enjoy beautifully planned and maintained gardens. I would recommend you go early as it gets quite warm walking in the mid day sun."
,,"I was not expecting, good garden in Singapore",4.0,,"When you had enough of shopping, foods, buildings, air conditions, cars, and all the buzz about the city, please head to this garden. The garden is big enough for 2 hours walk around and plenty to enjoy and see."
,,Fabulous botanic garden,5.0,,"We visited this garden twice during our short stay in Singapore. Its a really marvellous botanic garden, and is free to enter. Whether you are a serious plantaholic or just want a pleasant walk away from the bustle of the city you will be pleased. Inside the garden there is also the National Orchid Garden, for which a small entrance fee is required. This is also nice but you will find quite a few orchids in the free part of the garden also. Part son the garden are very well signposted to different areas of interest but the farther you get from the main gate, the less signposting is available. The side with all the car parking is quite poorly signed but persevere, its worth it."
,,Really nice gardens,5.0,,This is a nice way to spend a couple of hours walking around the gardens not to far to walk if you have young children or you have trouble walking
,,a pure delight,5.0,,"I came upon these gardens by chance and what a lovely surprise. I'm not a big garden fan but I spent three hours here and could have spent longer. The paths are easy to navigate and the lawns and flowers are very well maintained. There are several places to stop and have a refreshing drink, meal or glass of wine. I enjoyed seeing the monitor lizards roaming around freely."
,,Excellent value,5.0,,The whole area is planted to perfection and in immaculate condition. The attraction is free to walk round but there is a small charge t walk round the magnificent orchid gardens.
,,Nice morning walk,5.0,,Took a walk there from my hotel.. definitely worth the sweat.. it gets a bit hot but the park is well kept.. you will need at least 2 hours to walk the whole park..
,,Icon of Singapore,5.0,,"If you have time and its not poring with rain the gardens are a must. Its has been carefully planned and there is always beautiful flowers in bloom. Its free but worth the extra $5 to check out the most famous of all the Orchard Gardens. No trip to Singapore is complete without a visit and wander around here, Highly Recommended"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Beautiful clean gardens, with dogs getting walked, runners exercising and family and friends having picnics. Wonderful environment, beautiful surrounds with gorgeous places to stop for photo moments. A must visit whilst in Singapore."
,,Nice relaxing walk,5.0,,"I am not really a nature guy, but taking the time for a leisurely stroll through here I found to be rather pleasant. Calm, quiet, serene...and of course always fun to watch the other walkers, joggers, yogers, etc as they find their way through this reserve in the middle of the busy city."
,,Green Lungs,4.0,,"Even if you dont like the outdoors, here is a place with heritage leafy trees giving shades at all times of the day with small 'tropical forest' trails making it easy for all ages to tackle. Recently awarded a world heritage site, it has educational hubs, places for the weary and hungry to rest or snack; a great way to spend a relaxing week end with one's family for a picnic or just going solo for a run through work out or join groups doing their tai chis or yogas! Give yourself a treat escaping the buzz of daily work life."
,,greeny,4.0,,this place is so nice so green.. green everywhere. nice place to visit. lovely place to enjoy the nature.
,,Botanical gardens,5.0,,"A Unesco heritage site garden with trees and faunas that dates back 100 yrs old. Located just at top of orchard at Tanglin side. It is so nice to go for a walk in the evening there with my wife, daughter and dog.
The hustle and bustle of a city sudenly disappear after you enter the gate. I especially like a special tree with a horizontal branch which is featured on the back oof our $5/- note.Heard that you can have a hybrid orchid named after you for a couple of thousands dollars in the orchid garden. Hmm... something for your descendents to remember.
Great for family bonding."
,,A slice of heavenly beauty,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens is one of the most beautiful and awe inspiring places in Singapore. It is easily accessible from the MRT station.

The garden is free to enter and explore every imaginable type of flower and tree. It is so peaceful and beautiful.

There is a small fee to enter The National Orchid Garden, which boasts the world’s largest orchid display, with over 60,000 plants and orchids. These orchids are alive with color and beauty and the pictures that you can take are breathtaking.

Inside the orchid garden there is the “cool house” which tries to recreate the environment of a tropical highland forest and showcases orchids that are normally only found in the tropical highland areas.

Overall, there is more than 10,000 species spread out over its 183 acres of land that we could not possibly see in one day, but we gave it a good try.

While exploring the gardens we came upon a reflexology path. It has stones set up that massage your feet as you walk. It felt so good walking on the path and having our feet massaged from previous days of walking.

There is also a small 15 acre tropical rainforest which is older than the gardens themselves. It was magical walking through this area looking at all the trees that were so aged and had grown to be so majestic.

Fun fact from the research on the internet: More than 80% of its plant species are rare or endangered not only in the Gardens but also in Singapore. Hence it is critical that these species are conserved within one of the last remaining primary forests of Singapore.

I would highly recommend taking a full day to explore the gardens, taking a picnic lunch - although they have a cafe within the gardens - and definitely pay the small fee to enter the orchid area.

Make sure to bring your camera and good walking shoes and be prepared to be awed by the beauty of nature. You will not be disappointed."
,,Beautiful location with so much to see,5.0,,I visited the botanic gardens with my husband and parents. We had a lovely day walking around the gardens and the layout is excellent. So much thought as gone into the creation of these gardens and it is lovely to see all the statues/art throughout the gardens. We paid the additional monies to visit the VIP orchid garden and this was well worth it! $1 for senior citizens and $5 for an adult. The colours and range of different orchids was staggering and lots of seating areas for anyone just wanting to sit and rest. The staff were lovely and extremely helpful. A must see for anyone interested in plants/flowers or even those who enjoy a walk in beautiful surroundings.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Visited the Botanic gardens and was impressed by the care and maintenence. It is free entry but for $5 singapore dollars make sure you also go to the national orchid centre which is also on site you eill not be disappointed

,,Beautiful gardens within the city!,5.0,,"One of the things I love about Singapore is how green it is. These days, you often have to choose between the comforts of metropolitan lifestyle or the natural beauty of the country itself. Singapore does not compromise! The botanic gardens are a great way to get your green fix whilst on a city break. Free entry. Good idea to take plenty of water and maybe a picnic. Can get quite hot!"

,,Outstanding experience,5.0,,"The main gardens are free to enter & there is a lot you can see but there is also a lot of walking. Gardens extend for about 2 miles.

,,A walk in the gardens,5.0,,"I live close to Botanical gardens , when ever I walk to the park in the morning is gave me sense of calm and peaceful as you walk through this well craft nature is an important part of Singapore heritage the park was developed into small gardens base on the themes and they are beautifully kept and maintained with natural surroundings. The part was mane as one of world heritages site . I truly appreciated and how much the is valuable and possible to where the space is limited and the best NATURAL RESERVES in the heart of the city . You will disappointed when you visit Singapore botanical gardens so enjoyed the walk and explore."
,,"Lush green garden, good for visits and exercise too!",4.0,,"UNESCO World Heritage Site accorded in 2016, but it has always been a great place for me.

,,Long walk but worth it,4.0,,You can spend an entire day here and is really beautiful. Lots of different spots an quiet areas. You can not stay here for a short stay because even a quick look will take you at least an hour but is really worth it even when you have only one day to spare.
,,A fabulous garden in a big city,5.0,,"We spent the better part of a day at the Singapore Botanical Gardens (March 9, 2017). We weren't sure what to expect but we were very pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the various gardens. The orchid garden is spectacular. The best part is that general admissions are free (Singapore is very expensive so this was a very nice reorieve) and the cost of going to the UNESCO heritage site orchid garden was minimal ($5 Sing dollars or $1 Sing dollar for seniors over 60). Frankly the gardens were one of the very best parts of our visit to this overpriced city."
,,Oasis in the city,4.0,,This is free to the public and worth a visit. You also access the National Orchid Garden from here which you do have to pay for. Plenty of places also to eat and drink. Nice way to spend a morning/afternoon.
,,"Clean, hot, sticky.",4.0,,"See health garden, orchids, walk the many paths, stop by the lakes/ponds - there are some large fish, turtles and some very large monitor lizards. Take advantage of restrooms when you see them...."

,,"UNESCO World Heritage Site, great restaurants",5.0,,While we visited primarily for lunch at The Corner House we did manage an after lunch walk through some of the verdant greens. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Singapore for a few days.
,,Beautiful gardens in acres of park,5.0,,"We visited these gardens not knowing what to expect and were blown away with the expanse and beauty of the grounds, they by far outweighed any expectations we had. We spent a good hour just walking around the orchid gardens I had no idea there were so many varieties! Wear good walking shoes and be prepared to spend a day there."
,,Lovely place to spend time,5.0,,"A great place to spend time, allow yourself at least a couple of hours as there is so much to see. It's free to visit, you only pay to go into the Orchid House and that is five Singapore dollars, equivilant to £2.70 and is well worth it. Over 60's only pay one dollar, (50pence). Could quite easily spend a whole day here. There are places to buy food/refreshments but do take care as Su galore can get very humid."
,,Really nice place,5.0,,"It's a big garden and u need to walk more to see the attractions. There are plenty of different trees, flowers and it's clean garden. Photographers will love this place. Ticket need to be taken for orchid garden"
,,We visited the Botanic gardens 48 years ago,5.0,,What a transformation its fantastic we took picture of when we last went there and a lot of this visit the gentleman at the gate was true gent he went over all the new projects since we were last there very worth a visit but make sure you leave a lot of time lots to see
,,Love it,5.0,,"My running spot. Love the surroundings, flowers, roosters, (big) lizards, turtles, swans, other colorful birds etc.

I do seriously hope that more effort could be put into stopping the visitors feeding the fishes or the swans. Quite sick about this every time I saw visitors doing it despite the clear signs by the lake. That's very bad example for your kid..."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I used to live nearby and walked the Botanical Gardens often. Lakes with swans, many lovely paths, sculptures, meticulously maintained. Many varities of trees, orchids, ginger. Historical guided walks. Several restaurants in the gardens. Early morning see tai chi and other groups exercising. Musical performances on the lake stage (Shaw). Very family oriented. The Orchid Gardens are tucked inside the Botanical Gardens. I loved my frequent visits to the Botanical Gardens!"
,,World Class,5.0,,"We enjoy this great space many many times. A stroll with family, a sanctuary in the green gardens, a place to walk your dogs, this is for all people all the time. Do not miss this precious place. The Halia cafe adds even more to the joy. Tucked in the green it feels like you are in some tropical paridise."
,,Relaxing place of nature within the city,5.0,,Great for a slow stroll or a run thru' the gardens for a work out. The Orchid Gardens is also a excellent to smell the flowers and appreciate the many types of orchids.
,,Still good,4.0,,Been here several times since 1997 and the place is still well maintained even though there's the gardens by the bay now. This is another great place yo visit for FREE in Singapore! A lot of walking or running surrounded by greens everywhere!
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,"The botanic gardens is something not to be missed in Singapore. Probably needs 3-4 hours but definitely worth the visit. The orchid gardens ($5 entry per person) is a lifetime experience in terms of the variety of orchid and the overall scenery. The VIP garden is also a nice experience given the number of world leaders that have visited the gardens so nice to see who visited the Gardens. The Healing gardens also offers a large variety of flowers (the ""toxic"" garden is closed to public and only opens for guided tours but still there is a large number of healing plants). The Gardens are also good for sports and yoga given the magnificent and serene scenery. Would definitely recommend! Taxi to get back to the city might be tricky at peak hours so either call in advance or press the button at the taxi stand."
,,Good Day Excursion,4.0,,"Can be accessed using either the MRT or HOHO Bus, this is a very nice venue and a welcome break from the hustle bustle of the city centre. Lots of trails and attractions to explore with restaurant facilities available. Can be hard work walking in high humidity though, take sun screen, good walking shoes and plenty of water, beautiful gardens."
,,Unexpectedly large,5.0,,"We primarily went to see the Orchids and were not disappointed in the colour or variety. Although there were a lot of people around, the gardens were large enough for it not to be uncomfortable.

There are quite a few nice art works on display and many open spaces.

A well stocked gift shop and small snack bar are also available.

Only disappointment was not being able to find all of the orchids named after famous people."
,,Best nature reserve in Singapore in the heart of the city not to be missed,5.0,,"Excellent place crafted with nature, among all the concrete modern developments, Singapore has demonstrated how much nature is valuable and is still possible in a place where space is constraint. No visitor should miss this place. Early morning is best but still any time of the day is also good, to have a nice walk or sit and relax to enjoy the nature away from the hustle and bustle of the city but yet within the central city limits."
,,Awesome Botanic Gardens!,5.0,,Have been here many times and its a must see in my book. Very large...Make sure to takea camera because there're great shots to be had throughout.
,,Great way to relax,5.0,,"Very scenic, relaxing. Quite educational if you are into 'plants' Excellent choices for food and drinks too."
,,"Beautiful garden, relaxing and peaceful place on a weekday",4.0,,"The opening of the Botanic Gardens MRT station on the Circle Line has made the Botanic Gardens much more accessible for many people. It's a surprisingly quiet and peaceful place right in the middle of Singapore sandwiched between Bukit Timah Road on the northerly side and Holland Road to the south. The best parts of the Botanic Gardens are in the middle (around 10 to 15 minutes walking). There are a few cafes (especially close to the NUS Law campus and the Visitor's Centre). At the weekends it probably gets very busy, but on weekdays it's a fairly quiet place. It's not as spectacular as some botanic gardens elsewhere (such as Sydney's), but it's still very pleasant. It's prettyy big, walking slowly in the tropical heat you can easily spend two or three hours here."
,,RELAX AND BREATHE,5.0,,"Singapore is green but here the color takes on a new meaning. Lot to see, although academic info could be better, you can walk endlessly for hours. I recommend the rain forest trail and of course the orchid garden - there you will find flowers I never thought exists. I was disappointed by the ginger trail as I couldn't find much ginger and the info were scarce.
Overall a must while in SG.
I recommend it.
CIAO"
,,Holiday Cruise,5.0,,"A wonderful place, free of charge, although there is a charge to visit the Orchid gallery, 1 Singapore Dollar!!! Not a scrap of rubbish, dirt or graffiti. We saw Monitor Lizards, lots of squirrels, and the whole area was tranquil."
,,A garden or paradise,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore a visit to these gardens is a must. We was on an open top bus around the city when we stopped at the gardens. I suggested we hop off and take a look much to my husband's dismay. Two hours later after taking several photos and getting rather damp in the ""rain forest"" we regrettably had to make tracks back to our cruise ship.
Oh and the best thing it is FREE! Apart from entrance to the Orchid House, I don't know the price as we ran out of time to go there."
,,An excellent place to visit anytime of the day,4.0,,This place isn't your standard garden. It is a special park where you can do your sports routines and busk in the nature's wonders
,,Do not miss the botanic / orchard gardens - a real must see,5.0,,"If you rush you will miss so much, take your time (we took 4.5hrs), such a beautiful relaxing place to visit and the orchard gardens within are just amazing. No wonder the place is a UNESCO world heritage site. Well done Singapore, be proud of such a place in the middle of a city."
,,Magnificent gardens and orchid centre.,5.0,,"Don't miss these magnificent gardens, but make sure you have enough time. The orchid centre alone takes a lot of time. We only got through half of the gardens"
,,Paradise in Singapore,5.0,,Caught the Hop on Hop off bus to the Botanic Gardens; how beautiful they are. and FREE! Spent a few hours here. my daughter loved it as photography is a hobby and she had her new CANON camera. Hundreds of beautiful photos. We saw a wedding in progress - awesome place for a wedding
,,Huge Garden,5.0,,Large area to walk and relax. Enjoy the moment with fresh air. Need to bring sun glass and hat. Garden entry is free however need to pay for orchid garden. But worth to pay as many different kinds of orchid can see in one place.The most attractive place ever.
,,Excellent Botanic Gardens,5.0,,It was raining when we went here nevertheless it was an awesome place to beat the Singapore heat. We enjoyed the long trek. The restroom feels like you are in the middle of the forest. The place was spot on clean just like all places in Singapore.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The botanical is a must for everyone interested in gardens. It is so peaceful and tt is immaculate in every sence of the word. The orchid garden is a must, so many colours and types of orchids."
,,Give yourself lots of time,5.0,,The garden is free and covers a large area so give yourself lots of time to take it all in. There are lots of toilets and nice places to have a drink or take a picnic.
,,Wonderful National Orchid Gardens,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore make sure you visit the wonderful National Orchid Gardens, truly breathtaking with an amazing collection of orchids and wonderful gardens to walk through. Oh don't forget your umbrella due to the humidity in Singapore heavy rain can come down unexpectedly. I would recommend doing it on your own rather than a tour to give yourself more time to explore. Enjoy!"
,,Take your time,5.0,,"An amazing place, and a must to visit. Its quite large area, so take your time and don't be stressed when visiting. Bring a sun umbrella since it gets really hot in the sun."
,,Family vacation,4.0,,It was actually year march of 2015 when we visited sg and went to botanical gardens. Aside of the park if of free of charge it has lots to offer for families and young children! We had enjoyed the sight and everything it has to offer. If you are in a tight budget but looking for a world class park or view go visit this place and go crazy picturr taking!
,,Greeeeen !,5.0,,"This is a definite must-stop in Singapore, the park is relatively big and filled with lakes/ponds, there are pathways everywhere, big green spaces which are ideal to go with children but also places which are great to spend time with your other half. We went to the orchid garden which was splendid. This botanical park is the perfect getaway from the city!!"
,,One of the world's best botanical gardens.,5.0,,"This botanical garden is noted for its collection of tropical plants and trees. Like all things in Singapore, it is well maintained. Plan to spend plenty of time there to appreciate the exhibition."
,,Lovely gardens,3.0,,The gardens are great to see but the special attraction is the Orchid gardens. The botanical gardens is free entry but the orchid gardens are a small entry fee. If you love orchids it is a great display of the variety of orchids. They were beautiful.
,,UNESCO World Heritage Site Says It All,5.0,,"This expansive tropical garden oasis in the middle of bustling Singapore is a world treasure. The park atmosphere and beautiful walking paths contain hidden surprises all along when you pay special attention to the labeling. There are also lovely water features, garden swings, enormous trees, colorful plants and other spectacles of the tropics to see. This is a wonderful outing for couples, families or large groups. It is appealing to all ages."
,,Enjoyable stroll,5.0,,"An enjoyable stroll in lovely grounds. We saw Swans Cat Fish, Monitor Lizards (big ones), terrapins, and some strange plants."
,,A Gardener's Dream,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens were a wonderful display of flowers and plants in a tropical setting. The whole Garden is well layed out and provides a great place to take a leisurely stroll and view so many different plants in so many different settings. The rainforest section was really cool to see, as was the Orchid Gardens, which costs extra for an entrance fee. Great place to spend a morning before hitting up the shopping districts. Also, if you're a history fan, it's the only tropical garden that's a UNESCO Heritage site"
,,A visit here is a must,5.0,,"We went to the Botanic garden by taxi from our river view hotel at 9.30 and we had a lovely time strolling along the many paths, sitting down frequently to enjoy the vista. The orchid garden is not to be missed, as senior citizens this cost us $1 each and was great value. To see the huge collection of orchids growing in natural settings was just wonderful, and the colours were so beautiful. We had a light lunch in one of the cafes and got a taxi from their taxi rank back to our hotel. About $6/6.50 a trip which we thought was very reasonable. A bus service also is available.
This is a must if you visit Singapore a great way to spend a day looking round."
,,Don't miss even if you are not a plant person,5.0,,"These gardens are a delight, the orchid collection surpasses anything seen elsewhere and everywhere is beautifully kept. An easy metro journey from the city centre or a stop on the hop on bus."
,,Beautiful place to spend a few hours,5.0,,"This is a really nice cool place to get away from the manic Singapore city hustle, bustle, heat and traffic. We've been here a few times and always book our hotel within walking distance from the entrance of the gardens. FREE entry although you have to pay to visit the orchid gardens section, but that too is worth a visit and make sure you have a camera with you. Lots of lakes and places to eat or get a drink and loads of places to walk. If you're visiting Singapore make sure this is on you list of places to visit"
,,Best place ever,5.0,,"I live 10mins away from the gardens, so we take our young kids there frequently. Can spend half day there walking and playing. Kids live the open space, it's save as they cannot scape to any roads. The rainforest walk is staggering!"
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens sre really worth seeing even if you are not a gardner. Entry is free. The Frangipani section was particularly interesting . Entry to the orchid section is NOT for free, however, it is worth it."
,,Don't Miss It,5.0,,"Quite an interesting experience for nature lovers or anyone who enjoys being outside. We have been the restaurant, The Corner House a number of times before and that was the draw but it is such a treat to have so much nature in the heart of the city."
,,A walk through the Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Tropical flora, mysterious trees, beautiful vines a just a hint of what you will see walking thru the gardens. It cannot be seen in one day because if you do you will miss so much.
This is a wonderful development of such important Singapore heritage every different corner has a different story that you will want to experience slowly. So do not rush.
The entire garden is broken down into smaller gardens based on themes. The foliage is magnificent as you walk into each garden.
After all the hustle and bustle of the busy city it is nice to have quiet and appreciate all the beauty.
Even the walk to the Botanical Garden is interesting; you get to walk by different country embassies, lots of different architectural apartment buildings.
Again on taking your time, take a couple of days to really enjoy this beautiful area."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,Great gardens for a leisurely walk or a run. People enjoying quiet time or a Tai Chi class. Walk to gardens also enjoyable through the affluent suburbs quite the contrast to the very busy shopping precinct.
,,Well-manicured Gardens,5.0,,"The gardens look so orderly and clean. Ideal for all ages. It feels good to stay in this place for hours. With lushes around, I felt I was de-stressed from the hustle and bustle of the city. I was in awe knowing that there is such a beautiful garden in the middle of the city."
,,wonderful place,5.0,,i love these gardens and they are well worth a visit. its a beautiful oasis of calm and tranquility in a busy city with a lot to see and do. come in the cool of the day (early morning or evening). would highly recommend as a must do for all who love tropical gardens.
,,Heritage Listed Botanical Gardens,4.0,,"Happily surprised to find this gem. Upon entering the gardens there are so many different paths. I just followed my feet and luckily came across a watermonitor with a fish in his mouth being chased by a catfish. Further around the lake a white swan passed as turtles looked on. Two squirrels then ran up and down the tree I was standing next to.
Could definitely spent the whole day there easily. Please be advised that the healing garden is closed on Tuesdays."
,,Nature's wonderland,5.0,,"What a privilege to visit these beautiful gardens, and all for free. It's a place to return to often for quiet meditation, a good walk with friends and simply to get away from the hustle and bustle that is Singapore."
,,GARDENS OF SINGAPORE BOTANIC,5.0,,"GARDENS OF SINGAPORE BOTANIC

It's a place where thousands of kinds , Trees, Bushes, Plants , are gathered together in an large capacity of garden , here in Singapore .

Lovely place to walk , even from down town , Orchard road , is not so far , and the walking is very nice , nature is all over Singapore , and if your feet can stand 30 minutes normal speed of walking , then it is great to visit , even if it is hot , it is amazing , walking through the pedestrians road , side walk and never have to worry about safety , all the times , say or night it sis safe to walk in all corners and places of Singapore , even the one , that are not included in the map."
,,Absolutely wonderful,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens is the perfect place for anybody who wants to slow down and enjoy the wonders of nature!

It has different sections with their own attractions: a real rainforest, orchids, lakes, swamp, water-falls, healing plants, tropical fruit and nut trees, as well as extended stretches of grass for just laying around or having a pick-nick. You can also observe wildlife including various bird species, big but friendly lizards, fish and turtles, swans, wild chicken, etc.

It's open from 5 until midnight every day, if you go before 8 am or after 8 pm it starts to be much more calm in the Gardens and it's also less hot. It's only a 15 min. walk from Orchard Road but you can also reach it by bus or metro (MRT).

Locals love it for having a walk, for jogging and other sports, and you can also join activity groups for yoga, tai-chi, meditation, gymnastics, music and so on.

Some of the so called ""heritage trees"" are just amazing, must see.

The Gardens will be extended in 2018 with a huge new stretch of land and new sections to be added!"
,,Colorful Gardens,5.0,,"Interesting garden, full of flowers and colors ! The National Orchid Garden is must see in Singapore."
,,Beautiful Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Lovely walk through the gardens (there are quite a lot of hills) but mostly shaded. There is a lovely outdoor open air restaurant in the center and the outstanding Orchid Garden. Not to be missed. Easy to get to on the MRT.
,,Great place to go,5.0,,Jumped in a cab from hotel and for less than $10 we were there. Grounds kept so clean and a credit to the workers. Orchid Farm is amazing
,,A Must if you like Orchids,5.0,,"These gardens are beautiful and free to walk round you only pay to go into the orchid garden which is really a must see, it only costs $5 or $1 dollar if you are over sixty. A truly amazing display of so many different types of orchids."
,,Botanic at its Best,5.0,,"We like botanical gardens, and then there are some around the world we love. If you love gardens you will undoubtedly agree with our 5 stars given. It competes with Kew, Versailles and other great gardens of the world.

The biggest negative is its biggest attraction: the Orchid Garden, reportedly the largest in the world. It was crowded with tourists at a price with the remainder of this wonder, free, and relatively only sparsely peopled, at least on this day.

The jewel of this entire site is perhaps the Evolution Garden found essentially in the center of this botanical pleasure. Day or night there is something for anyone interested in flora and some fauna. Our 4 hours were well spent. However, even in early March a refreshing shower (sauna) was very welcome post visit.

Admittedly we did not visit Garden on the Bay, which a young female Singaporean we met in Bangkok, was impressed with, while not even having heard of the Botanic Garden. So the generations differ, but we can't help with an either or both decision."
,,Lovely,5.0,,We spent with our seven month old son a wonderful day at this lovely Place. A really nice Garden to have a Great with your Family. We call it : Gate to Narnia ;-) enjoy
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Lovely place for a relax walk. Beautiful ambience. The orchid garden is a must in my opinion..but i like orchids and there i have seen so many types that i never knew that exists. I will definitely spend again a few hours of my stay in Singapore.
Its not crowded and easy to access."
,,Relaxing Time,5.0,,Being surrounded by nature always feels great! The garden was clean and maintained very well. There were many places to seat and enjoy the breeze.
,,The best Botanic Gardens we have ever visited,5.0,,"You need time, and energy, to see everything. Free entry except for the orchid garden. The Healing Garden is closed on Tuesdays. The eating place near Raffles House is excellent. Local people eat here and we had good conversations. Everyone helpful and friendly. Local. tasty, food."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Enjoyed the visit even walking about in pouring rain, the orchids are beautiful make sure you see them."
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"Went to Singapore really to see the Botanical Gardens and was duly rewarded! The tropical plants and trees were just stunning. I suspect we saw only a fraction of the gardens ( and orchids) and that took about 4hrs. A lot of walking , so important to have good foot wear and water bottles. Tickets for Orchid garden available there, very reasonable."
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens was beautifully maintained for tourists to visit. We get the metro to get there and all going smoothly. The gardens was pretty nice and easy to walk around and take the photos. Nice place to see in Singapore!!!

Wonderful . Places to eat,nice food."
,,Lovely! Unmissable!,5.0,,"A very large, beautifully maintained public park with lovely landscaping and an impressive range of plant material. It is over 150 years old so there are many very large trees. A world class garden, deservedly awarded UNESCO World Heritage status - one of only 3 gardens to be so honoured.
The orchid garden is really spectacular.
Free admission to the main garden and a modest charge for the orchids."
,,Urban oasis,5.0,,UNESCO world heritage site within walking distance of Orchard Road. Great for a run or leisurely stroll. Still waiting to see my first monitor lizard taking a swim but hope it will happen soon. Best in early morning or at dusk. Tourists and locals alike take advantage of the shade and natural beauty. Can't miss part of Singapore experience.
,,beautiful oasis,5.0,,We stopped off here as we got the sight seeing bus. Free except orchid garden. beautifully set out. Good signage. A very peaceful place with all the natuarl beauty of singapore. fantastic eateries to suit all budgets. a must to visit
,,Try Jacob Ballas Children's Garden,5.0,,"If you travelling with young children, heads to Jacob Ballas Children's Garden. With playgrounds I think kids will have more fun there rather than exploring the vast area of the park. I found out it's where locals also take their kids for the weekend."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"The National orchid garden is a must see in Singapore. The rest of the gardens is also stunning. In particular, the rain forest and frangipani garden (in season).! Saw some incredibly large lizards around the gardens too!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,I spent virtually the whole afternoon here exploring. A pure delight even though it was a very showery afternoon. Orchid gardens a must.

,,LOVE LOVE LOVE - Singapore's first UNESCO site,5.0,,"Really loved the Singapore Botanic Gardens and felt extremely proud when it made it to become first and only tropical botanic gardens on UNESCO World Heritage List in 2015. The garden is made up of several sections - Tanglin, Central and Bukit Timah cores. It is situated a short 10 mins bus ride from Orchard Road (look for buses to Napier Road from Orchard Boulevard side and alight at the bus stop after British Council or ask the bus driver to alert you). You start off from the main gates along Napier and if you walked along the main pathway, you will soon reach the Swan Lake, a nice oasis away from the hustle and bustle of concrete Orchard Road. A popular spot for tourists is the National Orchid Garden (Central core zone) which boasts over 1000 species of orchids, which is the national flower of Singapore. The park is actually free but you will need to pay a nominal entrance fee of $5 for adults, $1 for senior citizens above 60 years and it's free for kids under 12 years. The park has regular concerts and events throughout the year. Suggest that you check out the Singapore botanic gardens website for more info. And yes, I bring my dog to the gardens and he absolutely loved it too!!"
,,A Beautiful Setting Everywhere You Look,4.0,,"We went in the morning before the sun got too hot, arriving by taxi but later taking the Metro to our next stop. It is quite a pleasant area to wander and the orchid garden is not to be missed. There are a few specialist gardens (Fragrant, Herbal, etc) and one or two of these might be of interest. This is a more traditional botanical garden and certainly worth a visit but if you want a modernised experience head for the Gardens by the Bay."
,,A must see,5.0,,"Entry to the gardens is free and easy access from MRT Station. Well worth a visit and the Orchid Gardens are amazing, although you have to pay to visit. You can picnic or go to one of the eating establishments"
,,Tranquil walk,5.0,,"Beautiful park, comparable to Central Park or to Regent park. Nice, well taken care of ponds and lawns. Enjoyed by families during weekend. Orchid gardens worth visiting. Good for jogging in the evening."
,,Great place in the city,5.0,,"This is a big park in the city. Many trees flowers and wild animals like a lizard or birds in the park. Lots of people enjoy their time with families. Looks very healthy and lovely. You can arrive easy their in many ways. MTR, Taxi and tour bus. If you're lucky guy, you can see black swan in the lake."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautifully maintained gardens. Didn't have time for a guided tour. The orchid garden is very nice, but not as varied as the one in Medellin Colombia."
,,Well worth UNESCO rating,5.0,,"The gardens have been declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, one of only three gardens worldwide to achieve this status.

The gardens are spectacular, well maintained and well worth a visit.

We spent almost half a day in the Orchid Gardens alone and would have happily returned to visit the Bamboo Gardens and the Scented Garden which visitors are encourages to see at night.

One imagines it takes an army of gardeners to keep the gardens in such pristine condition.

Children were happily feeding fish in the large ponds within the gardens and we saw several large monitor lizards.

It is probably best to visit early as the temperature, and humidity, start to climb around lunchtime.

Highly recommended for anyone interested in plants. Also a wonderful place for families."
,,Great escape!,5.0,,Definitely worth the price of admission (free)! You could spend hours walking through the grounds - especially if you like to take pictures. We visited during the off season and it was very peaceful and beautiful. Would love to go back and explore some more.
,,A true meaning of botanic garden,5.0,,"Stunning gardens, rewarded as a Unesco world heritage site, great walks impressive treas and clearly well thought out. It was an absolute treat to go through and enjoy the gardens even through it was absolutely boiling outside."
,,"Beautiful, large gardens",5.0,,"It's a great place to go for a relaxing day, with lakes hot houses and the orchid gardens. It was easy to access being next to an mrt station."
,,Another fantastic spot,5.0,,We spent hours here. Plenty to see and do. Still in awe of the work that goes into the displays. The Orchid display was fantastic. Love this place.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Absolutely stunning place to visit. A great day out. It is free and easy to spend a day there. The orchid gardens are fabulous. Had the nicest lunch never at one of the restaurants in the gardens. Not too expensive considering the quality of the food. Preferred this is the much acclaimed Gardens at the Bay though they were fab too.
,,Short Walk and Dinner,4.0,,"Didn't walk around too much and am not a huge fan of botanical gardens, but it seemed quite nice and well done. Not sure it is worth the trip unless pairing with a meal as well."
,,Never disappoints,5.0,,"You feel like you've fallen into a magical land of lush orchids, tropical plants and large overhanging trees. Stroll with friends, colleagues, baby strollers, dogs, or in blissful solitude. Pay the extra for the orchid garden!"
,,Amazing gardens in the middle of a skyscraper city,5.0,,"Was fortunate to make a long walk through the gardens and have to say it was one of the best maintained gardens I have ever seen in my entire life, it is definitely worth a trip there."
,,Interesting but not spectacular,3.0,,"We walked to the Botanic Gardens from Orchard Rd, and spent about an hour there. Though well laid out, to see all the Gardens would need a good 2 hours and we didn't feel there was enough variety there."
,,Lovely place to visit,5.0,,"Great on a nice day to spend a couple of hours.
Wide open spaces and lots of nice flowers and orchids etc. to see.
Needs to be a dry day though as it's all outside.
It's a bus ride out of the centre but if you use the hop on hop off buses then this is on the route.
There is a part of it that is only for orchids which you have to pay for but it's well worth it.
Other than that the gardens are free to visit.
Highly. Recommend"
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Beautiful well maintained gardens housing thousands of species. The splendour of colours here are truly amazing and to cap it all it's free. A must see on a visit to Singapore.
,,The botanical garden,5.0,,Singapore botanical garden has various plant species from around the globe ...a great place to photograph ..chit chat and watch the green lungs of the city state ...the entry to the botanical garden is free ..however u need to pay for entry into the orchid garden ....place to spend a quite time
,,Beautiful big Gardens in small country,5.0,,"I have been plenty of times visit this country, but this is my 1st time explore this beautiful Botanic Gardens. Worth to visit and not enough time to visit once because the garden is too big."
,,Tranquil retreat in central Singapore,4.0,,"These gardens are lovely and a great escape from the bustle of busy Singapore. It is easily accessed by car, taxi or bus, and in fact we found it a great break in the Duck and Hippo tourist bus run around the city. You can hop off at the Botanical Gardens and get on again later in the day. The gardens feature a range of environments ranging from jungle, through palm forests, ginger plantations, flowers and the highlight the National Orchid Gardens. There are good public facilities including a busy restaurant with a range of foods and although there are kilometres of paved walks around the gardens there are also some stalls selling water and snacks (and the inevitable souvenirs) as you go. A well recommended visit while in Singapore."
,,lovely place,4.0,,"huge park with all sorts of trees, plants and especially orchids. (watch for falling trees. Feb 17) The only downer is that it is very humid in amongst the flora and you have to walk long distances"
,,Excursion of City,5.0,,Had a lovely relaxing walk around these well manicured gardens.Some amazing orchids to be found.Recommend to anyone visiting Singapore.You don't have to buy water as theyhave water fountain in the grounds.We were given a tip from our guide to take an empty bottle and fill it up.
,,Overated,2.0,,"It's just a botanic garden, nothing special about it. If something notable, it's its mediocrity. A waste of space in Singapore and a waste of my time. Came in the morning and left swiftly. Just out of my memory, the Flowers Garden in Shiraz, Iran, is far nicer than this huge but sterile space. It has a good thing: it's for free!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The gardens truly frustrated me. I planned to spend only a couple hours there, but found I couldn't pry myself away and I wrecked my whole itinerary that day!"
,,Very nice tranquil place,4.0,,"Very pleasant oasis in a busy city. Worth a visit, but don't expect anything like Kew Gardens London. Good place to take your lunch break as they have an excellent restaurant."
,,"Beautiful, stunning",5.0,,"So many beautiful variety of orchids, well laid out garden well worth the money. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Pretty gardens and ponds,4.0,,Lots of different flowers all clearly labelled. Very nice and free to visit. We walked around and took lots of photos and just enjoyed the casual walk. The entrance is right next to a metro stop (botanic) so very easy to get to and leave.
,,"Love nature, Love this place!",5.0,,"What a beautiful natural place to visit on a nice day. My girlfiends and I had a nice walk and met some new friends here playing different sport games, we love football. My girlfriend was best in her class so we easily win. All the different native trees and flowers all can be found here. Right off the MRT! It's a must for at least a half a day. I read some sign about free music concerts here at the outdoor venue on Sunday's. Hopefully get back to see the show."
,,Trail Walk,5.0,,"Beautiful trail walks, took pictures of swans in the lake. Interesting plants and a great place to do meditation in peace."
,,my favorite place on earth,5.0,,This was my third visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It is so tranquil and beautiful it is my favorite place on earth. The varieties of orchids in the orchid garden and every step through is so beautiful. I cannot say enough about how much I love this place! you have to have lunch at Halia in the Botanic Gardens.
,,One of the best maintained botanical gardens anywhere,5.0,,Visited in Feb 2017. Well maintained and very large botanical gardens with something for everyone. Free entry as well. Also houses a truely amazing orchid garden with a small entry charge. But absolutely worth it. A jewel for Singapore to be truely proud of. An MRT station close by and also on the HoponHopoff buss route.
,,Great spot for long walks n weekend concerts in season,4.0,,"One of my favourite walking spots in Singapore. Its a lovely green oasis in the heart of the city and there are lovely koi ponds, a nice lake, lotus ponds, orchid garden and other flora and fauna to enjoy.

Regular visitors often time their visit when the outdoor concerts are in season. Its lovely for a picnic on the sprawling slopes.
Highly recommend."
,,World class,5.0,,"Beautifully maintained and laid out, with many rare flowers and trees, good explanation of how and why the garden was started, many little pond areas and sculptures to see. defiantly a clear day activity as not much shelter if you get caught in the rain. Wild Orchard exhibition worth while."
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,"Total serenity from the hustle and bustle of Singapore, I spent a good few hours wandering around enjoying the beautiful gardens and if you have the good fortune for a rain free visit it is a gorgeous way to spend half a day."
,,Singapore botanical gardens.,5.0,,"My visit to these gardens was exciting and beautiful. We were brave and used the metro to get there and mananged very well. We were on a cruise ship and the metro was within easy walking distance from the ship. The gardens were very pretty and easy to walk around. There is a lake and all the trees and plants were labelled, and well cared for. At the moment an extension to the children and parents only garden is being built."
,,Wonderful Experiance,5.0,,Visited this whilst on a stop over. A total contrast from the hustle and bustle of the busy city centre. An ideal place to escape from the noise and really beautifully kept and maintained range of exotic plants.
,,Nice places for families & friends,5.0,,Take with you a picnic baskets & there are lots of spaces for the children to play & relax. One of the favourite places to visit for my overseas friends.

,,Another amazing place in the middle of Singapore.,5.0,,"We visited from 9:30am and the park was busy with runners, walkers and those just visiting the park for its beauty. It is a very special place in the middle of Singapore and a must do whilst here.

Remember it does get hot but there was a little breeze the day we visited which was welcome. Sun cream and insect spray is essential.

There are so many areas to visit you could spend hours here. I found it mostly to be a place of peace and quiet.

There are drinks and food places with toilets on most of the main routes through the park. The drinks were welcomed and many others were enjoying lovely looking breakfasts.

Another free must do in Singapore."
,,It's Stunningly Beautiful,5.0,,"Without question, the most beautiful gardens in the world, and I travel a lot. World Heritage Site and a Must See.

MRT access is easy and get there early as there's a lot to take in. If your still adjusting to the Sg weather, take your time, bring a water bottle [use the refill stations] and have lunch. The food is great. Recommend the salmon sandwich and chips [enough for two]. My favorite spots were the orchid and prehistoric gardens. The evening concerts are also special. Check their schedule for days and times."
,,The green lungs of Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of the best maintained green areas I have seen in the middle of a big city like Singapore... The variety of trees, plants, birds and open green spaces sum up to a boon for morning and evening walkers. Well maintained with walkways, a pond, sitting areas, and even dispensing machines..."
,,Exquisite colours and variety.,5.0,,"Please allow three to four hours to absorb and appreciate the magnificence of this urban paradise.
Weather should not preclude a visit unless it is extreme.
We were captivated by the lengths that the Singaporean nation have taken in order to preserve and enhance their botanical heritage.
An absolute MUST SEE if you have but a short time in Singapore."
,,Nice respite from the hustle and bustle,4.0,,"A beautiful park with a wide variety of tropical plants. A visit in the early morning or late afternoon is recommended to avoid the heat and humidity of the day. The map is a bit off so we took some wrong turns, never made it to the orchid garden (admission)."
,,Evening Run after a business trip day,5.0,,Botanical Garden is great for strollers and runners - preferably in the not so hot evening hours. Enjoy the jungle path with water and restaurants along the way.
,,Recollection of your senses or just enjoy a picnic with family together with an outdoor concert on a Saturday afternoon,5.0,,"Always like this place ... we took our kids there for picnics and walks when they were young.
We frequent the concerts too... check the timetable on this. Usually on a Saturday late afternoon. A picnic with outdoor concern ... lovely combination.
Now we take morning walks with a couple of friends just before breakfast.
Beautiful gardens and matured trees and so convenient too ... a lung in the city... breathe!

The Orchid Garden within is filled with beautiful orchids. We go there from time to time. Pictures pictures pictures I couldn't resist even though I have been there quite a few times already. They are just so beautiful.

Enjoy... there is good reasons why this Botanical Gardens is one of the must visits in Singapore"
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Great place to visit but can be tiring on a hot day, which is most of the time. Great exhibits, well signposted and a great visitor centre."
,,Nice place for a walk but nothing more,3.0,,"Nice kept gardens and greenery for a break from urban Singapore. But nothing very fancy, perhaps only the orchid garden.. Lack natural wild life..."
,,Great place to spend a day,5.0,,"Spacious and beautiful, free entrance. Great opportunity to see some plants that are not usual for European areas such as flowering ginger. Easy to reach by subway (Botanic garden station)"
,,A new way of looking at Singapore,5.0,,"Endless stroll of beautiful gardens, flowers, rare birds and versatile settings. Walking alongside the swan lake, looking at the humongous carps in the water and admiring the swans that live there. Makes you really forget that just a couple of meters outside the gardens, is Singapore's busy daily life. Come here for a change of pace and relaxation!"
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,"What a lovely place to visit, you can stroll round at leisure visiting all the different colourful areas. Also visit the Orchid gardens"
,,Great place for a jog,5.0,,"I have very rarely walked through the Gardens, but when I lived in Singapore I ran through them every second day. It was like getting a breath of slightly cooler cleaner and oxygen rich air. The tan is only a couple of km to run through but if you start at the main gate and continue through to the childrens area at the back you can exit into the university grounds and cross the road for a rewarding prata and curry for a couple of dollars at Mr Pratas. Makes the gardens even more appealing when there's a reward at the end!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Spent the afternoon at the botanical gardens. The orchard display was amazing along with all the other beautiful flowers there.
,,World Heritage site,5.0,,"This is a relatively large botanical garden with smaller gardens devoted to a particular theme sprinkled throughout the park. The areas that are more memorable to me are the rainforest walk, the foliage garden, and the orchid garden (separate review on its own). But other areas are quite pleasant to walk through as well."
,,Go in the Morning,5.0,,Way to hot and humid to visit in the morning. I traveled there in the afternoon and finally found a cool place in the orchid garden. Worth a visit for a morning of relaxation.
,,The old botanical garden is the nicest,4.0,,There are 2 botanical gardens Take a tour to the old one which inhabits old trees A beautiful artificial lake and flowers Try to visit in the morning to watch hundreds of people from all ages performing Yoga and Tai Chi
,,Great Gardens,5.0,,"We had a lovely morning walking in the park. The park is free to enter although a small 5 $ charge to enter the Orchid.

The park is very well sign posted and there are park attendants who ask to help you if you look at the park location Map.

There is a lake full of Turtles and as well, with a large section of Bamboo.

Don't forget your sun screen though!☀️☀️☀️☀️"
,,Visiting the orchidarium,5.0,,Wear light clothes and carry an umbrella when visiting the lovely and well appointed Botanical Gardens. As a painter of orchids I am in botanical paradise. Well worth a visit.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens was large and beautiful. The VIP Orchards unique and the plants were labeled to help identify what they were. We went off season so it wasn't overly crowded. Which made it easy to navigate the Gardens.
,,beautiful walk,5.0,,This is one of the most beautiful walks we have done in a long time. You will be stunned by the tropical landscape of the grounds as you make your way to the Orchid Garden area. Take in the rain forest trail as well and be prepared for lots of walking.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,The botanical gardens are breathtaking. A lot to see. I would suggest anyone who comes to Singapore to visit this.
,,A must visit for a trip to Singapore,5.0,,"Always enjoy a slow stroll round these very extensive gardens, the size is quite massive and I see something new each time. There are plenty of places to sit and rest, a few places to get drink and snacks and entry to the National Orchid Garden within is well worth a few dollars.

There is now also an MRT station nearby - perfect to relax and stroll here for a few hours away from the concrete and glass of the city."
,,Tranquility in the city,5.0,,Last visited here back in 2014 and definitely wanted to re-visit this time. The park is free to walk around with a small charge for the orchid garden area. Well worth a visit for both the beautiful surroundings and also the chance to get away from the busy city.
,,Singapore Must If You Enjoy Gardens,5.0,,"Wow! What a great place to visit for exercise and beautiful tropical plants. Well laid out to enjoy the tropical vegetation in a natural setting, we spent two hours touring and enjoyed every moment. Lots of photo opportunities. Easy taxi service."
,,This a good day trip,5.0,,"You don't actually have to pay to get into the Botanic Gardens proper, it is similar to Central Park in New York. There are restaurants and shops on the way back from the MRT station to the National Orchid Garden, which is actually inside the Botanic Gardens.

We didn't have time to see the whole estate (rain), but it is massive and it is well kept and it is worth a day trip here."
,,Orchid heaven,5.0,,"I meant to write this review long ago as I visited this garden last year, but the picture is still very real and amazing. A visit to Singapore without spending time here will be incomplete.This is an old huge and lush garden, with thousands of tropical trees and beautiful orchids as far as your eyes can see. Admission is free and we had an excellent 82-year old guide who walked many kilometres with us and they are almost always open, from 5 am until 12 pm. Orchids, Bromeliad's and other beautiful flowers are all over in abundance . The Orchid Garden within the Botanical Garden and the ""Coolhouse""is not to be missed."
,,"amazing, must visit!",5.0,,"That is a MUST VISIT, even if you are not keen on nature & fresh air. Its a magical place, very beautiful, part of UNESCO world heritage list, a peaceful island inside the vibrant megapolis. Very easy to get even by feet from Orchard road, or taxy or HoponHopOff"
,,Suggestions for improvements to an excellent garden,5.0,,"A fortnight ago, I visited the garden and found it very well laid out with a large variety of vegetation from scrubs, herbal plants, flowering plants and trees both young and very old. A very well managed garden indeed, ideal for making your daily 10,000 steps target!

However, I met with 2 unexpected events. The first was a young child speeding DOWNHILL in a scooter across my path in a 4 way path junction. Had I been a split second faster, I could have injured myself and worse, sent the child flying.
The next event was seeing an adult couple cycling along the footpath.
Subsequent to a near miss incident and witnessing the cyclists, I checked a notice board inside the garden and found that both scooters and bicycles are NOT permitted with the garden.
Hmmmmm."
,,A must see when in Singapore,5.0,,Absolutely wonderful gardens and worth a few hours to explore. The highlight must be the Orchid section (entry $5 but only $1 for seniors). Amazing array of brilliantly coloured and divers flowering plants. Also the rain forrest walk is great but expect a very humid few hours.
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,The Singapore |Botanic Gardens are absolutely beautiful. The themed gardens are exceptional and the orchid display is unbelievable
,,Wonderful city resource,5.0,,"It's Sunday, we went to the botanical gardens today. There were locals everywhere with areas for their day at the park. It is free! We took 429 pictures in four hours. What amazing plants. The Bamboo section, Bromeliads, Foliage plants, fragrant plants, healing plants, oh my. The ginger garden is special, old historic buildings as well as a university campus all on site. We had no children with us but the Children's garden looked magical. Then, there is the National Orchid garden. It costs, but as 60+ we only paid S$1, S$5 usually. Well worth it! I've never seen most of the varieties found there. Then, the VIP section has hybrid orchids named for dignitaries, including William and Catherine of Cambridge, and of course Princess Diana. We saw an owl in a tree, two squirrels, but no lizards."
,,"Huge, welcoming public garden",5.0,,"The garden had the feel of a city park with many families playing and picnicking in this lovely open space. Walkers, joggers and of course, plant lovers took advantage of this beautiful environment. And it's free! Easy taxi drop off and pick up and the city tour busses stop here too. It's so big--no way to do it all in one day, so choose a section or come back for another visit."
,,beautiful even in the rain,5.0,,a beautiful place to walk through. just take your time and enjoy everything it has to offer. Wonderful to see all the plants outside instead of visiting a greenhouse
,,Botanic Gardens in Singapore,4.0,,"A nice tranquil place to relax in Singapore and get away from the humidity. The Gardens are well laid out, beautiful arrangements of the flowers, shrubs and trees"
,,Visit a very large Garden/Arboretum and Orchid Garden,5.0,,"Take a long walk through the large Garden/Arboretum and Orchid Garden. There are many parts to the garden, all worth visiting. The Most stunning is the separate Orchid Garden, there is a small charge but the area a feast of different orchids.
There are a number of restaurants and The Garden Bee Restaurant is good value."
,,One of the best botanic gardens I've ever been in!,5.0,,"It is really wide spread, so bring some time. You can easily spend half a day in there if it is not too hot. There are a lot of different garden themes. The most impressing was the evolution walk, where the history of the earth is pictured with the different stages of plants. Really well made!"
,,A UNESCO World Heritage Site - and its free...,5.0,,"A more than 150 year old garden. A UNESCO World Heritage Site! A large wonderful oasis in the middle of Singapore.

Beautiful surroundings. Frequented by locals, tourists, maids on days off, photography enthusiasts with tripods, other enthusiasts with binoculars, families with children. All without getting crowded, as the gardens cover an area of 72 hectares.

Access is free! What is there not to like?"
,,Interesting gardens and trees but terrible signage!,3.0,,"This is a very nice garden (with no entry fee) with great samplings of Asian flora. The problem we had was with the signage. We never found the bonsai garden, and finding the way out wasn't easy either. There were no guides that we could find, except at the entrance/exit. We did encounter a lovely lady who is local and was very helpful. I did find (after we had left) that there is an online app with a GPS that certainly would have helped...a LOT! Wish I had known beforehand. They should provide that info in their brochure/map, which wasn't very helpful. The only transportation within the garden is your feet. I was exhausted when we finally reached the exit."
,,Must see,5.0,,"These gardens are among the most important in the world. They are the home of orchids and a multitude of hybrids are propagated here. There are steps to a lily pond built by prisoners of war under the Japanese, and many of the trees are 150 plus years old. Grand sweeping lawns. Perfect day out."
,,Garden to die for!,5.0,,"It doesn't often happen that I walk around open mouthed in wonder, but this place did that to me. It was raining heavily, but I didn't care as I enjoyed walking around this paradise so much!"
,,truly Amazing,1.0,,"We were in Singapore in 2015 and 2017. We went on the ealier trip. It is so worth your while, whether or not you are into plants. It is just heavenly and a sight to behold"
,,Amazing greenery and beautiful landscapes!,5.0,,"This place is a must visit for all people who love lush green gardens, greenery and long walks with their loved ones.
Early mornings and evenings are perfect for this place. If you plan to visit on a sunny day, do carry your sun glasses and hats!"
,,historical and botanical,5.0,,"my favorite place of all attractions in singapore. this historical park is beautiful and educational. it deserves being listed world heritage site by unesco.
there is s great collection of exotic ginger and palm. i had never seen many of the plant displayed here anywhere before. food at the garden cafe is wonderful. try the brunch set. it is huge and awesome.

the admission to the park is free, except for the scenic orchid garden."
,,natural botanical beauty,5.0,,"lovely botanical gardens in Singapore, 10 minutes from orchard road. beautiful laid out gardens and flower beds. a must see for tourists, as it brings a balance to any city"
,,Lovely location,5.0,,"The Gardens are well worth a visit. Free entry you pay onlt to enter the Orchid section and for us over 60s that is only $1 ($5 for whippersnappers!) Lots of walking, choose a nice day."
,,Lovely place for an early morning stroll,5.0,,"A beautifully maintained piece of nature in easy access to the city, the gardens are varied and well maintained. For one dollar for Seniors one can view the exquisite Orchid Garden and that is something that should not be missed - beautiful.

Probably best to visit in early morning or perhaps evening as Singapore can get very hot."
,,Very enjoyable,5.0,,The gardens were lovely and it is free to enter (unless you wish to enter the orchid house). It is on the Hop on Hop Off Hippo bus route.
,,What a lovely free visit,5.0,,We have visited Botanic Gardens around the world but this must come up as one of the best and even better entry is free. If you appreciate Gardens please try and give yourself at least half a day here because you will need it. Laid out in sections with park like areas and lakes in between it is a delight. There are toilets and food outlets in many locations and plenty of friendly staff to guide you if required
,,Peaceful,5.0,,Easy to reach by bus or train. Very well maintained and most interesting - the 'labels' on various plants added to the njoyment.
,,Tropical Wonderland,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a tropical paradise. Where-ever you look, it is beautiful. The trees, shrubs, lakes, and lawns provide a peaceful environment to stroll with your loved one, take the family for an outing, or contemplate life alone. Photographic opportunities are countless!

The species diversity is wonderful. There are toilets scattered around the gardens, and a decent assortment of places to buy food and refreshments and receive great service. And most of the gardens are wheelchair accessible too.

Best of all, entry is free! You can walk the length of the gardens in under an hour, but I recommend to set aside at least two hours, if not an entire afternoon, to soak up the tranquility and beauty."
,,Great,4.0,,"I just visited the place yesterday and I must say I enjoyed the place ,it's far much better than the most hype Garden by the Bay.Anyone who wants to visit Singapore I highly recommend to visit the Botanical Garden vs the Garden by the Bay.The Botanical garden has no entrance fee except $5.00 for an adult and $1.00 for senior citizen above 60 years old and you need to show your passport if you are not a Singaporean citizen.Any child below 12 is free.While on the Garden by the Bay ,you will
Pay $28 to see the flower dome and the rain forest dome wc is not worth of what you will pay for."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The gardens are stunning! A must see in Singapore, perfect on a hazy day for some fresh air. Well kept very beautiful."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"There are botanical gardens all over the world and I've visited lots. So there is the rest of the world, and then there's Singapore. In a class by itself, surpassing even Kew Gardens.

A stroll through is to refresh the soul.

And they are open late, parts until midnight so it's good for evening birdwatching and also romantic.

Do not come to Singapore and miss this lush haven in the middle of the city."
,,A nice place for a stroll,4.0,,"The Gardens are not the most exciting, but are a very pleasant place to go for a walk. We were very pleased to be lucky enough to spot two monitor lizards. We didn't bother paying to go in to the Orchid Garden as Singapore is full of orchids and there are plenty of other plants to see."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"On our holidays to Sinapore we always visit these Botanical gardens, We always see something new and its so relaxing walking around. The food at the main gate is of excellent quality and the staff are very polite and always willing to help."
,,Beautiful tropical Botanic Garden steeped in history,5.0,,"This is your classic tropical botanic garden that is actually quite old and unique. It has public transport available by Bus or Train and nearly all the tourist buses have this as one of their stops, so its easy to get to. You can get a park map as you enter and there is more information (on billboards explaining what you are looking at) than you could possibly take in over 1 visit. 2 highlights for us were 'National Orchid Garden' and 'Evolution Garden' and they also have a cool house (instead of hot house) which is hard to get out of on a hot tropical day. Very old mature trees, a beautiful place to visit."
,,not as fantastic,2.0,,Just went in to check but came out as I can't see anything impressive. Probably this is good for children.
,,"Immaculate, An absolute Must!",5.0,,"The Gardens are amazing. The informative plaques are extremely well done. The maintenance of the Gardens is perfect. The staff are pleasant and welcoming. The statues are delightful, both contemporary and classic statues can be found in their perfect location with clear signage describing who, why and when - perfect. It is incredible that there is no charge. An absolute must!"
,,Mike Colliver,5.0,,One of the best places to visit in Singapore but don't go on a day they forecast thunderstorms the skywalk is closed.
,,A city runners haven.,4.0,,Very large garden with lots of different areas. Great for children or to get a bit of training in. We went on the weekend and some areas were quite busy but you could easily find a quit spot a little further in. There is on addition charge and the metro gos to the entrance.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This is a real beautiful place, a must see in Singapore. It is an oasis in that beautiful modern concrete city. Beautiful in the evening when it is lighted. You can buy extra tickets to get to the Skyway. Gardens are directly connected with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. This can be a half day activity."
,,Lovely gardens and free,5.0,,"The gardens are lovely and very peaceful. Free to get in, they are very large but easy to navigate. The lake is great with a beautiful statue of swans. There are a number of different statues and novelty attractions. Sometimes if is not easy avoiding the people taking annoying selfies."

,,Awesome,5.0,,"Crasy. So clean, so huge, so nice. Please continue, this place is magic. Let run, walk and take a rest there."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"A place of silence and nature in this loud city. But it's worthy to visit, no question about this. Ca easily be reached by 2 lines of the MRT within some minutes. The entrance is free, the gardens are wonderful, and with an extra fee of S$ 5 per adult you will be able to visit the world's greatest collection of orchids , an outstanding impression. I've been there for the 2nd time, and was again overwhelmed from these magnificient collection of flowers."
,,Wonderful peaceful place,5.0,,"These gardens are so beautiful, especially the Orchid garden, which only costs SGD 5 to get into (SGD 1 for over 60). Loveliest gardens we have ever seen."

,,FANTASTIC,5.0,,It combines technology with natural! Amazing flowers inside:) my wife loved it! Perfect place for photos
,,Botanical gardens,5.0,,"Loved it. I'm into horticulture, worked in the industry. Easy to get to via train, like most places in Singapore. I was traveling with a 13 year old and a couple of 20 somethings. They enjoyed it, I thought there would be moaning not long after we got there! We managed about 4 hours though, till it started to get hot."
,,Beautiful themed garden areas,5.0,,"We have been to many gardens, but this one is so interesting with many varied areas to see. Most of the trees are labelled and are fascinating to the western eye. Nice cafes dot around the garden to give you a rest. And of course includes the orchid collection, which is a must see."
,,More for working out,1.0,,Hardly any flowers. Most people doing tai chi and walking. Hardly any flowers or exhibits. It's free and opens at 5 am and shuts at 12 am. That should speak for itself
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,We had a lovely walk through the gardens with our kids! They are doing some renovations while we were there. My children absolutely loved the children's garden. There are slides and fun stuff for them to do there. They even have kid size toilets! My toddler thought that was really fun!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,These garden are well worth a vist. Just found it a little too hot to walk around so try visiting early in the morning when it's cooler.

Gorgeous stage for different performance like symphony of Singapore most time free performances.If like plant or interested in botanics this is a place for you.
Recommend this place."
,,Best Garden Ever,5.0,,"One of most beautiful garden in the world and the place is stunning in each corner with nice Organization and so clean
The staff so helpful
The entrance is free and they open from early morning 5 am till 12 midnight but better to come in day so you can observe all the beauty
We spent 3 hours inside walking all over and we didn't feel the time
Enjoy"
,,As spectacular as advertised,5.0,,"Many times I visit an attraction only to be disappointed. This is a rare case where my expectations were exceeded. Make sure to walk the rain forest trail and set aside a minimum of 90 minutes for the orchid garden.
Also, why would anyone name something so beautiful ""Golden Shower Arches""? This has nothing to do with McDonalds nor that other activity."
,,"So much to see, so much to learn",5.0,,A really enjoyable experience. We spent over three hours in the gardens and felt we had seen but a small amount of what was on offer. The themed gardens were well laid out and the plants and tress clearly labelled. An added bonus was its proximity to the MRT. Be prepared for a great day out.
,,Quiet garden in city Centre,5.0,,"Just a piece of untouched jungle garden around which the city is built.
The garden is close to city centre and amazingly free of city noise.
You cannot imagine you are in the middle of a metropolitan city centre when you walk around here. Orchid Garden (in the botanic Garden) is also a must.
It is easily reachable by MRT , bus and taxi and you can easily spend half a day there."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"These gardens are beautiful and well tended. The highlight is the Orchid Garden, for which there is a 5 S dollar charge, but it is definitely worth paying. The number and variety of orchids is stunning. A must-see in Singapore."
,,Lovely park,5.0,,"This huge garden is well worth visiting. Be prepared to walk and walk. It is more natural than Gardens by the Bay which seems to be more man-made (although beautiful in its way). The gardens are divided into different sections so it doesn’t seem quite so overwhelming. The Orchid Gardens are worth seeing although there is a small admission charge. The gardens are a tremendous asset to Singapore, providing a calm, green atmosphere in the middle of the bustling city."
,,An Absolute Delight,5.0,,"We visited the Botanical Gardens last Sunday - and what an absolute delight. Very large gardens - well maintained, and FREE (except the Orchid Section, which has only a nominal entrance fee). Unfortunately, a couple of old trees had blown over in the morning, so parts of the Gardens were out of bounds. Probably the best Botanical Gardens that I have ever visited. Highly recommended."
,,Beautiful garden area in Singapore,5.0,,"A very large area of gardens, lawns and water features. From the Metro or the bus stop it is 1.3km, or nearly a mile to the centre of the park, and then return. Probably not an activity for those unfit, or on very hot days. You could easily spend a half day here. Very relaxing."
,,Smoke-free garden with unique gardens and ponds.,4.0,,"Need leg strength to stoll the place, But many unique spots to explore and surprises to delights. Bring towel, umbrella and water."
,,Nice Afternoon Visit,5.0,,"We stayed for most of the afternoon, I was really impressed that this was a free attraction unless you wanted to visit the orchid garden ($5 or $1 if you are over 60). Saw quite a bit of wildlife too - sunbirds and lizards, some of the lizards were quite large. Enjoyed the cafe which was good value."
,,Nice way to spend the afternoon !,4.0,,"Whilst on our family trip to Singapore we enjoyed taking the children for a walk around the park. The grounds were well manicured and clean. There are a few cafes/restaurants within the gardens which can be a easily found on the maps provided.
If mosquitoes are easily attracted to you I would recommend using repellents whilst here."
,,A lovely quiet space in a busy city,5.0,,"Plenty of places to sit and contemplate. Lots of beautiful flowers and birds. Be careful of trees during or after storms as they drop branches and even fall (as happened the day we visited).
There are maps at most path junctions so you can just wander around as you wish."
,,Overhyped,2.0,,It is an average place just about good enough for a lazy afternoon. Definitely not a must see if you are a tourist. This is more for residents who have seen all the other awesome things Singapore has to offer.
,,City Oasis,4.0,,Lovely park in the middle of a bustling metropolis. Not really my thing but was nice to get out of the shopping malls that dominate Singapore and have a look at something else. Quite a big park so bring your walking shoes.
,,Jsharp,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore and like flowers and gardens, this is a must see! It has one of the finest orchard gardens in the world and the fee to enter the orchard garden for 60+ is 1 Singapore dollar , you can spend the entire day in just the orchard garden, but the health garden and ginger garden are great to see, bring your camera for you will take 100's of photo's"
,,Hidden Gem!,5.0,,This place is a nice surprise. Plan enough time for your visit. Don't say that it sounds boring because it is amazing!
,,Most beautiful orchid garden,5.0,,"The entire park is a wonderful place to visit. Walking, jogging, pickinicking, or just Chilling out. The Orchid Garden is our favorite place. You have to pay to enter that area, but it is definitely worth it. You can also have. A guided tour, which is nice if you want to learn about the many types of orchids and how they have been genetically engineered. One piece of advice: bring an umbrella with you. Two out of three times we visited it poured rain! Not uncommon in Singapore."
,,oustanding.. but bring plenty to drink!,5.0,,"fantastic place which we visited twice whilst here. it is best avoided after a rain shower as the mossies seem more active.. wear loads of DEET. otherwise, allow a good 3 hours and a gentle pace"

,,"Saturday - a lot of people, but real nice park",4.0,,"Had only some hours to spend, so I walked there for some silence ina green park. Oh what a misconception, on a sunny saturday, you are not with yourself in a park in Singapore - bad luck.
My dault probably, the park itself is nice and constructed in a way that it appears much bigger. Some theme gardens, like fragrance or foliage, make it a nice place and also a chance to learn some new."
,,Use insect repellent!,5.0,,"We took a taxi to the Botanical gardens because they are slightly out of the city centre. It's free to enter and is very big. The staff are helpful and a map is necessary.
There is wildlife in the park roaming free such as very large water monitors. The insects buzz throughout the day so a good insect repellent is a must. Plenty of water and a sun shade are also sensible precautions.
The national Orchid garden is a must see and costs 5 dollars to get in. The displays are beautiful.
Be careful not to walk too far it is exhausting in the heat.
We were very glad we went."
,,SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDENS,5.0,,Beautiful gardens well worth visiting.... highlight was the orchid gardens (you have to pay for this) where I lost at least an hour because I wanted to see and take pictures of everything! Can easily relax and spend the day here .... take a picnic!

One must visit the garden if you want to rejuvenate yourself from all the technological stress.

,,For all plant lovers,4.0,,"The botanical gardens of Singapore are delightful, there are hundreds of specimens of trees, shrubs and plants. Of particular interest is the orchid house, although there is a small admission fee for this. Keep your eyes peeled for the orchids that grow up the trunks of some of the trees. There is a feature called Swan Lake, but we did'nt see any swans, just a lot of algae,"
,,Singapore's Botanic Garden,5.0,,"What can I say about these beautiful gardens that has not already been said. Within these meticulously kept gardens lie some of the most beautiful specialist gardens I have had the privilege to see - the Orchid Gardens and the specialist Ginger Gardens.
Singapore is a fairly hot place to visit but the humidity is killer. I suggest that you give yourself at the very minimum a half day to walk around these gardens and take plenty of water with you. There are many places to sit and relax out of the direct sunlight but do yourself a favour and take your time to enjoy the experience. Just quietly, the little restaurant in the grounds near the Orchid Gardens is quite expensive so I suggest you take some snacks and get something to eat after you leave the gardens. Good experience and highly recommended."
,,Relaxing twilight walk,5.0,,Lovely in the twilight when the last of the day's sunlight filters through the trees and monitor lizards amble across the paths.
,,A Tranquil and Peaceful Environment,5.0,,"Have visited Singapore Botanic gardens on many occasions and to visit this attraction is a truly peaceful experience in a busy City. As with other things in Singapore, getting there is easy and cheap using public transport so I would recommend getting there this way.
The 'jewel in the crown' of this attraction is the Royal Orchid garden' which is a must see.The most beautiful orchids of every kind are on display and they are well presented in beautiful arrangements of many differing types.
Take a picnic and enjoy a day out there. It caters for every age group whether you or old and there is a children's play and water park available for the little ones.
If in Singapore head to these tranquil gardens for a great day out."

,,Perfect morning in lush nature!,5.0,,"Spent a recent Saturday at the Botanical Gardens and enjoyed every minute. There is so much variety, tons of different paths, grassy areas, forested areas, ponds, streams, trees, flowers, benches, gazebos, restaurants, and gift shop. You can walk for hours on end and never get bored. Easy to access with many entrances. And the best part is it's all free. I have been to many such gardens and this one is hands down the most beautiful and comprehensive. Don't forget to go to the National Orchid Garden as well. Entry is $5 and it's a steal!"
,,A great Place to Visit Away from Hustle & Bustle of the City,5.0,,"We took the MRT (Metro Rapid Transit) to the Botanical Gardens which is situated in the far northwest part of Singapore. It takes a bit of time to get there & you may have to transfer lines depending where you are staying. The MRT station is close to the Gardens & you walk along a long pathway to arrive at the central area of the gardens. Along the way there are sections of the garden where various flora & plants are situated. It's a nice, calm walk which provides you with plenty of open space to view the park & gardens. After walking 30-45 minutes through the park & gardens you arrive at a concession area where you can stop for drinks & snacks. The Orchid Garden is closeby where you can pay a reasonable entrance fee to explore the many varieties of orchids. I highly recommend a visit to the orchid garden section where you can roam & marvel at the colourful & beautiful selection of orchids. This is a photographers paradise for taking macro shots of the plants! You can take an alternate route back to the MRT station and view a different section of the gardens."
,,Our very own UNESCO World Heritage Site,5.0,,"Love the wonderful sights, the luscious greenery, fresh air and wonderful relaxation in our very own UNESCO World Heritage garden."

However, if you're a senior, it's only S$1 - and we didn't need to show an ID either! Just ask for the senior discount. The orchid gardens, which were split up into different sections, were beautiful. Outside, they also had a small bonsai garden, but part of it was locked off. It was nice and peaceful just walking around."
,,"Lovely garden, worth a visit",4.0,,"Went for a morning jog during my recent visit.

I was hoping to see more of the special orchids but they were just regulars one that you find it in USA.The planting lay out could be MORE creative. Have to pay for both entrances.If you enjoy nature that's ok to try it once, or twice with a picnic by the pond."

,,Lamenting the Loss of An Iconic 270 Year-old Tembusu National Heritage Tree!,5.0,,"Nothing much could be done by the NParks to bring back the fond memory of the painful loss of this 270-year-old iconic landmark in Singapore Botanic Gardens, much cherished by our late Mr.Lee Kuan Yew all his life.
Perhaps, our top NParks trees experts should wake up now to study the causes which have led to the repeated collapses of these particular tree species to prevent further losses.
On records, another younger but equally towering national heritage Tembusu within the ""city oasis"" named The Birds Hill in Spottiswoode Park was brought down during the monsoon just a few years ago..."

We loved the gazebo at Swan Lake, seeing all the different orchids and learning about different trees and plants along the paths. Very well maintained and clean. A must see!"
,,Great place to relax,4.0,,Its quite a walk away from the city centre but the environment is clean. The singapore heat is not always the best for picnics in a garden but still enjoyable once in a blue moon. Do remember your mosquito repellants when you visit.
,,"Best place to exercise, laze and enjoy the green",5.0,,"It's hard to tire of a green space such as this. Try at different times of day specially during the cooler hours. If you want to spoil yourself, complete it with a meal at Corner House.

,,It's amazing! AND it's free!!,5.0,,"There are only three UNESCO Botanic Gardens in the world. And one is here in Singapore. The MRT drops you right beside it. We spent 3 hours taking lots of photos, walking leisurely, and enjoying the incredible scenery. Lots of great history to soak up, too. For example, this is where the cultivation of rubber trees was first successfully begun. And the orchard garden, all by itself, is well worth the trip."

The direct MRT access makes this venue much more accessible now for every visitor. The only downside is the humid equatorial weather but there are enough tourist shops and F&B venues to escape the heat and cool down to a drink or bite. Don't miss this attraction if you love flowers and gardens.

Deepest condolences to the Indian lady and her family who were affected by the fallen tree in the Gardens recently."

,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful place for a romantic picnic or to explore nature. Very accessible via train or buses. Recommended
,,Step back in time to the primary rainforest,5.0,,Few patches of Singapore’s primary rainforests remain so the opportunity to walk through the rainforest in the Singapore Botanic Gardens gives a wonderful insight into how it would have looked before development.

The Orchid garden inside, is by far the loveliest garden I've been to (almost rivalling the Moghul gardens in Srinagar, India). The entrance for the Orchid garden is S$5 which is more than worth it!
Do spend a few hours there if in the city. There are little areas for picnickers too so pack up some sandwiches n beers and head over..."

,,Visit to Singapore Botanical Gardens,4.0,,"Singapore Botanical Gardens is very easily accessible by local bus, a taxi or cab, or even by the MRT located next to it. Best to visit early during the early morning when its not so hot or also just before the hours of the setting sun. During both these periods, one can see the joggers, walkers , families, having a lovely time doing their 'thing' there. As you move around this whole garden, you will notice the hundreds of flora and fauna which were purposely put in their places, to enhance the natural and green surroundings. Almost every plant, tree or flowering plant is accompanied with information about them. The visitor will not be left in question about any plant which is not familiar to them. One of the most delightful activity is to be able to just spread a mat and have a family picnic at any part of the garden you like.
It's a refreshing place to be and its just about 10 minutes taxi ride from the busy, glamorous Orchard Road area. If driving, there is ample parking space at the front entrance underground carpark.

,,Oasis of Calm,5.0,,"We visited the Botanic Gardens in Singapore on Sunday over the Chinese New Year weekend. We thought that it might be busy, but because of the vastness of the gardens, people were well distributed around and so it as a pleasure just to wander from one area to another. The various 'themed' gardens were very interesting, particularly the Evolution Garden, which was amazing. As for the orchids, they were STUNNING - so many different specimens and colours and the placing of them was so well planned. A great way to relax and unwind in bustling Singapore."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,We spent two half dats exploring the gardens inducing visits to the orchid gardens and lunch at Casa Verdi ( reviewed elsewhere) time well spent

We visited this time via the Big Bus tour which stops here on its route or you can get to it from the MRT although it's about 1 kilometre through the park to the orchids but well worth it.

We walked through the parks and couldn't believe how many species of different trees, shrubs and plants there is. There was families having picnics, people of all ages doing exercises and walking or running their dogs. Every where is so clean no litter or dog poo.

A truly beautiful amazing place to visit"

The botanic gardens is a great way to escape the chaos of the city . So tranquil & beautiful, we had a wonderful morning taking our time to appreciate the beauty to the gardens.

,,Sunday Morning Walk on 5 Feb 2017,5.0,,"This morning, woke up early, showers to make efforts to enjoy a morning walk at Botanic Garden.

Walked the garden with little pet dog. Greenery, morning dew, cool fresh air, birds chirping, cocks crowing, falling water were nature therapy helping to heal the tired body. Spotted there's also a Valentine event in the garden next weekend.

Saw few groups of people performing morning exercises and taiji together.

Walked by the little pond to find some lotus flowering. Really a cool relaxing walk. Feeling going to be a good day ahead.

Enjoyed."
,,Gorgeous Gardens,4.0,,Terrific location for photo enthusiasts. Lots of area to walk. The humidity made it a bit uncomfortable. A very nice gift shop and the Orchid Garden is not to be missed. I took the Hop on Hop Off bus. Very convenient.

This entire area is massive and truly spectacular!! Takes a lot of walking to see it all but truly worth the time.

,,My Favorite Place in Singapore,5.0,,"I have been to Singapore Botanic Gardens multiple times and I still find this world heritage place fascinating. This round we decided to have breakfast in the garden before we start to stroll in the huge garden. The food in the Casa Verde cafe is good and of course we love the ambiance.
We were lucky as the National Orchid Garden was free of charge for citizens, PRs, senior citizens and students (so I'm the only one have to pay). Do make sure you visit the VIP Orchid Garden for all the outstanding orchid hybrids."

We can easily get there by MRT. Once we were in there, we completely forget the chaos from outside world. It is very lush, green foliage and undulating. The frangipani garden is great to walk around or rest and enjoy the garden on the swings. Toilet is clean and hidden so you don't see it. There is coffee shop in the middle of the Garden where you can buy cinnamon and spices icy cold coffee, it loads with sugar but it gives you lots of energy you need."
,,Magical gardens,5.0,,"The two domes are home to a fantastic worldwide collection of new plants and flowers and the higher dome, trees collection, offers a fantastic walk path where plants and trees can be admired from the top, a rather unusual view.
Try to go around late afternoon about 30 minutes before the garden closes for the day, when the watering if the trees starts. The thin water sprayed from above the trees creates a magical and very atmospheric effect enhanced by the perfectly placed lights."
,,must visit for Singapore. Take a walk and chill.,5.0,,beautiful gardens. check out the old growth trees that are huge. The restaurant at the visitor centre is pretty good. Have the Laksa: surprisingly authentic.

Be it for a leisurely stroll, a jog or brisk walk , it is a place where you feast your eyes on the vibrant colours of the blooms while relaxing amidst the lush greenery .

You can jog around here, of course. The information about the plants is clear enough, they have so many kinds of garden. My favorite was foliage garden, because there were many pretty plants with pretty leaves."
,,NO 1 place to visit,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic is one of the best place to visit while in Singapore steep in history (over a 150 years) rich in culture and floral it's world heritage place... visit it in the morning or late afternoon this place have a zen effect.. of leaving the bustling and hustling far behind feel.. it's it priceless, take a walk in the garden it's fascinating, peaceful and have a calming effect, with flowers and trees you never know exist... highly recommended and don't forget the crown jewel ""the national orchid garden"" only next door..another MUST visit while in singapore... remember to bring an umbrella..."
,,a gardeners dream,5.0,,"What a fabulous place. So clean and well organised plenty of gardeners sweeping leaves and keeping everything pristine. Well laid out with lots of hidden seating.....and it's free. Lots of families around but it's so big it doesn't busy.
Loved it but we could only stay for a few hours as it was so hot and humid it becomes tiring."

We highly recommend a visit."

,,Stunning botanic garden,5.0,,"The botanic garden is a great escape from the busy Singapore streets. It has an amazing rainforest - rare to find in a capitol city - and sprawling grass, ponds and a fab stage almost surrounded by water. It is free to visit although there is a small charge for the orchid collection which is said to be stunning (time prohibited me from this gem, next time). It is listed by UNESCO and is a must see."
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,We went and it was raining fairly hard . A large umbrella solved that problem and our enjoyment of these beautiful gardens was not spoilt at all. On a sunny day it would definitely be one of the must see's in Singapore.
,,Beautiful garden and concept,5.0,,"The walk and the very relaxing water feature that is from top to the bottom of the floor is very relaxing and soothing.

The wooden artifacts made from recycled wood are equally interesting.
The flowers are beautiful.
Very good views of the whole city and great picture moments.
Must SEE"
,,Favorite place to go for a run.,4.0,,"I lived in Singapore for 2-1/2 years, about one mile from the Botanical Gardens. It quickly became my favorite place to go for a run in the morning. The many miles of paths and the variety of trees/flowers made it a truly rejuvenating experience."
,,Beautiful serenity,5.0,,"So beautiful place, peaceful, well taken care of, clean, relaxing. Take a picnic basket with you and enjoy the garden. Or if you have just an hour, go there anyway. A quick walk through garden is nice as well as a longer stay."
,,Awesome Orchids,4.0,,"Having a lot of Orchids at home (uk) , I wanted to see the display here. I was a bit disappointed they didn't have more species but the ones they do have are awesome."
,,Lost in heaven,5.0,,Being suprised when we first came in. It is such a huge complex that few hours seems not enough. There are plenty of floral species in which the orchids are the best one to us. It is nice place to relax and enjoy the nature.
,,Afternoon walk,4.0,,"Went for a walk after lunch in the gardens. Really well done and free if you do not want to do the high level walk among the artificial trees!, or go into the two pavilions. These cost $28 for the three as a package. As Singapore is very hot and humid it is nice as there is some shade. A good place to go."
,,Excellent for all the family,5.0,,"Beautifully kept, immaculate gardens and free to enter with very small additional charge for the National Orchid Garden, but worth it. Easily accessible by local transport,stops at entrance."
,,Wow,5.0,,Just amazing!!!! I don't know much about flowers but I can appreciate beauty and this place was spectacular. I'd move to Singapore just to walk through here everyday. Free entry but the orchid garden costs $5 entry. It's well worth it though.
,,"A must see in Singapore, the orchids are amazing",5.0,,"I visited the botanic gardens one afternoon. They are quite large and we surely did not see everything! The orchid exhibit is amazing, there is a reasonable fee to see the Orchids, but it is worth every penny."
,,Nice stroll for a day activity,4.0,,"Had a lovely afternoon walking through the botanical gardens. The plants and flowers are nice and there's joy for bird watchers too! Easy to reach by MRT and every thing is very clean. The Orchid Garden is a lovely extra and when the Singapore weather is too much for you, spend a few minutes to look at the cool house which has some wonderful special plants and trees. This place is a very good way to get away from all the shopping in Singapore."
,,Super experience!!,5.0,,"Within the city and yet so serene and peaceful!! Infinite collection of flora & fauna. Just sit there & relax. And have a nice ice cream. Ofcourse, it is a very clean place like rest of Singapore."
,,An essential part of any visit to Singapore,5.0,,"If you visit Singapore and only have time for one excursion you must make it the Botanic Gardens. For a start they are free to go into but much more important they are truly spectacular. Huge ancient trees, lakes, a rain forest board walk, turtles, fish, chickens and if you are lucky a monitor lizard or two slinking along the path or bathing in the waters. There are cafes and restaurants, waterfalls ( man made) creeks, streams and even a desert. Just wander through and be inspired."
,,must see,5.0,,these gardens are lovely and is well planned and very well maintained. this garden is very large and takes a whole day to see
,,Best botanic garden ever,5.0,,"I am not a major fan of botanical gardens, however this one was awesome. Great stroll around the park and free. Easy subway or bus ride to the gardens."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Wonderful variety of Orchids, well laid out grounds , not on my list of primary attractions to see in Singapore but well worth the visit if you have the time."
,,"Stunning gardens, but allow lots of time.",5.0,,The gardens are amazing. Wear walking shoes and just enjoy a casual explore through the gardens. If you take the MRT it drops you off right at one of the entrances which is very handy. Would definitely recommend. Requires about a full morning.
,,UNESCO World Heritage Site,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens was founded 156 years ago, and is the only tropical garden, to be honored as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 74 hectares in size, it would take a keen visitor at least half a day to cover all its main feature areas.

The variety of plant of flora and fauna is amazing, and the park is very well organised and friendly to both the casual stroller as well as to those seeking exercise throughout the day. It's best visited early in the morning though, given Singapore's hot typical climate. However, once you're in the areas with heavy overhead foliage it's actually quite cool even during the hottest parts of the day, so perhaps you could arrange your walk as such.

There are also a variety of dining options available in the park, from fine dining (dinner) to casual food courts. Some of the establishments are dog-friendly too.

Well recommended place to visit whilst you're in Singapore."
,,A must see,5.0,,The gardens are immaculate and the orchids are absolutely stunning. A large area with beautiful walks. Free entry to gardens 5$ entry to orchid area Some lovely restaurants on site.
,,Unesco world heritage gardens,5.0,,It would be easy to spend 3 days in the gardens. There is so much to see. Truly a wonder of the world and worth visiting.
,,Lovely,5.0,,"You know you are going to like a place when you read"" this is a non smoking garden"".
The gardens are just lovely to walk throughout and relax in. They are beautifully kept and there is good signage. There are places to eat but I haven't tried them . Access is free and it is open until very late at night. It is a favourite for joggers so beware!"
,,Lovely to stroll around.,5.0,,"Lovely to just walk around. Beautiful Plant, trees and flowers to look at. I recommend paying for the Orchid house, so many varieties. otherwise the majority is free to view."
,,Orchid Garden is must see,5.0,,"Do not miss these gardens if you love flowers, water, trees and a walk though gardens. Orchids of all colors in the special garden for a small fee. This was the second visit for me and I would go again."
,,Allow plenty of time,4.0,,"The gardens are very large with a wide range of exhibits, particularly enjoyed the lake areas and the orchids. Also some fantastic heritage trees. The weather can get very hot and humid on some days, if so I would recommend a walk around the Evolution and Healing gardens where you can get some shade. Very popular with locals particularly for early morning exercise, when you might even encounter one of the Monitor Lizards. Has its own MRT stop"
,,Have Walking Shoes!!!,5.0,,This is an amazing experience! Make sure you have comfortable shoes for all of the walking that you will do. This is a very tropical place so the flowers will blow you away!
,,Day visit to the garden,5.0,,"This place is huge... if anyone's planning to visit the gardens, please make sure you have a day to spend there. My favorite part of course was their orchid garden. Just so you understand once you enter the garden it's a further 2 km walk to get to the orchid section.

It's a very peaceful and beautiful place and of course is maintained exceptionally well. They do have some very interesting landscaping and a vast variety of trees and plants and flowers.

Amazing place that will leave you with good memories."
,,Wildlife!,5.0,,"The garden is huge - and not only shows lots and lots of impressive plants but wildlife as well. Within half a day we met uncountable huge butterfllies, squirrels, sunbirds (and other birds of cours), giant beetles (yuck!), an oriental whipsnake and a monitor lizard about 1.2m long."
,,Nice place to get clean air,4.0,,Very close to the Botanic Gardens MRT station. Very green and nice to get clean air. There is lake with black swan.
,,A city garden,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens in the middle of the city are wonderful. We used the MRT to get there and it deposited us at the gates. We spent four hours exploring. It is well sign posted and a guide map is available free of charge.
They are well laid out and the paths lead to many different areas. They are beautifully maintained and ongoing investment is taking place.
There are plenty of places to sit and rest if required and visitor centres supply facilities!
The Orchid Gardens are beautiful and are 5 dollars or only one dollar if you are over 60."
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"The paradise garden in the city. Majestic trees! Plants of tropical rain forest. Flowers that bloom. For lovers of nature and tranquillity, a must visit. A place for the family, a place to wake your dog, a place to be and breathe the beauty of nature."
,,My Sanctuary,5.0,,"I prefer this old Botanic Gardens to the newer Gardens by The Bay. There's a charm about the place, perhaps because of my many memories of it since childhood. The attractions here are not as ""big"" as the ones at Gardens by The Bay, but are no less significant: National Orchid Garden, Shaw Symphony Stage (sometimes with live concerts on Sundays), Ginger Garden, Swan Lake, Jacob Ballas Children's Garden, the 5-dollar tree (the tree is photographed on the back of our $5 bill) NParks Library, etc... My favourite is the Tropical Rainforest trail. In one visit, one can learn so much about tropical flora. There are so many little nooks, twists & turns in the track, yet it's pretty easy to find one's way around, as the Botanical Garden is small. If one has in mind to have a picnic, there are plenty of open spaces to set oneself down. In the area nearer to Jacob Ballas Children's Gardens, there are even sheltered Gazebos & a second swan lake with black swans. There are a few cafés and restaurants serving mostly intercontinental fare, though they're rather pricey. I enjoy the Botanic Gardens as a personal sanctuary from the concrete jungle without."
,,Tropical Splendour,5.0,,"From the moment we arrived we were struck by the lush flora. It is green and lush. I would recommend the Orchid Garden to anyone visiting. It does incur a small cost to enter but it us beautiful. I would also recommend taking the rainforest walk. We saw squirrels (or what looked like squirrels), a couple of wacky owls (yes, that is there name) and a hornbill bird. It was amazing. It does get hot so take your water. We ate at the cafe at the entrance and chose meals from the Singapore section. They were nice. As we walked towards the Orchid Garden we saw a restaurant (appeared to be affiliated with Raffles) and it offered some dining deals which seemed quite good. All up, a must if you are travelling to Singapore. We travelled to and from the gardens on the hop on & hop off bus-worth investing in."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Could spend several days there - the Orchid garden (pay to enter ) is superb . Early mornings a good time to visit.
,,Amazing! A must-see,5.0,,"Free to visit (outside the orchid garden, which is totally worth the money and is inexpensive). Splendid array of plants, wildlife and forestry to see. It can get very hot, so pack plenty of bottled water and sunscreen. There is an amazing concert stage as part of the gardens, so it is worth checking ahead to see if there is anything on as the acoustics and atmosphere are fantastic."
,,Stunning,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are absolutely beautiful and a great place to learn more about plants and trees whilst being surrounded by nature.
,,nice spot for a peaceful walk,5.0,,"We had a great time here. it was the highlight of our visit and certainly one of the nicest botanic parks we have been too. the quiet refreshing walks, albiet a bit humid, but that is what rain forest walks are supposed to be. stay hydrated."
,,Green side of town,4.0,,"Great place to stroll around peacefully and get off from hazzle dazzle in city. Interesting plants and trees. Good, different kind of paths to get to know."
,,This is also a must,5.0,,"Beautifully laid out and worth a visit. Watch out for the Monitor Lizards, some are more than a metre long (completely harmless)"
,,Beautiful garden well worth a visit,5.0,,The botanical garden of Singapore is a beautiful garden well worth visiting. Because of its size you never have a crowded feeling. The orchard garden is magnificent! All is well maintained. It's great for an early morning run!
,,Really lovely,4.0,,"Be prepared to walk a lot! I suppose that goes without saying, but we felt a little exhausted after our trek thru the gardens. We entered from the botanic gardens metro stop, and just wondered right in. Definitely swing through the rain forest, it was a delightful experience. And many of the small side gardens were pretty to view. Since the orchid section had an entrance fee, we decided to skip it. If you get down to the opposite end of the garden from the metro entrance, there is a free shuttle that will take you to the Holland Village metro stop, which we did and found it an awesome surprise. Make sure you also bring a bottle of water, there is one vending machine near the visitor center, otherwise the restaurants are all pretty fancy and sit down… If that's what you were looking for."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"My fave part is the National Orchid Garden --- just beautiful. But the whole place is just beautifully-curated and well-managed. Lots of beautiful trees, flowers and even birds. We saw an owl and a toucan. Warning: boys might get bored with this kind of tour. My husband is not the orchid-appreciating type so i had to keep talking to him to keep him interested. Make sure to follow this up with an activity that he would like. Have your camera ready! It's an awesome place to take photos. I highly recomment the mist garden in the Orchid Garden. Beautiful blooms."
,,A must visit better than gardens by the bay,5.0,,"Just beautiful and breathtaking, can't be skipped. Too bad there was rain during our visit but you could notice the attention and organization into making it a world class botanical garden. We enjoyed the native species to the region. The orchid garden has an entry fee of 5 SGD but worth it. Go and spend a few hours here to escape the hustle and bustle of the city."
,,"Marvellous place, you can spend your day here",5.0,,"This place offers a large variety of sights, landscapes and numerous places to lounge and relax. There is also a surprising fauna: we saw a hornbill upclose and a very green snake, beside the many monitor lizards and birds, and the ponds are swarming with turtles and (huge) catfish. Even without visiting the (paying) orchid garden, there is a lot to enjoy and it is a very lovely place. You can spend your whole day here."
,,Definitely worth visiting,5.0,,These are magnificent Botanical Gardens and easily reached by cab or on the MRT North line [Botanical Gardens Station]. The Orchid Garden within the main gardens is spectacular. Allow 2-3 hours to enjoy adequately. It is about 2.5 km in length.
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,Had a short trip to the gardens and were impressed by the orchids. Would liked to have spent longer but what we saw we were impressed with.
,,Beautiful gardens!,5.0,,"A truly fabulous botanical garden, most of which is free to the public. A serene and peaceful place to explore, with many different ""themed"" areas. There is a small fee for the orchid garden but it is well worth - truly stunning displays of these delightful flowers in so many shapes and colors. I can easily understand why it is one of only 2 UNESCO World Heritage Botanical Gardens. A great day out and easily accessible via public transport."
,,An oasis in town,5.0,,This botanic garden is well kept and very easy accessible. There are various themes in the park and it is truly an oasis in a busy city.
,,Perfect place to visit in Singapore,4.0,,An amazing Botanical Garden this is a must see on your list of things to do on a trip to Singapore. Perfect for Families or just for s singleton to stroll through - everyone will enjoy!
,,Don't leave Singapore without visiting here,5.0,,"I came here at 5:00am in the morning after an early flight not knowing what to do.
This place is amazing! You can see a lot of cool plants here and the temperature is really comfortable from the shades of the trees. Come here early morning! You feel like the whole garden is your private range."
,,Great way to spend a day,5.0,,"Very lovely gardens and it is open and free to the public except the Orchard Gardens which has a small fee. If you like orchids, it is worth it. Ensure to be prepared for rain as it can come and go anytime during the day."
,,Beautiful garden in the city!,5.0,,"It is worth waking up early and go at 8 am in this magnificent garden and see all the different groups of Tai Shi, practicing with fans or swords or just with their hands! The Orchid garden is beautiful, I would not miss it!"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"It is one the best botanic gardens in Singapore. Very serene and peaceful! We went to the gardens in the morning, it was worth spending a couple of hours there, took away all our travel stress. They also have a good cafe located in the vicinity. It is absolutely worth visiting, I would visit the gardens any given day!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Always visit the botanics when in Singapore, and always discover a new part. It's huge! Lots of construction work near the children's area, but not a big problem."
,,A nice walk,3.0,,The botanic gardens were a nice walk and the gardens are very well kept. Unfortunately we went when it was raining so not the most comfortable day!

Away from the all the noise of the city. This place is a perfect one to relax and chill on a weekend."
,,Stunning gardens - not to be missed,5.0,,"Though I'm sure always rather hot and humid to be wandering in Singapore, these gardens are an absolute haven in the busy city, and not to be missed. We explored the most stunning orchid garden I've ever seen anywhere (small entrance fee), cooling foliage gardens, a myriad of tropical flowering trees and little paths to romantic gazebos dotted around...also a lake with fish, turtles and huge swimming lizards, highly impressive to the teenager!"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"We walked through the Botanic Gardens during our recent visit to Singapore. To say that it is beautiful is an understatement. We were able to take dozens of pictures, which are some of the very best documentation of our 3.5 week tour of SE Asia. Check it out!"
,,Relaxed walk,5.0,,"A beautiful achivement of the locals taking care of the cuty and their surroundings. It is a very relaxing place as there is plenty to hide, to sit in peace and just enjoy being away from the city noise. Locals seemingly use it to jog around. No bikes or skaters allowed. There are restaurants and resting places around. Many many different types of plants, flowers, trees and educational signs as well."
,,Relaxing walkabout,5.0,,After a long hot day - this is a perfect ending. Shaded walkways offer a cool reprieve from the heat of Singapore. Take your time and enjoy a quiet walk while discovering the beautiful greenery & plants.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,No cost and easy to get to on the MTR. Very serene. It is interesting to see plants and flowers that are in the country. There are many such places in Singapore. There is a lot of green even amongst the high rises.

,,Didn't want to leave,5.0,,"These are beautiful lush gardens, with the orchard garden especially amazing. My camera is full of photos of the exotic orchids that seemed to go on forever. Some parts of the gardens were very cool which was a relief on a hot day, although other parts were super humid. Try to find the cool room (literally) for some relief! An added treat at the end was sighting a rare owl."
,,Just wonder,5.0,,"For all we had read about different plants, trees, grasses you can only marvel at the unusual, dead rat tree, deathly dangerous(arsenic tree) and so much more"
,,Beautiful oasis in the middle of the city.,4.0,,"Great spot for a stroll in the gardens, for friends,couples,families. We saw picnics,frisbee,dog walkers.

,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,With Orchard gardens You should make the effort to visit if you have some time. Was great to walk around and soak up the flowers and plants
,,Nature in the middle of the city,5.0,,I love going for a walk in the Botanical garden. It is a great place to find quietness in the middle of the city. The garden has a few restaurants and cafes as well. Early in the morning you can see many locals doing Tai Chi. You can join them if you'd like.
,,Huge Park!,4.0,,"There are so many entrances and ways to get in that it's confusing. However navigation in the garden is simple as the signs and maps are abundant. I love the decor in the park and the style of layout with lots of large spaces and old trees giving shade.

Overall great experience. Would go back there for a run."
,,Poor signage,3.0,,"Came here for dinner at Halia. Arrived via back entrance from tyressall road. There's construction going on and the restaurant signs not clear nor helpful

After dinner, wanted to take a taxi back but signs don't tell you where the taxi stand is. Walked 1.5km in a business suit to the orchard road entrance and even then, signs leading to exit were again confusing, especially in the dark

Not exactly a nice evening in the gardens"
,,Great but hard to get to,5.0,,"The first thing I did when I arrived in Singapore - so a bit jet lagged and I got completely lost wound up walking for an hour but I eventually found it! Definitely get the mrt rather than the bus it's a lot closer. Beautiful gardens so much to see and do, amazing place - rained when I was there but soon cleared up! Ate at the restaurant but food wasn't so great, very slimy and think there was tripe in the seafood noodles, they were out of rice! Definitely go and visit, take a book and chill out, spend an hour or a day there, really it's however long you have! The map is a little confusing but enjoy getting lost, you'll find a path again!"
,,"Gorgeous, fabulous botanic gardens",5.0,,"There's a good reason that in 2015 the Singapore Botanic Garden was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is spectacular, especially the orchid garden. Totally worthwhile. It's really the #1 place to visit in Singapore. Do NOT miss it."
,,One of the most beautiful places in Singapore,5.0,,A wonderful surprise in this amazing city. Not only its free to visit the main garden but its design and variety or tropical plants is a delight to the senses. The best collection of brirds of paradise I have ever seen.
,,Peace and tranquility in the heart of Singapore,4.0,,"What an amazing place, right from the time you enter to the time you walk out, every moment seems bliss.

We were staying on Orchard Road so for us this was bliss. Such peace, such tranquility, much needed for us after a hectic day of activity.

Yes this does involve walking around a ot but its worth every bit.

Highly recommend."
,,Heaven on Earth,5.0,,"Make sure you good walking shoes,you'll need them.This is one of the most beautiful Botanical Gardens I've seen.The Orchids are amazing so many I've not seen before.Peaceful wonderful visit."
,,See Orchid Garden comments....same place,5.0,,Follow comments under Orchid Garden as in same place. Magnificent trees and very well maintained. You must walk through the jungle walk...if you are lucky you will see iguanas munching through leaves looking for grubs and insects.
,,Part of city tour,5.0,,We visited as part of a city tour we went on for half a day and was a very nice way to break the drive and walk around these amazing gardens.
,,High light of Singapore,5.0,,"If you only have a few days in Singapore you should visit here and go into the Orchid Garden. The botanical garden is free to enter but the Orchid Garden is $12. Our total visit was 3 hrs 30 min, strolling around, so many different areas to see. Really lovely. Easy to get to from the Botanic Gardens MRT just outside the gates. Cafes and visitor centre as well a gifts shops are very nice. Wear proper shoes as its lots of walking."
,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,"Singapore botanical gardens are stunning. So peaceful and beautiful. You need to spend a long time there though as it's really large. Lots of information about all the plants and flowers. You do have to a small charge to enter the orchid gardens, currently 5 Singapore dollars.
I would thoroughly recommend visiting the gardens when in Singapore."
,,Nice Park for walking exercise,4.0,,This is a very nice park if you would like to walk in the morning or evening. Perfect place for workout. The park is free except if you want to visit the Orchid Garden. The gift shop sells many Singapore souvenirs. A good place to shop for the tourists.
,,Nature,5.0,,If you are a nature lover and like flowers n ancient plants this is a good place to go especially for children.
,,Simply splendid - a must visit,5.0,,"We spent four hours wandering the gardens which are magnificent. They are clearing laid out with plenty of historical and contemporary information about what you are seeing. Swan Lake, the Healing Garden and the Evolutionary Walkway were highlights but the jewel in the crown is the National Orchid Garden. Entry to the Botanic Gardens is free but they charge $5 to enter the Orchid Garden which given what is on show is wholly justified. An absolute must do if you are in Singapore."
,,Nice Green patch in Singapore.,4.0,,"I came here for an outdoor yoga session, but also had a walk through the gardens. Its a nice and green space - something you don't get a lot of in central Singapore. Many people gathering at the lake to look at a single black swan, many photos were being taken both of the single swan and of the weird group of people doing yoga. All in all nice enough but too many people for my liking. This was a Sat afternoon (perhaps the week is better)."
,,Nature lover,5.0,,"Impressive landscape. The place is so big that you will spend a lot of hours to explore. A place where you could do your morning run/walk. Very accessible. Thumbs up, Singapore!"
,,Remarkable place,5.0,,They keep all the plants and flowers extremely well. All are so beautiful. We ll revisit this place again this year.
,,Good day trip destination,5.0,,Good place to hangout for half a day with friends. In the urban Singapore this piece of naturally preserved landscape surely offers something different than the skyscrapers and towny nightlife for which Singapore is famous for. If you are here for more than 5 days then this is a must visit destination. Also it us free. Orchid garden inside this is a paid attraction but surely worth the every penny spent!
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"A wonderful setting, and a fascinating tropical rain-forest area. Good food and drink facilities, and an excellent shop. Don't miss it!"
,,Must see,5.0,,One can spend there hours and enjoy the beauty of it. Impressive how little Singapore has such big place of nature in the midst of it. Make sure to spare enough time for it.
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens holds very fond memories for many locals, as a favourite spot for outdoor wedding photographs, kids' hangout (there is a free Children's Garden with a huge tree-house, slides, and water-play), a few restaurants, nice sculptures here & there, and the occasional free concerts. Popular especially on weekends when it becomes a joggers' and fitness buffs' paradise - early mornings see different groups, tycoons and lesser mortals, work out and enjoy their undisturbed privacy and the cooler weather before it gets warm past 9.30 am; a nominal fee is charged for the optional Orchid Gardens which is a visual feast. I once dropped an American horticulturist friend there and fetched him back only after 6 hrs, so enamoured was he with the plant variety at this Unesco site; for lesser mortals, about 2.5 hrs' visit should suffice if you throw in the Orchids Garden. I advise to choose a cooler part of the day to visit. Accessible via the Botanic Gardens MRT station, or from the front entrance facing Dempsey Rd / Orchard Rd."
,,Ultimate Urban Oasis,5.0,,"Living in Singapore can sometimes seem like living in a giant construction site: roads torn up, parking areas devoured by mechanical beasts, traffic diverted - great disruption. All part of the price of establishing a world-class subway system. The Botanic Gardens however, are a huge green oasis, bequeathed to us by generations for foresightful individuals and governments. Strolling, jogging, walking the dog, or however, the Gardens are refreshingly peaceful clean and green, a place to relax, reflect, and admire some of the wonders of nature. Watch the fish at Swan Lake, watch or participate in the morning Tai Chi and exercise sessions. Join a fitness boot camp. Enjoy a drink or meal at one of the several cafes and restaurants. Marvel at one of the world's great orchid collections. Or just wander, people watching. If you live in Singapore, you have no need of this advice, but if you are visiting don't miss it! Dress casually, and lightly, with a hat if you will. You won't regret it."
,,"Feel natural, but check weather before going there",4.0,,"Stunning flowers and plants, great scenes of Botanic Gardens will please your travel. However, it's always good to check weather (google weather , etc) before going there! It's quite difficult to find shelter immediately when it start raining. Be safe too."
,,beautiful garden,4.0,,"As a Singaporean, the garden is peaceful, beautiful, well kept and is free to enjoy the natural beauty."
,,Not just for garden lovers!,5.0,,"This place is amazing! It is a beautiful green space in the city. So much thought and care has been taken with these gardens and it is incredible. I'm not a massive garden lover but I can really appreciate the work that has gone into creating these gardens. And it's free! I would highly recommend paying the S$5 to see the orchid gardens, though. It's great early in the morning when it's cooler and the locals are walking their dogs and making the most of the space. It really is a must do!"
,,Best Botanical Garden!,5.0,,"This is the best botanical garden I have ever seen. You can easily spend 5-6 hours here if you take your time and see everything. On top of this, it is free! Only the orchid garden costs a little."
,,Beautifully decorated for Christmas,5.0,,Easy to get to and free to enter! You need to pay to enter the Orchid Garden but that is so worth the ticket price. A wonderful place to wander around and enjoy the surroundings. Such a fabulous oasis in the middle of the city. It was so beautifully decorated for Christmas with so much going on and just so much to see.
,,Time to relax,5.0,,"The Botanic Garden is awesome! If you stay just a short time in Singapore I would recommend you to visit the Botanic Gardens instead of the Gardens by the Bay. The Botanic Gardens are more authentic and there is even a small rainforest with trees which are older than 300 years! A must see in the Gardens is the Orchard Garden, you have to pay for it but you will never forget this! There are so many different orchards."
,,Economical place for family,5.0,,Nice place to visit but depend on weather. Suggest bring along an umbrella for unexpected rain. There a nice cafe near the carpark
,,Family vacation,5.0,,It is really a great place to start seeing the beautiful flowers with lots of multiple colors and lots of space to cover.
,,must see in singapore,5.0,,"a peaceful respite in this tropical city of sky-scrapers. clean, safe and all-natural. Wonderful if you are a botany buff but also worthwhile for those you just love being in nature."
,,Singapore Botanic Garden,4.0,,The Botanic Garden of Singapore is a must visit place for any visitor to the city state. Located at the edge of the commercial district and it is easily accessible via the city MRT train system. The Garden houses a rich variety of tropical flora that incorporate a very well designed series of walkways and directional sign posts that enable visitors to navigate the many interesting historical landmarks with ease. There are also F&B outlets for visitors to rest and enjoyed the drinks and meals after a exploring the garden. Entrance to the Garden is FREE but there is an entrance fee to the Orchid Garden which is must place to visit. So remember to visit the Botanical Garden the next time you are in Singapore!
,,Hidden gem of Singapore,5.0,,"Easy to get to by bus or MRT. Has one of the best Orchid collections in the world. Free entry into park but will cost $5 for the orchid garden if you are not a local. The walking is very pleasant with many shaded areas. Also there are both high end restaurant and cheap eateries inside the park, so no need to pack your KFC or sandwich. There is a large casual dinner next to the main carpark at the basement, but the food quality is average (very); also you may need to queue up for a long while just to place the order - there is just one cashier who takes order 1 dish at a time and when you have a line of 20 people queuing! I cannot think of a more inefficient set up. W"
,,So nice,5.0,,"The gardens are beautiful and such a peaceful place to be. Great for walks, orchids garden is a must see. Might come across some wild life."
,,Worth visiting to relax and enjoy,4.0,,"Take any path in any direction and you are surrounded by a huge variety of our nature. Always in a very good shape, helped by artist creations, and always surrounded by other wondering and happy people. Never crowded, sometimes it's is just you. Visit the orchid garden to see amazing colors and shapes, get a drink and bite at the ginger garden restaurant while you relax in the garden. Easy to go and get away by taxi or MRT. Never getting bored at the Botanic garden in SG!"
,,A tropical paradise,5.0,,I've been walking and running through the Singapore botanical gardens since 2000 and never tire of it. It's lovely in the very early morning when the lights are on and the air is a tiny bit cooler. Bring water and wear cool clothes - and avoid mid-day. The other evening my husband and I packed a picnic basket with dinner and champagne for our date nite. There are many ways to enjoy this marvellous park.
,,The best Botanic Garden we have seen,5.0,,"We've explored lots of botanic gardens over the years, but this one is simply stunning, extraordinary considering this is not the very best time of year to see the plants and trees in full bloom. So pleased we gave it lots of time, but do it early morning or late evening, as it gets very warm. But worth it!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful place to visit. Make sure you bring lots of drinking water and wear comfortable shoes. This garden is a marvel!
,,Lovely trip out,4.0,,"Well worth visiting whilst in Singapore. Serene and tranquil spot, enjoy it with your family. Beautiful flora and fauna."
,,Amazing botanical garden,4.0,,This is definitely worth visiting this botanical garden in order to have some idea of the diversity of tropical plants. And the location is just beautiful. Very high class botanical garden.
,,I can walk in these gardens forever,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens is one of my favorite places in Singapore
(and *way* above Gardens by the Bay).

The gardens are beautiful, clean, peaceful, evergreen and not particularly hilly, just what one needs for a nice long walk.

If you like flowers and plants, stop by the National Orchid Garden, it's only SGD 5 for an adult.

There aren't many air conditioned stops in the Gardens, keep that in mind if you plan on visiting on a hot day. And pack a few bottles of water regardless."
,,A place filled with beauty ...,5.0,,"Being in Singapore is a life-time experience due to its wonderful and unique places.This is one of them,defintelly.When your soul is thirsty of beauty, go visit this (Heavenly) Garden !"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I loved going here. We started by taking a riding tour through the park. It was short and narrated a bit, but it gave us a feel of the place first. This was great as we knew what we definitely wanted to explore on our own after that. You could easily spend all day here so plan accordingly. If your not into plants/flowers etc. Then you should probably just skip it. I would definitely go back again!"
,,Most Enjoyable,5.0,,"We took some visiting friends. Go early in the morning when it is cooler. Do not miss orchid garden, quite special. Lots of birds seen, including Oriential Pied Hornbill, Silver Pheasant, many sunbirds and a few different woodpeckers and an Orange Thrush. Get a map at the entrance and take your time for a most enjoyable relaxing morning. Highly Recommended."
,,Holiday,5.0,,"Great day out with beautiful trees and flowers,just a pity it was raining,lovely cafe with reasonable prices,could spend a full day here , got on the hop on bus so easy to get too"
,,A shady escape from the crowds,5.0,,"Escape the bustle of the city and wander around this beautiful botanic gardens. If you are lucky you may catch a concert in the sound shell. Be sure to enter the jewel in the heart of the gardens, the beautiful National Orchid Garden."
,,Well worth the trip. Better than the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Much more colourful and varied than the Gardens by the Bay. Spent a lovely couple of hours wandering round looking at the rich and varied planting. Much better use if time than the other gardens
,,The most beautiful place,5.0,,Nothing compares to the orchids here. We walked around whilst on our city tour. Would love to spend more time here to take in more beauty.
,,Superb,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the visit, the orchid gardens were outstanding, I would recomend visiting in the morning when the temps a little cooler"
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,"Very nice and interesting to see, these gardens are beautiful and romantic. Definitely a highlight of our trip."
,,Acres of tranquillity,5.0,,"We'd first visited the gardens in 2012 and just had to return! As 1 of only a handful of UNESCO sites, for very good reason, not only is entrance free (there is a charge of the Orchid Gardens) but there is so much to see and enjoy. Paths meander around the park and to the lake - behold water lilies, feed the turtles, sit and reflect, savour the perfumes and colours of blossoms and blooms.

There is a cafe serving drinks and snacks, where you can sit and watch the world go by. A must for all ages."
,,Fantastic.,5.0,,"Spent over fours hours and took over 200 photos during our visit there.
The gardens are well laid out with a lot of thought put into the blending of shrubs, trees and sculptures.
One comment though a bit more signage as to where the main entrance is and how to get there for first time visitors otherwise everything else was great."
,,Wow,5.0,,The plants and flowers are amazing. It is such a nice break after the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd and the downtown CBT. Big enough that people spread out and you do not feel crowded
,,Amazing walk,5.0,,Enjoyed our lovely nature walk in this wonderful green place. One of the best Botanic Gardens I've ever seen.
,,Greenery,5.0,,"Always enjoy the smell and sights of nature (green grass, flowers, plants and butterflies). Manage to find shelter with seats to listen to the sound of nature and water flowing. A great place for me to calm down and relax."
,,Paradise on the earth,5.0,,"We had a great time there. This is the most beautiful garden we have ever visited. I dont like walking so much but I can not stop walking through all the corners. Well layout, colorful, nice smell of the floral. The Orchid garden was fantastic with huge of types that we have never seen them before. Please dont miss it. It is great place to relax."
,,Could spend a whole day here,5.0,,Beautiful garden with lots of park space to also bring a picnic lunch. The plants are all marked well to educate you on the types of plants living in the gardens.
,,lovely and peaceful,5.0,,"Enjoyed the walk in the gardens, even the rain was welcome as we jumped and played in it as it poured. Playground for kids available, lovely nature walk and experience."
,,Nicest botanical gardens,5.0,,"Orchids surround you. One is more beautiful than others. Handicapped paths can avoid steps but their is so much walking, they need a few more benches for seniors. Many new beds, a mist garden and every turn beats the last. Nice gift shop."
,,Tropical haven,5.0,,"Beautiful botanical garden with lots of tropical plants. The botanical garden also has a rain forest trail within. Look out for monitor lizards sunbathing on the pathways, and visit the lake with swans. The ginger garden is also a must visit."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"We didn't have a lot of time to visit but it is worth the tour, it is beautiful. The colours, the outlay is really something special. It is also quite and you can spend some private time here. Really a place to relax."
,,Botanical gardens,4.0,,Good place for long morning walks and exercise . A silent place to read and spend quality time with your kids. Well connected with MRTS hence easy to reach there
,,Fascinating for early morning walks,5.0,,"A stunning part of the City, walking distance from our hotel. Beautiful plants and walkways, but fun for a people watching point of view. All the locals jogging through the park, nannies pushing their young charges in strollers. Domestic staff walking a few dogs. People practicing Tai Chi. A real taste of modern Singapore."
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,Great way to spend a few hours very peaceful and very beautiful. The mrt stops right outside so very easy to get to
,,"Excellent garden, don't miss the orchid area",5.0,,"Very beautiful garden, and it's even free to enter. 5 SGD for the orchid garden, but that's well worth the price. Don't miss the rainforest walk and then finish with a meal in one of the restaurants in the garden."
,,World class,4.0,,"Walked through the gardens on my last trip home and was surprised to discover what a pretty, friendly place it has become."
,,Serenity,5.0,,What a gem in the middle of busy Singapore. The Botanic Gardens have been Heritage listed and once you have spent the day there you will understand why. The Orchids are world class. The entire garden setup is stunningly beautiful. Easy to get to by MRT just outside the main gate. Throughly recommend making this a must do when visiting Singapore
,,Enjoyable especially if you are a flower enthusiast,4.0,,"We went with our 11 & 13 year olds. It is a nice stroll through the gardens and there were some informational posters that made it more interesting for the children such as how hybrids are made. If you are visiting Singapore with children it is a nice place to see but not a ""must see"" on my list."
,,Mrs elrefai,5.0,,"This botanical garden is a place where you can feel the beauty , relaxation and the good smell . You walk through it as if it's the paradise on earth .
The orchid garden is very colourful and we'll organised. We spent there around 3 hours then we rested having our lunch in their lovely resturant then continue having our train to our next destination .
It's highly recommended to be visited"
,,Fantastic place to be!,5.0,,"Beautiful garden with fantastic flowers, an absolute favourite place and so well looked after. There is a range of lovely restaurants, shops and cafés. All staff are helpful and very nice and welcoming. We will surely be back. Loved all of the orchids. Well done!"
,,Photography haven,5.0,,"I love photography. And hence, i am always looking for places to take a photo that would please me. When I found Botanical Gardens, I realised that its a great place for photoshoots. From a moss filled garden to one that resembles caverns, the only limit is your imagination. Even if you are not into photoshoot, its a good place to spot pretty butterflies and nosy little squirrels. The food at the cafe is decent and would be great for a brunch with your families and friends.
Tip: Mosquito repellants. Apply generous dosage of it for they are resilent and persistent. And while you are at it, make sure you are hydrated with spare bottles of water.

,,Beautiful Long Walk,5.0,,"We came in from the MRT entrance to the park. Quite a walk to go to the other side of the gardens, but very beautiful. We skipped the orchid garden that costs extra, and still felt like we had seen a lot of beautiful gardens. Note on the side of the park with the lab there is a small orchid garden that was very beautiful! and no extra admission. Great visit, bring your walking shoes and water, and sunscreen."
,,Beautiful and tranquil,4.0,,"Enjoyed our stroll through the botanical gardens. Just lovely, peaceful and beautiful. The orchard section is well worth the visit. Took MRT Train to get there, a very easy ride. Would visit again!"
,,The best things in life are free!,5.0,,So much better than expected. Had an amazing day wandering around the many trials within the gardens. From the cactus and bonsai gardens to swan lake and symphony stage with its huge Lily pads. We saw so much wildlife including silver pheasant and migrating birds from Siberia in the rainforest area. Not to be missed a haven of peace and tranquillity in a busy city.
,,A little bit of Paradise,5.0,,"Wonderful place to spend a day (or more), always spotless, close to the CBD, and free. Waiting time for food was a bit longer than usual, but then it was a very busy day when we were there."
,,Botanic Gardens half day visit,5.0,,"Went there on my own and spent a few hours. It was a beautiful and amazing. Much more to it than expected. A great education of some of Singapore's history and the emphasis on all cultures working together to make such a great city. amazing plants, felt very safe. Nice to see people with dogs, children, lovers, photo shoots, all sorts of things! Quite noisy as road works, construction etc were happening all around. Good maps so easy to find my way around, even getting a little lost was fun. Very good gift shop and nice clean toilets - of course - you're in Singapore right?"
,,Relaxing in a garden,5.0,,"A big contrast with the Orchard Road tourist area, the Botanic Garden is worth a 2 hour visit in the morning or late afternoon.
Beautifully maintained. Very green and clean. Very safe. Not particularly hot because of abundance of shade. Apart from paved road going round the garden, there are a few short trails through the tropical forest worth exploring. Map is available at the visitor centre. And within 15 minutes from most hotels by taxi. Also accessible by the MRT. Within the Botanic Garden is the Orchid Pavilion. Quality restaurants are found within the compound."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,We went early in the day before it got too hot and it was wonderful. The gardens are beautiful and all of the different paths are filled with different species of plants. In particular we loved the orchid garden and thought that the cold room was especially cool. I never appreciated orchids as much as I did seeing them en mass in their natural habitat. The park is free except for the orchid garden which is only $5 a person. I also really enjoyed the bonsai garden and swan lake and next time I visit I will try to go on a day that is not blisteringly hot. Even in the heat though it was worth the trip! We got there by taxi from our hotel for only $8 but there is mass transportation that goes up that way and it really isn't too far outside of the city center. Wear comfy shoes and be sure to dress for the heat!
,,Great family outing place,5.0,,"Visited several times for pass few years with different groups of people including alone, with mum and with primary school mates . Every visit was a relax and satisfying experience. For nature lovers , this is one of the best botanical garden in the world ."
,,Free and so peaceful,5.0,,"This is a great place to chill out and relax. Make sure yo take sunscreen and a hat though! We saw loads of turtles and fish, and even saw an eagle catch a fish.Gardens are very well maintained."
,,So much have changed,5.0,,"You see I normally only review places I think worthy to. For a free entry, this is surprisingly well maintained, and not only that, it's evolving, advancing. Many new areas and plant species have sprung up! and then it's getting more family friendly with pets roaming the grass, yoga fitness athletes dominating the pavilions, and even kites. Now and then there are still people catching pokemons too! Children playground increased as well. My last visit was 7 years ago before this."
,,"Absolutely worth a visit, most beautiful gardens I've been to",5.0,,This is definitely worth a trip during your stay in Singapore. The gardens are few of charge (besides for the orchid garden) and the gardens are absolutely stunning. You can bring a picnic or a book and spend the day. There are so many different gardens to see and it's incredibly well done
,,Amazing park full of surprises,4.0,,"Massive lizards, endless bird songs, amazing tree's, dancing terepins and fantasticly laid out gardens that show the best of nature Singapore has to offer."
,,A Gem in the Orient,5.0,,A visit to the Botanical Gardens should be on everyone's Singapore itinerary. We visited over the Christmas period and the Gardens were at thier magical best. A relaxing walk here is the perfect antidote to the hustle and bustle of downtown Singapore. Loved the Orchid Garden.
,,Escape from town,4.0,,I always bring friends and family who visit me in singapore to botanic garden and they are always pleased with the visit. I also go there during week end to enjoy silence or to enjoy a relaxing dinner with music (they organize concert from time to time). Since it's now part of unesco heritage you should definitely plan it (and it's one of the rare thing in singapore that is free so.... ;)
,,Excellent,5.0,,Really incredible gardens. The national orchid Garden is the best part about this. Also dont miss out on the Black and White Swans!
,,Take your time.....,5.0,,"We spent an enjoyable morning walking around the gardens on New Year’s Day 2017

The main park was full of picnicking ladies scattered around the numerous shady spots – as it was a Sunday many may have had the day off and were making the most of the time – it was also popular for wedding photos

The main part of the Botanic Garden is set into a hill – with a mixture of steps and paths on offer – the orchids are a main draw – especially the VIP area – here are the varieties named after Nelson Mandela, Margaret Thatcher, William and Kate etc. – but there is much more to see amongst the intricate planting schemes including pieces of sculpture, large lizards and birdlife including a large hornbill.

It is a large green open space and until the development of the Garden by the Bay has had little competition – it will interesting to see if this development is extra competition or spreads the demand – thank you"
,,Relaxed with space and greenery,4.0,,"Went there for a run turned out to have plenty of difficulty, eg. you can chose run in slope or not and pretty flora. End with a drink at Food for Thought (near carpark area) - reasonably priced for a cafe."
,,Fabulous a must visit,5.0,,"We went for a nice walk in what we thought would be a nice open space with a few trees.

How wrong. It's beautiful. Tons of trees and flowers and all for free.

Loads of shade during the 5 k's we walked.

Then we went to the orchid section. That's $ 5 for adults but amazingly $ 1 for old farts like me (60+).

There's loads of places for food. We were there 4 hours and saw 85% of it.

This is a must visit. I've never seen botanical gardens as good as this."
,,Breathtakingly beautiful orchids,5.0,,"A World Heritage (UNESCO) site and so deserving. Breathtakingly beautiful orchids in the Orchid Gardens ... A must see for all flower lovers and even those who are not. You will see thousands of orchids in beautiful colors, shapes along with other plants. The Botanical Gardens equally as beautiful. Conviently located on the subway line so easy to get to. A must see especially for orchid lovers!"
,,Don't miss the orchid gardens!,5.0,,"Excellent botanic gardens, which have been accorded Unesco World Heritage site status. The orchid garden was the best I've seen, and should not be missed."
,,"Amazing garden, not just orchids...",5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are really amazing with loads of interesting things to see. The herbal gardens with explanations of the potential use of the various plants was especially fascinating!
,,Artificially created brilliance,5.0,,The banish gardens is an absolute must fit tourists visiting Singapore. The various paths and lakes lead you through a maze of natural beauty that is not distorted at any point by the artificial infrastructure of the gardens. Definitely worth a visit
,,Mr,4.0,,Well signposted with plant and tree descriptions. Very good trails and clean environment. Easy to locate using MRT. Plant descriptions give Botanic Names with brief description.
,,lovely respite in the middle of a hustling city.,5.0,,We went on a school holiday at Christmas time and found a delightful mix of local and tourists wandering the well manicured and curated trails and areas. Not to be missed!
,,It's Free!,4.0,,"While I am not a plant crazy person, I could see that these gardens were well worth a visit. CAUTION:- there are far too few seats to rest on, especially in shaded areas. The cafes were good and well frequented."
,,Not the best,2.0,,"I have seen many botanical gardens or nice parks around the world.
And this is not the best one as many review said.

It is surprising why this can be nominated as World Heritage while there is no real true historic nature and beauty on the site but artificial ones.
I hope Singapore people visit other parks around the world to learn how to make such level of gardens.

As many other parks, locals are really not good to maintain the site.
Children's park items are constantly broken and man made pond/lake are smelly.

Most of maintenance workers are not likely Singaporeans and cheap foreign labors which I do not feel good about it. If you proud of your garden, it should be taken full of care by locals...

Still, lot of lawn spaces so it can be good place to gather big groups and do some picnic. However, Singapore park has BITING ANTS which really Bite your skin to the level it really hurts and make you jump. So, you have to be very very careful where you sit or touch. Other way, you end up with pains and crying children."
,,Picturesque,5.0,,"Enjoyed every single step of the gardens, couldn't recommended the walk anymore. Only advice take some water Oh and a camera :)"
,,A tropical oasis,5.0,,"Went via the hop on bus. Easy peasy! A great activity on a warm day( is there any other kind in Singapore?) lots of shady places to ramble with good signs. It is all very do-able, because scale is slightly smaller than it seems from the map. Very civilised."
,,Wonderful gardens,5.0,,"Really nice visit. You will see beatiful flowers, animals, you will have a relaxing time too. I would really recommend them."
,,Worth a Biscuits t,5.0,,"A beautiful, very large forest, garden, open space in the middle of the city. Well worth your time, loved the jungle that Singapore was before years of civilization and the amazing tree specimens"
,,Excellent,5.0,,First time to Singapore so only a short visit but it's certainly on our list next time for a longer visit great plants flowers easy to navigate around and staff friendly . Well done yo all.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"There is not a place in the world as Singapur, so in love with the park, the people and everything, Singapur is awesome"
,,So pretty,5.0,,By far the best Botanical Gardens I've been to. The park is beautiful and very well kept. The jungly parts are so pretty and interesting. There are all sorts of trees and plants from all over the world here. I would definitely recommend. It's a large park though so plan accordingly. It's also pretty hot and humid in the area.
,,Beautiful location and experience,5.0,,"My husband and I visited the gardens as a stop on our hop on/off bus tour. We spent a few hours in the gardens and wish we could have spent much longer there. Not only were the gardens beautiful, the brochures, maps, special exhibits and signage were very informative and interesting. We will definitely be returning to complete our tour of the gardens on our next visit to Singapore!"
,,A great way to spend the afternoon (in the city),5.0,,"Enjoy an afternoon away from the bustling city. It's peaceful, perfect for relaxation and family outing. Bring your refreshment basket for a little picnic."
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,"Have been here numerous times over the years and on a recent trip to Singapore saw the stunning gardens which had been lit up for the festive season. Trees had been decorated by various schools. It was just gorgeous to wander through at night looking at the lights. These gardens are stunning at the best of times, but this just made it more spectacular. Didn't go into the orchid gardens on this trip but highly recommend them for anyone going to the gardens."
,,Great way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"It has been many years since we walked through the Botanical Gardens and we thought it well and truly time to go back. We were very happy we did. We walked from the main entrance to the Tanglin Street entrance. The gardens are very tranquil and the lake very pretty. The gardens are great as is the amount of wildlife. The lake is full of fish including some very large cat fish, turtles and swans."
,,Peaceful & Quiet!!!!,5.0,,"A place of sanctuary! Amazing plants,trees & birds! Lots & lots of walking to do but ample space for taking rest too!!! Extremely well-laid out & required facilities are provided very thoughtfully. a must-visit place!"
,,Middle class retreat,4.0,,"The main reason to visit the Singapore botanical gardens is to move on to the national orchid garden, oine of the citiy's premier attractions. The broader gardens themselves are spacious and clean but not, for example, as majestic as the botanical garden os Sydney. They do give a visitor an insight into the social life of Singapore; set in a middle class residential area they are used by locals for a variety of purposes. Many residents walk there dogs in the facility and it's entertaining to see the range of dog breeds favored. It's clearly a major local centre for the practise of tai chi, fascinating to watch for the non=practitioner. Clearly many locals also use the cafe areas for their week day breakfast, and some like to chat with visitors, to learn something of their homelands and exchange observations of the world scene.
The gardens are somke way from the normal tourist areas but taxis in Singapore are plentiful and cheap, and the area provides a calmatmosphere away from the city's hectic bustle."
,,Very peaceful,5.0,,This place is huge. There are many different gardens housed inside the whole Botanical Garden. Very well maintained.
,,"If you know your plants, quite and serene place to visit",4.0,,You have to know the plants and interesting place for a student of Botany. we liked the way everything was arranged and was very pleasant to walk through. Kids were very bored and wanted to run out.
,,A great way to spend your time,5.0,,On all my visits to Singapore I visit these gardens. You can wander around and take in the great design and interesting sights. The gazebo is my favourite place to visit.
,,Nice escape just outside shopping district,5.0,,"Botanic garden is just outside the Orchard area which is Singapore's shopping district. Look out for performances at the center stage during weekends. Bring your own picnic basket and mats and join the many others. It is definitely a good place to wind down and enjoy the nature. For families with younger children, the Jacobs Ballas children garden is also a must visit place."
,,Beauty at its BEST!!,4.0,,"This place will give you a lot of information about flowers,trees & plants . Beautiful place , good photography , beautifully decorated and well maintained ."
,,Lots of walking,3.0,,Visited the gardens on a Tuesday and it turns out the main section we were there to see was closed. Make sure you check first. Be prepared for lots and lots of long hot walks to get between attractions.
,,"Great attraction, must-see..",4.0,,"Great activity for a warm day.. definitely save a half day for it, can do it as a part of daily bus tour.. Plenty to see and also learn about plants.."
,,"Nature, rest and relaxation",4.0,,"A big park, great for resting and relaxation as well as jogging. The National Orchid Garden was 1.3 km from the Bukit Timah Gate or the Botanic gardens MRT. It was worth it. Different types of orchids and orchids named after famous personalities. I especially liked the mist house, where we found the carnivorous plant. It was not that tiring since your walking through the garden of lush green surrounding in the middle of the city! A squirrel surprised us as he was climbing on a tree.

Inside the National Orchid Garden, there are different types of orchids and orchids named after famous personalities. I especially liked the mist house, where we found the carnivorous plant."
,,We enjoyed out walk through the Botanic Gardens,4.0,,As it is very hot and humid in Singapore visiting the Botanic Gardens is a welcome respite from the heat as you wander around.
,,Pleasant and peaceful place for a walk!,5.0,,"Really loved visiting this huge park just for a stroll, and a bit of learning too if you're into that! Would recommend walking from the northern MRT station right through the gardens, can easily spend a whole morning there. Personal favorites were the sundial and bonsai gardens. Keep your eyes open for monitor lizards :)"
,,Nice greenery,4.0,,Centrally located with the service of MRT & bus. Nice place for gathering and strolls. Spacious with many photography opportunities.
,,Superbly presented gardens,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens in Singapore are absolutely in a class of their own. The maintenance, cleanliness and the variety of plants and landscapes is truly world class. A wonderful opportunity to see enjoy some beautiful expansive green space in an otherwise busy city. Well done Singapore on manning this heritage attraction so well!"
,,Exceptional variety of interest,5.0,,What a place to visit. To do it justice you will probably need two or three sessions as there is so much to see. One of our visits was with grandchildren and their play area at the gardens was so much fun for them - and with a big extension being built now. For those with a special interest there is a wealth of species. Those just wanting a good walk will not be disappointed either. And there are plenty of places to rest and recuperate.
,,a must see,5.0,,this is a must see but there is a lot of walking. it is the most beautiful place. very serene and lots of interesting facts on the trees etc
,,Fantastic Day Out,5.0,,"Spend a day here to enjoy it to the maximum ..you can't rush as each category is far apart.
Plenty to see and make references to any plant enthusiast or even just anyone who appreciates green nature. Most plants are labelled - although the new bamboo section was un-named which was a shame as the varieties were amazing.
The lay-out and maintenance of these gardens is truly first class.
Pathways are available but you can also walk on the grass where possible. Wear comfortable shoes, wear a hat and take plenty of cool drinks. There are a few benches.
Convenient for the MRT and certainly a must-see in Singapore!
Toilets are available, restaurants (both casual & fancy), gift shops and plenty of litter bins to ensure the gardens are kept clean!"
,,Beautiful Gardens.,5.0,,"Spent a morning here with friends, loved the gardens, very informative and easy to navigate. Walked here from our hotel."
,,Quaint and serene,4.0,,"This garden is overlooked as not worth seeing, but you'd be foolish to. It is lush green, inviting and relaxing. the Specimens of plants and trees are enormous with breathtaking vistas throughout. In such an expensive city, this is one of the only free things to see here."
,,Must visit,5.0,,I rate this as the best free entry attraction in Singapore. There is an entry fee for the Orchid garden S$5 per person and if your children have student id's it's free. I have seen many gardens around the world but this was particularly special. Well maintained and lush with excellent variety. A nice place for some tranquility beyond the city whilst still being in the heart of the city. Convenient access via a train station as well although it was within walking distance of our hotel. The Orchid garden is a must see and has many varieties of the most spectacular Orchids. Spare at least half a day. It rained intermittently when we were there but we did not mind.
,,Breath of fresh air,5.0,,"Always love the walks my partner and I have at Botanic Gardens. We cover about 8km there most Sat/ Sun mornings.

The planters the tended. The bush are fashioned well etc.

Kudos indeed to the many workers we see who are busy maintaining this amazing Heritage Site! Well done!"
,,A Remarkable Botanic Garden.,5.0,,"I have visited Botanic Gardens in over a dozen tropical countries. Singapore's Gardens are much larger/diverse than on might expect-- and, of course they are superbly organized in order to make the visitors trip most worthwhile [even when you are hungry]! They can be easily reached by the MRT.. and, entry is free!"
,,WAW,5.0,,"This place is so lovely!

It's totally free to go in and wonder round till ur hearts content. We didn't leave ourselves enough time really but we just loved it.

It's really tranquil and manicured. The odd runner or person reading a book. Children and dogs are welcome.

We pottered round the lake where what looked like 100s of terrapins were swimming and popping up the the lake edge. A beautiful black swan, squirrels, butterfly's, dragon flys and many more beautiful little creatures.

We got to it by bus and tubed it back to the bay. All very easy as it's really close.

Must see!!"
,,Not my grandmother's garden,5.0,,"Being a former Singaporean with fond recollections of this garden, I can say that this is not my grandmother's garden. It is greatly expanded with lots of gardens within the garden. In addition, this UNESCO Heritage site is FREE in a country where nothing is free. The MRT station at Bukit Timah is a great plus. The National Orchid Garden is a must see as you can see tens of thousands of orchids in one place. You can easily spend 3 hours in this garden."
,,Peaceful and Leisurely,4.0,,"This park is worth visiting. We spent over two hours walking about and still did not cover the whole area. Botanic Gardens is suitable for almost anyone. We saw people reading, playing music, jogging, sightseeing. Squirrels and birds also prowl the venue. Unfortunately, if it rains, then it is not recommended to visit as there are no walkway shelters."
,,Not good in hot weather,3.0,,"I have visited the botanic gardens during the city tour. It was the last attraction. The garden is good but not in hot weather and not with kids. The kids may not enjoy it. You need to walk all around the garden. For me, because of the hot weather, we were not able to visit more than the quarter of the garden. The advice is to check the weather and do not go with kids :)"
,,Amazing Garden,5.0,,They have rightly made this a world heritage site. Nicely maintained garden which gives you fair idea of the flora and fauna around in tropical Asia. The beauty of the garden is in well maintained water bodies and plantation around. The trails on the hill also gives you a real feel of forests.
,,Lovely Christmas light-up,5.0,,Went to the last night of the Christmas light-up. Love the trees decorated by the different groups. Always enjoyed the greenery away from the City
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,The gardens are big and beautiful. Very calming and the air smells very fresh. Would highly recommend this place to people of any age. Entry into the area is free but if you want to go into any of the greenhouses there is a charge.
,,Outstanding Gardens!,5.0,,The flowers are amazing! And the design elements included throughout the grounds are outstanding. Take the time to smell the roses!
,,Don't miss this garden.,5.0,,"Sure, Gardens by the Bay is trendier, more high-tech, and I recommend it enthusiastically, but if you really love plants, you don't want to miss this old, historic, classic botanic garden with endless footpaths through varied tropical plantings. The banyon trees alone are worth the visit, but there is much more. The softness of this garden is counterpoint to the hardness of today's super-modern Singapore."
,,Outstanding gardens especially the Orchid Garden.,5.0,,These beautiful gardens were enhanced by Christmas decorations during our visit. It seemed surreal seeing all of the Christmas trimmings at 30C!! The gardens are beautiful and the orchid garden is especially worth a visit!
,,UNESCO Heritage Site without burning a hole in your pocket,5.0,,"A must visit for visitors to Singapore. Trees, Shrubs, Small Lake, National Orchids & Nature at its best. Suitable for People of all ages."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful park, it is well kept and there is an area for the kids. there are several places where buy food and drinks. Better later afternoon or early morning, otherwise too hot"
,,Scenes away from city life,4.0,,"A wonderful get away from the hustle and bustle of city life- nice shaded area, open spaces for family and groups of friends to get together, picnic, outdoor games. If picnic is not your thing, you have the option of eating at either Halia (Restaurant level) or Food for Thought (Cafe).

Good place to collect ones thoughts....Do bring along an umbrella, never know when a downpour happens. Its something of a necessity although cumbersome. January is nice and cooling yet I have been to Botanics during dryer month. Not that comfortable as well. Heat and humidity something all of us can't control."
,,Long walks.,4.0,,"Beautiful tropical gardens and parkland. Easy to get to via SMRT. Take water, a hat and walking shoes, this is a very large park."
,,Beautiful relaxing time,5.0,,"If you visit Singapore, go to the botanical gardens. My wife and I had the best time as there was such a wide variety of plant species."
,,an educational journey close to nature,4.0,,"if you have the time, give yourself about 3 hours to walk from the Bukit Timah gate, to the Nassim gate & end at the Tanglin gate or vice versa, if you would like to cover the entire place; visit the various lakes, the various gardens, museums etc If your time is limited, visit the Orchid Garden, and see various beautiful species of Orchid. Also, interesting to see is the VIP Garden in the Orchid Garden which features Orchid named after politicians and royalties who have visited Singapore."
,,Stunning Botanical gardens; most especially the orchids!,5.0,,"For travelers and locals, this is a superb quiet place to escape the noise and bustle of the city. Lots of paths to walk, and much to see. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and dress for the heat and humidity, just like all of Singapore. Further do not forget to make time to see the orchids: stunning in their beauty and amazing to see so many types and varieties. You'll be back as either a local or a tourist I'm sure."
,,Beautifully manicured gardens,5.0,,"We read awesome reviews on the orchid garden and set out to visit as my father-in-law was an orchid enthuses.

The over 1km walk from the botanic garden met station was pleasant but slightly hot for the children who grew up in Aussie. Definitely wear loose, cool clothings and walking shoes. We enjoyed looking at the Christmas trees out up by various embassies and organisations on the way.

The orchid garden was indeed worth visiting. Every leaf, branch and flower has been carefully planted and cared for. The garden was spacious with a wide variety of orchids to surprise you. Bring your cameras, you will be snapping photos away."
,,Lovely Garden in the Heart of the City,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is huge and I always enjoy a walk in the gardens during the weekend. This is a perfect place from the hustle and bustle from the city.

One can enjoy an outdoor concert at the Shaw Symphony stage (must check the timings from the website) or just have a picnic around the area. There are many koi and turtles in pond that surrounds the stage as well. Within the gardens there are also many cafes to spend a quiet afternoon. In addition, there is also a beautiful Orchid Gardens and a Swan Lake within the gardens.

A must visit place in Singapore. Highly recommended."
,,Lovely green space,4.0,,"The Unesco World Heritage listed Botanic Gardens, supposedly the most visited botanic gardens in the world, are a very nice place to visit to escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore. We thought that they were much nicer than Gardens in the Bay. Research conducted at the gardens has been responsible for the lovely landscaped highways and the ‘greening’ of Singapore. If you can it is best to enter at one end of the gardens, for instance at the Bukit Timah Gate, accessed from Botanic Gardens MRT Station on the Circle Line. You should then walk all the way through and exit at the Tangkin Gate and pick up a bus on Holland Road ."
,,Prepare to walk a lot.,4.0,,"Visit on a Monday afternoon as a time filler prior to our night flight home.Took a taxi from the CBD dropped us off at the Tanglin Gate, picked up our garden map from the visitor counter, staff marked places on interest on map, then set off following the main gate road past swan lake on to Dell lane, then the Orchid Gardens. There is a $5 admission cost you can also purchase drinks and visit the toilet before entering. Lots to see here also compact to walk around, if photographing orchids close up is your thing, then this is the place for you. Half way round the Orchid garden you can also visit the cool room. Once out of the Orchid gardens we checked out the bandstand then followed Maranta Ave and Lower King Road towards the drop off point Tanglin Gate. The gardens are large we managed to see half only. according to the garden map you can also gain access from Bukit Timah Road.
Once exiting from the Tanglin Gate we were told by staff we could catch a taxi at the nearby Gleneagles Hospital around a 15 minute walk, which we did, finding a line of waiting cabs. The afternoon we were there it was extremely humid, wear light clothing and comfortable walking shoes, take some sun screen and bottled water, although food and drinks can be purchased inside the gardens."
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,A place to escape the city life with a very relaxing feeling. There are abundant and large variety of plants to admire. You will be bound to come across a bootcamp or yoga class. This is a great place to exercise and go for a run/walk.
,,Beautiful gardens!,5.0,,"You must go to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The orchid collection is truly breathtaking, and walking through the rainforest, past historic trees was fantastic. I highly recommend it."
,,Good Place to Spent time,5.0,,"We we together with my wife, sister and mom. That was good time to spent time while in Singapore. You can see so many turtle, black swan and fish. Big play ground also available to spend time with big group."
,,Decent park for Spending an hour,3.0,,Jacob ballis garden is very good for kids. Wish they have staff to check unruly kids. I saw kids throwing sand in the air and it was flying all over. There was no one telling them to behave. The parents just stayed quite throughout. It would be good if this park had staff to manage such incidents.
,,Must visit for nature lovers,4.0,,"Though Singapore itself is quite green, yet the botanical gardens can be very energy restoring place one can go amidst all the shopping, business meetings or tourist spot attraction hopping. Its quite huge and there are portions which are slightly steep to walk. Hence, comfortable walking shoes are must. Obviously, going in the morning is the most preferable time so that one can be back by lunch time. There is a Singapore Metro Station close to it, so reaching there is not much of a hassle and going onwards to another tourist spot is also doable from here.

Also, there is a wonderful orchid garden inside the Botanical Garden which houses almost orchids of all kinds. One has to pay an entrance fee of SGD 5 for entrance. Its really colourful and serene at the same time.

Truly remarkable place for nature lovers."
,,One of the best value attractions in Singapore,5.0,,"We are in Singapore for 10 days and have been struggling for family activities that are good value for money (hard to find, from our experience). On day 9, we decided to walk up to the Singapore Botanical Gardens as a time filler, rather than take the trip to the Zoo. We were not disappointed.

Our walk up Nassim Road to the gate was very interesting. Many Embassies and opulent homes to view. A nice change after the hustle of Orchard Road, and its surrounding high rise apartment living. A little like walking around Beverley Hills.

The Gardens themselves are huge, with many lakes and streams. Our kids enjoyed sitting by Symphony Lake watching the turtles swim. We were also surprised to watch a family of (rather large) lace monitors swimming and sitting in the banks. These sightings were appreciated more as they were unexpected.

Best of all, the main gardens are free, and have many themed areas to visit.

That being said, it is well worth paying the nominal entry fee to visit the Orchid Gardens contained within the grounds themselves. Unlike other paid attractions in Singapore, it is a large exhibit and you can easily pass a few hours wondering around.

We spent around 4 hours within the Gardens and didn't get around it all. Would have been a nice place to take a picnic."
,,Nice but not mandatory,3.0,,"Very nice as a walking destination, good to spend a couple of hours. Orchid garden is inside, a must see if you want to feel like visiting a botanic garden otherwise you feel more like being in a good park."
,,Lovely Oasis in the City,4.0,,"Pick a day to wander through the Gardens. It's a nice place to walk around, and get away from the hustle of the city. We went to the Ballas Kid's Garden, and whilst it is looking a bit worn down, the kids had a great time exploring, and playing. Bring a picnic lunch, some drinks, sunscreen, and insect repellant for a nice day out!"
,,National Orchid garden wonderful.,5.0,,"Gardens are easy to get to by the MRT, they are very well set out with a lot of variance of plants and trees. Easy walking, xmas display of lights in treetops was good. Well worth the visit. The orchid garden within was absolutely beautiful.,"
,,Beautiful place to spend some time and admire the flowers.,5.0,,"The botanic gardens in Singapore is a beautiful haven amongst a bustling city. We spent around 6 hours here, just meandering through the various areas and admiring the beautiful scenery.

Both my wife and I really enjoyed the orchid garden, which is easily the star of the show. There is a small fee to enter ($5 when we visited).

The whole gardens are accessible by buggy/wheelchair and botanic gardens also has its very own MRT station, so getting here couldn't be easier.

In summary we found this a lovely place to visit, and with it being free it makes a nice change from the rest of Singapore with most places costing a small fortune.

Well worth a visit, even if only for a few hours."
,,Loved the Orchid gardens,5.0,,It was worth it to enter the Botanical Gardens just to see the orchid gardens. A collection of hybrid orchids like nowhere else in the world. Highly recommended.
,,A very pleasant park,4.0,,"We had a great afternoon here and enjoyed the lovely walk. It is large so lots of exercise. It was a fairly hot day but as we entered the rain forest area it actually rained lightly and refreshingly.
I was a bit disappointed that the signage offered little detail. But that wasn't the point of our visit."
,,"Beautiful, relaxing and picturesque",5.0,,"Just a little way out of town, or at the end of Orchard Rd, but well worth a visit. The gardens are set out in sections and are wonderful to just stroll around or enjoy sitting by the lake.
It's free to go into the gardens but there is a small fee if you decide to go to the Orchid Garden which is within the gardens. You should, it's beautiful.
It's accessible by train, which we took, but if you're on the hop on hop off tourist but, it stops here too."
,,Massive Gardens - so much to see,5.0,,"So much to see, such little time. You could easily allow a whole day dedicated to the Botanic Gardens, it is truly amazing. Be sure to pay the $5 for the Orchid Gardens. They are absolutely amazing, free for students with ID. Take water though as it is very warm and long walks (feels longer than it actually is, but that was mainly due to the heat for us). Saw some squirrels which made the day. Absolutely amazing place."
,,A little bi dull,3.0,,"To our mindvthis is not one of the best botanical gardens. The most interesting is the orchid dep, but you have to pay extra entrance fee. You must really dig these flowers otherwise you feel slightlybdisappointed. Can be very hotbin sunny days as well. Bring plenty of water"
,,Lots of activities in the morning,4.0,,"My wife and I will do a morning jog there every weekend. The air is fresh in the wee hours before 8 (away from the usual humidity of the rest of day), place is clean with many greeneries and good to see lots of like minded people doing their workouts (yoga, jogging, Tai Chi practice). This is truly a gem to explore in the midst of Singapore city, and akin to its unesco status; what is not to like?"
,,Gorgeuos and Free,5.0,,I am not a gardener (I have NO ability when it comes to plants) but thoroughly enjoyed this park. You can spend an hour or all day. Magnificent grounds.
,,A Nice Place to Retreat to for Tranquility,5.0,,"This place is huge. Very huge.

I was thinking I can see what I need to see in 2 hours but I walked non-stop for 3 hours and there are still places I have not explored.

Do get a map. There are many gardens in this one garden. You will be spoilt for choice. With the map, it will be easier to plan your tour and you will not miss out any attraction.

The admission is free but not to the National Orchid Garden. However, you will not regret paying a small fee to see this beautiful garden! When I was there, as it was the holiday season, locals get to see it for free.

Free up a lot of space on your camera too as there will be many Instagram-worthy shots.

It is a nice getaway right in the middle of the city."
,,Top 10 to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"The Heaven on earth? Probably not but what a ""heaven"". If Singapore in a living garden, The Botanic Gardens would be its museum. A Must do with kids"
,,nice,3.0,,if you have spare time then go for it . it is nice but not really out of the ordinary . if you are staying for many days then go
,,A Wonderful Day at the Singapore Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"Our friends from Penang came to visit and we decided to capitalise on the cool weather by taking a walk through this park.Boy, we were in for a treat cos during the school holidays, the Orchid Garden is free(no admission charges for citizens and PRs)
The orchids were amazingly beautiful, and there were many other equally sights to take in as one strolls along the lusciously green lawns.
It was really a treat to be at the gardens this holiday."
,,Huge to Explore,5.0,,"Free admission.
Rainforest trekking track to walk in the forest.
National Orchid Garden is free admission during this season. Full of species in orchids. Colourful and beautiful. Mist glasshouse to cool you down.
Artifical waterfall in Ginger Garden and shops selling ice-cream to quench our thirst.
My children are running around the slopes at Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage.
Great venue to take photos in Heritage Garden with candy canes decorations.
Playing with the swings.
Feeding catfish in the Swan Lake.
So many squirrels around.
Too huge to explore in a day.
Shall be back again for Jacob Ballas children's garden."
,,Incredible place to have a picnic and enjoy the atmosphere.,4.0,,It's easy to forget you are in the middle of a robust city; it is enjoyable to walk the beautiful grounds and appreciate the atmosphere.
,,Always a pleasure to visit the gardens,5.0,,"I have visited the gardens many times and they are always beautiful . This time I visited at Christmas and part of the gardens were beautifully decorated and looked lovely.the gardens are a great way to spend a few hours.

The gardens are a welcome Oasis in the city. they are accessible on the MRT which makes a visit much easier."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"Botanic Gardens is a very well kept garden and attracts both locals and tourists. It's very big and has a few restaurants in the middle in case you get peckish. The only downside is the heat but as long as you dress aproppriately ( in sports wear or very thin clothes) and bring lots of water, you would appreciate the Botanical Gardens as much as I did and if you're lucky you may see an animal or two."
,,Great public garden!!!,5.0,,"Great place for walk. It was super warm in Singapore, sunshine, over 29 degree in December are not what we wish for winter. This place full with trees and flowers, so beautiful and also decreased the temperature. And most of this area are cost loss!! 很美的花園，各種花朵被細心照料、即使水源在這國家不是易取得的資源，他們不會因此就捨棄照料植物。是用心設計經營的植物園，看的出政府在這方面的用心。大部分的區域都是免入場費的，在炎熱午後能夠有這樣一個鬱鬱蒼蒼、花團錦簇的花園能夠散步，是城市的一大福音！"
,,Never get tired of visiting,5.0,,"Stunningly laid out...a feast of green, even in the midst of a heavy downpour. It is a day worth spending even if just wanting some time out from shopping. Only a $7-$8 taxi fare from Carlton type area (Bras Basah Rd). You can also take MRT. Visit the orchid garden...unbelievably beautiful with strains developed after well known persons"
,,The Best Gardens Ive Ever Been To (And Im not a flower lover),5.0,,I was dragged here with my family and after dreading being bored witless I found this place to be very interesting with something for everybody. The cafe at the main entrance has a mixture of paisan and western meals so it covers everyone and the place is very beautiful and brilliantly maintained. Beautiful paths to walk along between the various parts of the garden make this painless and there are water bubblers and toilets throughout. Special mention to the orchids and the mountain region display which was unbelievable. I now have a new understanding of why orchids are so beautiful
,,Massive gardens,5.0,,Again if your into plants this is lovely huge gardens plenty of walks and lots of displays although also lovely just yo sit and have a picnic
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful well kept gardens with many tourists visiting it but also widely used and appreciated by the locals. Very easy to spend at least a couple of hours here wondering at the beautiful flowers, trees and palms, a tropical paradise. There is also a very nice restaurant/cafeteria here!"
,,Casual Visit with my parents,5.0,,"Really great to catch Christmas lights at night. Gardens are really beautiful, extremely wide variety of plants which are well labelled. The garden is also well equipped with infrastructure such as benches, restaurants, toilets, water coolers and a performance stage. Really good for a stroll at night. There are also a few ponds with swans and many kinds of fishes. There are not much mosquitoes and I didn't get stung at all. A definite must go if you are visiting Singapore!

Recommended to go at night when it's more cooling"
,,So beautiful,5.0,,Very nice botanical garden with lots of attractions. On Sundays hundreds of Filipina maids gather in groups for picknick. Go in the early mornings to avoid the heat and enjoy the new day rising.
,,Very beautiful garden,5.0,,"This free access garden is a must go in Singapore. Some nice restaurants locate here also. It's a great place for family day trip, bring you football, frisbee, snacks to enjoy a wonderful family time. Especially during weekend, some musical performances could arrange here."
,,Great free attraction,5.0,,Spent about 5 hours walking the gardens today and still did not see it all. The gardens is a great leisurely walk.
,,very nice,5.0,,beautiful gardens to walk around or have a picnic. its for free which makes it even better... have already been there several times

,,Excellent to see so many variety,5.0,,"We ,My wife and me went in June 2016. We stayed in Marina bay sands which is one of its Kind. On day 2 we ventured to the Botanical garden just a walk away. They have built a artificial water fall which is quite high and gives a feel of a real one. The species planted come from almost every country of the world. you will need almost 5/6 hours for doing a complete round and appreciating the plants. Then the skywalk around artificial trees is simply splendid. Must see."
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,"Easy to get to on public transportation and free! Only the orchid gardens cost $5 for entry, and it's well worth the price. Spend an hour or several at this beautiful outdoor space."

,,very beautiful park,5.0,,"This is a place that any nature lover would appreciate to visit. Very big park so plan at least couple hours for visit. It is right on MRT stop and it is free to all. Take your time to enjoy the beauty of the nature (if you look for - you can spot some big monitor lizards, some interesting birds, we even saw a small green snake). Do not miss Orchid Gardens!"
,,Amazing Garden,5.0,,"Great place, better than the Gardens by the Bay- its looks more natural and closer to nature than the artificial garden. It has not been declared by UNESCO as a heritage site for nothing. Worth the visit is the Orchards Garden where a wide variety of Orchids can be found."
,,Must see,5.0,,"One of our favorite places in Singapore. Lush, green, interesting, beautiful, peaceful. This is probably my number one must see attraction in Singapore. Good restaurants there too"
,,excellent,5.0,,Went there and just enjoyed the artistic work and just love the grenery scene tand the stone splucture
,,Nice park to walk,4.0,,Very nice park to walk through. It's on the Downtown line so it's simple to get to from most hotels. This time of year they have the equivalent of decorated trees from the various organizations and countries. Nice to walk through. Very good concessions to have a drink or a meal at as well
,,A place to visit,5.0,,I was in Singapore for 4 days and never regretted spending a day in the botanic garden. If you like nature then this is a go place for you.
,,Botanical gardens at its best,5.0,,"There is so much to see in these botanical gardens; if you want to see everything you need a full day. We visited just before Christmas and everything was beautiful with some trees decorated for Christams! There was a Trees of the world"" exhibition theme running at the time, among many other things to see."
,,The best park in Singapore,5.0,,"It is a huge park that stretch from Bukit Timah to Holland Road. The Bukit Timah section is the newer one and it includes the children garden with play areas for kids, Jacob Ballas Children's Garden. However, this garden is off limit to adults unless they are with their kids. The original garden has a wide variety of flowers and landscaping to explore. It even has a rain forest area that is fully board-walked so walking is a breeze. It will need time to explore so plan ahead and decide where to go. The National Orchid Garden section is a must for orchid lovers but there is admission fee involved. Best time to visit a park in Singapore is early morning or late afternoon."
,,Garden of Eden,5.0,,"This year, I took my niece from New York, my sister in law & her daughter form Kuala Lumpur and my brother in law & his daughter from Melbourne, to visit the SBG on separate occasions. They all think the garden really lives up to its Word Heritage award."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a historical site, which I remember visiting when I was really young. Back then, the new attractions like Sentosa and Gardens by the Bay were still part of the sea... Although it is out of the way (far from those new major attractions in Singapore), in my opinion this is worth visiting more than the others.
Park is comprised by multiple large gardens. Beautifully planned and well maintained, you will bound to see something interesting in every corner. National Orchid Garden is a must see which is the only paid section in the park.
There are several restaurants in there for lunch but you can also bring your own sandwiches and have a picnic - plenty of grass area for you to choose! Wear your sunscreen and sunglasses as you will be walking under the bright sun for hours once you are inside! (which I did not do and got sunburn)"
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,"Spend best part of the day just wandering around.
Plenty to see and the Orchard collection is to die for, we loved it.
Take plenty of water as like all places in Singapore it is very humid.
Defiantly be calling in again next time we have a few days stopover in Singapore"
,,Just beautiful!,5.0,,"A wonderful oasis in the middle of Singapore. Although the gardens are very popular you can still find quiet walks and areas. everywhere is beautifully looked after with lots of different areas to explore. We loved the bonsai area and the walks around the lake. The Orchid area was an added bonus, well worth a visit even if you are not particularly interested in plants. The variety of plants and colours keep you snapping photos at every turn. Interesting to see the new varieties too named after famous visitors."
,,A park with scenic old trees and plants,5.0,,A huge park having varied must see trees and plants which you might have came across first time . A botanical garden with all living plants and trees.
,,Go all year.,5.0,,Beautiful location. A just see when in Singapore. Worth visiting at any time of year. There are lots of free events too.
,,Relaxing place for the whole family,5.0,,"We enjoyed our walks around the grounds of the botanical gardens but were rather unhappy when a large signboard announced free entry into the orchid garden during the school holidays. Only upon enquiring at the counter were we told it only applies to local Singaporeans. Then they should say so on the signboard.

Other than that it was quite a relaxing time with monitor lizards crossing the roads and great foliage."
,,Weekly walk,5.0,,"Beautifully maintained gardens, excellent for morning or late afternoon stroll, walk or jog. Favourite spots include National Orchid Garden, Red Brick Path, Palm Valley(for Picnic or watching the open air free music performances). Healing Garden is interesting too with various plants with medicinal properties. A big plus is the accessibility to gardens, with two mass rapid transport (underground) trains stopping at the door step (Botanic Gardens Station). The property was recently awarded with World Heritage status."
,,Beautiful and Relaxing,5.0,,A lovely place to wander around. Everything to a very high standard. Excellent cafe. The National Orchid Garden is a high-light.

,,Singapore Botanical garden,5.0,,"Love this place!It is a beautiful parcel of property.Everything is so well maintained.I never tire coming here. I can only imagine how it was back in the old days with all of the fanfare that must have taken place here. There's something to delight everyone. The orchids are beautiful,the canopy of trees are huge, swans,big koi,monitor lizards,birds will have you oooowing and awwing.Great way to spend part of your day walking around and if you get hungry,there are several resturants to choose from."
,,Good value,5.0,,Nice place for a visit. The Orchid Garden charged $5 for an adult but kids are free. A lot to see so if you have time to kill worthwhile.
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,Beautiful Garden .Must visit. To enter the park is free but there is an entrance fee for the orchid garden you can purchase there.
,,Orchid garden is the highlight,5.0,,The garden is well planted and planned. Very relax to explore but it is very hot and humid even with lots of natural shades from the trees. Orchid garden inside the Botanic garden is a must even you have to pay SGD5 per adult. Lots of species of orchids which are very colorful
,,So green and luscious,5.0,,"We spent the whole day here just wandering around. The gardens were magnificent, so well maintained and easy to navigate. The restaurant was excellent. It was cool and refreshing even though it was a hot day."
,,must visit!,5.0,,A great place to spend your evening. Really well maintained and has a good variety of plants and trees from around the world.
,,156-year-old tropical garden - An UNESCO World Heritage Site,4.0,,"As a child, my parent would bring my siblings for morning walks on weekends for exercises, enjoy the fresh air and the beauty of nature over 60,000 plants which are so well kept at the garden. Some have describe this as a ""nature lovers’ paradise"".
It is also a picnic ground for families. Sitting by the pond watching the goose, and fishes was my favorite. The National Orchid Garden is world renowned and has orchids that are named after dignitaries and celebrities globally.
Regular weekend outdoor concerts is a another big attraction and allow visitors to mix with locals at the garden.
Best time to visit is early in the morning or past 4pm so it won't be too hot.
But mostly come casual and stay on for dinner at one of the restaurants at the garden."
,,Histroy in the Making,5.0,,"Dating back to the early years of the development of Singapore, the Botanical Gardens have a long link to Kew Gardens in London. Perhaps one of the best gardens in the world this is a really lovely escape and allows a quiet meander around a number of different botanical settings. The Gardens by the Bay may be more high tech, but this si still one of Singapore's wonders. Well worth the time to visit. if you plan your visit around lunch, the café near the carpark has one of the best chicken curries and Laksa you can find. Great for all ages."
,,Santa in the tropics,5.0,,Beautiful Christmas light up at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Have a stroll at the only Unesco World Heritage site in Singapore.
,,It is Free,4.0,,"If you have extra time at Singapore, SBG will be a good place for you to walk around. No admission fee. The garden is big. Make sure you wear a comfortable clothing and shoes when you visit SBG."

,,Serene Surroundings,5.0,,"Went for a couple of morning walks ,same culminating in a coffee at the end of walk, great as we took our sister who came to visit Singapore .Moreover a World Heritage"
,,Awesome Orchid Garden,5.0,,"I like orchids but i didn't arrange plan to go to this place: Singapore Botanics Garden. I cancelled my plan to a place then i replaced with this one. My choice was not wrong, this place has an awesome orchids garden that makes me feel ""WOW"".. speechless. Amazing!"
,,aestetics and beauty galore,5.0,,An absolutely beautiful place to visit - and for free (certain sub-gardens excepted) - well maintained and orderly (like everything else in S'pore) this tropical plants are brought out to show their best - well explained with clear maps given for free at the gate. Could have done without the gawdy chistmas displays - that is a misunderstanding and in very poor taste - but the rest of the gardens are beutiful and serene. splurge the $5 on the orchid garden - it is magnificant.
,,It is Amazing!! A must visit place in Singapore.,5.0,,"Never thought it would be so beautiful. It is free of cost and you would walk miles in it. Different trees, colourful flowers and clean air will take you to a different Singapore. There is an Orchid Garden in it which they charge 5 SGD, a must go place."
,,Great Park with some obstacles,3.0,,"When I read Botanic Gardens I think of peace and quiet, but this does not apply to Singapore Botanic Gardens. It doubles as a public park used for sports activities, mainly jogging. Also be wary of greenskeepers racing around on their electric golf carts.
The Gardens are beautiful and contain sections with specialties like the Healing Garden, Ginger Garden, Fragrant Garden and of course the National Orchid Garden (this last one requires an entrance fee of S$5 but it is absolutely worth it)."
,,A absolute must see!,5.0,,This has to be the best botanical garden ever. The orchid exhibition area is probably the biggest and most spectacular in the world.
,,The beauty of the nature,5.0,,"It was fantastic for us to be there. We have seen cool plants, palms, black swan. ...and sadly tons of pokemon players. Hopefully the hype has fallen since then :)"
,,Nice stroll in a great environment,5.0,,"I have been several times to the botanic gardens. This time I brought my family ( wife, toddler and baby) to visit the gardens.
Despite being hot we enjoyed walking around, having some clean air and lying on the grass just relaxing. We were visited by some big lizards (like Komodo dragons) that made it even better for our big boy! ; )
We also visited the orchid garden which is very pretty and enjoyable. This one you have to pay but I believe it's worth it!
We stopped for some water at Casa Verde which also serves food. The grounds are huge so it's better to bring some water and food mainly for kids. A blanket/cloth to use on the grass is also a good add on.
Overall is a great place to visit and spend time."
,,Beautiful despite the rain,5.0,,"The gardens are huge with loads to see. It's very well laid out, with some beautiful plants and information regarding some of them. Definitely recommend for any day, if you fancy being outside in beautiful surroundings. It was also quite quiet and peaceful when we went (perhaps due to the rain)."
,,A Singapore Must See,5.0,,Free admission to a very large and outstanding botanic garden that is also an UNESCO World Heritage site.
,,Wonderful and free!,5.0,,"These gardens are very east to reach by the underground/metro system. The grounds are extensive and well thought out. The trellis gardens, rainforest walk and evolution garden are worth a small detour off the main path, since they are very impressive. We were there in December and many of the main paths were lined with Christmas trees decorated by different countries and organisations. The main tourist centre is well stocked with reasonably priced goods and there is a cafe/restaurant there that serves good food and drinks. Swan lake has a tremendous sculpture of swans flying up from the water and there is a delightful Victorian summerhouse at one end overlooking the water. A must visit within the gardens is the Orchid garden. You do have to pay to enter, which for us senior citizens amounted to $1 each. This is the most incredible display of orchids, not I. A greenhouse, but planted in beds and on trees, and the layout is continually being rethought and replanted. Outside, and next to the Orchid garden is the Ginger garden; again worth a walk through, since as with everywhere else, there is a plethora of information as well as plant varieties. You may be lucky to visit when the Shaw auditorium is in use. A lovely performance space in an expansive green oasis. Even if you aren't interested in plants you cannot fail to be impressed by this place: great for a family picnic with plenty of room for children to play."
,,Great place to run around,5.0,,Great collection of plants. So many wildlife. Many kids and parents plus people walking their dogs. Kids enjoy playing here and meet other kids.
,,Great Place to Relax,5.0,,"Definitely lovely way to spend a morning. The Botantical Gardens are located in the city but you wouldn't know it. It's perfect for everything from walking a dog, getting some exercise or having a picnic somewhere on the grounds."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"I went the the Singapore Botanical Gardens one morning to beat the heat. It was very interesting seeing people doing tai chi, yoga, group exercise, running, walking, & relaxing. With each step, I saw a beautiful vista, well-placed sculpture, stunning flower, joyful children, and serene enjoyment of nature. This was a top experience in Singapore!!!"
,,The Gift That Keeps on Giving,4.0,,"Clean, beautiful and cosmopolitan Singapore is anything but an 'urban jungle' with plenty of green spaces and gardens big and small. What was so special about this garden was the overall size, the variety of activities on offer, and the convenient location on the Downtown Line. High points included the Orchard Garden, the lake teeming with TURTLES!!!! ; the shady areas for family and community picnics and the outdoor theatre. Make sure you have your walking shoes on!"
,,Fantastic Gardeb,5.0,,"My wife and I enjoy this garden very much. Of special note is the Orchid Garden-the best we have ever seen.
We highly recommed for a vist. One great thing is that there is no charge for the gardens, and only a small fee for the Orchid garden"
,,Consider if time is in abundance,2.0,,"We went to the Botanic Gardens in the hope to see a large variety of flora and fauna in a city that seemed to place pride in showcasing it's green-fingered nature.
As a walk, it's pleasant enough and on a hot day, provided some nice scenery.
Hoqever, there was not much to see and the orchid garden, for which there was a small fee, was very underwhelming.
If you fancy a walk and have the time for it, then it might provide some benefit to you, otherwise worth skipping, especially the orchid garden!"
,,☺worth a visit .,4.0,,To get there . Walking was good for us but it a bit of a trek but they do provide a shuttle bus. Try and leave there as it goes dark and watch the lights starr to come on .
,,Best day out,5.0,,The gardens were spectactularly care for and well worth a visit. The orchids were the highlight and the complimentary wheel chair was ideal for my partner. Thanks
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful! So many gorgeous plants and the gardens are peaceful and quiet! Well worth your time.
,,Must be heaven,5.0,,"A superb place to spend a day, the varieties on display are amazing, Swan Lake was lovely however the Orchid garden is a must."

,,Outstandingly good,5.0,,"As a Long term resident of Singapore, this is one of my favourite places. If you want a nice leisurely jog or a stroll this is the place. Simply fantastic and so many plants and things to see."
,,The worst experience in Singapore.,1.0,,"Ｉwant to share the worst experience.
In spite of We Have a little child, My husband couldn't enter the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden in The Botanic Garden.
My husband went to a washroom at outside near the gate.
So i and my child entered the garden first.And we was playing at sandarea.
After my Husband used to washroom, He was stopped entry into the garden by security.
Becouse he didn't with our child at that time.
He explained that his family inside garden,But She flatly refused to let him in.
And then she said ""I CAN NOT TRUST YOU""
Even he was not allowed to enter with her for looking us.
Is this world heritage!?????"

,,Wow - what an amazing place to visit!,5.0,,A must see for any tourist to Singapore. Wander through there beautiful grades and sit down by the lake where concerts take place. Get there easily on the hop on hop off bus!
,,Take a day off at the Botanic Gardens,4.0,,"After a few days of shopping, stop by the Botanic Gardens. It's great for recovering from shopping and eating excess. It's central and easy to get to by public transportation. There are really old trees and many different parts to visit. Especially now during the Christmas season, they have lighted up parts of the garden and it adds to the festivity. Though the light up isn't as spectacular as Gardens by the Bay, it's free and not as crowded."
,,Unesco Gardens,4.0,,"I, visit the gardens every weekend so this review is more for tips on how to visit the gardens for a pleasant experience.

Do wear a good track shoes and light clothing, bring water bottles and hat/cap
Visit during the morning or early evening as it is very hot in the afternoon. If you are coming from the Nassim Road gate (visitor centre) just visit the gardens by going left, that is where the orchid gardens are.
If you are coming in by MRT, Botanic Gardens MRT is at Cluny Road, It will be a long walk thru the gardens. Not much to see around there, mostly for families doing picnics.
Be prepared to spend half a day there, and one of the cheaper attractions in Singapore, different experience with the City's Gardens by the Bay."
,,Fantastic orchids,4.0,,Visited on part of a tour of Singapore and really glad we did. Beautiful gardens with fantastic displays of orchids. Wish we could have spent longer there.
,,Diverse greenery to explore,5.0,,"I live in Singapore and thus visit the Gardens regularly. Early morning walking is best when you call smell the fresh aromas of the of the dawn,before the sun burns them away. There are also pockets of people doing Tai Chi and you are most welcome to join in,so dont be shy. The Gardens can get rather busy on Sundays as its domestic workers day off. It is actually quite delightful to see them all together,picnicing and the excited cacophony of Tagaloc rising as they catch up on the weeks gossip. It is often not unusual for them to sing and play guitars and can be quite entertaining to stop and listen.
The flora and fauna of the Gardens is very diverse. Walk under the canopy of trees,follow the rain forest trail,picnic on the lawns,visit the Orchid Garden to see an amazing number of beautiful plants. They often grow hybrids also and have a section of orchids named after notable people who have visited the Gardens. The Garden itself I believe is over 150 years old and I often look at some of the massive old trees and ponder what changes they have ''seen'' in their life spans. The gardens are centrally located,very close to Orchard Rd and is a must visit for all ages.Free as well but you will have to pay a token amount to access the Orchid Garden!"
,,An UNESCO icon Singapore should be very proud of,5.0,,"Not often can a recreational garden successfully blend science and beauty. But Singapore gardens does this in spades.

Go early morning so the gardens have just been watered and you will spot the water droplets in the flowers. You will also see many Tai Chi activists and may even want to join in.

Make sure you drop into the free galleries and museums along the way so you get a full appreciation of the history.

Also the Orchid Garden is a can not miss!"
,,Beautiful and spacious,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Garden is huge, and there’s so much to see. You could pack a nice picnic lunch and easily spend your entire day there. The park itself is free, but if you're there, you have to go to the National Orchid Garden too. There is a nominal SG$5 fee to get into the National Orchid Garden, but it is absolutely worth it. Orchids are my favorite flower, so seeing all the different types in various shapes, colors, and patterns all in one place is just fabulous. Plus, the garden has designated “photo spots” for you to take the best pictures with the most beautiful backgrounds. It took us maybe 1-2 hours to walk through the Orchid Garden alone. Quite spacious and beautifully laid out.

The Botanic Gardens has a number of different sections for different types of plants. The Ginger Garden also caught my eye, but we didn't have enough time.

Word of advice: Make sure to bring an umbrella just in case. We were there at the end of monsoon season in November and we were caught in a torrential downpour! If it weren’t for our umbrellas, we would’ve soaked through.

It's my favorite spot in Singapore and a must visit if it's your first time there."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,4.0,,Very conveniently located for visitors. Very large place and will take visitors more than three hours to cover.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,This park is incredible and huge. You could spend several days here. Easy access by the MRT; it drops you off at the entrance. The main entry fee was a little steep...FREE! Ha ha. And the $5 to enter the largest orchid garden in the world is a no brainer. Fantastic and spotlessly clean. Ignore the complaints in reviews saying it's too hot. Of course it's hot; you're on the equator. Plenty of shade and a frosty Tiger Beer tastes even better when the heat is on.
,,Well worth the walk from Orchard Road,4.0,,If you are on Orchard Road and fancy a break from all the hassle of shopping then The SBG is just a 20 min walk away. You can relax and eat lunch or watch the dancers in the park running through their latest routines.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"The Garden has beautiful flowers, and the scenery get more fascinating by night time. Funny, there were no bugs to annoy us, though it was full of plants"
,,well worth a visit,4.0,,The weather was not great during our few days in Singapore but we did manage a few rain free hours with some sun to visit here .It is free to enter and is a quiet and relaxing place .
,,Botanical garden,5.0,,"You can loose yourself in these gardens, a real oasis of peace and tranquility, spotlessly maintained and with interesting plant collections. And free entry!"
,,Absolutely beautiful garden s,5.0,,Our favourite botanical gardens in the world gardens are always our first places to visit and this beats the lot..stopped for a refreshing drink of ginger and lemongrass and this really did the job. Be aware gardens are free with orchids gardens only $1 for over sixties but refreshments are very expensive.as expected in Singapore.
,,A must see,5.0,,"My number 1 spot among the places in Singapore I have seen. great for walking, taking pictures, relaxation & breath of fresh air.
Very clean, quiet & natural. Its free except the Orchid garden that needs 5 Singapore dollars for entrance but its beyond worthy. The Orchids are amazingly Beautiful, indeed"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We visited the botanical gardens on our last day in Singapore, so we didn't have time to explore the entire garden. However, the portion that we visited was well manicured and blended well with the surroundings. It is listed on the UNESCO heritage site as one of the best botanical gardens in the world, and it is easy to see why.

Pros:
It is free (except for the National Orchid Garden hidden within the gardens), easy to access within the center of the city, has multiple access points and has its own terminal on the MRT route.

The National Orchid Garden within the garden is the only part of the garden that has an entry fee and it is only $5 Singapore dollars. It is stunning and well worth the cost.

We got lucky and had the opportunity to see two black swans interacting with the park maintenance crew as they gathered lake moss to use as fertilizer for the trees.

Cons:
There are none unless you consider how large the gardens are and the time and energy needed to explore the whole thing. It is beautiful and an absolutely must see for any nature lover."
,,Don't missed the Orchard Garden,4.0,,"One of the largest botanic gardens that I have visited, it is also well maintained throughout. The best part is the Orchard garden, which requires a ticket ($5 for adults) but it is totally worth it"

,,Favourite place in Singapore,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are so beautiful, lots to do for children and adults. I spent a lot of time relaxing here and taking serene walks during my free time.

,,Night walk in the gardens.,4.0,,"Me and my wife went on the night walk. It was free to get in, there was a Christmas theme being December.

The walkways were lined with trees which had been decorated by local schools and businesses using lights and a multitude of items.

You entered via a small garden which had been tastefully decorated with lights, and there was a good atmosphere.

The walk was very pleasant, and took about 1 hour to walk through the gardens following the lights, you could have diverted and done you own thing. At the end there is a car park, but it was a long walk to the nearest bus station.

There was a band stand in the middle, with bags containing candle like lights, and on the steps the bags spelt ""will you marry"".

It was very romantic place."
,,Squirrels!,5.0,,"Had a great run through the gardens, recovering from the singapore marathon. It's all decorated for Christmas and looked so pretty. We saw heaps,of squirrels, so cute! And there was lots of shade to hide from the Singapore heat."
,,Enjoyable and relaxing moments,5.0,,Enjoyable and relaxing moments while walking inside.Be prepared to walk many km inside the garden surrounded by many plants and trees from around the world. Good place for morning jig.Opens around 8am.Entrance is free of charge.Do not miss the orchard garden inside.Did you know that Singapore exporta mire than 60 mil orchid plants per year. You have to pay a certain fee.
,,Nice walk in the garden,4.0,,Some interesting areas in the botanical garden. You also have the indoor garden and walk in the trees (both which you have to pay). Nice area to get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore city.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This indoor/ outdoor garden is so beautiful with many various species of tropical flowers, trees and cactus. It has theme areas and an amazing conference/ venue centre attached ."
,,Lovely gardens and free entry,4.0,,Spent an afternoon exploring the gardens and walking around. The gardens were so peaceful and a perfect place to escape the busy city atmosphere. We were lucky it was a dry day however quite humid but lots of water stations around to top up your water bottles. Also good facilities on site. Entry was also free. Would definitely recommend.
,,One of my favourite places in my country,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is well-kept and has numerous areas to explore within the garden grounds. I especially love to go for leisure runs or when they are free concerts at the Symphony Lake. Do be mindful of the limited parking lots on popular days like concert days and why not go earlier to take a walk around the pretty park before settling for a nice picnic.It can get quite warm and humid, and mozzies might attack so do dress appropriately.
The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a place of interest that I highly recommend to all my foreigner friends and they often fit it in their itinerary on a morning before visiting the shopping malls of Orchard road."
,,My favourite walking garden,5.0,,"Nicest in the morning around 7am where it's cool and quiet. Sightings of monitor lizard, swans at swan lake, catfish, koi, etc. Yesterday's sighting of an Oriental Pied Hornbill was a surprise. Lovely clusters of blooming Vanda Miss Joaquim near the bandstand (Nassim Gate)."
,,A 'must see',5.0,,I had been here years ago when there were monkeys in the grounds. Was encouraged by a resident to return and it was one of the highlights of the trip. Took heaps of photos of orchards and the gardens in general. A great break from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road. Staff in the gift shop were very friendly and gave informative information about Singapore in general.
,,Wow,5.0,,"A real nice part of the Botanic Garden! Very well-planned and well-organized, and an enormous number of orchids to see. A must for anyone interested in orchids!"
,,GREAT and its free,5.0,,"Lovely place to stroll through. It is free to enter and currently has trees of the world which individually decorated Christmas trees. The Orchid garden which is FABULOUS has an admission fee for tourists, but it is only S$5. Recommended to everyone as the number one place to go in Singapore."
,,One of our favourite places in this fascinating city.,5.0,,We have visited Botanical Gardens all over the world - and this is one of the finest! So many areas I cannot list them all. I could spend a week here and not be bored. And they have several nice places to eat - as varied as the flora - and two shops. My favourite is the one by the main entrance!
,,Green and Glorious,5.0,,"Fancy walking around for free in one of the best botanic garden in the world, well here it is. Beautifully maintained and well thought out, this is a wow to visit."
,,A friendly garden for all,5.0,,"A beautiful garden within minutes from Orchard Road and suitable for all ages. The best time to visit is early morning to feel the dew or early evening to feel the sunset rays thru the trees. The trees and plants are from Asia, some are planted many many years ago. The orchid garden within is simply awesome. There are seats at short intervals for the old or tired visitors. The palm valley - a popular place for picnics for the locals. The valley is like a shallow bowl and the parents have ""helicopter view"" while the children play. A wonderful place just to ""people watch""."
,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,Make time for these gardens. The variety and quantity of superbly cultured orchids are an eye opener.
,,Beautiful Gardens hard to enjoy in the humidity,5.0,,"We strolled around the gardens but the hummidity was so high we had to curtail our trip. The gardens are beautiful with many attractions within including Orchid garden and theatre. Many restaurants and places to sit and watch the world go by, a must see."
,,Beauty in the night,5.0,,"This place is one of our favourite walks at night. We would usually go around 9+ to 10pm and there would be just a couple of strollers like us who love this garden.
There has been a new car park along Tyersall Rd, from Hollande Rd and it's near to the Ginger Garden.
We would normally start from this point or from the car park at Nassim Gate from Cluny Rd.
Our route takes us round the ""old"" garden, from the pond near the main gate at Holland Rd to the other surrounding the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage. It's a cool 45 min walk and along the way, you could smell some wonderful scents of flowers."
,,scenic landscaped garden,4.0,,"peaceful and relaxing atmosphere away from the busy and polluted city, great place for walking and running with slight uphills, great place to relax and enjoy family time with your loved ones."
,,Nice for leisure walk yourself or the dog can walk you :),4.0,,"There's Christmas trees lights decoration right now, free entrance to the Orchid Gardens too for local residents."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"You need your walking shoes on for this one - although you can do as much or as little as you like. Its easy accessible by train or bus.
The gardens are spectacular, well maintained and the flowers beautiful. Take a picnic if you can - there's places to sit and relax"
,,Fantastic for adults and Asian children ( encouraged to be interested),4.0,,"Loved it, walked in a rain forest, saw lizards in the shrubbery and lake. You don't have to love plants to enjoy but it helps! Only did half on first visit as it was a hot day but returned to go to the orchid garden. It is lovely, could easily spend a few hours as the restaurants were good too. Can wander about at no cost except a small charge for orchid garden."
,,One word: wonderful,5.0,,"The botanic garden is something unique. It is under Unesco patrimony. The orchids are more than wonderful and if you want to relax, there is a nice bar inside"
,,Not worth a visit if you have been to Gardens By the Bay,3.0,,"A wide range of flora, but the walk could become unbearable on a hot and sunny day. If you are not a fervent enthusiast of botany, fatigue and boredom may set in after navigating the expansive landscape for, say, 1 hour or so. Very scenic spot, could be a good place to relax IF the weather is cool. If you have a tight schedule, just visit either this or Gardens by the Bay. If on a tight schedule and fear the heat, just visit the latter."
,,A delight for eyes,5.0,,There is no doubt that this is one of the most beautiful and clean places in the city. You will find beauty in whichever direction you will look at. I could have spent whole say here if I would have had a day free. Definitely a must visit attraction.
,,Magnificent!!!,5.0,,"December is the best time to visit Singapore Botanic Garden.

With the trees light-up at Botanic Gardens , it feels like u are in a paradise. Is it just magnificent. I would love to be there everyday and enjoy that beautiful view that brings u to a wonderful world with different flowers , lights and colors.

Dot miss the chance of visiting Singapore Botanic Gardens as it is really the best in the world of its kind.

4th December 2016"
,,Great and free!!!!,4.0,,When was the last time you could visit a great place free!!!! Walk through those superb garden from the et station to reach the national orchid garden .
,,So much to see in the Garden,5.0,,"It took us the entire afternoon to see the garden and we did not finish seeing everything. There is so much to see in the garden: orchid garden, healing garden, cactus garden, the outdoors park with an amphitheatre, and much more. For us it was easy to get there. We took the SMRT train to the garden and walked right in."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Love the botanic gardens. It's a must go see!!!! The orchid house is amazing. It's quite hilly and humid but the trick is to take it slowly and gently. And enjoy.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"We went to the botanical gardens for an afternoon whilst on a short stop over. What a beautiful place to walk and relax in. If you have time and are fed up of shopping malls everywhere you go, then this place is a must!"
,,100% worth a visit,5.0,,One of the highlights of our Singapore trip. Take a whole morning to wander the gardens. So refreshing and beautiful! All within 10 mins of the city. So beautifully planned and maintained.
,,Very big place...,3.0,,"Since we were at marina bay gardens and the japanese gardens and here I would choose only marina bay gardens if I came back to Singapore again and short of time. The place is so big and so much to see all is green peace and beautiful well taken care of and the map and routs are clear. Easy to get here and relex if you look for a green spot. Look at google images before coming its reflecting. Came with kids 6,9,11 and they lost their patience after 1 hour of walking and looking at the greens..."
,,Cool place,5.0,,"If anyone come to Singapore for traveling must go to this place, especially the National Orchid Garden, if you are a flower lover!!!!"
,,Heaven on earth!,5.0,,"A world heritage site and deservedly so. This was our third visit to these magnificent gardens and hopefully it won't be our last. There is so much to see and absorb with the amazing collections of plants and trees that you could probably go every week and still see something different.
Another bonus is that there is no charge for admittance apart from the orchid garden where a small fee (SGD 5) is charged. There are lakes, fountains, waterfalls and some wonderful sculptures positioned around the garden. It's popular with locals and tourists alike and probably the best time to visit is in the morning or evening when it should be slightly cooler. Clearly there is a lot of hard work undertaken to maintain these gardens ....paths are clearly signposted and most, if not all, the plants are labeled. There are plenty of seats to rest those weary feet and various cafes around to buy a cold drink.
The botanic gardens are a collection of individual gardens all with their distinctive charecter and the gardens, as all gardens should, continues to develop with new projects underway. In one part of the garden, which we found particularly fascinating, are steps built using bricks made by prisoners of war in Singapore charecterised by an arrow on the brick face.
There are some magnificent trees and it's not difficult to spot various birds and insects. The gardens display nature at its best and hopefully it will make people wonder why we are so intent on destroying it.
If you are only in Singapore for a few days, visiting the Botanic Gardens should be a priority! Make sure camera batteries are fully charged and a notebook and pen available. You won't be disappointed."
,,Massive garden to be explored and just gorgeous!,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens inside this magical place. We visited the orchids, the bonsai garden, ginger garden and so much more. Lovely walk. Also bought few small things from their gift shops. Would highly recommend. Visited during our honeymoon in Jan 2015 but cannot change the year."
,,A lovely walk,4.0,,"Botanic Gardens are a great place to unwind and walk around greenery and tranquility. If you have a bit of time left in your schedule, don't hesitate to go."
,,gardens for wisdom,4.0,,"Pretty weell kept and developed. I got to know ginger thru the extensive dedicated area. Orchids section , which is not free, what a pity, is really good and popular..."
,,Christmas at Botanic Gardens,4.0,,"There are beautiful lights up during this time of the year till 31 st December every night . THe garden is open daily from 5 am. To 12 mid night ! Lights up in the gardens start around 7 pm .
The atmosphere is great with Christmas carols and music being played from speakers around certain attractions. This garden is also under Unesco Heritage sight for the Greenary since 2015 !

However, if you are a Orchids lover you have to visit the National Orchids gardens situated next to it ."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"If gardens are your thing this is the one not to miss. From memory at least 2 acres of careful planning and planting provide you with a feast to the eye. The orchid centre is obviously the high point and centre point of the gardens. There is a small fee to enter the orchid gardens but it is a must do. I found the gift shop very interesting too with some novel items for sale that would not disappoint. To be honest , one day is not enough to fully appreciate. Take 2 and stay awhile sitting admiring the beautiful sculpture of swans at oddly enough swan lake !!"
,,Best Flower Garden!,4.0,,This is such a beautiful place and must not be missed. The orchids are breathtaking. The place is so stunning that one could stay there all day and not want to leave! A truly Singapore attraction.
,,you must go,5.0,,"if you are kind of nature oriented so this is where you must go and see there are many flowers and plants and ponds in there its free to visit and takes a long time to see the whole , consider enough time for it"
,,Spend half a day here.,5.0,,"It is totally worth the time. The feeling that you are in the middle of a dense forest is easy to get, but very easy to forget as well when you come across all the facilities that are provided. The walk through the gardens, sitting there among the trees. Its easy to get a grip on the idea that a little neglect and the whole of Singapore could be easily overrun by this fauna. Walking through it with a slight drizzle is really beautiful."
,,Beautiful Grounds,5.0,,"We've been here numerous times. The gardens are beautiful and laid out well. Being Singapore, they are kept in immaculate condition. With the opening of the Downtown Line on the MRT, it's even easier to get here. Just get off st the Botanic Garden station, go upstairs and walk about 20 steps and you're there.

Two suggestions. Go early or go in the evening and bring water. I can't imagine mid-day is much fun with the heat and humidity."
,,Serene,5.0,,"Despite the heavy footfall, the gardens simply exude serenity. The only ones not to come under its spell are babies and frisky dogs. They've taken over Raffles hostel next day and introduced a food court for some variety to the F&B. Glad to see that it has kept its charm."
,,Must do for any visitor,5.0,,"You don't have to be a gardener or a flower/plant lover to appreciate Botanic Gardens. I found it fascinating discovering all the tropical plants which are set out in amazing arrangements. Very relaxing strolling around the miles and miles of paths.... if you feel stressed, find a dog and take it for a walk around Botanic Gardens. With so many trees, the dogs love it too!"
,,You must see.,5.0,,"You must see. The uniquely beautiful place. If visiting Singapore is required, must find time to see it."
,,A must visit!,5.0,,Beautifully set out with an amazing range of plants. Spent hours here but could easily have stayed longer. Good restaurants too. No entry fee which is an added bonus!
,,Lovely afternoon out,5.0,,"We spent our Stop over day visiting the gardens as we had missed them on our 3 day stay on way to Australia
We wholeheartedly recommend them
Walk slowly and quietly and you will see fauna as well as flora
Oh and take hat and water It gets hot !!!"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"This is one of the best botanic gardens I have seen around the world. There is a lot of variety. Different areas you can escape into and best of all... Its an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. Take a picnic or buy snacks there (but make sure you put the rubbish in the bins - heavy fines in Singapore). This area is great if you just want to walk, or go for a jog. Great family place too."
,,I just felt in love with this place,4.0,,"Im a reall nature guy, love to be outdors. I need to say one of the most amazing and well maintained gardens I ever saw. Its so spacious therecare constant atractions thete like concerts and shows. Would love to have an apartment with a view on this place. You can easilly spend entire day thereo"
,,Amazing .Deserves its World Heritage Title,5.0,,"We have seen Botanical Gardens in various countries. This is in a class of its own. The Orchid Garden is absolutely gorgeous. Everything is in perfect settings and maintained to an unbelievable level. Don't hum and har, just go and see it for yourself."
,,Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"You really have to see these gardens to understand how special they are. Free entry and you can get there on the hop on/hop off bus, taxi or MRT. Beautifully laid out and maintained immaculately.
They have protected a section of the rain forest that used to cover the whole of Singapore before the concrete and glass arrived.
Make time to have lunch at the Visitor Centre by Nassim Gate. The local items on the menu are great and probably the best value food you'll come across in your time visiting Singapore. can't recommend this highly enough. We did it in light rain which kept the temperature down. Just borrow an umbrella from the hotel and you'll be fine. Make sure you go to the Orchid section. 5S$ entry and well worth it."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,Recently made a Unesco heritage site. A very big garden with very good collection of flowers. A must visit for nature loving tourist. Entry is free.
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,Fantastic gardens immaculately kept with a fabulous collection of orchids. I can not recommend a visit here too highly.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Really great place to explore. Spent the morning walking around the whole gardens and paid the extra to see the orchids.
,,Beautiful but vast,4.0,,"Choose a cool day if you can. We enjoyed our walk around the Botanical Gardens. It involves a lot of walking so be prepared with sunshades to protect you from the sun. It is very interesting and well set out.
The orchid house and cool greenhouse had a small charge for entry but were worth it. Seniors do get in a reduced rate so carry proof of age."
,,Lovely spot,4.0,,"The orchid gardens were a highlight, and be prepared to walk quite a bit if you arrive from the botanic gardens MRT station!"
,,like in Paradise!,4.0,,great botanic garden with nice atmosphere! an impressive Orchard garden too - a must see. well organized and a place to recover from stressful days.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"An oasis of peace and calm away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Plenty of shaded paths. The Botanic Gardens MRT stop takes you right to the Bukit Timah Gate, or alternatively you can get off the MRT at Orchard and then several buses stop very near the Tanglin Gate. The Tanglin Gate is nearer to the National Orchid Gardens (for which there is a small charge, currently S$5 for adults/S$1 for seniors) which is definitely worth paying for. The flowers are absolutely stunning.
The Botanic Gardens are very popular with locals at the weekends and you'll find lots of families picnicking although it never feels crowded because of the size. It is much quieter on a weekday."
,,A Must,5.0,,"The most beautiful place, fantastic orchids, beautifully peaceful. Very well kept, free to go in the air I'd gardens are 5dollars for Adults and 1dollar for the over 60's"
,,Beautiful green respite from city life!,4.0,,A wonderful spot to stroll about with family or friends. Plenty to see and enjoy. Don't miss the orchid gardens. Beautiful flowers on display.
,,Absolutely Nature in the city,4.0,,The garden is absolutely a natural garden within just 5 mins from the busy shopping and dining belt of Orchard Road from either of its two entrances by subway or public bus. Yet it display new trend of vegetations and modern comfort while still giving her visitor a leisure calm type feeling as strolling in a garden. Suitable for entry at anytime of the day ; invoking a different sense of goodness every times
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Went for a morning jog through the botanic gardens. Let's just say Singapore does it right. From the landscaping, to the rainforest walk, and gazebos it captures the local and regional flora quite spectacularly. Many small cafes and venues to get some quiet in the midst of a busy city . Highly recommended!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Beautiful well maintained garden. Lovely walk. Great for kids to run around. A new surprise after ever bend.
,,Hidden treasures abound!,5.0,,"Despite clearly labeled sign posts, every very corner of the park seems to hide some wonderful secret. From restaurants Blue Bali and Halia, to the concert in the park venue, it's always a pleasure to visit the gardens."
,,Nice place to spend time,4.0,,"Visited there during weekend at business trip. A lots of plants, trees, flowers, etc. to see. We could not even walk through whole garden. You could spend there whole day or two."
,,"Beautiful, especially the orchid garden",5.0,,"On almost every visit to Singapore we enjoy the Botanical gardens and this time we walked the entire distance from top to bottom of the park. We especially enjoy the Orchid gardens, for which one needs to pay an admission fee, which is absolutely worth it. The orchids are stunning and the grounds are beautifully kept.

A visit to the gardens is a must when in Singapore."
,,Fresh and Green,4.0,,"During our honeymoon five years ago, we were visit this gardens, many kinds of plants over there, clean and green"
,,Walk around the gardens,5.0,,Very good walk with family through the rain forest and next to the reservoir. Plenty of shade from the trees. Good views from the top.
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens ... my other great jogging place,5.0,,"I also like to jog in the Botanic Gardens in the morning, but the reason Gardens on the Bay is better than Botanical Gardens is that you can just walk across the helix bridge to the Bay, while transportation to and from Botanical is inconvenient (especially early in the morning to find a taxi to go back to the hotel is a bit inconvenient)."
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"This is a beautiful place even if you're not into gardens etc. It's incredibly well laid out and there's lots to see and it's free of charge, except the Orchidarium which is S$5 to enter which I recommend.

You can easily spend half a day or more here.

Obviously plenty of walking required.

A must thing to do."
,,Wonderful walk though established gardens,5.0,,Spent a few hours wandering around this fantastic place with different gardens including a rain forest in the indigenous species from Singapore. Well worth a visit to the orchid garden as this was incredibly well presented.
,,"The Orchid Garden is the ""must see"" here",4.0,,"The humidity slowed us down here, so we did not see the whole of the site.
But the Orchids section has to be seen - it has the most beautiful flowers in many colours and forms.
We took a half day, which was tiring in the humidity."
,,Interesting garden,4.0,,Nice garden with different plant. Especially good to visit in dark. Exciting walk throw the park. Worth to visit
,,Really lovely place to walk around,5.0,,I have been here several times before but on this trip originally went to Gardens by the Bay as people recommended that however I still felt I needed to visit the Botanic Gardens as it is feels so much more about the plants and trees here rather than Gardens by the Bay which feels more about the architecture around. Could happily return here so many more times.
,,Stunning Orchids & Ginger flowers,5.0,,"On the Yellow bus route, the gardens were getting their Christmas decorations which cheered the spirit. An avenue of privately decorated trees by families, schools and businesses lined the route to the Orchid Garden. Glorious orchids of all shapes and sizes planted in drifts. Palm valley vista was stunning. Do visit."
,,Small tortoise and swans in pond,4.0,,We have some hours extra and decided to go to Botanical Gardens. Go via SMRT and it takes you to the gate of the gardens. Child was delighted to play with swans and tortoise in the pond there. It was a pleasant surprise and worth the visit.
,,The best free thing to do in Singapore - a must visit,5.0,,One of the greatest assets of the country is it's gardens. Lots to see and look at and plenty of eating and refreshment options. Service from the park staff was efficient and friendly. Recommend visiting early in the morning when it is a little cooler. Go for breakfast!

,,Lovely place; very huge,5.0,,"Our flight back from Singapore was in the night and we had time after lunch so decided to visit the botanical gardens. Our first impression was - its beautiful and its huge!! It is very well kept. We saw some of the garden and then moved to the Jacob Ballas Childen's garden. Its a very good timepass for kids. Our 6 yr old loved the mechanical excavator in the garden and spent considerable amount of time there,making us go back again and again.

Entry to the garden is free and one can take picnic basket and have a fabulous time. If you have time, do visit the garden."

,,We always visit the gardens,5.0,,"Overtime we get to Singapore we go to the gardens and walk through from one end to the other. Its generally cooler than the local area, particularly in the shade and its very relaxing.

Make sure you spend at least an hour here on your visit to Singapore - calm down and relax!"
,,Great place for a morning walk.,4.0,,"Did an early morning walk at the gardens. It is really a nice experience. Joggers of all ages, people walking dogs, and the set up of the gardens is awesome. Stunning flora/ fauna, well maintained and everything looked manicured. Go early, and don't miss the orchid garden."
,,The most beautiful gardens,5.0,,The orchid garden is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. There are thousands of varieties of orchids.
,,"Very expansive, but a beautiful walk if you don't mind the heat",5.0,,"Our first time to the gardens and we weren't disappionted, however we couldn't find a particular area we were after despite following the map.
The Orchid garden is well worth paying the money for to get into.
So many beautiful photo opportunities right throughout the whole garden, but if you are not used to the heat, there is a lot of ground to cover in high humid conditions.

In the 3/4 hr walk, from Cluny gate to Tanglin gate, found a bonsai garden, some statues, christmas decorations, swings to rest on, more water stuff, etc.

Being a weekend, had lots of yogi groups plus one chinese exercise group. Loads of doggies and the usual joggers."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Singapore is my Favorite in Asia as it has everything to offer and Its like Mini Europe for me . The gardens are free to enter and very beautifully maintained
,,Amazing Gardens,5.0,,This place is not to be missed and is not only for flower lovers. The orchid gardens and sculptures were extraordinary and it is easy to get to if you take the HOP ON HOP OFF BUS.
,,Lovely visit,5.0,,"Absolutely great experience and definitely worth doing when in Singapore! Such a stress relieving and relaxing place to have a gentle stroll around and take in the natural beauty when remembering you are in the centre of Singapore. With a mini Rainforest, Orchid garden and an eco garden, the multiple differing sections of the gardens make this a great place for anyone to get a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the Singapore street life."
,,worth a unesco award,5.0,,the botanic garden is one of the few places in singapore where nature is in intact and untouched by the mankind. you will find orchids some as far as 80 years old and of course the national flower of singapore. good to set aside 2-3 hours for leisure walk.

Our favorite was the orchid garden. But many other places to visit. Entire park is well maintained. Lots of signs to point the way. It gets hot, so bring water. There are a couple of places to buy food and drinks once inside as well. If I lived in Singapore I would be a regular here."
,,My Narnia!,5.0,,"I am a plant Junkie. I admit it. Singapore Botanic Gardens was a highlight of my visit. We walked from our Orchard Road hotel( 15 minutes, approx), past the beautiful embassy buildings and the ongoing construction that keeps Singapore such a progressive city.
Once inside the gates, you are in an oasis! Lawns for people to do tai chi, box, play soccer, walk their dogs or picnic. A huge pond full of turtles and catfish that beg for crumbs. The national orchid garden is within the park and is a riot of color. The garden is free, except for the orchid garden. The ginger garden was gorgeous and we watched monitor lizards dig through the soil for bugs. There are many signs to lead you to the various areas of the park. I wish more cities offered something like this very usable space!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Easy to get to by train, free entry, cafes & facilities in the gardens. Stunning gardens, well signposted and easy walking, even in hot weather."

,,Stunning. Visit.,5.0,,"I only spent about 3 hours wandering through the garden, so I only saw some of the gardens. The gardens are peppered with features, such as the concert platform in Symphonic Lake. The gardens are beautifully maintained and range from lakes to themed gardens and, of course, the National Orchid Garden. You will also come across a variety of wildlife, such as turtles, and aquatic birds. If you are visiting with children, there is a children's garden, and plenty of eateries and toilets. The gardens are free to enter, and are worth the effort of travelling to see them."
,,very beautiful place,5.0,,the most beautiful and extremely well organised and managed garden. must visit Orchid garden..opens after 8:30 am singaore time

The most interesting point of the garden is the flowers are separated into different blocks due to its are of source. The government spent a huge fund in transporting and planting, it just like a global garden. In order to create different environment for different flowers to plant, it took lots of time and money to do this. During we walk in this garden, it feels like we are traveling the world and see many different beautiful flowers. The garden is filled with various of potpourri, it seems like a paradise.

,,One of my favorite places in Singapore,5.0,,"Just recently included in the UN list of world heritage sites, these beautiful botanic gardens, founded by the British in colonial times, are immaculately kept. The landscape is varied with many dedicated areas, such as one dedicated to healing and poisonous herbs, that are well marked with informative signs for those who wish to learn more.
Great also for older people. It is forbidden to cycle or skate, so the lanes are safe and quite. Great lawns for picnics. Very often there will be free concerts at the Shaw symphony stage: it is nice to sit on the lawn sipping wine and having food while listening to the music.
A large garden with a varied landscape, statues, sheltered areas, lakes, it will give you hours of pleasure. You can spot the occasional monitor lizard, squirrels, birds...."

Plenty of spaces to sit and just relax and watch the activity. Lovely ponds. Its a huge space and there is lots to see so you will need a good period of time to see it all - I spent about 3-4 hours here and still did not get to see everything. Its easy to get to on the train and well worth the effort, even if you only see a portion of it."

,,Loved the botanical gardens,4.0,,"The botanical gardens are a definite must see. There are so many aspects to visit and see, that you could easily spend the day there.

I had limited time, so I only spent about 4 hours there, but I got to go through the orchid gardens, the rain forest and past a couple of other spots. All well worth it."
,,Amazing orchid garden!,5.0,,"The botanical gardens is a great place to stroll and take the kids, who will love the open areas to run around in.

Surrounded by many old trees, plants and greens, air quality is so fresh, cool and clean especially during the wet season. A very well maintained park where workers will sweep the walk ways and man the garden to its pristine condition daily. Lay by the lawn and join in the occasional open-air public symphony concert to spend an afternoon or evening with the family.

,,Historical and beautiful for a few hours or a whole day.,5.0,,"Visited for a afternoon and evening, these wonderful historic gardens. Enjoyed the shaded walkways while the sun was up. There is a fantastic orchid garden which is absolutely world class. I would rate above those in Washington and London.

When we are tired there are some benches in the middle of the road where you can enjoy the beautiful tropical garden.
At the end you can enjoy the National Orchid Garden at charge S$ 5 for adult. But my senior Mom only paid S$ 1.
To get a taxi back to the hotel, you need to wait in the lobby of Nassim Road after asking the Customer Service assistance."
,,Best day out...,5.0,,"After an easy MRT trip from my accommodation, I spent a day walking in the lush green gardens of the Botanic Gardens. The Foliage Garden was my favourite along with the Fragrant Garden and Rain forest Boardwalk.

,,Singapore Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"This is one of the most beautiful places you will visit. The park is free except for the Orchid garden which cost just a few dollars and is worth the effort of seeing over 1,000 varieties of orchids.

,,Worth a walk ariund,5.0,,"We went to the gardens and didn't regret it. The gardens are extremely clean, and well looked after. Plenty of toilets along the way and water stations to fill up bottles. The National Orchard gardens cost to enter. (I think about $5pp)"

,,"If only one garden in Singapore, this is the one!",5.0,,"This garden is a large park used by everyone, locals and tourist alike. There were dog walkers, groups doing yoga and tourists all enjoying a perfectly kept park. There were no weeds, past prime exhibits. The maps, the signage was without fault.

,,Stunning garden,4.0,,That lives up to its reputation for preservation of nature. Families..couples..friends..fun for all abounds.
,,Peaceful Oasis,5.0,,"Beautifully designed and maintained gardens and lake,an oasis so close to the city.Easily accessed by mrt and is free entry.There is a cafe and nearby water fountains which lots of brides/ grooms were taking advantage of for their photographs.There is an orchid garden set within the botanic gardens which has a separate paid entry ( well worth the look)."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Once you visited Gardens by the Bay, you should head to botanical gardens. Super clean, elegant and refreshing."
,,Amazing gardens,5.0,,"Probably the best botanical gardens I have seen. Be prepared for the heat, cool clothes and a bottle of water are a must. There are quite a few drinking fountains around to get a free water refill. Entry is free but inside there is an orchid garden that is well worth the small fee to see.

It is approx 2.5km walk from one end to the other, with public transport at both ends, it's too hot to do unnecessary walking. Just outside the orchid gardens is a couple of restaurants. They are overpriced but good food, and they have aircon thank goodness.

Keep your eyes peeled for wildlife such as monitor lizards and squirrels"
,,Family trip,5.0,,Our children brought their scooters with them for our visit and they enjoyed it as much as we did. The orchard gardens are a must!

,,this is a must see,5.0,,"An amazing oasis of calm in the midst of a bustling city. Arriving by the MRT, a spotless, on time metro we immediately entered another world as we went onto the gardens. The air is pure, the flowers are fragrant, the noise of the city is muffled to non-existent. My favorites were the orchid garden, a true wonder, and the cool house. This building houses plants that only grow in the colder temperatures of the mountains and upon entering on a hot day one is transported to such a mountain top. The wonder of this is truly outstanding.
This is a must see."
,,Fabulous gardens and wildlife,5.0,,"We loved the botantic gardens. The variety of tree specimens was great, ranging from huge ancient trees, to small bonsai. We also loved the lake with its turtles plus we saw a couple of big lizards (like monitor lizards) by the lakeside."

,,Botanic Gardens - a wonderful place to spend a full day or just half an hour,5.0,,Easily accessible from the MRT there are plenty of walks with interesting things to see along the way. A children's garden (including water play) as well as other themed gardens means that whether you have just half an hour or a full day you can more than fill the time. My particular favourite is the national Orchid Garden. There are food outlets within the garden - not cheap but good quality.
,,Thorough Relaxation!,5.0,,"A visit to this garden provides a thorough relaxation experience. Plenty of foliage, big sized leaves, some very old trees, neatly paved paths, a charming lake with swans black and white, etc take you to another world as you enter from the outside concrete jungle. Great men have visited this Park. Swami Vivekananda, an Indian saint of 19th century visited this park in June 1893."
,,A must visit for residents and visitors,5.0,,"Everyone should visit SBG! It's centrally located on a huge plot of land, and so many beautiful facets of nature on ""display"". Sometimes there are free public performances as well, do a check on their website to get your free concert! Also good for picnic with family, friends and/or pets! I go there at least twice a month."
,,Relaxing- Visit the Orchid gardens,5.0,,Lovely really chilled out and enjoyed exploring. The Orchid gardens are amazing and I am not hugely interested in flora well worth the small cost to go and see. The rest of the botanic gardens are free. The ginger gardens I didn't really appreciate 550 varieties and no smell is apparent. Manmade waterfalls are fun. Saw lots of Americans circuit training .... well you can't have too much tranquility
,,Lots of construction!,3.0,,"This review is based on today's visit. Lots of construction! Run here when I am in Singapore. The surroundings usually make up for it being somewhat small for a good run. However, the sheer amount of current construction rather ruined this morning's run."

,,Orchid heaven,4.0,,We thought that we saw some orchids at the Gardens by the Sea but the Orchid Display at the Botanic gardens is out of this world. The Gardens have many unique features such as the pathway constructed out of bricks made by POW's of the Japanese during WWII. Access to the Gardens is easy either by the cheap and very clean Taxi's of by Public Transport.
,,So beautiful. Surprisingly a lot to see in a small space,5.0,,"I went running here and it's such a beautiful place. Different landscapes at every turn, which make the gardens seem bigger than it actually is. Terrains are pretty flat so it's a good spot for families with young children."
,,Beautiful tranquil gardens,5.0,,"Spent the morning looking around these lovely gardens. The main Orchid garden was truly magnificent and admittance is only 10 dollars, free for children and only 1 dollar for seniors. The gardens are large and involve a lot of walking, so best to arrive early before it gets too hot and humid."
,,One of Singapore's Gems,3.0,,"The Singapore Botanic garden is one of Singapore's stand out attractions. Lots of indigenous and tropical plants, fascinating displays and structures and, for garden enthusiasts, a great place to spend hours lost in the many different varieties of plants and displays artistically laid out. Singapore is famous for the way it manicures everything and the Botanic gardens takes green sculpture to a whole new level.

The Red line hop-on/off bus stops at these gardens making it very convenient. The orchid garden will mesmerize you. Spend atleat 2 hours at the orchid garden to get a sense of its grandeur. Truly a UNESCO heritage site indeed.
,,Lovely and enchanting,4.0,,"The gardens are truly one of a kind. There are several smaller gardens inside this huge park set aside for varieties of plants. The evergreen Rain forest where plants and trees from across the globe have been meticulously planted and named. The Ginger gardens, The Orchid garden, Cactus garden, Bonsai garden etc. Entry to the gardens are free, but the Orchid garden charges a nominal fee. There are a few outlets selling mementos and stuff which are good. A lot of people come there for exercise and running through the park as it is a huge lung space right in the middle of the city."
,,A relaxing display well set up for the disabled,5.0,,"We were looking for a relaxing stop over suitable for a disabled person on a walker and took a taxi to the gardens. We were unsure from previous reviews or their internet site if food was available. Not a problem as there was a large cafe serving breakfast that the locals knew well and used, as it was crowded. Service was quick and efficient and our eggs benedict wonderful. Set the mood for the day. We strolled around generally heading from the visitor centre towards the other gate at Orchard Road past the ampitheatre. Too many beautiful vistas to single out any one. The camera was in constant use. People were friendly and many had their dogs on leash enjoying the park.There was adequate seating to stop and enjoy and informative display boards. There were two free guided tours available mid morning, but we chose to just amble along. We saw only a small section of the gardens in five hours of roaming. We were surprised to find out from our health band that we had walked 8 km"
,,Stunning - consider lunch at Casa Verde,5.0,,Visited with my young family and we all loved it. Kids especially enjoyed the children's area with splash park and treehouse. Parents enjoyed the stunning flora. We all had a great meal in the restaurant (Casa Verse) near the visitors centre to break up the long walk!
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,Nice place to visit you could spend 2hours or 8hours depending on how much time you have to walk around but great place to visit
,,I love this place,5.0,,"This is a huge and amazing botanic garden. I particularly love the bougainvillea collection. It is super-huge, so expect to walk a lot."
,,Amazing,5.0,,We often stroll through the gardens and just love them. Amazing flora and fauna at almost every turn. Wonderful.
,,Weekend best outing,4.0,,"Located right next to Orchard, it's refreshing to visit during the weekends when town is packed with people. If Garden by the bay is wonder of Singapore then Botanic Gardens would definitely be the nature legacy of Singapore from 150 years ago. The park is filled with different varieties of tropical species plus beautiful Orchid garden in the middle (with admission), so you can see and study plants all around Asia. Not to mention, you can bring dogs too."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect but this place was absolutely beautiful.

You don't pay to get in but the orchid garden is $5 and well worth it.

Everyone was friendly and the ambience is refreshing.

Plenty of places to have food too, I ate at Halia and it was pleasant and the the food was very nice, plus the service was excellent.

There was music on when I visited which just topped off the day as it started late afternoon.

A remarkable place for all ages.

When you are finished go to the visitor desk and ask them to book you a taxi. There's a surcharge of $2.30 but it's worth it as you will be waiting a long time at the queue! (I waited 35 mins and no taxi in sight).

Have fun!"
,,A peaceful and beautiful oasis in Singapore,5.0,,really wonderful to enter the Gardens and leave the hustle and bustle of urban Singapore behind. The orchid gardens were spectacular and it was wonderful to stroll along the paths and watch the children and families enjoy this beautiful retreat. well worth the visit if you have time.
,,Spectacular gardens,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing manicured gardens which are beautifully maintained. Staff a plenty to keep the grounds in pristine condition, with lakes and the sensational national orchard gardens to visit which requires you to pay a nominal fee, but definitely worth it. The abundance of orchards on display and the colours is unbelievable - photographers paradise. Singapore botanical gardens are only an approximately $5 taxi ride from Orchard rd, so I would recommend taking the taxi over the MRT as its more convenient. Many different types of gardens and lakes to explore, with fish ponds at the entrance of the gardens, which was fun for the kids to purchase food for $1 to feed the fish.
I would recommend going in the morning too before the heats ramps up as it does in Singapore."
,,Worth a viait,5.0,,"We went for a wander around the gardens and loved how clean (like all of Singapore!), well maintained and beautiful it was. We were caught in a storm while there so didn't stay as long as we would have hoped but they are definitely worth a visit!"
,,World Heritage Site,5.0,,I was so pleased to find that Singapore have these marvellous gardens that are a World Heritage Site. They're full of wondrous species and info. People walk through/ visit/ jog/ picnic. Great.
,,A good half days explore,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens were very close by the SMRT station providing us a good means of transport. The Gardens were very large and included the National Orchid Collection. The sights and scents were overpowering but not a good idea if one suffers with hayfever. At the centre of the gardens was a large lake occupied by many turtles or terrapins and we glimsped a rather large lizzard in the undergrowth. There was a large band stand that was being set up for a perfomance that evening. National Orchid disiplays were very impressive, a must see if you have the time."
,,Great morning walk through the green,5.0,,"Really enjoyed my time there, great way to spend your morning before all the business open. Entered from the Botanic Gardens MRT Stn, walking my way through the abundant green until exited through the Tanglin Gate. Went there morning abt 9am, before it get hot. Bring your sun hat and drink. Plants enthusiast, prepare spending whole day there. Lots of beautiful spot in there, my favourites were the Vanda Garden, Swan Lake with its beautiful gazebo, the Chopin sculpture looking to the Symphony Lake. All place were free except the Orchid Garden, but if you're orchid lover, I suppose it would worth to visit. They really maintain everything beautifully there. And I love the little notes they put on some great trees/spots! Would love to go there again."
,,Probably the best botanical gardens I have visited,5.0,,"An incredible experience. Very easily reached using the MRT trains. No entrance fee except to enter the Orchid Garden. Have forgotten the actual cost, except that it was very little. If you like orchids, then you should not miss it."
,,Lovely for a stroll,4.0,,Some of the directions on the signs can be a bit confusing. Only 1 toilet area that I could find and that was at the area where there was food. Easy to access via the MRT. You could spend as long or as little as you like. Plenty of spaces to enjoy a picnic
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"The botanical gardens in Singapore are a huge area in the city and are filled with a huge variety of plants.
Especially worth a visit is the orchid display. Here on display are a huge variety of especially bred displays of wonderful colours and patterns
There are numerous restaurants throughout the area and one can easily spend a day at this pleasant venue."
,,Nice walk and surprise concerts,5.0,,"This is one of recommended sites in Singapore, which tourist informations recommends for you, free of charge. It is relaxing place, where you can find beautiful colours and good smells. In the middle of gardens there is one big stage, where on lucky day you can hear beautiful impro music by local artist. One question is in my head, why hired gardeners have to wear yellow boots, when outside is +35C."
,,Beautiful Orchid garden,5.0,,"Not to be missed. Beautiful Colours, elegant lay-out,. There is even a refrigerated area for mountain species, including animal eating ones. Also an elegant black and white house in the middle of the garden. Easily accessible by subway."
,,We just keep going back!,5.0,,Back again in Singapore for the 3rd time in a year and we just cannot get enough of the Botanical Gardens and especially the National Orchid Garden. The attention to detail and love that the groundskeepers give to the gardens is unique in the world. Thank you.

,,Great place to visit even when it rains,5.0,,"An amazing place to spend the day the orchids are incredible. My favorite was the rain forest walk. We were lucky to spot a 3 ft lizard. The food at ""food to think about""was very good. Not many people probably because of the rain."

,,Beautiful place to spend some time,4.0,,"We had the pleasure to visit the Garden, absolutely stunning, a fabulous array of flora . We were with a tour group and spent about 1-2 hours, but could have easily spent a lot more time. We went into the Cool house and Mist house.

This was one of my favorite things we did in Singapore."

,,"Lush, Beautiful, and Warm",5.0,,"This is the world's highest rated public garden. Extensive gardens means lots of walking, a few hills, and it's always warm in Singapore. Wild mynah birds and large hornbills inhabit the trees. The undergrowth is full of fancy chickens, squirrels, and very large lizards. The park is free but there is a small fee for the National Orchid Garden, which is a must see. As usual, refreshments and meals are pricy in the park."
,,Stroll,3.0,,"Very Hot, nice if you are a real garden lover. Less suitable if you are just looking for a quiet walk."
,,Wish I had stayed there longer,5.0,,The botanic garden is a nice touch of nature in the middle of the crowded city. There's a lot of different animals wondering around. The plants are beautiful too! At the end of our visit I realised there could have been so many animals and plants that we could have discovered but did not due to lack of time. If you are a fan of wildlife make sure you have plenty of time to visit this place.

,,The secret trail,3.0,,Only visit the gardens on a cool day if possible there's a lot of walking don't miss the lake with its terrains
,,Incredible orchids,5.0,,The rest of the garden was great too. Bring your walking shoes. MRT is at far end from orchid house.
,,Beautiful but too big to do in a day - be selective,5.0,,"Not sure it is a ""must see"" location as it is quite far from the Bay area but nevertheless if you have an interest in this sort of stuff then don't miss it. It is too big to do in one day because being out in the heat all day is tough. It is possible to find isolated spots to have peace away from the crowds but we would recommend getting to the orchid house early (only $5 entry fee) as that does get very busy with bus trips. Lots of walkers, joggers, yoga and tai chi etc going on. Like everything in Singapore it is beautifully maintained but sometimes you know you just crave for natural chaos, it can seem too clinical."
,,Children's Garden,4.0,,"The botanic gardens MRT stop made accessing the gardens super easy. We have five kids, so decided to walk to the children's garden from the MRT.
From what we saw, the gardens are well-maintained and a lovely, calm green space amidst the busy-ness of the city.
Our children (8,6,4,2,baby) thoroughly enjoyed the children's garden. They went through the maze a number of times, tromped over the bridge, and took full advantage of the slides that were nestled among tall, shady trees.
The loved being able to get close to the stream going through the children's garden and were thrilled to see turtles and birds there.
We walked along the edge of the lake outside the children's garden. The birds and turtles delighted our children and we found the gardens as a whole to be a calming place.
We will definitely plan to go back to see the areas of the gardens we didn't make it to on this visit."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This place is stunning and my favourite was the orchid garden. You need to pay a minimal fee to gt into th orchid garden but it was so worth it

,,An oasis of peace,4.0,,"Do yourselves a favour, take a stroll through these wonderful gardens. You won’t believe you’re in a tiny country with 5 million+ people. It is an oasis of peace, less than 500m from major roads, you don’t hear the traffic at all.
Local people go there for a stroll, with their dogs! Amazing, there is no poo to be seen anywhere! Trained dogs, or trained owners? I don’t know – but it is a wonderful visit. Entrance is free, but if you want to visit the National Orchid Garden (on the same premises) there is a fee. If you have a ‘Singapore Stopover Pass’, it’s free.
I would suggest a minimum of 2 to 3 hours for both."
,,Weekly trip,5.0,,Every Sunday I stroll with my dog through the lovely gardens. So relaxing in the middle of Singapore.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are huge, perfectly maintained and a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Once inside, you cannot hear the traffic and it is easy to forget you are in the middle of a hectic city! It is possible to spend hours exploring the different areas but it gets so hot and tiring so decide which bits you would particularly like to see (its impossible to see it all in one trip unless you are super fit). The gift shop has some lovely souvenirs and the cafe in the centre is a great place to stop for a rest & refreshments. The variety of plants is incredible and even non nature lovers couldn't fail to be impressed by this place!"
,,Simply amazing..,5.0,,"Not really a fan of garden or flowers or plants but once I saw the Botanic Gardens I was really amazed.. especially that it was easy to reach via MRT, they have their own station.

,,"Nice gardens, tranquil space",4.0,,"This is a nice place to go if you have kids (need space to run around/play with a ball etc) or you love flowers! A green oasis. The orchid garden is nice too (essentially just lots of orchids, as expected).

It's easy to enter the gardens from the Botanical Gardens MRT. Orchard Rd station is a bit if a hike, but if you like walking it's doable (around 2kms to cross the garden diagonally)."
,,Great Environment,5.0,,A good place to be when you need to work out those calories after all the food hunt. Only about 4 km walk from Grand Hyatt Hotel. Very well kept and lively with the right kind of crowd. There is a cafeteria there but we find their cup of Green Tea over price @SGD5 for this self service outlet. No entrance fee neede
,,Take the time to go here,5.0,,I wish I had more time here. It is a wonderful place to stroll around and take in the different areas of the gardens. It is quite peaceful yet vibrant. A very friendly place.
,,A must see,5.0,,In the hustle and bustle that is Singapore the Botanic Gardens are a must see. The orchid display is outstanding
,,It rained BUT gorgeous anyway!,5.0,,A must visit in Singapore and it's FREE! And on a metro stop. You need to pay a little to see the orchid garden but it's well worth it.
,,Beautiful day,5.0,,"The botanic gardens are a must. This area is well preserved and spotless. It takes you away from the city and surrounds you with a wide virility of plants and trees. I especially enjoyed the bonsai exhibit that was not really advertised. The orchid garden is amazing. I walked from the city, through the garden and took the subway back to the hotel. It was a great day."
,,Simply Wonderful,5.0,,"Walking through the botanic gardens was simply a ""paradise in the middle of a bustling city"". It's large enough to spend a few hours and has well paved roads/paths. The signage is good. It's simply a nice getaway and has an amazing amount of different plants and flowers to look at. Definitely worth a visit."
,,"Huge, lovely, and free!",5.0,,"This is definitely worth a stop on a nice day for visitors who need to walk off jet lag. The gardens are huge, and a popular place for families to picnic alongside individuals jogging the paths or working out on the sidelines. It has a great community feel, and the majority of the gardens are completely free and open to the public (there is a charge to view the Orchid Garden)."

Best in the morning when it is cooler and before the sting of the sun is felt.
Take plenty of water and enjoy."
,,Lost in Paradise,5.0,,"I decided to walk to the Botanic Hardens after a little shopping. I found my way to the entrance after a 20 minute walk just as the sun was beginning it's evening time light show before giving way to night! I decided I'd follow the paths leading to the train stop at the other end and I wound up lost because I was busily gazing at all the lovely garden sculptures, landscaping designs and simply the peacefulness of the location. Night fell and when I finally got through the maze of the park I could thoroughly understand why it is a UNESCO Heritage site!!! The shear size and beauty of the park blows you away - even at night!"
,,Amazing display,5.0,,Easy access via the MRT as the station is at the gate. The gardens are laid out in themed areas as well as related species. There is a lot to see and most of it is free. The orchid garden has a small entry charge - which is only $1 for the over 60s so take some ID. To see such an amazing range of orchids effectively growing in their natural habitat is a unique experience. The gardens can busy on public holidays and weekends. It is worth taking an umbrella so that you can continue your visit when the inevitable rain arrives.

The collection of different plants was amazing with the orchids being highlight.

,,Don't Miss!,5.0,,"Such a diverse range of plants, all sizes, colours, something for everyone to enjoy here. Huge gardens, popular with locals and tourists alike. My other half who doesn't particularly enjoy traipsing round gardens of any sort thought it was quite an amazing place. Don't Miss!"

,,Wonderful place to while away some hours.,5.0,,"Beautiful garden in the middle of a bustling, vibrant city. There is an intact original rain forest on-site. It has it's own MRT (subway), stop and is steps from the MRT entrance. Signs clearly direct you through this amazing place. So happy I has the chance to visit!"
,,Well worth a visit - and it is (mostly) free!,4.0,,"We visited on a warm sunny day when our 5-year old child was hot, sweaty and sleep-deprived due to jet lag. Not good circumstances but we found the gardens to be the perfect place to dispel the problems. The park is a few feet from the MRT entrance but it's another 15min walk to the children's garden - however this is through some beautiful sculptured and free flowing gardens, which have easy walking paths and seated areas to allow for resting. There is a paid orchid garden which we did not visit and though there is lots of construction work on new areas of the gardens, everything is fenced off so as not to disturb current garden patrons.

The children's garden is amazing. There is a tree house play area, a sensory garden, a maze (with movable gates so staff must change it frequently allowing local children a chance to never enter the same maze over time!), a garden cafe - a bit pricey but caters to the standard children's fare.

We spent 2 hours here and did not explore more than 30%. It's a great place to visit and we were pleasantly surprised to see that it was quiet and not crowded, allowing us to hear the birds and animals easily. Remember to pack water and shade - we found water only at the children's cafe and this is on one side of the park. It may not be easy to purchase once in the main park."

,,Must-see in Singapore,5.0,,this is the must-see place in Singapore for everyone! I am sure you will not regret that as it is a very unique and very beautiful garden with hundreds of interesting plants. very exotic and everything beautifully arranged!!!
,,"Amazing place, full of wonder",5.0,,"What a beautiful place! Tall specimen trees, lush vegetation, amazing bonsai collection, orchids of every shape and colour, history lessons, groups knelt in prayer, ponds, bridges, floral arches, sculpture. Wish we had more time to take it all in. Not to be missed."
,,Very green!,3.0,,Not really my thing and if you love plants maybe this is for you but it was just a huge park with fake bird noises to me!
,,Wonderful gardens,5.0,,The gardens were immaculate and the diversity in plant life was outstanding. Combined with the orchid gardens we could have stayed here all day.
,,Specular,4.0,,"We spent a half day here arriving on the Hop off Hop on bus.
This is a very large site.
There are many areas for different interests.
The Gardens admission is free but there is a minor charge for the orchid gardens.
The gardens had many families as we visited on a Sunday.
This could be a full day adventure."
,,Stunning and pretty much all for free!,5.0,,"Our intended morning visit here ended up being a whole day once we realised the size and extent of the gardens. They are totally beautiful and stunning and because of its size it didn't feel over busy.
As well as beautiful plants we also spotted some great wildlife and were particularly fascinated by the large lizards roaming around.
Great way to spend a day."
,,Pleasant stroll in the park,4.0,,"My family and I (including our 8 and 10 year olds) spent an hour or two exploring the botanic gardens on a recent stop over in Singapore.

The gardens are beautifully presented and full of interesting flora and fauna. Whilst we didn't get to see it all we did manage to see a variety of ancient and modern gardens and a number of beautifully manicured gardens and walkways.

It was also lovely to see so many locals enjoying picnics and lunch breaks in the gardens too - it added to the experience knowing that the gardens are well loved and appreciated by those that see them daily.

With younger children I would say the heat was a bit of a concern so take plenty of water and find the shade where you can. I'm also not convinced that our boys, at the age they are, could have done more than the hour or two that we managed. However, they loved what they saw and wanted to keep going for as long as they could.

A lovely, tranquil and interesting place to visit - particularly in the early morning or late afternoon when it's a bit cooler."
,,Beautiful and an escape from hustle,5.0,,Amazing well set out. Signage great. It is a long walk round so plan your trip. Try and go on a cooler day. Make sure you include the orchid garden.
,,An afternoon walk,5.0,,A lovely well kept parkland with lots of interesting tropical plants and flowers. Great for adults and children alike.
,,Loved Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"This is one park that Singaporeans should be proud of. There are a lot of visitors and there are many nice restaurants within reach, from mid tier to expensive ones for you to rest your feet when you are tired. You do see people jogging in the park as well. And it has been awarded a UNESCO. A definite place worth visiting and revisiting."
,,What a gem!,5.0,,"To know that admission is free to the Botanic Gardens and maybe SG$5 for the Orchid Gardens just makes a fantastic attraction even better. You'll love this oasis in the city. What a perfect place for a walk, a picnic, pictures, etc."

,,歩くのが好きでもそうでなくてもオススメ,5.0,,"チケット売り場付近からシャトルバスが出ています。楽に回りたい方はそれを利用するのも有りですが、時間に余裕があり、歩くのが苦じゃない人はゆっくり歩いて回ることをお勧めします。７０前後の女性も歩いて回っていて、なぜシャトルを利用しないのですか？と訪ねてみたら、”You will miss a lot of things if you take a shuttle."" (シャトルを使うのは楽だけど、いろいろなものを見逃すわよ。）と、素敵な言葉を頂きました。良い出会いでした。"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"So green and lush the gardens have to be some of the best in the world. So beautiful. Free to wander in but pay to see the orchid display. Fantastic, huge open green areas for kids to run wild and enjoy nature. Get off the hop on hop off bus and have a look."
,,"Therapeutic, Serene, and worth multiple visits",5.0,,"Decided to go for a run in Singapore's famed Botanic Gardens. currently a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Botanic Gardens span across 3-4 kms of lush, tropical greenery and thousands of species of flora and fauna. Great place to visit with family, and pets. Biking, sports, and skating aren't allowed, but fitness enthusiasts can enjoy the Gardens' multiple trails and winding paths, with the Gardens' kept open from 5am - midnight. easily accessible by bus or the subway, the Gardens' are a must see for anyone visiting or living in Singapore."
,,All natural,5.0,,The gifts of nature is here with all the plants and different kinds of herbs. The oldest tree of this country was here and the history and even the uses of all the plants and the healing capabilities. I love the nature and I love green.

,,Exquisite,5.0,,"Beautiful place to walk around. The orchids are amazing. You see many people running, walking or strolling through with family. The gardens are huge- so plan time to explore. It is also fantastic to walk through at night. Very safe and very peaceful."
,,Lisa,5.0,,"Another must do attraction for all.
Children will love the swans on the lake, themed garden & open space everywhere to run around after being in a hotel room or shopping mall..
About 2/3 lovely restaurants but check if opened on that day.
Locals use a few of the tracks for exercising a nice feel.
Drive on the way interesting as you pass a few embassies.
Morning best before it gets to hot.
Enjoy we did."
,,Great for flower and plant enthusiasts,5.0,,"This is a nice place to wander, especially if it is not too hot. Entrance is free (except for the Orchid Garden)"
,,Sanctuary away from home,5.0,,"This used to be my green paradise when I was living in Singapore years ago. Not much has changed in this beautiful park and it always brings back wonderful memories of my life in this charming city I used to call home. A wonderful haven of peace and greenery, the best park ever to have picnics, a jog and fish feeding! Just be careful as the fish swarm straight towards your fingers and toes as soon as they spot a shadow in the water! I love this place and it's one of my favourites each time I'm home in Singapore."
,,Weekly Exercise,5.0,,"The air is so crisp and fresh it is almost tangible...
The plants, flowers and trees at e such a treat to the eyes!!!
Go there and give yourself a treat, breathing in the air so untainted is almost food for the soul and the body!!!"
,,An oasis of calm and besuty in the city,5.0,,We enjoyed wandering along in the lush green people friendly gardens here. My favouite was the orchard gardens. Just mind boggling in besuty and variety. Truly a people's dedication and love of plants. Take your hat snd sunscreen if you're fair. Water bottle too. Kids took their scooters snd lots of little dogs on leads. Places to picnic. Next time i'm spending time in the rainforest too
,,stunning example of tropical landscaping,5.0,,exceptional lungs in an already green city. Surrounded by upmarket neighbourhoods and lends a very classy style to the gardens. Spacious and well used for events.
,,Well wort a visit,4.0,,Lovely well maintained gardens that are a nice change from the pace of the city. Better to go early to beat the heat and humidity.
,,Very green - well-managed,5.0,,"A nice place to escape in Singapore. You can jog or just chilled out. Love the orchid zone, so beautiful and peaceful."
,,What Size Cactus !!,4.0,,"Amazing variety of cacti very interesting, extremely clean well laid out gardens and a wonderfully variety of plants well organised"
,,Fabulous!,5.0,,We got here by the Hop on- Hop off Bus. The gardens are lovely. Yo should also visit the National Orchid Garden while you are there. it was very hot though so best to go on a cooler day (just my opinion)
,,A healing haven!!,4.0,,"This is one of the most beautiful botanic gardens in the world. Come prepared to walk and explore the various paths, exhibits, special gardens and plants, herbs, lakes, enjoy the majesty of elegant old trees and be surprised by the exotic flowers that bloom at different times of the year. Be filled with joy and wonder! A highlight is the Orchid Garden, and you must not miss the Begonias, Ginger garden, and the jungle walk, just to mention a few. Of special mention is the wonderful way this garden is enjoyed by many exercise enthusiasts throughout the day, but particularly early every morning - you can join in most groups as they go through their Tai Chi routines, or Chinese dances, or other stretch moves. As you walk through the Gardens, every corner reveals something exciting, and you cover the distance without getting weary. What a great way to heal yourself and distress."
,,Absolutely unbelievable...,5.0,,"As we were limited to time, we only had time to visit the Orchid Garden - and we were so pleased to have been able to fit this in to our busy schedule. With over 1000 species, and 2000 hybrids, the garden has the largest display of orchids in the world. We saw the Crane Fountain, Golden Shower Arches, Tan Hoon Siang Mist House and Cool House. I've never seen so many beautiful flowers in one place, and the whole place is absolutely immaculate. On our way out we went through the gift shop, and purchased a lovely gold necklace with a real orchid that had been dipped in liquid gold - a truly amazing and unique gift to finish off a truly splendid trip."
,,Pleasant Garden a la Hyde Park,5.0,,"Free music, accessible but please dont take the bus, wear comfy shoes. Very near to MRT but a bit of walking..lovely park."
,,Worth the effort,5.0,,"My wife loves Orchids and we both love Ginger plants. So we went here to see these two sections specifically. Luckuly for us they are adjacent to each other.

We got dropped at the entrance closest to both gardens, so I am not commenting on the rest of the gardens, but what we saw on the way out seems beautiful. No noise from the adjacent bustling metropolis.

The Ginger garden was was mostly not in flower as we were unable to schedule our trip around this, but the flowers that were out were beautiful and amazing.

The Orchid Garden is S$5 per person 13 years and over. The Gardens are free so don't whinge about the cost. Are they worth it? YES !! Flowers everywhere. Such fantastic & amazing blooms.

We wish we lived in Singapore so we could grow some of these in our garden."
,,Nice to spend a few hours here,4.0,,It was nice to have a break from the shops and spend a few hours walking around the gardens. Plenty of opportunities to find a nice spot and just have a sit to recharge your batteries.
,,Beautiful Garden for some peace,4.0,,"Lush green garden with manicured lawns, thousands of local and exotic trees, well defined nature walks.Good location for some peace away from the hustle of the metropolis though conveniently located near MRT. Children can play around freely in acres of open lush green turf."
,,The most Beautiful municipal garden in the world,5.0,,"Wander around in peace away from crowds in Beautiful gardens. Only charge you to go into National Orchid gardens, rest is free"
,,Excellent gardens,5.0,,"These must be amongst the best botanic gardens in the tropics. They are large, and have a huge, mature collection. The orchid collection is spectacular and there are excellent other collections. The evolution exhibit is fascinating, although the labelling could be improved. Well worth a visit."
,,"If you love gardens, you'll love this one...",5.0,,The Garden has a wonderful assortment of plants and flowers.The variety of orchards is tremendous. It's easy to spend a few hours (or more) wandering through the garden. Don't miss this 'Must See' when in Singapore.
,,Sprawling and meticulously maintained,5.0,,"The lungs of Singapore, sprawling and very nicely laid out. Beautifully maintained with a large collection of tropical flora. Pets allowed which is less than common in Singapore.

Has a few restaurants on site as well with the Halia being of note.

Easy to access by the MRT, you walk straight out to one of the gates from the Botanic Gardens station.

Seems like an ideal spot for locals to relax, and tourists can soak in a bit of what the locals do to relax as well. Highly recommended."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Something for all. Do not miss the Orchid Gardens. We did it in three visits as we had limited time each visit.
,,Amazing.,5.0,,Can't say much more than everyone else...this is a must see. And spend the S$5 extra for the orchid garden.
,,Lovely city escape,5.0,,Free entry. Huge garden with many different themes. Great escape from the rush of the city. Could spend days in this garden.
,,Construction abounds...,3.0,,"Mapped poorly, and significant amounts of construction occurring at the moment which will inevitably interfere with your entry and exit from the garden if you are approaching from the south. MRT should be your only way to get here, at least that way you avoid walking 2km to get into the gardens at all. Some lovely features and great places for a picnic, to read a book etc. but not suitable for a hot day."
,,Amazing !,5.0,,"We enjoyed walking through this lovely garden. It's well maintained. Also it's a great place for kids to learn new things about plants, trees basically the nature. Our most favorite spot was the lake. It was soo amazing to set next the lake."
,,A very serene place,5.0,,Spent 3 hours at these gardens just wandering around a lovely place to visit would recommend and it was free.
,,An oasis of calm in a busy city,5.0,,If you need some time out of the hustle and bustle definitely worth spending a few hours wandering through. Getting there is easy - an MRT stop is right outside. Do plan your trip though as we specifically wanted to see the Orchids which are over the side. There is a bus that takes you to a closer entry gate but we decided to walk...it was further than we thought. While it was a lovely walk the Singapore humidity was ever present. Lots of water and an umbrella to provide shade helped.
,,SG50 Carnival,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens is filled with lush greenery that soothes your soul. Many people were picnicking, with a stage of exhibition of music flowing throughout the entire garden. The SG50 carnival was packed with various exciting shows and performances that were really engaging. However the traditional games and crafts activities only allowed us to play the games, but not learn more about the game which was unfortunate. Regardless, the atmosphere was great when coupled with the flora and fauna in the garden."
,,Great place for outing,4.0,,"A great place for outing. Kids can learn about many plants, flowers, trees. There is a Botany Centre where they breed plants near Tanglin gate. There one can find a board with list of talks or workshops also, which related to plants or planting.

Love the lakes and Orchid garden. One can find beautiful spots to rest. Some of my favourite spots are near Casa Verde at Nassim gate and Foliage Garden near Bukit Timah gate."
,,Renew the bondage with our real neigbours,5.0,,"Singapore Zoo is both an inside and outside adventure. It brings animals, who are our real neighbours at a close distance where we can feel our bondage with them. The night safari is an experience worth sharing and the outside bonanza of food and shows add flavour to it. I would go back again just to see how the earth hosts all of us in harmony."
,,Awesome scenic,4.0,,"another option for garden by the bay. if you think that garden by the bay don't suit you. maybe you can try coming here. there are many interesting flowers and a must visit orchid garden. Although the garden might not have big domes and exotic flowers or trees like garden by the bay, you can also come here for a short walk or picnic here."
,,Oasis,5.0,,The botanic gardens are an oasis in the city. You can spend an hour or a day here. There are lots of different walks. We walked around a lake and saw a monitor lizard. The cafe we found was very good as well. It was an excellent and interesting day out
,,Great picnic spot for free music performances,5.0,,"We went to the Botanic Gardens to catch a free performance at the Shaw Foundation Symphonic Stage. The seats are the gentle slopes surrounding the stage, so we went earlier to reserve a space and picnic.

There were signs with clear directions on our way in, which took about half an hour. Most of the stage area is not shaded, so I recommend only picnicking from around 4pm onwards when it's less sunny. The greenery there is well kept and litter bins conveniently located for easy trash disposal.

Overall, the Botanic Gardens is a great place to picnic. The acoustics were pretty good considering the outdoor environment and the picturesque view, soothing. We hung around for a few hours afterwards to chit-chat and enjoy the night sky and fresh air.

The foot paths are well-lit so you can find your way out easily enough. Otherwise, there will always be joggers and dog walkers around to ask for directions.

There are usually free performances happening every weekend in the evenings. You can check the schedule at their website."
,,A very beautiful garden in a busy city,5.0,,"This is a very beautiful garden with a variety of theme build (yes many of it are man made to fit in the vast spices of plants, flowers, and etc.
The garden is big (as in Singapore standard) and therefore the resting areas for rejuvenation must allow for both old and young. The cafes are good and very popular.
Lastly, we can see a good mix of people doing their regular exercises eg. Tai Chi; Yoga; Stretching etc.
Must visit to see a nice garden that are put together on this UNESCO Heritage Site.
Entrance is FREE"
,,Enjoyable garden with wonderful plants,5.0,,"There are few better ways to spend a few outdoor hours in Singapore than strolling the paths of the Botanic Gardens. Free to enter, the gardens are a treasure trove of plants, discovered via winding pathways.

We started at the northern end via the Botanic Gardens MRT station and slowly meandered south towards the Orchid Garden. As well as as enjoyed the plants along the way, you can take in extra exhibits like the Evolution Garden which tells the story of how plants have evolved on our planet.

Educational and entertaining, the Botanic Gardens also have a visitor's centre and cafe to refresh you after you walk.

Highly recommended."

In the end of the road..was a MRT station. It was very integrated...excellent."
,,Heritage site,5.0,,"UNESCO site worth visiting during a trip in Singapore. Easy to walk about, clean and well maintained. You might come across swans in the main 'lake' area, or catch an outdoor performance at the central stage area. There are good restaurants within the garden if you get hungry!"
,,Oasis in the heart of singapore,5.0,,A visit to botanical gardens is a fantastic way to spend an evening or early morning right in the heart of Singapore. Do visit the orchid gardens. Also has couple of really nice restaurants and check out for shows at the swan lake.
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"We walked for miles and for hours and had an amazing afternoon. The gardens are varied and stunning. The planting and variety of flora is wonderful. We saw wildlife goalies, huge lizards, beautiful birds, fish, turtles etc.
There are a variety of places to eat and drink - a choice of places to suit differing occasions and budgets.
Sculptures and landscaped vistas, themed areas - all contribute to an outstanding must-see in Singapore :-)
Loved it!"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Lovely gardens and plants with a few waterfalls thrown in. Better if you are not in a rush so you can fully appreciate it. We only had 50 mins.
,,"Very Hot, confusing signs",3.0,,I decided to stop by on a very hot day. The sign (outside the MRT) said only 10min to the orchid garden in the center so I decided to go. Unfortunately the signs are not too clear inside the garden. There may be a split to 4 paths but the sign will just show left and right. I ended up circling around in there for half an hour before finding where I was. Make sure you bring some water with you as the heat can be unbearable.
,,Experience nature,4.0,,"We went on a Sunday which meant it was a little busy however as it is so large we can still find some nice quiet spot. Great attraction considering it is free, it is a good attraction especially the children's garden. Had lots of things to keep children interested such as a tree house, wooden bridge, water area, sand pit. Saw a lot of lizards, birds, insects roaming in their natural environment which is surprising but great to see. We had food at the gardens and it is was very good portion and delicious, so don't worry too much about packing lunch. Do however carry a bottle of water as very humid, also an umbrella as the sun can be quite harsh. Can't wait for the opening of the extended children's gardens!"
,,A beautiful oasis in the city,5.0,,"Singapore's botanic gardens is a beautiful place to wander about and take in the serenity. There is a large lake with seating along the pathways where you can find a peaceful spot to sit. Great place to let the kids run around the expansive lawn areas, take the dog for a walk or go for a run. On the weekends there is entertainment in the dome in the evening. The orchid gardens is an extra cost (the botanic gardens are free) and it's well worth having a look as it's quite large and with some amazing orchids planted in lovely terraced gardens."
,,Peaceful And beautiful,4.0,,Super calming and beautiful. Lovely for a stroll or a jog around. Very refreshing right in the middle of the city
,,Just like another botanic garden,2.0,,"Being a tourist in Singapoe, felt going to this botanic garden was waste and time consuming as it was just like another big botanic garden. This may be good for family picnic but not for a foreign tourist as there are many other good places in Singapore than this."
,,Nice place for a walk,5.0,,"Good place to walk around leisurely, huge park and connects to Orchard road for shopping. Recommend going either early morning or late evening to avoid hot weather"
,,A very well kept heritage site that is free to visit,5.0,,"Many variety of plants and flowers, best for morning run and picnic for family bonding. There are regular free performances by world class orchestras, entertaining performances from youths and artists."
,,You'll need a full day here!,5.0,,"This place is beautiful! There are so many different orchids, flowers and various displays of the orchids if you love colour then it's the place to be. We were then on a particularly hot day so it was very warm walking around the park however the 'cool house' was a refreshing visit!"
,,Singapore's Tropical Jungle,5.0,,"Paradise Gardens with a real Jungle and tropical trees, come here if you want to escape Singapore crowds...I also recommend the Orchid and Ginger gardens they are an amazing opportunity to see ginger, vanilla and orchids growing..."
,,good day,5.0,,"we went there mainly for our 4 yo girl, knowing that wasn't a ""stuck in the cage"" kind of zoo, and we weren't disappointed. The poor old bear seem to visibly suffer and shouldn't really be there. If you don't love zoos in general but want to show it to your kids, go for it"
,,Nice place to chill,4.0,,A wonderful place to chill as the botanic garden is huge and very well maintained. It can get hot though as there're not a lot of shelters available.
,,Great morning stroll,4.0,,"If you like gardens, this would be the place to go. You can get lost here and if you have dogs, they too are welcomed here but on leash. You can even sit down at one of the on site cafes or right outside the park."
,,One of the best attractions for families,5.0,,Soak yourself in the ambience of nature in this magnificent garden. The periodic free concerts and events will let you and your family enjoy the evening when the temperature is more suitable for a walk in the garden.
,,Don't miss!,5.0,,My favourite place in Singapore. So much care has been lavished on these gardens. Very busy on Sat/Sun.
,,"Love the place, Love the green and Love the Nature",5.0,,"Love the place, Love the green and Love the Nature... I always enjoyed my time connecting with the nature..."
,,"Picnic, walk, sit under a tree",4.0,,"Whichever is your way of enjoying the nature the botanical gardens fits it all. Hi for a run on a choice of many tracks, visit all the different parts of the park or just sit by the lake to read or under a tree for a picnic. This last option seems very popular with the locals.
We enjoyed the orchid and the evolution gardens a lot."
,,Visit,4.0,,Lovely relaxing place to spend some time away from the hustle and bustle of the City. Great place to wander around in the shade of the trees.
,,Very hot in the day time,3.0,,"The exhibitions in indoor dooms are fantastic sometime and bad the other time. Depends on the season or change of the flowering I assume.

The outdoor part is very much affected by the weather. Most of time it is very hot in Singapore. Walking in the outside can be challenging.

When the weather is mild, it is very nice to walk and wonder around."
,,Nice greenery and open space,5.0,,Great place to picnic with the family. Very convenient visitors can take the Circle Line and alighy at Botanic Gardens station
,,Beautiful park and so thankful that we live walking distance from it,5.0,,"We live (5 years) near the Jacob Ballas end of Botanic garden, the children park is great fun for children, small enough for them to explore and run freely, the rest of the park is great too- the amphitheater where they sometimes have concerts, so we pack our cool box, bring a picnic mat and chill out on weekends. The children love it and have been going since they were young now 4 & 6, they love to run around the park, and enjoy the open space. We go every week with our friends, mums and kids, all enjoy having a picnic, near the duck pond @ the Cluny End, where its a large open space (so we can watch them playing frisbee/football)."
,,Great place for an afternoon,4.0,,Great place for a stroll and possibly a picnic as things cool down later in the day. The gardens are beautifully arranged with different areas to explore.
,,Huge park to explore and chill out,4.0,,Conveniently located not far from the city centre is a very huge garden with different themed areas to explore which might take you more than half a day. Don't forget to stop by the National Orchid Garden. There are also some nice restaurants or you can buy a picnic basket from them and sit on the grass. A must-visit for nature lovers.
,,Very interesting romantic getaway place!,5.0,,"If you love orchid flowers, this place is it!
It's a great place to go with your loved ones.
You will be greeted with so many orchids of different beauty.
A nice cool place in the middle of garden provides a relaxing break from hot weather also. Definitely recommended!"
,,really fitting of a UNESCO site. there is a place for everyone here.,5.0,,great dining options. i come here to jog v often and the shade that the mature trees provide (many of them heritage trees) really make jogging more pleasurable. the lakes also make the views very stunning.
,,Paradise in the heart of this amazing city. A must attraction.,5.0,,"This place blew my mind it's beautiful in so many ways! The lakes the plants the animals- we say a few wild lizards foraging for a few worms. The orchid gardens are amazing, magical and must be seen. This is a place that makes you happy to be alive.

Great for kids, family, couples."
,,Amazing Orchids,5.0,,"Always a great place for a stroll. There aren't too many places you can go and see ginger growing. Or vanilla pods popping out of orchids! The Bonsai display and Orchid collection are simply divine. If you are going early in the day, be sure to dress for the heat and take some water."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Like many botanical gardens but in Singapore! That allows a rather greater range of plants than in some places. Worthy of at least two visits.
,,Natural beauty of nature!,5.0,,This place is an other version of ' heaven' its a very beautiful place and peaceful. The gardens are perfectly arrange and I coudnt say anything anymore for twa's perfect. We enjoyed a lot here and took lots of pictures wherein u could stay and walk here the whole day without getting bored. Cafe's outside are nice as well. Must visit to kill time as well.
,,Peace and Tranquility,4.0,,"Any lover of gardens, this place should be on your bucket list. I'm not a real plant lover but still enjoyed my visit. Be aware it is big and you could spend hours wandering around. Just walking from one end to the other is a long walk. Take a hat and sunscreen if it is sunny."
,,Stunning Tropical Garden,5.0,,"One of only 3 botanic gardens with Unesco world heritage status, the gardens are an oasis in the city. The national orchid collection is a must see. Had the added bonus of seeing a 2/3 foot Komodo dragon in the bushes!"
,,Flowers speak with the fullest pallet of colours & shapes.,4.0,,A good spacious ground to relax and enjoy the scenery. It Mind the heat leads to the more interesting National Orchid Garden which is however the final destination.

,,Perfect park,3.0,,Interesting park but have to pay for the orchid garden otherwise a plesent place to visit in a sunny afternoon

,,Escape the hustle & bustle,4.0,,"This is a great place to escape the hordes of shoppers.
Free to enter, unless you wish to visit the orchid garden where a small fee is charged. The locals tend to bring a blanket and sit under the trees for shade, I wish I had. I did the full loop from the MRT station to the top and back again, i guess it was about 4 km in total.
Bring water (though there are a few places to stock up in the park) and take a gentle stroll around the immaculate grounds. It's a lovely way to spend a few hours hassle free.
Look for the large lizards scavenging amongst the tree roots for bugs."
,,very relaxing,5.0,,"what a great way to spend a day,wandering around the gardens.so many things to see.we will be back. ken"

A wonderful green respite from urban Singapore.
The kids loved it and a particular highlight was the rain forest walk - we saw lot of insects and animals and some of the heritage trees are amazing.
If we had more time we would have come back with a picnic."
,,Very good,5.0,,A beautiful place and very well maintained gardens. It has a soothing effect on the soul. Singapore administration really takes good care of all such utilities..very good.

,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"We loved these garden, wish we had more time. We wandered through and saw some awesome sights including large reptiles and the beautiful orchid gardens ($5). This is a UNESCO world heritage site, which are always good to see. Take a picnic, spend time amongst the trees or on the lawns- there are a lot of places to relax and enjoy the space."
,,A must see!!,5.0,,These gardens are amazing. I have sone the Gardens by the bay.. and i have to say i like this better. The informal layout is fab and the energy is buzzing. I loved it. Pay $5 and enjoy the orchid garden it is worth it. Walking shoes a must. . Water a must and definitely enjoy the reflexology path. Just people watching is the best here. I can't rate this enough. While i do love the Gardens by the bay... this is a new level of wow. And i will be back with a red bull and a picnic ready to explore further.
,,Unbelievable that this is in the center of Singapore,5.0,,"Once inside of the gardens its hard to believe that you are in the center of a large city, very little exposure to the outside world and generally very little traffic noise.

The layout is very good, with various plant types running from one to another.

The only down side is that the MRT drops off at about 600 M from the visitor center and therefor you do not have a map of the gardens until you walk to the visitor center, but the are in the process of building a new visitor center near the MRT. It is a long walk from one end to the other, so take water an dbe prepared. Never the less it is a delightful experience.

Once at teh city end of the Gardens you need to take a bus to teh nearest MRT, but a new MRT station is being built at teh city end of teh gardens,"
,,Relaxing and Beautiful,5.0,,"A must do, even if you have been to Gardens by the Bay , this a also a great place to wander through. It is free to enter ( except the Orchid Garden) and a well worth the bus trip to visit.
Stop and have lunch there too, reasonably price and lovely meals.
Take the time to feed the fish and the turtle"
,,A good walk and flower and tree lover paradise,5.0,,Choose a early morning or evening for a good walk. Else head straight to the orchid gardens. It's worth the money and a pleasant walk too. But are you a flower person ? 😊.

,,A must,5.0,,Everyone needs to visits the botanical gardens .. Take a few hours out to enjoy the beautiful orchids and unusual plants and trees ... Well worth the visit
,,Amazing space!,5.0,,"The gardens were within a twenty minute walk of our hotel. We had a short visit to the orchid house inside the botanical gardens on a coach tour the previous day, so the intention was to re-visit. But we didn't get as far as the orchid house because the rest of the gardens are so amazing and even then we only got round half of the site! The trees and foliage are impressive and there are sculptures and water features and the whole environment is beautifully kept."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are one of my favourite places to take me back to England. The gardens are superbly set out and every corner you turn takes you to another breath taken view.
,,Definitely worth a visit but bring walking shoes!,5.0,,"Recently declared a World Heritage site due to its historical background, the Gardens have been part of my life from childhood when my parents first brought me here. I have continued my visits with my wife and then my children and have watched the site expand to almost double its size and broaden the natural horticultural offerings greatly.

Today one can view how orchids are cultivated, trek through a short stretch of primary jungle, feed swans, listen to live music on certain weekends and enjoy absorbing information on the flora of the tropics.

Be prepared for undulating grounds so be shod suitably."
,,Excellent,5.0,,We arrived at the top of the gardens by MRT (Botanic Gardens) and walked down to one of the lower exits taking in most sites on the way. We were able to pick up a free informative map and plan at the entrance and enjoyed the well maintained environs together with the good explanation boards of things both of botanic and historic significance. A gem - well worth its World Heritage Status
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The Gardens are a beautiful place to relax and have a leisurely stroll. The foliage and plants are all kept exceptionally well. The food at the restaurant can be slightly pricey but non the less, the quality was very good. I could definitely spend hours relaxing here and I will be visiting again."

,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"I've been to the Botanic gardens countless times. Love it. Whether it's for a free performance or the orchid gardens when I've foreign guests or to go to Corner House. When my nephew was young, we bring him here every week. May do that for my niece. Especially to teach some science."
,,Lots of space to calm down from busy city life,4.0,,"Going with our parents, they really enjoyed the orchids and the general setting of teh botanical gardens. However, we typically dont go to the gardens, because of the weather. It is an activity that is located completely outdoors with shade in some places, but it involves quite a bit of walking in the sun. The day we went last time, it was a cool 29 degrees, which was somewhat more bearable than usual"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Wow! Just stunning! The VIP orchid garden is particularly gorgeous with orchids created and grown for specific people, such as Margaret Thatcher etc. No entrance fee to the main gardens, and the $5 for orchid garden is well worth it.

Lovely day out, slowly wandering around the huge gardens!"
,,A park for all people,5.0,,"Very beautiful park within walking distance from Orchard Road. It has at least two lakes contain variety of deferent fishes,tortoises and water fouls. It is very densely planted with hundreds of species of tropical plants. A good place to walk, run, people watching or simply to get some fresh air and self reflection. Best of all, is FREE."
,,Worth visiting but long walk inside!,5.0,,We are approaching senior citizen age and the Gardens are really beautiful but quite a long walk inside. I hope the authorities provide senior citizens with transport facilities inside the garden. Make sure you carry umbrellas to protect yourself from the sun or rain. We reached the gardens by bus from the place we were staying on Thomson road.
,,Loved the Orchids,5.0,,It is 10years since we were here and it looks just as beautiful now. Love the orchids. The grounds are beautifully kept. They have a wheelchair friendly route in the orchid garden . There are eating places gift shops too.

,,Beautiful but a little out of the way,4.0,,"We visited the gardens on our first full day in Singapore and I found it to be peaceful and enjoyable. We took the hop on hop off bus to get there, as it was out of the way to the city, but I feel it was worth it. There were quite a few areas to go and visit and the Orchid Garden was in there as well which was good to see. Was very warm in there, but its like the rest of Singapore"
,,Well maintained,5.0,,It's a well conserved and maintained botanical gardens. Recommended to visit on a cloudy day or in the evening. Too hot to walk around for a sunny day.

,,Wonderful,5.0,,Superb huge gardens with magnificent orchid gardens. Concessions available for over 60s. Need to take water and hats as can get very hot
,,Garden Paradise in the City,5.0,,"Do people realise this amazing green space is actually World Heritage Listed? It was founded in about 1859 and is an absolute world class joy to appreciate. Spend an entire day here wandering around, taking the gorgeous orchid garden, following the trails or simply reading a book and taking refuge from the commercial contrast in the shopping areas of Singapore. There are some lovely cafes on your travels from which to take respite and refresh.

TIP. Take an Uber when you are exiting the park. It's easy and cheap to get around with in most parts of the city and will save time compared to other means of transport options.

Bonus, the children's playground section is especially fun for kids under 6/7 years old. There is a playful water fountain area and activities to keep them busy for a couple of hours - AND - it's free!"
,,A treasure,5.0,,I've enjoyed this Botanic Garden for years and years. It's a treasure in a concrete jungle like Singapore that's so focused on the business district and the shopping mecca. This is one of the few places to go to experience green space and tranquility. It is a really nice place and we love going there.
,,"Justly famous, superb orchids",5.0,,"The Gardens are justifiably famous, especially the orchid garden (which is a World Heritage Site) which was stunning.with a very wide variety of orchids in a natural setting."
,,Tranquil,4.0,,"Singapore Botanic Garden is one of my favourite place to visit when I have the spare time. I love to walk around in the park, the trees, the plants, the flowers make me happy, tranquil, contented. Best place to destress!"
,,Tranquil oasis,5.0,,"Much bigger than expected, a peaceful place to spend a few hours. Some interesting historical buildings dotted around. Orchid Garden well worth the entry fee. Gates are quite spread apart, several km of walking between the two main entrances."
,,love!,5.0,,"typical garden that I love. Many park benches, kids played around, some ponds. A good place for jogging. It is free and clean, but sometimes beware of the animals. I saw a big lizard there (in Indonesia we call it 'biawak')"
,,Very nice,5.0,,"Only had time to see the orchids, but they were certainly worth it. Signage could be a little better otherwise a must so!"
,,PERFECT DAY OUT....!!!,5.0,,Perfect spot for family outing. We can spend almost full day in the garden.You have to carry the food & water.
,,Kids park made it worth visiting,4.0,,"Small kids park with a variety of things to do is worth stopping at. It's free, has a close snack bar and is secure, not allowing in adults without children. Take the kid's bathers/swimmers."
,,Enjoyable Afternoon,4.0,,It's a great afternoon activity with friends or family. The garden is spacious with areas for picnic. There are a lot of exotic orchids in the garden that I haven't seen before!
,,Nature side of Singapore,5.0,,"Apart from shopping at Orchard Road, a visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens is also a good choice. Free of charge, the area is large and filled with plants and flowers for your relaxation. If you like orchids, there is a National Orchid Garden that you can pay S$ 5 for admission.

Transport is convenient as you can take MRT to Botanic Garden Station."
,,2 hours was not enough!,4.0,,"Easily found via MRT via Botanic Gardens station, you'll find yourself at the north end of the gardens, a great place to start.

As others have noted, buy a bottle of water before you enter, because vending machines are hard to come by, the main cafe and gift shop are toward the middle of the gardens and it will take a while to get there, you can imagine it can get quite warm. Bring a hat and grab a map as you enter. If visiting on a Saturday they have free guided tours listed on their website, you'd get a lot out of those.

Some features I'd recommend, the little herb garden, the healing garden which has over 400 varieties of plants used for medicines with descriptions along the way. Also the fragrant garden, National Orchid garden (separate entry free but utterly worth the small fee), the ginger garden next door to that and then treat yourself to a leisurely stroll toward Tanglin gate.

From here you can walk (about 20 mins in the heat) or call a cab to go to Long Beach seafood restaurant @ Dempsey for black pepper crab or singapore chilli crab and have a wander through the Dempsey Hill area.

We thought 2.5 hours would be ample time to wander through the gardens, we're brisk walkers and we're not usually too fussed about gardens, not having a green thumb between the two of us, but we wished we had at least 3.5 hours. We had to rush to get to a restaurant booking afterward.

It was definitely worth the visit to see the different fauna, read all the interesting information in the healing garden, and see all the amazing orchids. Just be mindful, it can get hot so wear a hat"
,,Singapore's first UNESCO Heritage Site,5.0,,"It is a beautiful garden tourists will not want to miss visting. There are many visitors daily especially in the morning the locals go there to exercise, walk the dogs etc. When there is a musical performance the crowds even picnic there. There are orchid gardens, garden of evolution, swan lake etc. Evening walk is great before or after dinner."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,These botanic gardens are among the most beautiful I've visited. Lots to see and study plus the orchid garden set within is stunning. Well worth a visit.
,,Great for exercising and playing with children,5.0,,"Had a great time here getting some exercise with our year-old son, and letting him explore on the huge grassy areas as well as looks at all the trees, leaves, other kids playing, and dogs being walked. Wonderful."
,,Great way to spend your time,4.0,,"The botanic gardens are one of the many oases in Singapore. The area of the park is huge with in te centre the botanic gardens itself, which have many different flowers and plants in a relatively small area. The entrance fee here is a few dollar. The area around is more spacey, and well worth going as well. This part is free. The whole place feels less articificial than the gardens at the bay. You can easy spend more than a few hours here if you will visit everything. If you are considering to combine this with the MacRitchie nature trail which is not far away be prepared to walk a lot of km."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"This Botanic gardens was one of the best i'v ever visited, the National Orchid Garden cost only $5 to visit the garden itself is free. I was in Singapore for 7 days and visited the gardens on three separate occasions this is a must visit."
,,an oasis in the city,5.0,,"easily accessible by MRT, and well served with little cafes to break up the walk in the hot sun, lovely lakes and landscaped areas, maybe a lack of flora compared to greenery, but still beautiful."
,,Don't miss the Jacob Ballas Children's garden.,5.0,,"You don't even need to be a child to enjoy this delightful area, attractively laid with a suspension bridge, tunnel, little glades with child-sized seating, and interactive educational features, as well as the water play area. It's easy to miss if you approach from the main entrance as there are so many distractions along the way! There is an adjacent car park at this side if you are loaded up with buggies and towels and entrance is free."
,,Be a good historian of biology to know all the kinds. That is awesome,4.0,,"For the last day in Singapore, choosing this place though my feet were too worn out and nearly drop off my body. But the feeling was still so good. The good atmosphere was saving me from dragging myself all the long way through the map. But you love plants, love flowers and forests, so don't hesitate to enjoy this place. The bandstand was also famous and many couples chose for wedding photoshoot."
,,Oasis in the City,5.0,,"These gardens are wonderful! There is plenty of shade and lots of places to eat and drink. Many spots to sit too. Singapore is always hot, but found the gardens very pleasant, even at midday. There was a lovely breeze in most parts. There are airconditioned galleries to visit too. The National Orchid Garden is well worth the $5 admission fee, with lovely paths to wander, fountains, sculptures and a variety of plant houses to discover. A taxi from the city was less than $10, but there are plenty of public transport options too."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Great by day and fantastic at night for the light show. What we found unbelievable was its all free! Well worth a visit.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Conveniently located and wonderful for a walk or picnic. Make sure you d not miss the Orchid Garden.

,,JUST BEAUTIFUL 💗,5.0,,"Magical garden , where you can find every type of flower . Even some dedicated to some stars and celebrities !! Great photos spots 😍"
,,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC,5.0,,It is free which is brilliant for locals and for visitors. The orchid garden has a small entrance fee but well worth it. Very hot of course but there are areas of shade and nice restaurants/cafes.
,,Nice activity,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are free to enter, nice to walk around and see the different areas. A nice activity!"
,,Lovely Gardens,5.0,,The gardens themselves are very large and most interesting. There is a lot to see so if you can jump on the hop on and off bus like mode utilise that. In saying that we didn't and walked everywhere the waterfalls and rainforest areas were lovely the Gimger garden was also great. Thoroughly enjoyed a relaxing time there are plenty of cafes and restaurant around the gardens.
,,Early Bird Get The Worm..Amazing Gardens,5.0,,"Certainly Refreshing..being Excersicing or Relaxation,this is an ideal place to visit especially in the morning."
,,A most beautiful garden,5.0,,"This botanic garden is the most carefully tended and best laid out garden I have been in in many years and is free to enter. There are sections for the different types of flora and it is well signposted so that you can find the area you want easily. There are also numerous information boards around. When we were there we saw many family groups making use of this delightful environment. The only downside is that the weather in Singapore is always hot and humid, so the best time for a visit is early in the morning."
,,Just beautiful,4.0,,"Spent our time primarily in the orchid garden. Everything you'd hope for in a botanic garden. Only drawback was the heat, which kept us from spending more time exploring all the Gardens have to offer."
,,Lovely early in the morning,5.0,,"Beautiful tropical gardens...but go as early as possible in the day before it heats up! The restaurant ""Halia"" is a lovely place for lunch at the end of your visit."
,,Like this place,4.0,,"Love this place but will be better if more care and to maintain the area better, more portable toilet is required especially on weekend"
,,Morning running,4.0,,"I went there for a morning running, the gardens are very nice, with mix of trees/flowers and also a dedicated area for the rain forest. Nice to see people doing tai-chin, jogging,..."
,,Best place to relax with the family,5.0,,"Living nearby and growing up practically next to botanic gardens, bringing my family there over the weekend for a picnic and a healthy walk is my idea of a great family outing.
Not costing anything but yet having enough activities and amenities to keep everyone in the family happy."
,,Wow! An astounding array of breathtaking orchids!,5.0,,"If you love orchids, like orchids, or have even seen a supermarket orchid, this place will blow you away. It has stunning displays of orchids, and it is a wonderfully relaxing and breathtaking place to stroll leisurely through. If you have even struggled with growing an orchid, this place will make you envious of how easily they grow! HIGHLY recommended!"
,,A tropical garden paradise,5.0,,"We arrived very early as our flight arrived into Singapore at 5am. We had a whole day to spend in Singapore before our connecting flight and we got a taxi out to the gardens for a very early morning walk. They open very early (at 5.00am). We got there around 6.00am and it was actually a perfect time to stroll around the gardens before the heat and humidity became too much, as it tends to do in Singapore. The gardens are beautifully laid out and there are many other specialized gardens within the garden (which cost extra to visit). The other gardens also have later opening times - the Orchid Garden only opens at 8.30am. There were a lot of locals out early jogging in the garden, doing boot camp activities, yoga and (older adults) doing Tai Chi at this early hour. The gardens themselves are unique and beautifully laid out."
,,Fantastic Design,5.0,,"Went here with our group, the Garden was so beautiful. we took a lots of pictures. It is not natural one but really nice design. We loved everything here. We wished to have a longer time here as our tour was quite short here. May be we have to be back once date."
,,Beautiful- Perfectly executed,5.0,,"This was the first time I've been to Singapore and my friend lives off this Metro stop. The first day we were in Singapore we decided to wake up early and go to the gardens. Beautiful! Just perfectly executed! I still have just so many photos of the overall grand scheme of the gardens! My personal favorite section had to be the historical section where you walk through how the earth was formed and how all living things came from. Another personal favorite part was the Royal Gardens.

Must see! It was also totally free!"
,,Nice break from the city,4.0,,"The gardens are a nice way to spend a few hours and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are wide paths that lead you through all sorts of plants, bamboo and bougainvillia gardens, a garden that shows plant evolution and the must see orchid garden with its magnificent blooms. There are samples of colonial architecture in the park also. Entry is free but entry to the orchid garden is $5 per person."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"Even if you are not into gardening yourself you'll still be blown away by the landscapes, garden displays, fountains and tranquility here. Perfectly manicured display of plants and flowers. Thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. A definite must do in Singapore."
,,Gorgeous botanical gardens,5.0,,"Being a landscape gardener I'm always interested on seeing a city's botanical gardens. Singapore doesn't dissapoint. This garden is magnificent. At the time my wife and I had a bad dose of gastroenteritis. Walking around experiencing the diverse smells and shapes of flowers and foliage took away from the way we were both feeling. This botanical garden is massive and probably the biggest I've ever walked around. It offers various gardens to explore, one is a paid experience, which is the orchid garden. This garden has an abudance of orchids, which lies in large and seperate enclosure. If you're at the Singapore botanical gardens make sure you add this to your to do list. Actually, don't miss this attraction, it is by far one of the main things to do in Singapore."
,,Take your children to the Jacob Bayliss children's garden,5.0,,"Our two young children had a great time at this lovely children's garden inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It is partly based on the actual gardens but has been set out to engage children - educating about plants in a fun and interactive way. Bridges and waterfalls make this a beautiful area to explore with your Kids.
Of course the favourite part was the play area which is set in sand and has slides and a mini fort. The splash zone was unfortunately closed while we were there, for maintainence I think...
We got the MRT there and had about a 10 minute walk through the gardens, but we saw taxis pull up right out front the children's gardens too. I think it was free to get in, and at front there was a cafe with toasties, drinks and snacks.
Well worth a visit if you're in Singapore with young children !"
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"loads of nature, ponds, plants. A place to take beautiful pictures. A place where you can sit and relax and find peace. Various exit and entrance."
,,Nice to be there,5.0,,We felt it was more like treking as we found it very good for walking. Healing garden was very nice.
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,This is perfection in the city. A must for naturalists. Such a captivating landscape. A must for all!
,,Good green space to get a break from the city,3.0,,Well-laid gardens with a few special tours but you have to plan those in advance. The entry to the main area is free but for the special gardens inside you need to buy tickets.
,,A beautiful peaceful place in a big city,5.0,,"These gardens a a real experience where you can wonder and enjoy a range of beautiful plants and flowers. The orchard garden are something everyone should visit, so many different types of orchards in one place"
,,Peaceful and calming,4.0,,"A great way to spend an afternoon. The orchid gardens are beautiful, so definitely worth visiting these. The whole gardens are a welcome calm away from the buzz of the city. We visited on a Monday afternoon so it wasn't too busy at all, perhaps there may be more people on a weekend? Either way the gardens are so huge i cant imagine it being too overcrowded or touristy.

We had great fun feeding the fish and turtle by the lake, so definitely worth spending 2 dollar on the machine to buy the food for them - especially if you've kids with you.

Near to the ginger gardens there is a fantastic restaurant called Halia which everyone should sample.

Overall a fantastic visit with lots to see and a very friendly welcome from staff."
,,It was different but beautiful,5.0,,"I travel with my family had a stop over for three day and had visiting this beautiful garden... It is truly amazing how man made garden can turn out to be so nice...

The price abit dear, but if you can afford you should go and pay a visit it is different from any garden you ever seen ...

They have brought the world plants to this garden and it was truly a marvel."
,,A wonderful day amongst the Orchids,5.0,,We enjoyed a wonderful day visiting the Botanic Gardens of Singapore and particularly enjoyed the National Orchid Collection which was extremely interesting .. we visited on a weekend and it was very interesting to be there to see all of the Singaporians enjoying their down time also. A great day spent amongst the Orchids and of course many many other plant species.
,,very nice and tropical!,5.0,,"Nice for a walk, beautiful the orchid garden inside the park.
People gather there to practice yoga or just for a stroll in the green away from traffic. there is a nice outdoor restaurant, pleasant in the evening for dinner.
MRT stops there so very convenient to reach."
,,Beautiful even if you're not really into flowers,4.0,,"Veen there as a part if a guided tour. I was not really expecting too much (i am not really into flowers that much) , but itwas astonishing good. I gad great time, everything is beautifully setup, very schenographic... Guge amount if pkants and flowers. I had fun and end up wishing to have more spare time."
,,Garden,5.0,,"This is a beautiful garden and we even seen a metre long Komodo dragon !! Squirrels climbing trees . Great little restaurant , amazing orchids. A must see 😄"
,,Just Amazing,5.0,,I will just say that this is totally worthwhile to visit the botanical garden! Young and old can enjoy this one.
,,Great and free,5.0,,"I'm not a gardens' maniac but this one is well worth visiting. It's free of charge, you pay just for the orchid gardens inside (if you want to visit, which I'd recommend) and it's popular not only among tourists but also local people, who come there for their tai chi lessons, jogging and picknicks. It's huge and we had just one morning for it (before our flight home), so we absolutely didn't have chance to see the whole place, just a part. You may be lucky and spot a lot of animals, birds, fish and insects as well."
,,HARMONY IN EVERYTHING,5.0,,"Every time I come to Singapore, I never miss a chance to visit this place! The Garden is so big that it is not possible to see everything during a single trip. The most amazing thing is to watch the fishes, turtles and swans in Swan Lake! The entrance is free and the earlier you come, the more things you will enjoy (it'll be too hot later)!"
,,Bird watching,4.0,,I usually visit this place for bird watching. I got some beautiful clicks from here. Flora is impressive. Nice place for picnic.
,,A good place to wind down,4.0,,"Good for a long walk and maybe a picnic. Not many places in Singapore that you can just roam around and hear no traffic or see no buildings.
You don't need to buy any tickets, the free of charge area is big enough to satisfy you.
MRT access (Singapore subway network) is accessible - there's an MRT station called Botanic Gardens so you reach the place directly...
Enjoy!"
,,Stunning Nature!,5.0,,"This is a must, not only for nature enthusiasts. Singapore must have some of the best attractions in the world. Such a variety of plants of any kind. Ideal place to teach your kids and guide them back to nature and flora. Enjoy."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"So tranquil and just perfect for a wonder, not a piece of rubbishy in site perfection at its best like only Singapore can do"
,,It's huge and a good long walk from start to finish,5.0,,Great place to visit. So many gardens. Well kept and beautiful. Good exercise. A big area to cover so wear comfy shoes. You can enter at one end with the mrt and catch another one at the other end.
,,Love it,4.0,,"Great location, great walking trails, leafy and pretty, good food options and we have attended many concerts there most of which have been very enjoyable."
,,A Green Garden Only,3.0,,"If you're into photography or just green plants then you may want to visit here, but if you're expecting many colorful and assorted flowers expect to be disappointed. The only slight exception to this is the orchid garden ($5) which for me had basically a small sampling with nothing really outstanding to see. I did get a few good pictures but in the hot sun. The gift shop does have flower tea and air conditioning! If you want a short hike and some greenery then this is the place for you."
,,Such a calming experience - loved it!,5.0,,"We got off our hop on bus here on Day 5 of our Singapore holiday. Our two teenagers weren't too keen when we told them that we wanted to visit here. At the end though - our teenagers spoke very highly of our few hours there. They thoroughly enjoyed it.

We walked around in the morning. We found it a calming experience after a hectic few days for us being at the Grand Prix etc. The parks are spectacular.

Obviously the weather was hot, but being in the gardens was still very pleasant.

We paid the $5 each to walk through the Orchid Garden - we ummed and ahhed about going - but was very glad.

Even if you don't do the Orchid Garden, the Botanical Gardens is a definite visit. They are a real credit to Singapore.

We finished off our visit to the park with a iced coffee and pear Danish at the coffee shop. Wow! Never seen a Danish like this before - but yummo!!!

Thoroughly enjoyed our time spent at the Botanical Gardens. Just gorgeous."
,,Must see especially if you are a plant enthusiast,5.0,,"Lots and lots of lovely trees, bushes and plants. Free to get in, and a great walk. Some restaurants are good if not great. Spend time don't rush.

The garden is very nice, comfortable which I think is a must to visit during you SG trip."
,,Best Tropical Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"This is one of the best tropical botanic gardens that I've visited. The entry is free and can be accessed via public transport or cars.

The gardens cover a big area and different sections of the gardens cover different themes and species of plants. There's also the paid per entry garden called the National Orchid Garden.

The place is good for sheltering from the heat during the afternoon. Plenty of facilities (eatery, vending machines, drinking fountains, toilets) to make your time as comfortable as possible.

You can easily spend a few hours at this place."
,,A beautiful and well-maintained place to escape from Singapore's heat,5.0,,"The duration of the visit should depend on your connection to nature. However, one morning / afternoon is enough to enjoy the beauty and serenity of the place, learn about natural species in a tropical setting and take great pictures.

Situated amongst the gardens were the information centres explaining the history of the gardens over the years including the brick steps hand made by POW's during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. There was a concert planned for later in the evening for the locals. We walked for a few hours and still didn't see everything. There is a lovely area with 'swing seats' for adults and children - just to relax. Very beautiful gardens.
,,"Clean, relaxing and free",5.0,,This botanical garden is well maintained. Nothing really has changed over the past 10 years. The place is perfect for relaxing and just walking around looking at greeneries.

Best time to visit is early morning or evenings."
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are really beautiful with lots of different areas to explore. The gift shop also offers some lovely items with really helpful and friendly staff.

,,Awesome,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is the epicenter of this natural, flowering splendor. Formerly an unused plantation, the garden hugs 60 acres of the city, not only living up to Singapore's nickname of the City in the Garden, but earning the country's first UNESCO World Heritage site title. The gardens attract both casual naturalists and scholarly botanists with its world-renowned botanical library, acres of varied vegetation and free admission."
,,Gorgeous place to relax in the middle of the city!,5.0,,"After a week long of conference i managed to spend some time relaxing in the garden.

I arrived slightly late so wasn't able to do the orchids but you will find special flowers and orchids across the gardens anyway!"

,,Great excursion to escape the city,5.0,,"This was a really well set out garden with trails going through a small wood. Great escape from the heat and noise of the city and to top it all free. The Orchid garden is also here, but there is a small fee to pay to go round this."
,,splendid display...beautiful !,4.0,,the climate is wonderful for the plants growing in Singapore...just witness the groomed boulevards...but the botanical gardens are the crowning glory.
,,Scenic and huge botanical garden,4.0,,"The botanical garden is very huge and a nice place to relax amidst the busy tourist visit. But, recommended only if there is spare time unless you are a nature lover. But, prepared to walk about 2 kms from the nearest MRT."
,,Always just so PERFECT!,5.0,,"Mostly here for evening walks with my pup and just to sit and absorb the greens during day in the weekends.
Super green and such a fantastic place for a picnic date or just to watch the swans at the lake. BG is a big place so if u want to play some music and not interrupt other park goers there are plenty of space and different spots.
If you didn't bring anything along, there a day time cafe which turns into restaurant by night. Alternatively there is a Dapaulo near by before you enter the park if your taking the train. You can go and pick up some food or simply buy snacks from there before heading into the park.
You can see people doing Yoga and at times there is some kind of activities going on. So you might want to check the Parks schedule online.

PLEASE bring a bottle of water with you as if can get a little hot during the day:)"

,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore. Really well maintained gardens with the most amazing plants to see, really show casing what grows & thrives in this hot & humid climate. I spent over 4 hours here just enjoying wandering around. The orchid garden is spectacular, the largest number of orchids I have ever seen. I could happily visit again & again and probably spot something else I hadn't seen before. I was also lucky enough to see a large monitor lizard in the undergrowth scratching around for food."
,,Good day trip,5.0,,Went around these can send hours there very clean and present orchid garden is nice but requires entry ticket
,,Even better than I remembered,5.0,,"It's over 20 years since I last visited.
The Botanics were founded in 1859 and since then it's been a landmark of Singapore , it really is worth the effort to go and experience all it has to offer. It is truly spectacular. The plants range from fabulous species of orchids to impressive rainforest plants and trees.
It's possible to walk as long or short as you wish.
There are plenty of places to have a picnic should you fancy."
,,I liked a lot,5.0,,"If you have time to walk and enjoy the nature, this place is for you. I would be happy to live near this type of parks. It is really amazing. I pass it very fast almost running for 2 hours, but to enjoy it you will need more."

Great set up and very well run, like all of Singapore"
,,Great place but too hilly for wheelchairs,4.0,,"Stopped off here whilst on hop on/ hop off bus tour. Free to get in but a charge for entrance to the orchid centre within.
Extensive grounds, beautiful and interesting.
Large lizards digging around in the undergrowth.
Wheelchairs can be borrowed at the reception area free. Could have spent all day here but was absolutely exhausted in the heat and humidity in the very hilly environment, although we managed to enjoy the orchid centre - with the help of sympathetic passers by with the wheelchair pushing at steep bits !
A wee train with or without a commentary would be gratefully appreciated by all"
,,scoting,5.0,,we can play a scotter or search for swams to see.we can also look at ducklings and turtles.it has more than 100 people visiting everyday.
,,Worth a trip,5.0,,"Catch the MRT directly to garden. It is lush and lots to see. Wide, open spaces. Orchid garden is worth it. Limited Cafes so take water. Visit later in the afternoon for a cooler experience."
,,Lovely,5.0,,A beautiful well set gardens. Make sure you have comfy shoes on as lots of walking required but a must see.
,,Gardens in Singapore,5.0,,We visited this garden yesterday. Despite the heat we had a wonderful few hours exploring this incredible place. It is beautifully laid out with lawns dotted with ancient trees and tropical plants. There is a rainforest area and a breathtaking orchid garden. An army if workers keep this garden in utterly pristine order. ( unesco world heritage site since July 2015) A must visit particularly if the hustle and bustle of the city becomes tiring. Not too crowded but hot. An umbrella for shade and bottled water helps. On leaving order a taxi at the customer help counter as it is too hot waiting for a random taxi to pass by. Keep your eyes open for magnificent monitor lizards in amongst the shrubs. Free entry to garden and small charge ($5 singapore dollars from memory) for entry to the orchid garden.
,,A beautiful day in the gardens,5.0,,"A fabulous time spent exploring here, some Saturday evenings free music events in amphitheatre. A rainforest walk complete with monkeys.loved it."
,,nice for a walk in the nature,4.0,,It is a very nice place to enjoy some nature while staying in the city. You can also find a number of good restaurant just out of the Gardens.
,,found a komodo dragon!,4.0,,"This is a large spralling park, with lots of nice flowers to see, and if you are lucky you may spot a komodo dragon hiding in the shrubs! There is't much shade, so it can get very hot in the blistering heat!"
,,Singapore's true gem,5.0,,To have such a garden in the middle of a busy city-state is such an accomplishment-- and then to have UNESCO give it its seal of approval is icing on the cake.
,,Beautiful oasis in the midst of Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a beautiful respite from the bustle of Singapore.

They combine areas of natural rainforest with large open grassed areas on one hand, and highly cultivated display gardens on the other. Not a leaf is out of place-- that may be a bit ""un- natural"" but it doesn't detract.

For us the highlight was the orchid garden, where hundreds of orchids of different shapes, sizes and colours were beautifully presented.

The gardens have streams, water falls, well tended paths and boardwalks and excellent signage on plants. The restaurants and food outlets on the sight looked good, and the souvenir shop sold classy momentos

All up it was the usual Singapore order and efficiency in a lovely setting."
,,Doesnt fail to impress everytime I go there,5.0,,"This is one of the best parks in Singapore. This time I went with m 87 year old grandmom and she had a great time. The entire park is wheelchair friendly. You can also avail of the free wheelchair facility at the visitor center.

Look forward to visiting the park again."
,,Hot AF!,5.0,,"Great visit, the turtles and birds are cool to watch. Only downside is the heat which absolutely killed me, but the wife and I still enjoyed our visit! I'd suggest to take the MRT up rather than walk all the way up Orchard Road."
,,Orchids,4.0,,"The Gardens are the only World heritage site in Singapore. Take the underground to the far end of the garden and wander back through it and get a taxi out of the other end back to your hotel. Eating places exist in the gardens. Take some of the 'off the beaten track' paths to spot more wildlife and get away from the noise. Check out the orchids, some amazing flowers and easy to take photograph's. You can easily spend several hours wandering through the place"
,,Well maintained botanical garden,4.0,,excellent experience in the bustling city of Singapore. Situated on the Yellow line via MRT. Worth a visit on a weekend.

It's free to enter and wander round but there is the National Orchid garden within the Botantic Gardens which cost $5 per adult to enter which is extremely good value for the display that you see"
,,Morning walks,5.0,,Unesco world heritage gardens. Mature trees and unique plants. Great green lung in a modern city state.
,,Always good to visit,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens is a wonderful place to visit when in Singapore with all its variety and beauty. Such a lovely place so close to heart of the city
,,A place to breath and relax,5.0,,It would take more than a day to explore the whole park. It is well kept ( as most places in Singapore) and i understand singaporeans who has their picnics there. I cant think of a more harmonic place. Almost film-like in many ways.
,,Great couple of hours in the nature,5.0,,"Great garden, easily accessible, and free! we spent a lovely couple of hours wandering around. If you like flowers, I recommend paying the extra $10 for the orchid garden. 🌺"
,,Garden City,4.0,,"Together with Gardens by the Bay, East Coast Gardens and the Southern Ridges parks and forest areas, the Singapore Botanic Gardens firmly establishes Singapore as a garden city.

In fact, you don't have to go to any of these. Drive or travel any where in Singapore and the roads are lined with trees with centre strips of shrubs, trees, flowers and lawns.

The Botanical Gardens is a UNESCO Heritage Site.

It was established in 1859 by the Agri-Horticultural Society on 60 acres of land that previously a plantation.

Best of all, admittance to the Gardens is free, but there is a S$5 fee for entry to the National Orchid Garden, which is in the middle of the Botanic Garden.

The gardens are used by Singaporeans for walking,jogging and exercise, but I just enjoyed strolling slowly through it for two hours taking in the amazing tropical flora."
,,An oasis amongst the desert of metropolis,4.0,,"This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a must-see in Singapore. I regularly visit the city and make a point of visiting the gardens whenever I can. Awesome walking and biking trails weaves through 74 acres, divided into 12 different gardens that include several heritage buildings on site, laboratories and educational facilities, and 3 lakes. The Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage is a beautiful semi-natural ampitheatre, such an awesome venue. Their Sunday free concert series is awesome!"
,,Well maintained gardens,4.0,,Very well managed tropical gardens The national orchid garden costs $5 but is worth a visit Innumerable staff maintain gardens to a very high standard
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"The gardens are so diverse and there is so much to see it is difficult to see it all in one day. The Orchid Gardens are within the Botanical Gardens but there also areas given to the growth of plants from different areas within the world like the arid Sun Garden, the Cool House along with the Ginger Gardens and sensory Fragrant Gardens and the sweep of the Palm Valley. Take two days to appreciate its beauty is a recommendation"
,,Great day out was hot but great,5.0,,"Easy to spend the day here.,very informative and great map if you don't want to miss anything. Spend the day take a picnic lunch and enjoy the well manicured grounds"
,,Clean and free!,4.0,,"Loved the botanic gardens - it is a great place to take a walk and see plants you do not normally see. The healing garden was closed for maintenance, and fall is not really the time of year once can see flowers, so we did not stay long. It is very clean and free to get in."
,,Big park and many plants collection,4.0,,Had been to this place with friends in the evening. Peaceful place and many collection of plants. Easily accessible to public transport as well. Best time to visit is during evening after 4.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Although a hot day saw a tiny portion of the gardens as spent most time in the orchid garden. A whole day would do it if you can stand the heat. There are many restaurants and cafés dotted about so you can get cool between more exploring. Trees are amazing, planting wonderful. I can see why it has been given awards."
,,"Friend hanging out, walking in the green",5.0,,"I often spend half of my day off here, prepare some snacks, a book and a mat. Beautiful place, quiet, and relaxing. Pick a place along the lake where it's more windy and you can hide yourself in the shade during noon time,
Good idea for friend re-union and family with kids as well."
,,Not just for flowers....,5.0,,...there are plenty of places to hang out in the gardens without visiting the orchid garden and it's easy to get there (MRT or bus). The Ginger cafe is worth a visit but take money it's not cheap and watch out for the hard sell on the 'extras' available in the nearby shop.
,,A must-go for classical music goers and picnic lovers,5.0,,Every few weekends in a month Singapore symphony or Singapore Chinese Symphony would give free outdoor concerts that last 1 hour each time. The crowd can be very overwhelming so be prepared to go there a few hours before the crowd kicks in. Singapore can be so hot and humid so remember to bring your chilled beer and wine glasses with those picnic mats and relaxed in the music and green.
,,beautiful garden,4.0,,beautiful garden extremely well maintained It is open at night and also worth de visit as it is well lit and peaceful

,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,"I've looked for information about the Botanic Gardens and I knew it's big, but I didn't expect it was that huge. You can find tons of information and a great number of species of plants. You can spend a whole day in the park just wandering around and visiting the exhibitions and gardens. Simply stunning and fantastic."
,,Botanical Gardens,4.0,,You will find full of plantation and different kind of flowers and for the photographers point to capture those..
,,A good outing with a picknic,4.0,,"Take the train or taxi to Botanical Gardens (SMRT) station as parking is difficult but not impossible.Take a slow walk towards Tangling Road. Take your own water and a picnic and stop over at the gazebo shelters, there are plenty to chose from. Stop over at the lake and read the information guides.There are cafes and a restaurant in the gardens but be advised they come at a price. The orchard garden is worth visit and reasonably priced. Allow at least two hours to enjoy the outing. This is one of the most peaceful places in central Singapore."
,,Wonderful walk,5.0,,Any visitor in singapore must spend some time walking in this vast garden. Wear comfortable shoes n a camera. Many food n drinks outlet...for u to rest.

,,Beautiful and free,5.0,,"The stroll through this park is beautiful, especially if you enjoy looking at all things green. Also inside is the national botanical garden which costs $5SGD for adults to enter their orchid garden.

,,Botanical garden,4.0,,"It's an amazing garden providing d feeling of fresh air . It's a lush green garden surrounded by beautiful lakes n throughout one can enjoy the chirping of various kinds of birds...

- some streams for children to catch some ""fishes""

,,Worth a visit day or night,5.0,,"Very well set out, beautiful gardens and a wonderful sound and light show in the evenings.
The night show is on twice a night, but is very popular so worth getting there well ahead of show time.
There are a few places there to eat beforehand or just settle in for the show.
The best spot is around the centre tree but you can see well from all around also.
Advise to take your camera or smartphone to get some great photos or video."
,,Jurassic Park without the Dinosaurs,4.0,,"I live fairly close, love going here. Open-air ampitheatre for concerts. Big lakes full of huge fish. Monitor lizards scratching in the leaf litter for breakfast. It's a pretty long walk from one end to the other, and lots of things to see and take pictures of.

You can get to the North end of the park via MRT but it's a bit of a walk to get into the garden from the station.

Be sure to hit up the National Orchid Garden. There is a fee, but it's small.

My one problem is that it reminds me of Jurassic Park and I keep expecting to see velociraptors. They run 40km/hour and KNOW NO FEAR."
,,Pick a day with good weather!,5.0,,"Head over for a picnic under the trees or play games on the large field. Some nights, there are also performances at the symphonic stage.

My favourite place to explore in the Botanic Gardens, is the Orchid Garden. Just pay a small fee of $5 and you'll get to see a large selection of beautiful orchids and other plants.

Note: Check out the National Environment Agency weather app for best data collection."

Several lakes are dotted around the park where you can find an abundance of fauna, including water monitors, black swans, tortoises and many fish. Part of the area is world heritage listed.

,,Lovely place to walk around n admire the beauty of nature,5.0,,"This is a nice garden to spend the morning. There are decent walk ways along the swan lake and around the whole garden. The best part it's free but you need to pay admission only if you go into the orchid gardens.
There are a few restaurants inside the garden. Most are pretty reasonable but there is also a one Michelin star - corner house near the Nassim gate.
To complete the whole garden, one would easily need an hour.
Definitely recommend it"
,,A little walk in the garden which never fails to make me wanna go back for more,5.0,,"One of our favorite weekend visits even though I am a local. Recommended itinerary for a first time visit (3hrs minimum): Enter from the visitor centre entrance. Start off with breakfast/brunch if you are feeling hungry already at Casa Verde. Treat yourself to a hearty breakfast surrounded by nature. They serve local delights, classic american breakfast, sandwiches, pizzas and pastas. This eatery is also full, be prepared to wait and find yourself a table. After your meal, continue to walk deeper into the garden where you can feed the fish at the Symphony Lake. Continue towards Orchid Plaza and visit the National Orchid Garden for a small fee. You will find different specie of beautiful orchids named after famous people inside this garden. Enter the rain forest trail for a walk in the tropical rainforest (keep to the left side of the trail) and it should lead you back to the visitor centre where u can have some refreshments again before you depart.

The gardens were very so nice that we spent hours to enjoy them, but sadly, it was raining heavily and we did not have chance to visit the National Orchid Garden."
,,Always something going on here!,5.0,,We like to bring visitors here. The restaurants in the park can get a bit busy so best bring a picnic. We also enjoy the free concerts here. The children run around playing and we watch thr concert! It can be hilly so when you are sitting up on a slope you get a nice Breeze.

Please check out their website as there are lots of free concerts at the weekend...it will tell you what and who is on...usually held in the concert park area which is very impressive.
A great way to relax and enjoy something different on your precious days off.
Highly recommended."
,,A must,5.0,,"Whether or not you are into gardens, this is a must see when visiting Singapore. The garden is beautifully laid out and you can spend hours walking round. As with all places in Singapore , bring some water."
,,Well worth a visit if you love gardens,4.0,,"These gardens are really worth seeing. Especially all the water features. I did expect to see a few more rare plants that I would not recognize, however the gardens are still lovely."
,,Evening Walk With Pet,5.0,,"A Saturday evening in August, decided to drive to Botanic Garden with my dog.

Walked through the 2 ponds, spotted a swan swimming. Passing the orchid santuary, not much flowers in bloom. Huge heliconia hanging downwards. Stopped by the world clock in the heart of the garden, a place where many families gathered to build relationship. Squirrels ran and dashed through the roofs. Lots of trees, ferns, shrubs, flowering and non-flowering plants made up this garden. An the sound of falling dripping water at the main entrance which I always feel that it's a form of water therapy, peacefully calmed the mind.

Placed my dog in my bag wanted to use the washroom but there was this Chinese old cleaner demanded me to leave her outside before entering. How very rude of him. (Knowing that pet are prohibited in the washroom but I did the needful to place it inside my bag. I supposed this man needs to use some initiative.)

The walk in this garden is always great but the service staff can be more helpful and understanding to provide a better experience."
,,Stunning - not to miss for nature lovers!,5.0,,Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy these vast gardens! It's worth the small fee to visit the orchid garden too. Any budding photographers will just love these grounds. I do suggest taking some snacks and drinks with you as the cafe is quite busy and pricey. An excellent way to spend the day that will suit any age group!
,,very interesting,4.0,,"do not miss the botanic gardens, they are really great.

,,amazing,5.0,,i can't take my eyes away from this place.. my memory is full of beautiful flower and ofcourse with the beautiful arrangement of the garden.
,,Love the rainforest walk!,5.0,,"My favorite part of the botanic gardens is the rainforest walk. Don't miss it if you come here. The entire rainforest walk is boarded so it's easy to walk no matter what footwear you're wearing. There are three entrances to the walk, two of which do not have stairs. It takes less than 15 minutes walking in a loop. The foliage makes the walk very shady and I've often seen squirrels and pretty birds here and all over the botanic gardens.

There's a small cafe Casa Verde where I like to get a morning juice and blueberry Danish. It's yummy but not cheap!"
,,"Beautiful, free and a hop on hop off stop",4.0,,I was expecting to have to pay and was pleasantly surprised when I found out I didnt. Our hop on hop off bus came right to the entrance and we had a nice leisurely stroll through the beautiful gardens and water features. We were on a little bit of a time rush so we didnt see it all and didnt pay to go in the orchard gardens ($5) but one could easily spend a whole day here. Very peaceful and it was kind of cool to see the singaporeans doing different exercises in groups here.
,,relaxing place!,5.0,,"perfect place,relaxing, clean,a lot of gardens to visit.must see!even if it is raining is so good too!"
,,A Big Oasis in the middle of suburbia.,4.0,,What a lovely surprise to find this garden. I took the mrt straight to the gardens. A huge area to cover. Was there for 5 hours taking in the plants animals and serenity of the place.
,,gorgeous orchids displayed,4.0,,"Well worth the price of entry but be aware you can get lost it is so big, so always take plenty of water with you. A lot of thought has been made to create pockets where couple can take photos with the orchids surrounding them, very thoughtful"
,,Love it!!!!!!!!!! :),5.0,,"I love botanic gardens everywhere, but this one is really special. You are in a jungle environment. The entire city is a botanic garden :) Watch-out for those afternoon rain. It is like fire hose. Be sure to have umbrella handy :)"
,,Very pretty! Well worth visiting for a few hours,4.0,,"Take the time to walk through this garden.. even if only 30 minutes.

Lots of different routes and paths. Little areas with cacti, bonsai and a separate Orchid garden which is well worth going to.

Ponds with giant fish and large terrapins in.

Also worth visiting in the evening when it is lit up."
,,Nice for a Leisurely Stroll,5.0,,"I walked through the Botanic Gardens, starting from the end close to the MRT station and getting out in the other end (Tanglin Gate) which was about a 2 km walk. The garden has many different sections (rainforest, orchid gallery, etc) which I did not get to visit due to lack of time. I would definitely explore the area more next time. Bring water, as it could get hot even under the shade. Was a bit disappointed that the Bandstand (the one usually featured in photos of the Botanic Gardens) was under renovation during the time of my visit.9"
,,Lovely Safe Gardens,4.0,,"As when Visiting the other attractions in Singapore Remember the Heat and Humidity will up there !!! the gardens are a really lovely place to visit if you have the time, its free so that's a added bonus !"
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The gardens are the place to relax and unwind from this busy city. It has been listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site and for a good reason. Unlike the boisterous and very busy Sentosa island, the gardens offer tranquillity and peace.

There are various areas in the park: tropical garden (rain forest), lakes, Herb Gardens and the main attraction: the Orchid gardens. They are all clearly posted and you also get the map. The grounds are immaculately kept.

Fascinating Orchid gardens, with over 1,000 species and even more hybrids, cost $5 to enter. Make sure you visit the VIP area where new varieties have been created to honour various visiting dignitaries. Probably the nicest one is the purple and white Papilionanda William Catherine.

Located in Tanglin, not that far from the north-western end of Orchard Road or can be accesses via MRT: Botanic Gardens station on the intersection of the Downtown Line (blue) and the Circle Line (orange)."
,,Neat and clean,4.0,,You get to see a lot of plants and it is a clean and quite place.. Ideal for jogging and photography.

,,Stunning place,5.0,,perfect place to do sport .... or walk around .... or have a picnic withe yore family .... I'll visit it again
,,Nice gardens - confusing but ok,4.0,,"We want in a Tuesday, making for a very relaxing trip. I'm glad because we were trying to find one of the gardens and got lost somewhere around the college. Nice college though. Eat at the hawker stand at Raffles building - well worth it."
,,Half day tour,4.0,,We visited here as part of our day was very beautiful with plenty to see and very good photo opportunities.
,,"Huge, gorgeous place",4.0,,"A wonderful place, tropical greenery with tallest bamboo you've ever seen, well marked out paths, pristine as most things are in Singapore, watching baby turtles and a water dragon in the lake was a highlight. What would have been good there would be more seating/drinking places, there are the odd roofed over resting places with bottles of water, but not really enough, otherwise it would be 5 stars from us. The heat and humidity is really something. Take water."
,,Beautiful and restful,4.0,,"Large gardens easy to get to by bus and Metro (suggestion: take a bus to the southern end, walk to the northern end and return to the city centre by Metro (or vice versa). Includes a wonderful walk through original Singapore rainforest. The rating reflects only the fact that cafes/ restaurants (of which there are several) proved impossible to find - no, or unclear, signposting."
,,A nice relaxing walk,4.0,,"When in Singapore, make sure you take some time to walk through the Botanic Gardens. A lot of different plants and flowers. Beautiful landscape, smells and colors. And a lot of residents running and enjoying the place."
,,Highlight of my visit,5.0,,"I like nature trips and honestly I enjoyed it here than visiting Universal Studios in Sentosa. If you want a breath of fresh air within the city with nice views as well, this is a must-visit."
,,Beautiful and expansive grounds,5.0,,"This is a beautiful and well maintained garden that spans a significant amount of space. The best part is that it is free. There are plenty of areas of shade as you walk around. There is a children's area which is even interesting for adults and they had a refreshing water area where you can get wet and get relief from the hot sun. I saw black swans and white swans and an amphitheater surrounded by a pond with turtles and fish. I even saw a few other interesting creatures roaming around including roosters, squirrels and lizards. I ate French toast at Casa Verde although you are allowed to picnic here so you may want to bring your own food. I got caught in a thunderstorm so we all had to wait it out for awhile but I also walked in it as I needed to get back to my hotel. You can pay to see the orchids but I felt I get enough of that at the Gardens by the Bay. Ideally you will want to spend several hours here. It is very convenient from the metro."
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"Absolutely beautiful, also a very historical place, having 156 years worth of history. Lots of walking paths to walk around and it opens at 5.00 am and closes at 12.00 midnight."

,,Haven of peace and tranquility,4.0,,"This was a really great place for a quiet morning after a long vacation visiting 3 countries. It is beautifully set out and very peaceful with lots of water falls and plants of interest, don't miss the Orchid garden, it's a really great place for photographs and a lovely way to see another side of this busy Asian island state. Its free to enter although you have to pay for the orchid gardens, its not expensive and not to be missed."

,,If you love Gardens this is the place for you,5.0,,"It is truely one of the most beautiful gardens I have strolled through, you can easily spend a whole day here and the orchids a will take your breath away just beautiful"
,,Well kept gardens,4.0,,"Since we stayed at the le grove serviced apartments we walked to the gardens. We visited the orchid garden only. It is a big place and because of our love for orchids that is where we spent about 2 hours. Although not all orchids were in bloom, the gardens are set up beautifully. entrance to the garden is free, however there is a very minimal ticket to the orchid garden. It was very encouraging to see people relaxing and enjoying themselves. Food was great and amenities well kept. A great place to visit."
,,Second only to Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are second only to Gardens by the Bay, so definitely go if you enjoy nature at all; they're very gorgeous and have a lot of variety, and plenty of places to explore, sit down, and take it all in."
,,Well worth the time,4.0,,"This is a great attraction and well worth the visit. Well maintained and such a large space in such a small city.
A breath of fresh air and peace in a busy city. The orchids are magnificent.
Visit here rather than the flower dome and it's free...."
,,Fun and easy,5.0,,Simple way to wind down and get away from the fast paced city. Easy and calming. Good to get some exercise too.
,,Combined with the orchid show,4.0,,"The cover of the trees gives one some respite from the heat and humidity. Swan lake is very calming as is the meditation garden. Unfortunately the frangipani were in bud but not out, and the ginger garden was not in flower. The topography of the gardens will be a challenge for some people, but rest seats are scattered around."
,,Second Best out of the City,4.0,,"This park/garden is quite large and is extremely accessible with buses and a close MRT station. Just like the GBB, it is well maintained however, it is quite different in a few places, and thus both is worth the visit if you have spare time ~~"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Went not expecting much to pass some time however was an absolutely beautiful day out. Relaxing area, maintained by absolutely loads of staff. There are vending machines which provides food for the terapins & fish for you to feed for $1. There is a restaurant in the middle of the gardens with lovely food that's reasonably priced.
Lovely beautiful place highly recommended."
,,"Plants, plants",5.0,,"Our Singaporean friends took us here last evening. Very enjoyable and interesting if you like plants. They had, in an indoor setting, plants for all over the world. Enjoyable, if you like this kind of thing. First time I saw such a site in an indoor setting."
,,Tom Eadie,4.0,,"My wife and I spent many hours touring the Gardens by the Bay and were very impressed with the great layout and beauty of these gardens.

These are not just gardens full of colour and different species of plants but it is full of figurines, wooden carvings, man made waterfall and walks through the park itself.

I would highly recommend to anyone including families with children to add this tourist attraction to your itinerary, well worth the reasonable cost."
,,A relaxing experience,4.0,,"It was my first time to the Botanical Garden. It was very accessible, which we could reach the place via train (Circle line) or from Orchard Road. Other than the admission fees for the Orchid Garden, we did not pay a single cent. The entire place was so full of relaxing vibes. We had thoroughly enjoyed the walk, learning the different plans and orchids. There is a huge place for folks to have picnic, play on the grass. As the place is big, I realise there aren't many benches for people who might want to rest their feet."
,,Beautiful Orchid and garden that must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is listed in UNESCO World Heritage Site for her beautiful 156 years history.
You can plan your morning stroll or picnic on this 82 hec with over 10,000 floral all over the garden. It's free entry.
For less than US$4 for adult, National Orchid Garden should not be missed. Over 1200 species of orchid and special species are delegated to Head of State and well known celebrities! Incorporated with different zoning, i.e. Spring, Summer, Autumn and winter, you will enjoy full bloomed orchid.
Best time to visit is 7-9am, cooler and lesser people. But still good for an evening stroll or jog.
Singapore is know as Garden City, truly shown in this area. Whether you are a nature lover or not, a trip to this famous gardens still worth going with easy access by public transport."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"One of the greenest area in the city, is hardly crowded. It is very easily accessible. We could not finish walking around as it is a huge place. Beautifully laid out, we saw some people cycling and jogging. I do not know if buggies are available, I hope they are as one can not cover the entire garden on foot."
,,Great place to walk,5.0,,I have been walking in the Botanic Gardens for years. It is amazing how big the gardens still seem after all these years. We like to just ramble along the walking trails and visit the orchid garden. You won't be disappointed.
,,Beautiful on a sunny day,5.0,,"Take a hop-on hop-off bus ticket and stop at the Botanical Gardens for a 30min to 1hr walk with nice views, beautiful plants and a good rest outside the city. Nice experience!"
,,Exquisite blooms,5.0,,This is our fifth visit to the gardens and we never tire of the beauty of the orchids. Each time there have been different orchids out in bloom so it is fresh experience for us. We limited our garden experience to the orchid garden and then went on to our favourite restaurant Halia for lunch to celebrate our anniversary.
,,Family Day out,5.0,,It was a great place to take the family for a walk and some play. The vegetation is wonderful and the paths are well maintained.
,,"""The best things in life are free!""",5.0,,"Great place to visit, even on a rainy day. Lots of different areas to explore, all clearly laid out and marked. Vast open spaces means its not crowded. Really useful information signs every now and again to help you understand what you were looking at. We had lunch at the cafe which was enjoyed by all."
,,Great for families and picnic.,5.0,,"Good for hiking, walking around, family picnics. Huge garden but a good variety of plants. Very accessible from the Botanic Garden MRT."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are beautifully kept and an absolute delight for anyone with an interest in gardens.
The variety of tropical plants is staggering.
Unfortunately, the tropical heat and humidity makes it difficult to spend enough time walking the grounds for less fit individuals. Many electric buggies zip around carrying staff. The gardens should consider making a few available to transit people to areas of the gardens for a cost. It would be a very popular feature, and enable visitors to visit more areas of the beautiful gardens."
,,Great way to enjoy nature for free!,5.0,,Brought some overseas visitors here as they wanted to somewhere other than The usual touristy hunts. Had a great nature walk around the park. Great for bringing kids and dogs too!
,,A must visit oasis in the heart of the city,5.0,,"I have been to Singapore more than 60 times in the last 35 years but have never considered visiting this garden in the middle of the city. When I heard that the National Orchid Garden has been named a world heritage site I decided to pay it a visit. The orchid garden was, no doubt, very beautiful but the botanical gardens was a revelation. I had never imagined that such a calm, well maintained oasis could exist in the heart of the city. The deeper you walked to the center of the garden the quieter it becomes and the city almost disappears. Access to the gardens has become easier through the Botanic Gardens MRT station."
,,Trip down memory lane!,5.0,,We visited the gardens for a couple of hours but could of spent the whole day here. You can purchase a picinic and go off exploring the gardens.
,,A beatiful garden for free,4.0,,"a great trip to Singapore Botanic Gardens, for free, in the centre of the city, even though it was a kind of sunny day, but i still found it humid for a more than 2 kilos walk. love it"
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"We have been to the gardens on a Sunday, weather was lovely, still humid to take a long walk. We saw a big lizard :) there are people running, doing picnic on the grass. It is a nice place to enjoy with young kids."
,,beautiful,4.0,,"A wonderful place to take in a gentle stroll around this wonderful park, fo not underestimate the size, give yourself time to enjoy and relax"
,,A different world in Singapore,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens in truly a place outside time. It is hard to imagine an oasis of green and calm exists inside busy Singapore. The grounds are exquisitely maintained. The stories of the heritage trees are fascinating. And it is just plain relaxing to walk amid so much green. There are places where the tree cover creates a beautiful canopy. In such places, you can actually feel the temperature drop.

And the cafe, Food for Thought, is outstanding!"
,,"Must go destination in Singapore, also for Pokemon lovers",5.0,,"Explore the zillion reasons for the Heritage award. It worried every second of the tour.

My overseas friends were truly awed by the perfectly manicured garden which was tendered with so much love and care.

Well landscaped, trimmed and clean. People from all walks of life, locals and foreigners alike were treated to the same awesome atmosphere.

Works are carried out to expand and improve the garden.

It is THE place for all activities we all enjoyed. Simple get together, catch up, picnics, exercise, team events, concerts....even Pokemon treasure hunt!

We all basked in our great fortune to be in the heavenly place, Singapore!"
,,Fantastic attraction,5.0,,"Definitely recommend for visitors of all types and ages. It's a large gardens with different themes and well-kept. The orchid garden is a must, with a very inexpensive entry fee."
,,"Another ""must do"" in Singapore",5.0,,"We always visit the gardens when staying Singapore. This time we took the MRT which means we started at the northern end of the gardens and walked south towards the main facilities and the orchid garden. We enjoy the layout of the gardens, plenty of paths and you can experience the gardens in peaceful solitude.

The feature gardens such as the ginger garden, healing garden and children's garden are all great features, as as the lakes. We saw plenty of bird life too, a great place for birders. There are, of course, a few places at which to eat - we tried The Halia restaurant which was excellent, and there are places to buy souvenirs. Entry to the Botanic gardens is free but make sure you pay $5 to visit the National Orchid Garden as this is magnificent."
,,Serene and Lovely Place for all to Enjoy.,5.0,,"Other than being a unesco site, it is also a huge garden for human and pets to enjoy. The best part is the garden to free for all (other than some of the sites within). One can enjoy a picnic with friends, games with friends or simply just chill out or take a stroll. There are also restaurants on yhd premise, some of which are pet friendly. This is also a place where one can catch many pokemons given the many pokemon stops."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"This is a great place to go, it's free and you can really feel the humid tropical lushness that is also Singapore. Bring am umbrella and stay during the midday rain, in the rainy season, pure bliss."
,,Beautiful flowers along with lots of different type of tree,5.0,,"Lots of orchids and many more different flowers are there.The garden is so beautiful, well maintained and is such a fantastic place to visit. Kids were having fun. It is also very close to the city centre."
,,Quite Large,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are rather large, with several sections dedicated to a theme. There is an area for children, a healing garden (medicinal plants), a foliage garden, etc. The National Orchid Garden is housed within the Botanic Gardens. The Botanic Gardens are free but there is a $5 fee to enter the National Orchid Garden. The Botanic Gardens MRT stops adjacent the entrance to the Botanic Gardens - you cannot get lost. Expect to see people exercising or doing yoga in groups, or families playing, on the large expanses of open land. Plenty of food, rest rooms, and gift shops. Lots of walking."
,,Pure delight,5.0,,Though the day was hot and humid we could still enjoy it walking and admiring shady paths and exotic plants of this unique botanical garden. Eating out there was also a great experience.
,,So beautiful and serene!,5.0,,"We went for a stroll at the before our dinner at Corner House, which is situated within the compounds of the Botanic Gardens. The garden is so beautiful, well maintained and is such a fantastic place to visit. It is also very close to the city centre."
,,The Highlight of the Singapore Day tour,4.0,,"The gardens are first class. Walking is involved and there are some small inclines to navigate so good walking shoes are a must. The tulips were in bloom and the walk through the gardens is very nice after walking around Singapore during the morning.
We had a relaxing and good time. Even though the temperatures were in the 90's, the gardens were a little bit cooler. An interesting side note, I do not recall any insects.
This is worth the price of admission. Definitely want a high resolution camera for good shots of the flowers."
,,Day out with family full of simple pleasures,4.0,,"We dont need to spend lots of money to have a wonderful family outing. My recent afternoon outing to the botanic gardens with my young niece, nephew and my 12 year old was nothing but simple pleasures that nature brings. The kids had so much fun feeding the fish and turtles in the pond (make sure you buy the fish food from the dispenser located near the visitor infornation counter). Then we were pleasantly surprised to find old swings in another lart of the park which brought back so much childhood memories because we had one of these swings in our house garden growing up....being in the nature really does wonders to your spirit and soul! Having a piece of this natural heritage in the middle of concrete Singapore is a true respite!"
,,"Beautiful garden, free for public",5.0,,"It is a beautiful garden, with a great walking trait. It might be too hot during the day, so it's best to visit either in the early morning or late afternoon"
,,Better than expected,5.0,,"Went with family, spent more time than expected...children's area was really nice. Orchid garden was great, just a nice place to wonder around."
,,Interesting gardens,4.0,,Beautifully laid out. Particularly enjoyed the orchids garden. Did not see all we wanted to due to massive downpour. Best to visit early in the morning due to heat. Take plenty of water.
,,Beauty is not just on the inside of this place,4.0,,"The experience of the Botanic Gardens begins well before you arrive and is stunning from start to finish. Although we travelled to Singapore simply as a long stop over, we couldn't help but be excited by the beauty of the gardens that we could see clearly from our hotel grounds. So we headed there to see for ourselves. The glass dome that surrounds the Botanical Garden Flower Dome is breathtaking from the Marina City Park and it houses a huge selection of beautifully kept specimens from the globe. It is well air conditioned inside so be prepared to be a lot cooler in the dome than out in the park. The pathways that snake you through the gardens are very tidy as Singapore is famous for and they lead on to quiet nooks all about the park. We had a marvellous time exploring some of the more hardy and native flora on display outside of the dome too. It's a great day out and you could easily spend an entire day here with the attractions that are contained within the park but also a lot of time can be spent learning about the various flora just from walking about the public areas of the gardens. An enjoyable afternoon."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Singapore Botanis Gardens are so awesome. They are full of unusual plants and flowers and it is a dream to go through them, enjoy"
,,nice to relax,4.0,,"is huge with special garden for kids nice surroundings, a lor of flower and greenaries good place for families"
,,Another mind blowing architectural marvel,5.0,,"A completely self-contained habitat for a whole plethora of flora and fauna in a couple of giant glass bubbles...It's priceless!!!
I was simply spell bound at the scale of execution of this marvel. With almost every conceivable category of botanical species which is not available locally in Singapore being on display, one can imagine the grandeur of this feat. See it to believe it...With a waterfall of its own!!!"
,,disappointing but still had lovely parts,3.0,,Lots of tracks to run or walk but a lot of green foliage along the way. was hoping to see tropical flowers but had to walk over a kilometre to get to the national orchid part and would then cost $5 to enter. Didn't have time to view as had taken me 40 mins walk to reach there from train station ran out of time had to return. The lakes are beautiful though and there are the occasional pretty tropical flowers along the way. They've imported some tree species which was interesting and didn't see entire garden to be fair.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Taking the winding paths though the multiple sections of this garden is an incomparable experience. From the incredible scents of the gardenias and magnolias to the healing powers in the healing garden it is amazing every time I go. The swans on the lake and the aunties and uncles practicing Tai Chi. The garden's , a Unesco site, are a must see for everyone. Don't forget your camera!"
,,Beautiful and unforgettable,5.0,,"It is one of the best things about Singapore. Each time I came to Singapore, I made sure I have a walk there. Orchard garden is very beautiful."

A top Singapore attraction...,5.0,,"Whether you want to experience the best and most exotic flora and fauna from Asia or give your kids a crush course on nature or simply have a serene, romantic walk with your partner, Botanic Gardens is the place to visit. Beautifully landscaped and sensibly designed with many comfortable walkways around the garden for visitors it provides a perfect weekend spot for family and friends to relax and recharge. The Orchid Garden must be the biggest in its kind in the world and definitely the jewel of SBG with its huge variety of orchids many of which I had no idea of. If you live in Singapore or just visiting Singapore, Botanic Gardens is a venue you can always enjoy for a day outdoors."
,,Beautiful Sunday Morning Hike at Singapore Botanic Garden,5.0,,"What better way to spend a beautiful sunday morning than a hike with buddies in this UNESCO garden? There are many trails to follow pending on interest and time.

We started from Bukit Timah entrance near to MRT station and ended at Tanglin Gate. Of the many gardens we passed, special mentions are the Evolution and Healing Gardens of high educational values. The former traces life from the very beginning to present stage while the latter displays an eye-opening showcase of variety of common herbs with medicinal uses for different parts of our body.

Have a picnic at the Palm Valley is a perfect way to end the hike!"
,,Nature in the city,5.0,,Great place to enjoy the flora. Recently awarded World Heritage. Must take a walk and experience the nature in Singapore. Near to great shopping and eating places. Perfect for a day to chill and relax.
,,Serene calmness,4.0,,"Nice place to visit to get a calm and peaceful outing with your family. Provides multiple stops for a good photo opportunity.

It is a place where you can relax away from the device driven madness of our day to day life, spending time with kids."

,,Special,5.0,,"A beautiful and tranquil place in a busy city. It's easily accessible by MRT. The Botanic Gardens are well designed with interesting smaller themed gardens within its boundaries. The National Orchard Garden is an exceptional place in the Gardens, well worth the small fee.
If you go to Singapore don't miss it."
,,Nice to find so much green in a busy city.,4.0,,This place is huge. Is really nice to be in nature when you are in a busy city. But can be pretty warm so plan your time there.
,,A long walk,5.0,,"A long, romantic walk. Such a beautiful place that is well kept. Just watch out for mozzies! Perfect for picnics too! Just don't forget to clean up after yourself."
,,Tranquil serene peaceful garden,5.0,,"It is a very beautiful and big garden with lots of trees, flowers, with an Orchid garden, rose garden and big wide pond with lots of fishers and a couple of swans with wooden chairs for you to enjoy the peaceful environment and relax. It is such a wonderful place that has become one of the Unesco heritage side. It is very suitable for a good weekend family outing, there are also restaurants and shops where you can eat and shop, tourists who come to Singapore is a must visit, and a very good reason to visit is because it is free. Have a wonderful and memorable time everyone."
,,Expect the unexpected,4.0,,"Got off the MRT at Botanic gardens, wasnt quite sure where to turn, so took a right turn and had quite a surprise when we got pleasantly lost in botanic gardens. An accidental visit turned out to be quite a good one after all. Lots of grass for frisbee throwing, football playing (for young children), badminton challenges amongst kids and adults alike, etc. saw many people walking their dogs and picking up after them too. It was a nice environment to see people enjoying themselves despite the humidity. Many shady areas for joggers and brisk walkers who need breaks. A bit of a problem would be the distance between toilets. So stop and go whenever you see a toilet because you wont know where the next one will be. Bring water and caps if you intend to stay long.
There are eateries within the park but it can be a little pricey, depemding on what you order. So if you can be bothered, bring and pack your own picnic. Great picnic spots all around. More than enough space for everyone.
Wear comfortable footwear and start exploring the variety of plants there. If you're lucky enough to spot chickens, squirrels, or snakes (I'm kidding!), stop and take a photo. Enjoy the serenity of the place. Nice to stop and smell the grass in the midst of our hustle and bustle. Have fun!"
,,Fantastic Place,5.0,,Well worth a visit. Beautiful setting which is relaxing and spiritual. It's a place where you could 'while away the hours'. The orchid garden is absolutely wonderful - I couldn't stop taking photos of the gorgeous flowers - such beauty. The minor charge of 5 Singapore dollars to gain access to the orchid garden is well worth it. Really pleased we went - it's a memory that will stay with me.
,,Peaceful oasis in Singapore,5.0,,"I read rave reviews about the botanic gardens and went to check out during my Singapore trip. The gardens are indeed very beautiful. My two cents will be, plan to spend a little longer - nature is much appreciated without haste.
I spent a little longer than three hours and enjoyed my time there. Also, Orchid garden was totally worth visiting. Orchids were beautiful. You might say why not many places sharing information on different kinds of orchids or plants. But I liked the minimalist approach and rather having the opportunity to just enjoy nature."
,,Excellent,4.0,,"Whole Singapore is green, but the Botanical Garden, at the very heart of the city is greener! Given the size of Singapore, the Botanical Garden covers a huge area and very well maintained, nice place to spend few hours easily."
,,MOST BEAUTIFUL GARDEN,5.0,,My visit to the Singapore Botanical Gardens just happened to be a night with a performance by the Singapore Philharmonic Orchestra. Families and children very orderly and listening to the amazing sounds from the gem of the country. I continued my visit and walked every manicured corner of the gardens. Everyone coming to Singapore must visit!
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Lovely experience. The place looked amazing. Loved the orchid section. Well cared for, so close to city central yet felt very calm and quiet."
,,Great Place To Walk For Two Hours,5.0,,"I went to Singapore on business in June 2016 for two weeks. I visited the Singapore Botanic Gardens twice. It is a great place to walk. Full of paths, lakes, plants and gardens, a very nice visitor center. It is near the MRT which is convenient. The only challenge is the hot weather in Singapore. I was soaking wet from perspiration. But this place is a must see. I can also share from a past business trip that in December they had a special exhibit of Christmas tree ornaments from around the world."
,,A nice place for morning exercise and picnic.,4.0,,"This garden is big and filled with different species of plants. They have herb and healing garden which features herbs that have healing properties. The garden is well-maintained, walking track is clear of falling leaves, good for jogging.

There are 2 ponds inside the garden where you can watch swans swimming on it, while you are having a picnic at the empty grass patch. A good place to have a picnic, as it is quite shady. At night, the garden is well-lit so you can even have a picnic in the evening if you feel that afternoon is still too hot for you."
,,Green escape,4.0,,"Nice and rare to have such a green area in a big urban city like Singapore. We can walk, play, relax and eat there Perfect for family and kids with their water playground"
,,Lovely day in the sun,4.0,,"If in Singapore I would advise visiting the botanic gardens. There is a great variety of flowers and plants in the gardens and some lovely walks to take around. Like everything in Singapore, the gardens are pristinely maintained and a walk around them is very serene.

The National Orchid Garden costs to enter but it is the highlight of the trip, so it is worth the entry fee"
,,A must see for keen gardeners,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are absolutely magnificent. I visit there every time I go to Singapore. However, put on your walking shoes because the gardens are very big and you need to walk to various attractions within the gardens.
Access to the gardens was easy. We took the train and the train stopped at the gardens, we exited just inside the main fence.
A favourite for me is the orchid garden. There are plenty of signs around showing the directions. The orchids are 1.2 Km walk within the gardens, from the station, and all the signage shows how many more metres you need to walk until you get there. Being somewhat older, it took us quite some time to walk to the orchids and we were very tired when we had finished seeing what we wanted so we took a taxi back to the hotel. The taxis are not expensive. There are a couple of eating places with the gardens, which were reasonably priced. There are other attractions, but the orchids took up so much of our time, we did not see much else. We had a great day."
,,Fantastic variety and beautifully designed,5.0,,Worth spending a full day there.You need to have a good pair of walking shoes with you .Many visitors we saw had taken their dogs (on a leash )with them.
,,Calm and green place in the city,4.0,,The botanic garden is located in the city. This is a calm and green place for chilling after a bussy day.
,,"A Beautiful, Well-manicured, Hot and Humid Walk in the Park",4.0,,"Botanic Gardens is almost perfect if you can make it there before 7am. The crowds have yet to gather fully and the weather hasn't really heated up. It's a tranquil and peaceful respite from consumer-oriented Singapore, except for the occasional tinny music of early morning Chinese exercise classes. Later, however, the park is filled with training tai-tais, pokemon-go hunters and treking tourists, all sweating from the heat. It's still beautiful, but not as inspiring. Go early, if you can!"
,,UNESCO World Heritage Site,5.0,,"More than 10,000 species of flora is spread over its 82-hectares area, which is stretched vertically; the longest distance between the northern and southern ends is 2.5 km (1.6 mi). It is certainly worth your visit if you are in Singapore."
,,Orchid garden is worth a visit,4.0,,Not as colourful as gardens in Europe or North America but the gardens are worth a visit just to see the orchid display.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,We had lovely time with flora and fauna around us..Our daughter loved having her breakfast sitting inbetween pegions and watching ducks walking close to her...Wonderful experience☺ Rituparna Arora
,,One of the best in the world,4.0,,"For those visiting Singapore either for pleasure or on business, the Singapore Botanic Gardens is a great place to de-stress or cure your jetlag - go and jig or just brisk walk among the greenery. The peace and quiet is soothing to the mind and body. It is walking distance from the Orchard Road area.

For those coming from temperate climates, be prepared for the humidity though. Clean restrooms. Good eating places inside. Go there on a Sunday afternoon. There is usually a concert or some cultural performance and show. Bring a picnic mat, a bottle of wine and cheese and you are all set.

My only wish is for the Garden tomhave an area dedicated to fruit bearing trees in the region."
,,You Really Must,5.0,,"We arrived quite early in the morning at the entrance where we enjoyed a morning coffee to the soothing sounds of water from the nearby fountains. Whilst not a large garden it is well worth a visit to take in the tropical plants and flowers before the sun gets too high and the heat sets in. Do visit the orchid garden, just spectacular and the ginger plant display is excellent too. There are a couple of stylish eateries here so you can enjoy a drink, breakfast or lunch. The gardens are a popular haunt for Singapore's expats pushing prams, walking the dog or practising yoga. Also ran into a few large lizards sunning themselves as well as tortoises, fish and swans in the ponds. A very pleasant place to spend a morning."
,,Wonderful place,4.0,,"Easy to reach from city centre,cheap taxi ride.Wonderful world of orchids and many other exotic plants.Well maintained and very relaxing."
,,One of the best places to go for morning exercise in Singapore.,5.0,,"I am a senior Singaporean. Our Botanical Garden is well known to all Singapore citizens and many tourists. You can read about it in the websites,

What I want to share is my personal review. Many locals who are well or not so well in health will choose to go to this Garden for morning walks, jog to,exercise. Reason is that not only the place is well maintained, the air here is cleaner.

If you are there early between 6 to 9 am ( opening hours is 5 am to 12 midnight) you can see many small groups of people doing various group exercises like line-dancing and tai chi.

Individuals are there too with many taking along their dogs to walk. It is a wonderful atmosphere.

Directions signages are clear. Toilets are clean and drinking water are available. You don't need to spend any money while inside this Garden as admission is free.

There is a restaurant and other food outlets if you are hungry though.

Late evening are visited mainly by romantic couples who spend their private moments under the trees.

If you are a tourist and have a free morning especially in weekends do spend an hour or two there."
,,Great! Very nice,4.0,,"We made a nice walk through the gardens. Nice flowers an trees, its definitely a must see in the great city singapore."
,,Great place for a morning exercise,5.0,,"Very good location, just a couple of minutes walk from Orchard road. I used to have my morning run in this garden, just as it was getting light. A few people was also out enjoying the sunrise and listening to the wildlife , birds, that lives there.
Not to be missed!"
,,First time visiting Botanic Garden,5.0,,"This is my first time visiting the Botanic Garden, nice and wonderful place to walk and enjoy the beautiful garden and people around were friendly.
You have to visit the place since it is easy to excess with the MRT and free of charge to visit the place.
So go for it...Cheers"
,,Peaceful oasis in the city,5.0,,The gardens were very tranquil and large. Need to stay at least 2 – 3 hours to appreciate all the various varieties and quiet locations away from the city traffic. Very close to the bus stop. Metro stop is quite a distance from the entrance.
,,What You Need To Know About The Botanic Gardens.,5.0,,"One of only 2 natural gardens in the world (the other being Rio). These gardens are what's left of the jungle. The city was built around them.

A magnificent gardens about 5km from the heart of the city, they are full of amazing orchids and plants. Even several large goannas are worthy of a photo as they dig for grubs. It can be a bit hot and sticky, but have plenty of space. Unlike Gardens at the Bay, which has nice cool domes, but too many crowds doing selfies."
,,Very very special place,5.0,,"I have lived nearby the Botanic Gardens for 30 years and never get tired of walking there. A few tips : go in the early morning or after 5pm when the sun is not so hot. If going to the orchid garden, check the closing time to avoid disappointment. I think last entry is 6pm but am not sure. If you have kids under 8 yrs old you must visit the Jacob ballad children's garden. It has a treehouse and water play. Last entry 6:30 I think ...Bring dry spares. Take care that you use the Bukit tima road entrance as the children's garden is a Long walk from the main entrance. Ask a taxi driver to take you there / or take the mrt to Botanic Gardens as the mrt station is on that side. Lastly the Botanic Gardens is free. Only the orchid enclosure charges. Children garden is also free.

If you have done the Botanic Gardens , also try MacRitchie Reservoir or the Bukit tima nature reserve. The latter is only open sat/sun Til end 2016 as they are doing repairs. The nature reserve is very special but the hiking trails are a bit steep. Lots of monkeys...enjoy!"
,,Amazing landscapes in winter,5.0,,"Tropical forest, tropical sounds and smells, amazing flowers, colonial glimpses. Magic if visited in the right season."
,,Great day free,5.0,,"Spent lovely day wandering around great, good value , places to eat not too expensive, we visited last december good mrt connections"
,,"Free, peaceful and very nice",5.0,,"Nice place to walk, rest, relax, picnic, play or just admire the nature. Free admision. Huge park. With a peace of tropical rainforest"
,,Tranquility,5.0,,"The Singapore botanical garden is in the heart of the city. However, once inside the feeling is one of being away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
There is a wide variety of plants and trees and flowers and the good part is the detailed information that is provided.
As a family we truly enjoyed visiting the botanical Gardens and plan to visit again in the near future."
,,/green mind,4.0,,"ok la. good place to relax. see greenery. near to orchard road. good eatery in that area. recommend to have breakfast in the morning to enjoy the morning scene. try avoid hot afternoon which has 50% chance of rain to accompany. Cheers, and enjoy"
,,peace and tranquility in central Singapore,5.0,,A great place to go to relax and unwind . One of the most beautiful Botanic Gardens in the world . there are lots of activities in the gardens including a children's playground and sometimes musical events. Or you can just take a picnic and chill out on a Sunday
,,Beautiful scenery and peaceful walks,5.0,,"This is a great place for a picnic or a leisurely stroll through the lovely manicured gardens, or through the preserved rain forest trails.

There are many signs giving details of the flora that you can see along the way, and there are opportunities to feed the large fish that swim in the ponds. If you are lucky, you may also see a monitor lizard or two swimming or walking around the grounds.

Easy to get to by MRT or Taxi, and great for a family activity - highly recommended"
,,The best orchids ever,5.0,,If you want to see the best orchids ever this is a must do. The entire ground of the gardens is beautiful.
,,Walk into Nature - have a DSLR Camera ready,5.0,,"The Botanic Garden is a great place to spend the day. bring along a camera to capture the great variety of flora that exists. Bring the kids for a run, allowing them to appreciate the nature more in a garden city."
,,First visit to the Botanical Gardens,5.0,,My wife finally was able to join me during a business visit to Singapore and we made a visit to the Botanical Garden on the weekend. My wife was impressed with the orchids and Komodo Dragons. After so many visits to Singapore all it took was my wife to be with me to experience what was close by and never visited. I highly recommend a visit to the Botanical Gardens of SG with a stop for lunch in the Halia Restaurant for a quick bite to eat as it will take hours to see it all.
,,Love these gardens- free entry,5.0,,"We spent 3 .5 hours walking around these gardens and still did not see all of it.
temp 33+ make sure you take plenty of water, there are drinking fountains next to toilets and restaurants, also small snack shops around the gardens.
We took a taxi to the garden which only cost us 6 dollars we also took a taxi to return back to our hotel, the heat can make you very tired and we wanted to save our energy for the walk.
we paid 5 dollars each to go into the Orchid garden well worth the money.
would recommend this garden to all"
,,BEAUTIFUL!,5.0,,It is a perfect way to get out of the modern city and enjoy nature like it is used to be. It is a nice place to go for a walk and for some extra money you can go inside of the domes for even better nature or flowers to see. The park itself is free of charge
,,Could spend all day here!,4.0,,"If you want a relaxing day in Singapore, then head to the Botanic Garden. There's so much to see and do, that you could easily spend a whole day there. Thankfully there's plenty of places to sit and relax if it's too hot and humid. I'd suggest finding a quiet spot in the shade to just sit back and take it all in for awhile! Definitely worth the visit!"
,,Beautiful peaceful park in a busy city,5.0,,"My husband and I visited here, we thought to spend a morning but enjoyed the whole gardens including a visit to the Orchid Gardens, we ended up staying the day. Definitely well worth a visit. Free to go in the gardens, 5$ each to go in the orchid gardens."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Very beautiful gardens with plenty kinds of plants and flowers! The concert area in the middle of the Botanic Gardens is an exceptional idea! Try to visit them in a cloudy and not very hot day because the humidity is very high and it will be very difficult to stay for a long time.
,,Delightful oasis in busy city,5.0,,"Wonderful gardens that are beautifully maintained and free to enter (you have to pay a small amount for the orchids garden though, but we'll worth it)"
,,A lush tropical garden,4.0,,"This is steamy humid Singapore so plan your visit well in order to enjoy this very large tropical garden. A visit in the late afternoon or early morning is probably best. Set aside more than 2 hours if you want to see it all (and there is a lot to cover).

The gardens can largely be divided into 2 halves:

1. The original gardens next to embassy row on Napier Road where you enter by the Tanglin Gate. There's massive construction going on outside for an extension of the MRT system so the approach to this side of the gardens is likely to be marred by ugliness some some years. But do persist as the older part of the gardens have a lush mature feel you don't get in the other half.

Here you will find swan lake, the rainforest garden, the WWII POW brick steps, symphony park (where there are occasional public concerts) and the ginger garden.

The National Orchid Garden - the only fee paying part of the gardens are located here as well.

2. The newer half has entrances at Cluny Gate (conveniently next to the Botanic Gardens MRT station) and if you are driving or taking a taxi, at Nassim Gate.

This half feels more manicured. The highlights for me were the healing and fragrant gardens and the Jacob Ballas children's garden with its fountains.

At the weekends, the park is a popular spot for picnics and a meeting point for many of Singapore's domestic helper population.

One thing could be improved - the casual family style cafes are somewhat basic and spaced quite far apart. There are vending machines for drinks located around the park but not many so bring some bottled water with you.

There are a few upscale restaurants located within the park for those who want to indulge - I think these are mainly dinner rather than lunch options."
,,A gem within the city - and its free!,5.0,,"Spent a lovely afternoon here. Tons to see, just make sure you've got your walking shoes on! The gardens are really pretty and the map is helpful in deciding which bits to visit first. The restaurants are actually really decent too!

We paid to go inside the orchid garden, and for $5 it was worth it. The gardens are beautiful and saw lots of flowers I'd not seen before.

Definitely worth a visit here. There are families, runners, dogs, and people finding a quite spot to enjoy their book. It's a lovely atmosphere."
,,Worth a visit with the kids,4.0,,"Good for taking children who need to run off excess energy - we took my cousin's son who was the example of this, while we walked and talked in eye & ear shot. Beautiful flowers and sculptures. Free unless you pay to go into a special exhibition - they had an orchid exhibition when we were there in July 2016 but we didn't pay to go in."
,,I never knew that a Botanic garden can be so pleasurable,5.0,,"Fascinatingly beautiful place to walk and see different habitats. The park itself is free, the orchid garden cost $5. However, if you want to see orchids, Gardens by the Bay are a better place. Take water bottles with you. You can fill them at water fountains."
,,Bonsai Display,5.0,,"I can go here on most days and it is still peacefil and uncrowded. An amazing bonsai display (almost a national treasure). The walk up the Pagoda is meditive. If you're in S/pore, make an effort to see this joint."
,,The best place in Singapore,5.0,,"Stunning place with something new at every corner! Beautifully laid out and a pleasurable day out with friends, visitors or by yourself. I love the Bonsai Trees and Swan Lake."
,,"Great Gardens, Best Orchids Display in the World?",5.0,,"Absolutely marvelous gardens and park setting. One could spend hours wondering this beautiful area. Unfortunately I had only 2-3 hours at the end of a long day, but the impression the gardens left me will stay forever. The orchids portion of the park was splendid, with hundreds of varietals of all sizes and colors. And while the entire park was worth the visit, this area was the best in my book... And I would be surprised if any location around the world had a better orchids display. Can't wait to go back.... Not sure when, but I will..."
,,Join the guided tours on Saturdays,4.0,,"We joined one of the free tours Saturday morning (the heritage tour). We were met with heavy rain so the tour started inside, and when the rain cleared we walked a little around the gardens. The guide was terrific, knowledgeable and a great communicator.

We walked some other parts of the botanical garden afterwards on our own. It is great!"
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Always enjoy visiting here and the Orchid Garden. Updates taking place to Dell area restricted some access but so easy to get around. be prepared for lots of time and walking.
,,Great Experience - And Free!,5.0,,"This was n to the first time at the Botanical Gardens and I'll go again. On a very busy Sunday afternoon, there were still quiet oases where there was simply no-one at all (try the rainforest walk and keep you eyes open for the monitor lizards!).

It's an easy walk from the corner of Orchard Road and Scotts Road and takes about 30 minutes at a steady pace. It is reasonably flat too.

The frangipani garden is worth a special trip, if only for the lovely seated swings you can take a quiet break in. I also enjoyed a drink at Casa Verde, where you can watch the world go by."
,,"Beautiful, worth the visit, larger than you would expect",5.0,,"The gardens are massive. Bring good walking shoes and an umbrella to shield from rain and/or blazing heat - and water.
We saw many iguanas eating in the bushes. Several fish and turtles plus the amazing lush forests and delicate flowers.
We paid $5 to enter the orchid garden - very interesting and worth it.
Note there are several entrances to the park, one right beside MRT stop.
It's much larger than we anticipated. We walked around for 2 hours and only saw half the garden.
Serene and beautiful."
,,Great place to go for a walk...,5.0,,We went to the gardens for walks early morning or late evening. It is a garden in a tropical paradise. An amazing park with so much tropical plants
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Arrived in a huge downpour but continued to look around and it was so worth it! Rain didn't last long. Even if you are not a gardener it is still worthwhile to take a walk through here.
Costs to view the orchid garden which was impressive."
,,World class and free,5.0,,This is definitely worth a visit. We spent 2 hours here. It is on a par with other gardens and is free. Easy to get to on the MRT and well organised. Used for running as well. It has something for the specialist and also for general visitors. Bring mosquito spray with you.
,,Beautiful Garden !!,3.0,,"This place doesn't really say anything for me but the huge variety of plans and what nature can really offer us is amazing!!
Place is so clean and everything in order explaining to you each tree what it is and why is used for!!

,,A fine way of spending a few hours.,4.0,,Beautiful gardens with lakes and the chance of spotting monitor lizards and other wildlife. An oasis of calm in a busy city. On the metro too.
,,Must Visi for nature lovers,4.0,,Its a half day activity and nature lovers will be delighted. There are themed subsections in the Gardens. Family with kids should be aware that we need to walk a lot.
,,Great Greenery,5.0,,Really a forest in the middle of the city. Lot of picturesque spot there. Orchid garden has lot to see and boon to eyes. Better avoid noon time.
,,Cozy beautiful gardens,4.0,,"The UNESCO heritage site is quite good for a nice stroll or listening a symphony at the Shaw Symphony Center. It is good place for a romantic stroll, photography, photoshoot, and I heard the fine dining is pretty good too."
,,Gorgeous gardens,5.0,,"One of the best botanic gardens we've been to -- can't believe it's free. Very easy to get to via MRT as there is a station just outside the entrance. It's really well organized and meticulously maintained. The National Orchid Garden is located within the Singapore Botanic Garden, and requires a ticket which you purchase at the entrance. We really enjoyed the evolution walk, which is supposed to recreate vegetation during different evolutionary periods of time. There is an overwhelming number of orchid varieties. The kids enjoyed it as much as the adults did in our group. Might be a good idea to bring snacks and water, as well as hats and sunscreen if it's a hot day."
,,Huge,5.0,,"Get some good walking shoes and bring plenty of water! You'll want to keep wandering and exploring the Botanic Gardens. Very pretty, a great free activity. $5 entry to get into the Orchid gardens is definitely worth it."
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"This must be one of my favourite places in Singapore. The gardens cover large area with great variety of plants. There are ""themed"" areas, for example ""Evolution Garden"" which shows gradual evolution of plants on earth. One of the main attractions is ""National Orchids Garden"" which contains huge collection of, yes you guessed it, orchids. This is the only area where one pays a fee to get into it. At the time of my visit the fee was $5 for adults and children below 13 were admitted free of charge. The orchids are a main attraction so it can get crowded. I would suggest an early morning as the best time of day to visit it. The gardens were opened from 5am but Orchid Gardens were closed until 8am."
,,A walk in the park,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are free, and offer a great way to just relax in natural surroundings. A great place if you want to take a run, or a leisurely stroll amongst the thousands of species of plants."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Stopped off here as part of the fun vee city tour and hadn't read much about it but were absolutely delighted we did! The gardens are beautifully maintained and very varied. They are free to enter (apart from the orchids) and we'll shaded. The gardens are a great way to relax and take a break from the city. We spent about 2.5 hours walking around and loved every minute. There is lots of information on the plants which was useful for us as we are not keen gardeners. Would definitely recommend a stop here. It is a way out of the city but as it's on the sighseeing route for the busses, it's simple to get to."
,,So lovely,5.0,,"What a great experience, so many plants, trees and orchids and its enormous. You only pay to enter the orchid garden if you want for $5 each. Bring a camera and cash for food and drinks"
,,Nice gardens,5.0,,"Even though it's usually a little hot & humid for walking about these gardens are worth it! Nicely laid out and the Orchid garden (modest entry fee) is definitely worth a visit, plus you get to have a cool off in the temperate house 😄"
,,An oasis in Singapore,4.0,,"A greenery
in the middle of Singapore which offers an escape from the busy city.

Worth visiting if you like plants or flowers, or if you just want to see something else than concrete or marble. The area is well laid out with plenty of maps and displays around to inform about the garden and its plants.

The orchid garden is very interesting and is a must to be seen."
,,A peaceful place,5.0,,The garden is well located. Near the paradise of shopping. There few hundreds type of flowers to enjoy looking at. Is a nice place to jog around. Yoga training. Peaceful picnic with your kids or love ones. Fret not. There's a circle line locate near to it. So it is easy to reach.
,,Simply lovely,5.0,,"Singapore is a future city today. The gardens are established and mature and impeccably groomed. We were lucky enough to see a musical event the day we visited and despite being very busy everyone seem very chilled and relaxed, most likely due to the lovely natural surrounding.

Some excellent food to be had there also - hunt around and try the Italian. Was great!"
,,Well maintaned,5.0,,Very good place to have morning jog and photography. You no need to bring your own water as water dispensers are easily found.
,,Good Attraction,5.0,,It is a must go for those who loves the environment. Prepare for lots of walking and picnicing. Bring along umbrella and mineral water. Place is close to mrt and orchard road.
,,Carol Avilla,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens are the best garden(s) that I have ever seen! The gardens were established in the late 1800's, and the rich history of orchid propagation is preserved through the exhibits. The Singapore Botanical Garden is much more than the sum of its orchids. There are countless varieties of other flowers to see. I happily spent 4 hours sinking in the beauty of this world class garden!"
,,A pleasant walk,4.0,,"This was a pleasant hour or so, but would advise coming in the cool of the morning or early evening. The highlight was to be able to go to the Orchid Garden."
,,Great place to relax,5.0,,"Plan to spend around half a day here. It is a wonderful botanic park. Expect to walk about a fair bit so bring comfortable shoes. Due to the humidity, bring plenty of water also."
,,Serene and beautiful,5.0,,"A terrific place to visit whilst coping with jet lag. Beautifully presented, lots of shade and capacity for resting to eat and drink. The orchid gardens are a must. They cost $5 per adult, with payment by cash only.
Easy to access by public transport, but make sure you have correct change if catching a bus.
Check for concert presentations at the outdoor autitorium as this would be a real treat."
,,Wonderful place with gorgeous flowers,5.0,,You can spend a whole day at the botanical gardens...with great pleasure...you have so many plants and places to discover and admire...It 's a real pleasure for the eyes...and if you're tired you can rest in the shade ..or have a nice meal at the restaurant..or have an ice cream...there are so many flowers and orchids and all the botanical garden is just a wonderful place .It's free except if you want to visit the orchid garden but it's worth it...
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,It's probably one of the placed you'd not go when you come over the first time but it's definitely worth the visit. Get out of the busy city center and spend a few hours in the gardens. Both grown and kids will enjoy this place. The Orchid garden is also definitely worth visiting.
,,Love this place,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are now UNESCO recognised and will be expanded because of it. Many of the trees inside are older than Singapore (the Republic) and have great significance to the economic rise of Malaysia and Singapore as the British experimented with different plants and trees here for cultivation. It is free to the public except for some portions like the Orchid Garden and has excellent restaurants and cafes within its huge compound. It is also dog friendly and there are always new sections that you can visit to take it all in.
,,Its Free yes Free,5.0,,"Wow all this space to walk around in a major city and its free, all you have to pay for is entrance to the Orchid Garden. We did not have much time to do it justice as our main goal was to see the Orchid Gardens and then on into town. Its well layed out and easy to get around even with buggies or wheel chairs."
,,Lovely gardens for morning strolls,5.0,,Beautiful gardens with a lake and performance stage. It's best to go early in the morning and evening when it is not so hot. Look out for the weekend evening concerts.
,,A world class garden full of beauty and energy.,5.0,,"This garden is so well taken care of, and they always add interesting features. Go in the morning to feel the energy of the early runners."
,,Relaxing place,5.0,,This olace is good for jogging in the morning. Good for breath taking and relaxing. This place is near with Gleneagles Medical Centre
,,Orchid Awesomeness,5.0,,"Loved!!! the free tour on a Saturday where we got to see all the orchids We were toured around by a special guide who offered all kinds of wonderful information and answered all of our questions with a smile. We really learned a lot about orchids, not only their beauty, but their ability to express sentiment and to be a part of the culture here in Singapore. Can't wait to return on another day for another tour of the rainforest or similar area. The botanic gardens here are likely some of the most spectacular ever. We feel so blessed to have been able to visit. You will enjoy your trip here, finding out there are tens of thousands of orchids in the world, and thousands of different palm trees as well. This is an eye-opening experience, and quite a wonderful way to get to know the beauty and the grandeur of nature. Bring bottled water, your camera, a sun hat, maybe a hand fan, umbrella, and wear comfy walking shoes. Consider having lunch at the gardens afterward."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful, clean, well kept I ould go on forever. One of my highlights tof my visit to Singapore. The only dissapointment was I never had long enough to look around the whole of the Gardens. This probably needs to be done overa 2 day period has it is very tiring in the heat. It covers a huge area with the most beautiful trees and a lot of them brought in from other countries. A lovely lake with swans and Turtles. A must to see"
,,Peaceful Place in the Midst of a Bustling City,5.0,,I had the pleasure of walking to work through the Botanic Gardens most mornings while I lived in Singapore and have found it is one of the things/experiences that I miss the most about Singapore. The gardens are beautifully manicured with well marked trails and paths taking you through a variety of different sections of the park. The free concerts on weekends were also great family events to take a picnic and relax to some great performances. I really found the gardens to be incredibly peaceful and calming amidst the hustle of the city. I would encourage any tourist or long-term visitor to take advantage of enjoying the Botanic Gardens. I can also recommend Food for Thought as a great place to grab a coffee or quick bite to eat.
,,Beautiful~,5.0,,"Walking into this place was extremely beautiful, such a huge botanic gardens and amazing walk throughout. My favourite was the bonsai garden, so much beauty and thought was taken into setting this place up for public. Truly feels like bliss."
,,Jacob Ballas Children's Garden,4.0,,"Took my 1yr old here on our recent holiday in Singapore. Took the MRT but because of garden upgrades, signs to the children's garden were not clear and we ended up walking around for a long time before finding it!

Lovely, clean, well thought out garden and play space for children. Compared to children's play garden at Marina Bay Gardens, it is looking a little old (but am assuming the upgrade and expansion will change this)!

Highlight- definitely the water play area after the long, humid walk getting there!!"
,,Beautiful Oasis In The Middle Of The City,5.0,,"From those who love nature, come visit this place as I really recommend itnand its free. Very big place to walk around and tiring for sure, but definitely worth it. You also can visit the Orchid Garden but have to pay for it. You will experince the oohing and the aahing when coming here. After walking under the sun, you can go to Orchard for cooling down. Its only few mins by bus and then enjoy your shopping :)"
,,The orchid garden really is a small miracle,5.0,,"Thousands of orchids, including some mountain sorts (in glass house to keep the temperature down), wonderful place to visit, well worth it!"
,,Loved it! Free attraction,5.0,,"Had a great time visiting the Botanic garden. After quite a bit of travelling, I was looking for free activities to do in Singapore. This did not disappoint. The beauty of the gardens is stunning. A great place to visit, walk, people watch, have a picnic, watch people taking wedding photos and also pop along to the Orchid Garden - this has to be paid for, but was only about $5 from what I remember. There is also a shop inside which is great for souvenirs.

So many colours, flowers. Just beautiful"
,,Needed this place.,5.0,,"I really needed this wonderful green osia , sometimes Singapore and the crowds get to much and one needs to just have some space, this is the place for it. So easy to get to and from, the restaurants are great, the feeling is great and one comes away from the Gardens feeling great. Just great, what more does one need."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,4.0,,A beautiful place that anyone visiting Singapore should really go. A must-go for all natural lovers. Easily accessible with the MRT station right next to it.
,,Lovely visit,5.0,,The gardens were beautiful and immaculate well worth a days visit. There is so much to see in these wonderful gardens and the orchid garden is a must.
,,Great place for a workout and a run.,5.0,,With plenty of hills and stairs it's a great place to burn off some steam. Good tracks for flat or hill running. And can run for km with nice varying views.
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"A nice morning spent away from busy city. The entry is free, you only have to pay to go into orchid gardens."
,,Botanic Gardens of Singapore,5.0,,Not as famous but just as spectacular as gardens by the bay in different ways mainly due to the World Heritage Orchids. New visitor centre opening soon.
,,nice park,5.0,,perfect place to go...nice view..clean and safe to walk anywhere..nice food..nice market for shopping..lots of museum and temple...
,,Good visit,5.0,,"I've been to Singapore a number of times but never had chance to get to the Botanic Gardens, so I made the effort this time and it was well worth it. Firstly the gardens are free entry (apart from the Orchid section which is an affordable $5 if you want to see it. This is great nowadays especially in somewhere like Singapore which can be very expensive. The gardens themselves cover a large area and whilst not heavily populated with lots of bright coloured flowers as I'm used to in European gardens, they still have very beautiful greenery with multiple trees, shrubs and plants creating a very tranquil feel. There are areas of lakes/water and the whole experience was very relaxing. Despite a lot of visitors it's big enough not to feel busy or crowded. You could easily walk for hours around the place, but don't forget your suncream. As you would expect it's very hot! Access is easy, either walking from Orchard area, by taxi or via Botanic Gardens MRT (underground) station very close by."
,,Top spot in Singapore,4.0,,"We decided to visit the Botanic Gardens and did not really know what to expect. It was a hot day and we were gals to see plenty of shade on the way round. The helpful guide at the entrance gave us a map and some useful tips on how long to allow to visit the various parts of the gardens. We decided to head straight to the Orchid Garden and to our surprise we were offered seniors discount making it only a couple of dollars each!! Once we got inside we were amazed at the orchid displays lining the pathways, the cold house, the bromeliad house, and the list goes on. The Orchid Garden is a first class attraction for Singapore and well worth the visit on its own.
As usual with Singapore the rest of he garden is beautifully laid out immaculate."
,,Beautiful. Well kept & serene,4.0,,"It didn't earn its UNESCO World Heritage award for nothing. I love the charm of this place

Thanks to the maintenance team who kept this place clean, safe and beautiful

Came here once on a weekday after the rain and it was the most perfect time for me to stroll and unwind with a good book in hand

Tourists can be sure that they won't get lost here as there are plenty of signage to show you to the right path"
,,A beautiful garden,5.0,,"The orchids in the botanical gardens are out of this world. There is a special area of them that have been developed for famous people who have visited ( posthumously in the case of Lady Diana) each of them being quite distinctive.
The gardens can be busy-we visited first thing in the morning when it was a bit cooler. The obligatory gift shop sells very different items, all orchid themed, quite expensive but good quality."
,,Great to walk around. Love the orchid garden.,5.0,,"We love to return to this place. Lovely walk around the gardens. The orchid garden at only 5 dollar ticket is worth visiting. One of the best attractions of Singapore, I think."
,,Huge Garden,4.0,,"This place is big and beautiful. However, advisable only if you love gardens as you would need to walk and walk."
,,Nice for a stroll,3.0,,Nothing outdoor will be fantastic with weather in Singapore. One moment high sun and the other rain. Bring both umbrella and drink lots of water. It will be a sweaty trip if in hot weather.
,,How is this free?,5.0,,"Away from the modern tall silver city be whisked away to paradise with flowers and animals who seemed to be enjoying the views as much as I was. Saw joggers, yoga classes and weddings but felt completely at peace. The orchid entry at $5 could be tripled I'd still be happy, I wish I had packed a lunch then I would stay the whole day."
,,Amazing Gardens,5.0,,"This is well worth a visit. For a start it's free and it is so tranquill you wouldn't know that you were in a bustling city, the plants and lakes are amazing and so well kept, even if you only visit for a hour its still worth going to."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"Although it is too hot for us to walk around but we managed to explore the whole garden. It is very clean & very green. you need to wear comfy shoes. This garden is located right at the train station so public transport is highly recommended, not many restaurant or take away shop around, make sure to eat first before heading here"
,,Really pretty,4.0,,This is a great place to come to escape the city. The gardens are huge with lots of mini gardens inside of it. It's lovely to just come here and sit on the grass with a picnic. Definitely recommended for a nice day if you have the time.

,,Lovely gardens- alot to walk around!,5.0,,"I spent a couple of hours here and thought it might be a good place to spend on a very hot day. It was however not as shaded as I thought it would have been. I viewed the Foliage Garden, Scented Gardens, Bamboo gardens and healing gardens.
It is a huge area, so bring comfortable shoes and sunscreen/ umbrella to keep out of the sun!"
,,small garden,2.0,,"Singapore Botanic Garden is a green and refreshing place in the city center, but too crowded on weekends."

,,Worth the walk,5.0,,"It is a huge park with beautiful landscape, very green and clean as well. Saw some people picnic there sat under the threes and bringing their own food. I walked about 700 / 900 m to the Orchid garden, its quit long walk but I enjoyed so much as the area very green and plenty thing to see. the Orchid garden itself also large area full of Orchid with the colors you might haven't seen anywhere before. The area are well organized, they provide site map for the visitor, free drink from the tab, toilet, souvenir shop also gazebo and restaurant inside the park. Easy access as you just stop at Botanical Garden MRT station and follow the sign."
,,a daytrip to remember,5.0,,"The gardens are free and you can easily spent half a day walking in them. From the woodlands border, you can take bus 710 (2,5rm). The park is a true beauty and the are also some free museums like the unesco or hetitage museum. Do eat at the food court at raffles building. The chicken rice set for only 5sd is delicious.
you only have to pay for the orchid garden (5sd) but it's totally worth it!"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Great places to wander. Tropical gardens amazing and great place for kids to run around! Hop on hop off bus yellow line.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"These gardens are extensive, serene and truly worth visiting. We spent about five hours there, including time in the orchid gardens. Even so, we didn't cover all areas."
,,UNESCO world heritage for a reason!,5.0,,"I believe this is one of the best attractions in Singapore, though its quiet and modesty - and location away from the CBD prevent it from being treasured as much as it should. Still the locals know it and visit often and there is always something interesting happening within the gardens. They have been renovated over the years and visiting it today is new and unique. One could walk around all day (but must take water for the heat!). Within the Botanic Gardens are the National Orchid Gardens and these are a must as well as the Ginger plants. Amazingly, all of this (except Orchids) are free to visit. Simply a beautiful and well worth braving the heat for a walk amongst this fascinating place."
,,Nice Gardens,3.0,,Nice Gardens but nothing special. Was once a large estate. Well kept but my main interest was visiting the orchid house.
,,Beautiful,3.0,,Just beautiful. Spent all day just wondering around in the gardens looking at all the flowers and plants. Wish I had of realised what it was like and would have taken a picnic and sat on the lawns at lunch time. It was just a peaceful relaxing experience.
,,Take your time,5.0,,This place is so well cared for. Didn't see it all-too humid. Make sure to go to the orchid garden. Well worth it. You could spend the whole day here and the food was good.
,,Romantic garden,5.0,,Places of nature always amuses us! Went to the botanic garden after a half day hiking and it's a nice place to relax at! Lots of things to look out for over there
,,Beautiful place to see many flowers and trees,5.0,,"This place offers few different theme gardens, including healing garden, children's garden, orchid garden, etc. Each garden is wonderfully maintained, it offers great view and pleasant walk even with hot weather. From end to end, it takes about at least 3-4 hours and I loved the variety of scenery each garden offered. This is a must place when you visit Singapore!"
,,there is a reason why those gardens are on UNESCO world heritage list,5.0,,"Another lovely park in Singapore, but be ready for a long walk. It is definitely worth visiting, nice and well looked after, some of its part have been left untouched like rain forest to show complex nature of it. If you are lucky you can spot turtle and monitor lizard.Entrance is free, the only place where you need to purchase ticket is Orchid garden."
,,Lovely to spend a day,4.0,,A very pleasant and well kept gardens that were a delight to walk around. Easily accessible using MRT. Wheelchair friendly and good restaurants. Worth a visit!

,,lovely greenspace in the middle of the city,5.0,,"plenty to see here in the gardens, amazing array of plants and attractions could easily spend a day meandering around, food onsite, toilets etc, also lots of lovely places to lie around and soak up the sun"
,,"Brilliant day out, wear comfy shoes and bring insect repellent",5.0,,"Brilliant day out, but depending on how much you like gardens might be worth choosing a few which you like the look of the most on a route. It's 2km from one end of the park to the other so quite a distance.

The orchid garden is a must visit!

It's handy they have free water refilling stations by every toilets. Although I would recommend buy spray especially when it comes to dusk"
,,A true gem not to be missed,5.0,,"This is a top class tropical botanical garden that is well kept, informative and a pleasure to walk thru, the closest rival to this garden is the one in Sri Lanka close to a town named kandy.
As the garden opens early go for a leisurely stroll or grab a coffee in the morning.
Be aware that the the midday sun may be very intense - so do come prepared with a hat,and plenty of water .
Also don't miss orchid house . Certainly the best in the world. As entrance to botanical gardens is free what more can I say?"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We enjoyed this lovely park a lot. Lots and lots of orchid-types, shade, ambiance... very relaxing. Even our two teenage boys ""endured"" the experience."
,,Best visited in the mornings,5.0,,"I visit the Botanic Gardens almost weekly. My favorite time to visit is in the early morning, between 7am to 9am, when it is relatively cool and quiet to enjoy the Gardens. Even the air is perfumed with the scents of flowers, plants and the trees.
Evenings starting from 6pm is great, too, but it does get dark around 7pm.

On weekends, there are many groups of people gathering to exercise (taichi, yoga, fitness circuits), jog or walk their pet dogs. There are many trails to explore and I frequently duck into one to enjoy the quietness and solitude (however long or short it may last, as the Garden is well visited by many).

There are a few restaurants and cafes in the Gardens, including one which recently won a Michelin star. For more wallet friendly fare, I enjoy going to Food for Thought, which is a great place to unwind over simple meals, and a great place for rain shelter.

This is a non smoking garden."
,,Beautiful gardens in a bustling city,5.0,,"Singapore is rightly proud of its Botanic Gardens, which are a World Heritage Site. Easy to access and beautifully maintained they are a real oasis of calm and well worth an hour or more to visit and just relax by one of the lakes, explore some of the themed areas or just stroll around."

,,The only nice place in Singapore,5.0,,"I am not a city person so this place was a great place to spend the day while doing a visa run from Bali. It is kind of like Singapore's version of central park in NY.

If I lived in Singapore I would go there as much as possible. It's free too, added bonus.

Bring a camera!"
,,Gorgeous Park,5.0,,An extremely well laid out park with many and varied attractions. Take plenty of fluids as it gets extremely hot and humid walking around.
,,Not so secret garden,4.0,,"If you're looking for some alone time or want to get a good space to have picnic with the family this is a good place. Some people also take a jog here as there are less people even on a weekend.

It can be pretty hot in the afternoon since it's still inside the city."
,,A fresh escape from the urban area,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic gardens is just a marvelous place if you need to escape from the great urban area of Singapore. A good place to take a walk or run for a while.

,,Outstanding Gardens,5.0,,"These gardens are an outstanding attraction.
They are extensive , beautifully cared for and a wonderful example of a tropical botanic garden.
The Orchid garden takes a small charge for entry but is also a must see.
It's a long walk from top to bottom by the time you wind your way through the various exhibits.
Take lots of time, lots of water and enjoy."
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Large and well maintained garden with food court and an orchid garden

,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,The gardens are absolutely beautiful and so well maintained. Put on your best walking shoes and grab a drink bottle before you go here as you will work up quite a sweat wandering round these amazing gardens. The national orchid garden has an entry fee of $5 per adult but I think it's well worth it. There's a huge array of orchids and the colour are just spectacular. Would definitely go again.
,,Botanical Garden,4.0,,"This 150 year old Garden has become an UNESCO Heritage Site since 2014 - the first in Asia! Even if you are a unsophisticated visitor on botany and horticultural issues you will enjoy a walk in this Garden. I love the Swan lake and this time I was lucky to spot a large lizard swimming in the lake together with the 2 white swans! . Although Singapore is very hot the walk under the canopy of many of large and many heritage trees will make it forget the heat. The walk will also lead you into the campus of the old Singapore University.

It's better to take the MRT to the Botanical Garden stop and start the walk to end up at the Tanglin Gate (which is actually the front entrance but there is lots of construction work there currently)"
,,Amazing Experience with Nature,5.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens is a loooooong stretch of nature park and gardens. You got to bring comfortable shoes and extra shirt. Sometimes it is humid so you may like to bring a fan or portable electric fan :-) What's also good is that there is no entrance fee! You just ride a taxi to the place. The place is so long there are 2 main gates so you have to decide where you want to go first. Inside it are variety of gardens and the National Orchid Garden. This one has an entrance fee (around SGD5 during my visit).

,,Oasis in the middle of the city,5.0,,"I have been to Singapore many times over the past 10yrs for some reason I never ventured to the botanical garden, but this time around my hotel was around the corner so all my morning walks was in the park. It was a great place to get you exercise and always something new to explore. Park is huge good to have some bearing of where you are going, had to guide one visitor to an exist after she was completely lost and was going in circles."
,,If you stay in Singapore longer than 2 days then it's a nice place to spend 3-4 hours,5.0,,"I usually visit Botanic Gardens on my first day when I arrive to a new city (if the place has a garden that is recommended for a visit). I 've been to many gardens around the world. Gardens in Singapore proudly hold number one spot on my list.
Of course it's Singapore so everything is perfectly organized. There are signs everywhere showing you with the detailed precision how many meters are from Point A to Point B. Greenery is beautiful, there are many different landscapes that open up in front of you one after another as you walk through the gardens. Of course Orchid Garden is world famous, no need for me to describe it here. A plenty of restrooms through the park, which are clean. There is a souvenir shop inside, which has many great unique items that I 've never seen anywhere else in Singapore.
After exiting the gardens I walked to Orchard Road so this distance is quite walkable.
Only a word of advice - it can be very hot and humid (surprise!). I felt it all over my body after spending around 4 hours there. And I had a plenty of water. Just be ready.
A visit is highly recommended."
,,Relaxing oasis in Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are just steps,away from the Metro & it made for an easy commute. The Gardens themselves are beautiful. I tended to think more jungle than gardens, but certainly there are a variety of flowers as well. It does get hot & humid so bring along some water as the humidity I found to be very high."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,Beautiful gardens in a nice peaceful area. Not too had for walking and well designed layout. Orchard area a must. Nice children's area all sealed of for safety.

Very much enjoyable place if you love Nature and Outdoors."

,,Decent just not with lightning,3.0,,"Careful if there's a storm. You'll get zapped. Trees like a rain forest. Decent though, saw a lizard that looked like a dinosaur. Literally was huge. Looked like a fisher price kids toy that u get in early learning centre except it was alive and moving, and erm real. There's also turtles in the pond."
,,Fantastic greenery with lakes - good for family walks or exercise and free weekend concerts,4.0,,"Love running/walking here with its landscape and trails. There is an orchid enclosure where people often have weddings and also several restaurants like Halia, Cafe Verde and Food for Thought. Nice to chill at Cafe Verde after a weekend morning run or walk. Good brunch.

It is crowded over weekends especially when there are free weekend concerts and most will picnic early to get a good spot in front of the Shaw stage. Some of the concerts are excellent."
,,Nice day to spend at the park,4.0,,I went to the Botanical Gardens to get out of my hotel and get acclimated to the area and time change. Spent the day roaming the gardens and Bay Area. Though it was overcast and rainy the park was a good way to see the plant life of Southeast Asia. There are two areas where you have to pay to get into and both were worth the admission. It was nice to have an MRT station right at the gardens entrance too.
,,Nice and peaceful place,5.0,,Relaxing place and many people picnicking there. Great place for family and couple where don't need to spend money. Relax and peace your mind after a long weekday.

,,Peaceful on A Drizzling Day,5.0,,"Public places are normally crowded but normally on a weekday especially when it drizzles on a nice clowdy day, you will get a wondeful experience walking through a simulated forest rich in flora. I took the walk alone and was delighted to spend some me time enjoying Singapore's outdoor park."

,,Traveling to Singapore with mother age 79,5.0,,"We are here for the garden festival and general holiday. Botanic gardens yesterday were beautiful. Orchid garden was great, but flowers not as prolific as same time in 2014. Perhaps a cyclical thing with the weather.
Highly recommend early start. Gardens open at 5am and orchid garden at 8:00 am. After completing the orchids track back down to Halia restaurant at the ginger garden for lunch which starts at noon and offers 3 seating options: outside, outside under very effective fans or inside (refrigerated) and a wide range of good food and drinks at reasonable cost.
Walk back down to the visitor centre for easiest access to transport home. Orchid garden is $5 adults and $1 over sixty with ID from any country, gardens free. About the best $6 I've ever spent."
,,lovely green wonder,5.0,,"A must visit place in Sg. If you happen to be there in the weekend during the day, look out for the free concert in the middle of the pond. It's magical."
,,Simply Beautiful,5.0,,Wonderful Botanical Gardens. It's huge and yet so peaceful. The plants and trees are spectacular. Best of all it's free.

,,Incredible green lung,5.0,,"While Singapore remains a very green city, the Botanic Gardens are still an important green lung. This vast park has several lakes, gardens and trails, including the National Orchid Garden and a variety of special displays.

There are even some very good food options within the gardens, making it perfect for a morning stroll, followed by some gambolling in the greenery. A definite must-visit."
,,Great place to explore for free,5.0,,"What a great garden experience on the outskirts of the city, we took the hop on-off bus around and were able to go exploring over a couple of days. Great areas from orchids to a prehistoric garden to plants that have health effects. Peaceful and provoking ... And best of all ... It's free. How could it get better?"

,,A wonderful place to be,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens in Singapore has got to be one of the most serene city locations I've ever visited. Moving from one side to the other the staff have excellently sculpted the place over the years to provide a truly unique experience which makes the place seem like it is shifting biomes when clearly it is not. The orchard garden is beautiful, the history walk is incredibly well done, the amphitheatre is ace for concerts, and the shop sells the best rose milk I've ever had. The place is perfect for reading, running, meditating, distressing, frisbee (in the north end) etc. It's a World Heritage site I believe, and rightly so. If you're in Singapore, it's a must do."
,,"Well-kept park, great space for chilling in the evenings",5.0,,"As a UNESCO-heritage site, you'll find that this is no ordinary park. Come prepared with lots of water and snacks, and you'll be treated to a dose of Singapore's nature (What's left of it!)."
,,Not as expected,4.0,,There are so many kinds of Orchids but it is not wonderful as I expected.I think that more flowers would be greater.
,,"Beautiful flowers & scenery, but kind of boring",3.0,,"The gift shops are extremely expensive and you are constantly being bugged by the store assistants encouraging you to buy things and keep following you around the store 😂 but the gardens were good, plenty of flowers & water falls, good for photography"

The orchids are exceptional , the colours symphony fantastic and the entire visit is an experience that shlod never be missed. Also a frangipani small forest impresed us by the variety of flowers coulours and smell.
This garden is a must for every Singapore resident!"
,,AMAZING! Could have stayed there all day,5.0,,"Check out my blog for ideas/photos of Singapore and what i got up to in the 6 days i was there: https://asimplenurseslife.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/singapore/

I absolutely loved these gardens, they were incredibly beautiful and were much better than expected!
The orchard garden was definitely my favourite, we paid around $5 to get in and i don't regret a dime. The flowers were spectacular!"
,,A Beautiful Garden,5.0,,This place is amazing and very large. Singapore is hot so make sure you bring water. There are some cafes in the gardens and great gift shops.

,,Family visit,5.0,,A good place for walks and exercise. Many varieties of plants and trees to learn and enjoy. It is very well kept. Thanks to the botanists and keepers of this fantastic park. The best part is the entrance to it is free. The orchid garden is also a great place to visit

,,A place of tranquility and relaxation,4.0,,"As a local, I like this place for morning and evening walks especially during cool weather. This place exudes the sense of peacefulness and tranquility. It is very therapeutic hearing the birds chirping, waterfall and smelling the floral fragrance around you. There are many good spots for photography as well."
,,Recently awarded World Heritage site,5.0,,"A naturally well kept Garden with Colonial buildings still intact and very suitable for families and friends, young and old.
A must visit to many places of interest within this very large garden, especially the ORCHIDS enclosure is a must stop venue with all varieties of Orchids, some even named after Royalties and celebrities like Jackie Chan. Get a guide map from the Tourist Information upon arrival for the various attractions. It could take you half a day or you could spend the whole day there. Food & beverage within the Gardens are palatable. There is one inside near or beside the carpark after the entrance that serves a good spread of local fare that is suitable for those on a budget too. Further inside are a cafe and a restaurant that serves good or fine dining too.
Wheelchair access is not a problem too."
,,A visit to the nature,5.0,,Place is well planned with ability to visit different gardens of various theme. Most of them are free. Area that can be impove is to have more toilets as threre is only 4 in the park. Dist between toilets may be too long for some people who are not able to walk long distances. There is also too little shelter
,,Nice place,4.0,,Quite a big place and mostly free except for the Orchid exhibits. I like some of the big trees. Good to escape the busy life of Singapore.
,,Fun For Families,5.0,,I've lived in Singapore for 2 years now and finally made a trip to the Gardens. It was a wonderful time with my family and the kids loved it. Plus it's a great way for the whole family to get exercise.
,,A scenic run through 150 years of history in one place,5.0,,"I love to have long runs and this place never fails to calm me and give me a peace of mind after I do my run around it.
Lots of greenery, it was the place where S'pore experimented with plants from all over the world before selecting them for planting around the whole island. It was told that about 6,000 to 8,000 were collected and 2,000 were finally used islandwide to create the garden city of Singapore, which other cities started to emulate.
I prefer the old garden facing Holland/Tanglin road for its rich forage and fauna in the morning and evening time."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Caught the MRT train to the gardens. Lovely to mix with locals withe their children and dogs, variety of plants - the ginger display is very interesting. Took a small travel blanket and enjoyed sitting on a grassy patch and relaxing. Good lunch at the cafe too."
,,Plantful walks...,5.0,,"These gardens are HUGE! You feel close to nature by taking any of the paths and walking by smaller or bigger lakes with fish and swans swimming up and down...There are restaurants and shops where you can dine or have a refreshment, although a bit expensive for the mid Singaporean. People can even have a picnic there since the entrance is free!! Just be responsible and do not leave any waste after finishing your meal."
,,Tranquillize!,4.0,,"Great place to be in. Love the well maintained plants and flowers. For families, couples, friends and individuals. Be prepared with anti-mosquitoes repellent."
,,Nice picnic trip,5.0,,"It's a nice escape tucked away in the corner of orchard district's hustle & bustle.

,,Away from the mosquitoes and rain!,5.0,,"A UNESCO World Heritage site (and I cannot think of a place more deserving). Possibily the closest I can get to a natural jungle away from team-building activities, mosquitoes and the rain. I do kind of wish that there were more choices for Halal food though, can't help but feel hungry all the time when I'm here."
,,Breakfast & stroll,3.0,,"It's a great Park for the family, especially those with small kids. But the sizzling weather in Singapore generally do not allow strolls most times of the day. But still a great place to relax and soak up the sun."
,,Perfect place to have family picnic,4.0,,"I brought my parents, daughter and nephews to visit the botanic gardens during their june school holiday. This place is one of my favourite place to spend relaxing saturday afternoon with my family. We had a picnic near the symphony stage it has a combination of ample shades and open spaced"
,,My favoruite park in Singapore & its free entry,5.0,,"Being a Singaporean I couldn't be more proud of Singapore Botanic Garden. Is a huge park with some much to offer, so many different spots to roam around. I could spend the entire morning or afternoon just laying on the picnic mat watching the clouds, enjoying the moments of tranquil. Yes even in the afternoon I could do that, thanks to the big trees offering good shades.

Did I mention is free entry? ;)"
,,Greenery to the power infinity..,5.0,,Though Singapore itself is a garden but this one is an added point .. huge area to hang around n wide open space available for children to play around. Go early in the morning to avoid the heat n crowd. Duration along with Orchid garden - 3-4 hours. U need to walk a lot.
,,Great Day out,5.0,,Even if you are not really into botanical gardens I'd recommend a visit here. I've busted many around the world & this is one ift he best. Couple dollars extra for the Orchid Garden worth it - take your camera.
,,Garden bliss!,5.0,,Beautiful gardens! Recommend comfortable shoes as there is a lot to see. The Orchid garden was particulrly fabulous!
,,A place to visit for nature lovers,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a must visit for anyone who loves nature and orchids in particular.

Simple recommendations are
1) always carry an umbrella per person visiting as the Singapore rains can disrupt your visit for just an hour in the whole day and it would be sunny again
2) if you intend to take pictures do wear a disposable raincoat instead. - that way you won't have to fumble with the umbrella and your expensive camera

I would wish they would put small sign posts or alerts near the orchids that have a pleasant perfume smell. (Yes there are a few- our tour guide was kind enough to point them out)

The gold plated orchid pendants are worth a gift to buy from the gift shop.They look so elegant."
,,Botanical Graden Singapore,3.0,,Relaxing place for a stroll (morning/evening to avoid the harsh Singapore sun) perfect for family to take a walk in the greenery. However do bring along an umbrella as shelters may be scarce.
,,Peaceful time,5.0,,"Never thought I would see a squirrel in Singapore and saw two! Very cute but probably a rodent here.
Caught public transport, $1.60 one way and so helpful, clean and polite.
The gardens are well set out and good signage yelling a good story. So nice to see so many people enjoying a beautiful public space.
The Ginger section was really nice and we stopped off for ginger and honey tea. The Ginger Garden snack was very beautiful.
Enjoyed the experience as so peaceful and tranquil."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"When in Singapore, it is always a good day out to visit the Botanical Garden here. The collection of plants from around the world but mainly from south east asia, is very good. The landscaping is great. There are some fine examples of very ornamental palms from Malaysia. Orchids are everywhere, however, as an orchid-lover and grower, I must say that it becomes tedious to look at mass-produced orchid hybrids. The natural beautiful orchid species are almost absent."
,,Great for Singapore,4.0,,"Being from German, the garden was somehow just ok. However, for Singapore is it great to have a garden this size."
,,A Pleasant Stroll on a Warm Day in Singapore,4.0,,On the prompting of my son who wanted to visit we came here on a late July day. The park does not charge for entry which is just one nice aspect of the spot. This is a very quiet and peaceful spot and you will frequently see couples having their wedding photos taken here.
,,Just stunning,5.0,,This place has inspired the city to be a garden city and you can see why. An absolute must if in Singapore
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,I went at 9 am to avoid the heat and really enjoyed walking in the gardens. The Orchid gardens have an entrance fee which is well with paying as there is a lot to see here. The gardens are large and the different areas well signposted. I especially enjoyed the peace and quiet in the healing g garden. There is a taxi rank near the visitors centre as well as a metro stop at one end of the park.
,,good place to visit,4.0,,Beautiful large gardens with good pathways and easy to walk around. This garden one can't complete in a one day time if you really want to see all the stuff then you have to comeback at least one more time. If you are interested in plants and just nature in general then undoubtedly you gonna love it! The garden is very clean and perfectly maintained. Plenty of information to be found as you walk around. Good signposting with maps around the grounds.
,,Nature Under Sunshine,4.0,,"Beautiful place to see the nature after come out from the city sounds, here you can feel the peace, can open your eyes and let the sun shine touch your soul. Garden, small lake, water fall even every single leave of the garden will never let you go back. This is what from where we were brought up actually ""The Nature""."
,,The Orchard gardens are amazing. Fantastic lay out and we wished we had had a whole day to spend at this venue.,5.0,,Fantastic place. Orchard gardens are amazing.

,,A wonderful place to visit over and over again.,5.0,,"Walking, photographing, eating, resting, bird watching or just simply being .

Early morning is good to see all the yoga tai chi action. Late afternoon is a great time to relax at the end of the day and eat outside at the lovely , simple café."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Very beautiful, interesting and perfect for great walks and relaxing. Very good maintained. Perfect to go there for a jog (no need to bring water because plenty of drinking fountains are located at the park). The thematic zones of the gardens are very interesting and you will learn something new for sure."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"If you have depression, then you have to go to this place. Fresh oxygen, many photo sites and place to eat or have a drink. You might witness exotic creatures which will very much enrich your experience."
,,Sumptuous gardens,5.0,,A visit to Singapore isn't complete without a visit to these gardens which is a UNESCO world heritage site. Beautiful large gardens with good pathways and easy to walk around. Plenty of information to be found as you walk around. Good signposting with maps around the grounds.
,,Breath-taking,5.0,,A beautiful place to spend half a day if you into plants. The variety of botanical attractions were beyond expectation.
,,Decent price,4.0,,"Place is decently priced and if you are a nature person then this is another place for you to enjoy the greenery around and also you can take pictures of you with trees.
Now they have a train station in the Circle Line for Botanic Gardens so if you want to get here faster I suggest you to take the circle line train and you will reach there in around 5 mins and you will be able to enjoy your whole day there"
,,Gardens of paradise,5.0,,"Pristine gardens. Peaceful walk thru the gardens. Orchids were spectacular. Lovely to see the people practicing their Thi Chi in the park. Also had breakfast at the park, good value meal."

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"If you are interested in plants and just nature in general you eill probably love it!
It was so nice and relaxing getting away from the busy and loud traffic and go into a very peaceful place. The garden is very clean and perfectly maintained.
Since I was there with my much younger sister she was happy to leave after like three hours, while I could have stayed there for a while longer.
If you don't have too much time, i would suggest you just go to the orchid garden. Its stunning!"
,,Be ready to use those legs,4.0,,"Be ready to walk. And I mean a far far walk. It is very big and you will really appreciate this place if you are nature lover. The orchis garden inside is the best place.
Not good in a rainy season. Far from the main city. We took taxi to hotel that cost us around S$17"
,,Run to your hearts content,5.0,,"Enjoy the flowers but I enjoy running here at night. The garden is so much more interesting then running on a treadmill. I feel really safe to run before 8pm. After that it does get a little quieter. You can easily map out a 5km run.
There are lots of gardens to visit and restaurants to eat at."
,,Serene and educational Gardens,5.0,,This is a beautiful serene garden with brilliant presentation carefully set out in a way that is easy to stroll around. It is very educational as plants are well labelled. I just loved the clever way the VIP Garden named orchid hybrids after famous visiting dignitaries - which then became a commercial initiative as it created a demand for those flowers! Don't miss these Gardens if you visit Singapore. The Cafes are a bit average fur food but it is a shame not to spend the whole day here.
,,nice place in heart of the city,5.0,,"i like the night show with the fireworks and trees, the whole garden is quite pleasant and nice for the kids to go and enjoy themselves in the middle of the city"
,,Peaceful Oasis,5.0,,"The Botanic Garden is a truly peaceful, vast garden in the heart of Singapore. I recommend coming early in the AM to beat the heat (if it's not raining). There were many families, runners, walkers, and visitors enjoying the grounds. If you are staying on the North East end of Orchard Road (Hilton, Four Seasons, Marriott, Hyatt for example) you can even walk to the Garden, but there is a MRT stop on the Circle Line, as well.

I also recommend the (pay for entrance) Orchid Garden if you have never been."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"This garden is beautiful. We saw an orchestra rehearsing on the ""floating stage"". We were told they have a free concert later that day but we didn't get to see it. There are beautiful orchids in the garden and I like the iconic gazebo called the Bandstand. It enhances the beauty of the place."
,,Good in the mornings and evenings,5.0,,The gardens can get extreamly warm and uncomfortable in the afternoons and early evenings. Also be sure to bring some protective clothing if you intend to take a stroll in the night as there are Moxie's pretty much everywhere.
,,Beautiful although very hot to walk around,4.0,,The Botanic Gardens are beautiful and I do recommend walking around them. However be warned you need to carry plenty of water and take plenty of breaks as it is very hot . There is a nice restaurant by the entrance that serves decent food . Best to go in the early morning or evening when it is less hot .
,,Promenade,4.0,,You will enjoy a promenade a long the Singapore Botanical Gardens. Alone or in friends company will be always a nice walk. The only problem is the humidity.
,,Fantastic place to visit,5.0,,"Even if you are not a gardener you must go and look at these gardens.Their beauty has to be seen to be believed, gardeners, you will come away with many ideas that you can implement in your own garden.Truely inspiring."
,,Piece of nature in the city center,5.0,,"Botanical carden was very beautiful. Full of different orchids, with different shapes and colors. You need to pay in order to go and see the orchids but the huge park outside is free and there were lots of people enjoying picnic food and have a nice time with the friends.

You can walk to the gardens from the Orchard road. If you do not feel like walking in the hot and moist weather, it is easily reachable by MRT or buss or taxi.

I was really wondering why I did not visit there earlier. It was so nice experience that I would put it as a mandatory to see for everyone visiting Singapore."
,,Fabulous & better than gardens by the bay,5.0,,My partner and I took the hop in and hop off bus here. Although it was extremely hot the gardens were amazing and the orchid garden definitely worth the $5 entry fee. I highly recommend
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,"Came here with my Daughter on Saturday. The air was very fresh and cooling. Came to jog with my Daughter. There are also food options nearby. Lush greenery and beautiful flowers and trees. Big and Wide walkways with benches along the way. This is a nice UNESCO heritage site, there are also small exhibits there. Will go back again if I have the opportunity ."
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"Such a relaxing way to spend the day! A really lovely walk through the botanical gardens is a must!

,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"Came here for brisk walk in the early morning , love the fresh air and lush greenery. Many beautiful sculptures by renowned sculptors, orchid garden, eateries etc. Must visit place."
,,Waste of time,3.0,,"Declared as a UNESCO world heritage site, short walk from MRT station with free entry this place is a massive stretch of vegetation, very well kept but saw very few patches of flowering plants."
,,Nice place to have a rest,5.0,,Highly recommend to visit on hot day. To feel how incredible the nature is. To relax at shadows. Romantic place.
,,a MUST visit,5.0,,"I dragged my feet thinking it's just another botanic garden, and I've been to so many...I nearly did not go...

Its AMAZING, it's beautiful, breath taking, lots of wow moments...if you can go their early in the morning, you'll enjoy the cooler weather as well as watching locals engage in different types of exercises such as ChiGung, dancing and more.

I loved it! but I only went early morning, not sure what it would be like later in the day"
,,Lovely day out,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are really lovely and lush. We've been at different times of the day. The children's garden is great fun, the kids (6 & 8yo) played for quite a while there. We saw a huge monitor lizard near Tanglin gate and kids fed the enormous catfish in the little lake. We bought pizza at the restaurant at Nassim gate to have a picnic on the concert lawn one day, but would pack our own picnic next time as the place is outrageously priced for what you get."
,,beautiful Orchid,5.0,,This is a garden with an extensive variety of orchids. Absolutely beautiful and educational. I wouldn't usually pick a location like this to visit but we were brought here as part of our city tour and I quite enjoyed it and learned a lot.
,,Love it must see,5.0,,The Botanic garden is one of the most famous attraction here in town forget about the high-rise you encounter plants from around the word love the way they take care of the place it's worth every penny it's a haven for plants lovers
,,"Beautiful, relaxing area",5.0,,"A huge park filled with different zones. Great areas to sit and relax. The Orchid garden was fantastic, especially the cold area. The Evolution garden was also a lovely, interesting zone - very well set out. Easy to get to but a fair way out from city centre. Easy to spend a couple of hours here. Saw some unusual birds and a squirrel"
,,Stunning.,5.0,,Stunning...Only had time to touch the surface with the national orchid garden. Beautiful and wish we had more time.
,,Bold and simple garden is what i called,1.0,,"This Botanical garden is only good for peoples who wants to stroll around in the nature in Singapore. It is so empty and not much to offer compared to others around the world. Peoples normally come here to exercise and stroll in nature only, not for its uniqueness or whatsoever.

Spend time on others before considering this."
,,"Nice tranquil place, some interesting exhibits",4.0,,"I decided to hop off my tour bus to visit the Botanic gardens. It is a group of expansive gardens, with large lawns, a great variety of plant species, all neatly labeled. It includes some special exhibits like the Healing gardens, featuring medicinal plants; a Meditation garden; and an Evolution Garden, which recreates the evolution of life on earth with realistic looking zones, ponds, etc. and some amazing fossils. I was most looking forward to this part, and it did not disappoint.
They even have a store where you can buy natural products and souvenirs. Overall, it was a relaxing and educational experience. Probably not the best place to go if you're looking for an action-packed adventure. But it's a good place for an educational trip or to just explore nature."
,,Interesting,3.0,,The gardens are lovely and worth a visit. I did find the number of runners there a bit stifling as the walkways are not really wide enough to support all the pedestrian traffic. The layout of the gardens is very dynamic and picturesque.
,,Botanical Smile,5.0,,I missed my dog and made new friends . The locals walk their pets here. I cuddled them all. Came along with the Happy Hippo bus. Easy way to do sightseeing. Take an umbrella for rain and sun. Loved it!
,,1st Anniversary for world heritage!!,5.0,,"Visited here with group of 7 people as biz tour.
It was a day of 1st Anniversary of Botanic Garden to be registered as world heritage.
If you want to make experience with nature, I highly recommend this place.
Also, you could see the view of people running, having Yoga, and just walking around.
This place is really huge, so you need more than 3 hours if you like to see all of them."
,,Beautiful park,5.0,,"If you need a break from the city, the beautiful scenery of the Botanic Garden is a must! Lovely walking paths and lakes. The Orchid Garden is inside this area. Do be sure to return to the Botanic Garden MRT station. There is no station at the other (Orchard St) gate. It's quite a walk from that fate to Orchard St and that MRT station - as I discovered."
,,TRANQUIL OASIS,5.0,,"Took a taxi from the city to visit this wonderful place, and enjoyed 2-3 hours of just walking around enjoying the many plants on show. There's food and drinks available here and the whole park is well maintained and looked after, a tranquil experience."
,,Visit to Singapore Botanic Garden is always relaxing.,4.0,,"I go to Botanic Gardens quite often. Its always soothing to the eyes with the wide expanse of lawns, gardens and greeneries. I enjoyed strolling around and chatting with friend as we enjoyed the scenery. There are also many cute little dogs running around and white graceful swans in the lake. The orchid garden is definitely worth a visit."
,,Flora & Fauna,5.0,,A very well maintained botanic garden & also a Unesco Heritage Site. The peace & tranquility in this garden right in the middle of the city is amazing.
,,Wonderful place!,5.0,,"We went once again to the Botanical gardens the other day. In fact, we wanted to go to the orchid gardens which we knew close at 7.00 pm. We arrived there shortly after 6.00 pm. Please note that they do not sell tickets after 6.00 pm.
We walked along the small lake near the amphitheater and it was a wonderful experience. We enjoyed walking amidst the magnificent trees and saw a number of birds like the toucans, kingfisher and herons along with other more common birds.
Would definitely recommend this attraction to everyone."
,,"Still maintained that well manicured garden , nice place just to laze around",4.0,,"My husband and I did just a three hour stay here, had our fair bit of walking, enjoying the natural environment of plants , the lagoon and had a coffee after our walk. The place is really nice for walking and just to look around for that refreshing view of properly laid out plants around the area. I had been here in 2007, then 2009 although there are some changes done, still it remained a botanical garden for people to enjoy plants in it's natural habitat. It;s a refreshing sight to see birds around and take picture of course, as always is a part of the travel."
,,Vast green spaces,5.0,,"The gardens offer a beautiful retreat from the busy city without having to travel far. There are many families, couples, and friends enjoying the park throughout the day. It's easily accessible via the MRT and a number of cafes are available throughout. The orchid gardens are a big highlight for a small fee"
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"We visited the Singapore Botanic Gardens as part of a group tour through SmarTours. The weather was poor and it was raining, but the Gardens remained beautiful to behold and a highlight of the trip.

The Gardens are laid out with several different exhibits, including their famous orchids in many unique displays. The path to view is a circular pattern with several exhibits to see along the way. There is also an indoor exhibit featuring a waterfall.

Even in the rain, the Gardens are well worth a visit."
,,Early morning walk,5.0,,"A good 4-5km walk around the gardens. Many people go there for tai chi, group dancing, dog walking and photography. We saw turtles and swans in the lake. Bathrooms are available throughout and drinking fountain is near the main restaurant."
,,Nice for walk and jogging,5.0,,"this place was great when you want to visit on weekend. because it's a great time to great healthy and cozy with the beautiful scenery. why healthy? if you want to run or jogging for a mile away, this was a great place. a lot of track with the different atmosphere. with a wide variety of garden it will make your weekend day be awesome. or you just want to walk and enjoy the view with family you can do in this place. even you can take a picture for a lot of variation from the plant in here. just enjoy the nature in the middle town."
,,"Large, perfectly manicured, gardens",5.0,,This is a fairly large public garden that is free to visit. Various trails take you through different sections. Also several common areas where people were doing yoga or participating in exercise classes. Signage is excellent so it is easy to get around. The condition of the gardens are immaculate. Very impressive and highly suggest. You can walk through in an hour or spend half a day easily depending on your level of interest.
,,Quietly beautiful!,5.0,,This is not the typical commercial hangout. There is an element of natural romance to this place. It's cool the moment you get into the gardens and a n atural aroma to go with it. Very colorful too! Some carvings of the plants were also seen. The climb up was kind of adventurous but with picturesque views.
,,Nature in all its splendor,4.0,,"Easily accessible by MRT, it has a plethora of fauna that is representative of indigenous species for Asia. Best visited in the early hours at sunrise (7am), when parking is easy. The cold and humid air is a delight as it embraces our harried souls. By 8.30am, it starts to become uncomfortable for most of us mere mortals. It is then that Breakfast could be taken at the eatery near Nassim Gate, or a prepacked meal at one of the many benches along the 2 lakes. No bicycles or wheeled devices are allowed. Provisions for a water bottle and small towel would be prudent. Blankets under the shady trees are ideal for a nap or lazy time with a book. Take your time and don't spoil the serenity and calming effect it offers, by rushing about. Be lazy and leave this venue recharged and calm."
,,Tour,5.0,,We went on a tour & the guide took us through the orchid area. It was beautiful & specular with different varieties of orchids. The flamingos were special & there was other bird life as well
,,Must visit when in Singapore!,5.0,,Wish I could have spent more than just a couple hours here as it really is a spectacular Botanical Garden. Magical!
,,"people who are interested in ecology, visit this garden!",4.0,,"there are lots of species of plants inside this garden. As a gardener, i really appreciate their maintenance work inside. For those who like biodiversity or ecology, you have to visit this amazing garden. It is free for public!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The gardens are absolutely stunning. Very very well kept. We took a picnic tea & stayed until after dark. Unfortunately we arrived too late for the Orchid garden. The lake area kept me facinated with lots of turtles, fish & even a Monitor lizard taking a swim!"
,,Very good outdoor activity,5.0,,"Great way to spend a morning. Easily reached on the MRT. Away from the crowds downtown. All free but for the Orchid section. Very extensive, so take it slow and drink plenty of water"
,,Huge Park,4.0,,"Big gardens and have various tropical trees, better to visit in the early morning or in the afternoon when the weather become less hot."
,,Serenity Now,5.0,,Singapore Botanical Gardens are worth the visit any time of the day or night. They are constantly changing and improving. Pay the extra $5 to enter the Orchid Garden you won't be disappointed.
,,Wonderful walk.,5.0,,The gardens are a wonderful place to spend a peaceful day walking. The Orchid gardens are amazing. I have never seen the array of colors.
,,Excellent and free park in the city,5.0,,"No need for a guide, just pick up a map at the main entrance. Lots of paths to stroll along and specialized gardens within, like the healing garden. Everything except the orchid gardens are free. Lot of open space to bring a ball and play soccer too. Paths are mostly smooth and suitable to scooters for kids."
,,Quiet Interesting Oasis in Busy Singapore,5.0,,"I had no problem getting here on the excellent bus service that Singapore has. The desk attendant at the front gate was helpful about where things were in the park, like the National Orchid Garden. I found the Botanic Gardens to be peaceful and well laid-out. There were informative markers in front of lots of plants and trees. They also had interesting exhibits like a rainforest-canopy walk, and an area made of bricks manufactured by prisoners of the Japanese. If you like fast-paced nightlife only, then this is not your deal. But if you like to see the local flora of Singapore, then this is a must-visit destination. I'm glad I went, even though it was mighty hot."
,,The Cleanest Garden Air,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens are a delight to explore. Not only do you get exercise at your own pace - though there were a few dedicated lunch-time joggers exercising - but you get to breathe the beautiful air and the gentle scents of the surrounding vegetation. On an overcast day, this is a truly peaceful and refreshing attraction. It's quiet, the earth smells are enticing, the green surroundings invite you in. The National Orchid Centre is truly worth a visit too. At S$1 for a Senior's ticket and S$4 General entry, it's the most beautiful 'garden within a garden', laid out with good pathways, garden 'rooms' around each corner, beautiful paving and the most spectacular array of Singapore's famous orchids, Hoyas and succulents. Even the group of school children we followed around were happily occupied snapping photos of the blooms on their iPads and iPhones, oohing and aahing at the beautiful blooms. Further on in the garden space, the old colonial house (an original rubber plantation house a century ago) of the original garden manager/curator sits quietly among the space echoing the origins of the gardens. The tropical trees, palms and vines are spectacular as are the massive trees with broad, spreading branches where monkeys used to sit and chatter. A truly lovely place to withdraw to in the middle of of a vibrant city."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"We've been to this place a few days ago (July). The gardens are very well maintained, clean and most of all beautiful to watch! The admission is free for the Botanic Gardens and very easy to access with MRT."
,,Oasis in a big city,5.0,,Amazing place in such a crowded busy city. The variety of trees and flowers are very interesting and we could find some very rare speicies. It is also relaxing just to stole through the gardens. We enjoyed it. Its free!
,,Garden of Eden?,5.0,,"This is the country's garden, open to everyone: walkers, joggers, people practicing Tai Chi, playing musical instruments, meditating, picnicking with children. Plants & trees well-labeled. Flat, even ground for walking the various paths. There are a few Dining options available with quite good food. I think the best part is - it is connected to the National Orchid Garden (which has an admission fee)"
,,Immaculate gardens,5.0,,We've been to many botanical gardens in the world and this was one of the best. It is extremely well maintained and labelled. A model of excellence.
,,Big and Free,4.0,,"I was recommended to visit the botanic gardens, but was not aware how big it is. It was a humid afternoon, and I was only able to finish less than half.
Surprisingly majority of it is free, which is really good for the public to stroll and enjoy.
Compared with English Gardens, such as the Kew, there seems to much going on in this botanic garden, and the landscaping details need some refinement."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"a beautiful morning of just enjoying the best parts of Singapore, there were many people there which made it far more enjoyable,"
,,One of the best Natural reserves...,5.0,,Singapore Botanical garden is one of the Natural heritage sites of the world. There are thousands of varieties of trees and flowers and it's almost too much to take in in one visit. It's a great place for family trips and evidently weddings!!! (When I visited there was some wedding Photoshoot going on specially by the Swan lake and Caves)... it's natural beauty and treasures will amaze anyone...
,,Ever so relaxing.,5.0,,"The gardens are a haven from the crowds and the bustle of Singapore. Just wandering around the beautifully manicured gardens makes your blood pressure drop! The maps are very useful but don't rush, there is so much to enjoy. It is a credit to all staff and management and there is a sense of continual improvement and planning. Bit sad, but there was virtually no-one in the Children's garden. It is in an ""out of the way"" part of the gardens and clearly has not had the same amount of budget put into it compared to the orchid sections. Still good, just the same. Maybe just a quiet time of the week. You must visit the Orchid Garden."
,,Time required to see it fully,4.0,,"We came here as part of a ""tour"" of Singapore.. Not enough time allowed to enjoy the wonderful gardens. Plenty of well documented examples to see what grows well in hot humid conditions. An excellent Botanic Garden"
,,fascinating to go to,5.0,,incredible array of nature that si perfect to go to on a sunny day with family. recommended for anyone who likes nature

,,A wonderful place,5.0,,Amazing gardens with plenty of areas to talk around and absorb the natural surrounding. Very un-spoiled and tranquil.
,,One of the nicest botanic gardens in Asia,5.0,,"A huge and diverse botanic garden with thousands of Asian tree, shrubs and flower species, worth a visit for children and adults, with ponds, lawns and many trails to explore, and good public services everywhere. It combines nicely before a shopping visit to Orchard Street."
,,Beautiful greenery,5.0,,"A lovely place to enjoy nature, nice scenery to enjoy as well for photo taking and also great for group gathering or picnic as it has plenty of open space. Kids would love to run around freely there."
,,Amazing!!!! Must visit at Night!!,5.0,,It is like being in Avatar movie!! Super great place to visit during the night/evening!! Enjoyed it so much!! You won't regret!!

,,Flowers everywhere,4.0,,"For scenery, photography and outdoor lovers. Also great for picnic. You can enjoy your day with your family and captured great memories here."
,,"A beautiful and charming ""garden"" rich in interesting trees, plants and pools.",5.0,,"Whether alone with the desire to learn more about the age and origines of the vegetation or accompanied by children and well-behaved dogs - these gardens are a really lovely place to walk, meditate, sit on the grass to read or enjoy the company of friends with an impromtu pic-nic. There is also the very interesting orchid Garden with an entrance fee (no dogs allowed here). There are various cultural evenings organised with music from orchestras while all the lawns around are filled with families, many children and lots of dogs, showing the incredible cultural and ethnic variation of Singapore. Everyone extremely civilized and well-behaved. My several visits have never disappointed me. I have visited the gardens solo, with friends, with family and also with dogs. (I tried it all !)"
,,a must go,5.0,,"a good place to chill in the evening,. dont; go in the afternoon, very hot ! quite a big park that need about 2hr- 3hrs slow pace walking."
,,My favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,One of my favorite places in Singapore. There is extensive areas being reconstructed but there are plenty of beautiful spots to hang out and many paths to walk.
,,Place for Adventure,5.0,,Botanic Gardens make a good place to just take a stroll along nature or test out your orienteering skills through the maze of walkways. It is suitable for family picnic or outings with friends. Also a good place to hold corporate events.
,,Garden of Eden,5.0,,"Although some work is being done in several places of the Botanical Garden, it is still worth a visit especially if you're over 60 ($1 entry fee to National Orchid Garden!)). A beautifully maintained garden and large layout adds up to a good walk in the park. The weather was very hot and humid so take along your water bottles and use the shops for airconditioning relief rather than shopping therapy - mostly tacky tourist items!"
,,very good,4.0,,"good for people who like gardens and nature. there are a lot of meadow where you can lie down and enjoy the scenery. It is a good place to go picnic with friends and families.

I encounter a very big lizzard in a particular spot. So, be careful when you are in the middle of thick bushes."
,,Amazing place. Worth a visit,5.0,,"Perfect for a Half day visit. The two conservatories are very nice, flowers and cloud forest. the external gardens are free to access and worth spending some time visiting the world species."
,,Green and Large - nice escape from the City,4.0,,"We visited as part of a trip to the Orchid Garden. Big, wide open green spaces with nice walking paths. Lots of families, people with dogs, etc. More of what I would think of as a ""park"" than gardens. Nice."
,,"For niçe, long walks, bug-free, how can that be?",4.0,,"An ascepticized garden, from the almost bug-free rain forest, where no more monkeys or giant spiders are to be seen., to the orchid cloning section. Astoundingly few flowers around for the size of the gardens. Access is free of charge, except for the orchid garden."
,,Great place for a walk,3.0,,Pleasant garden. Would suggest you go early in the AM or late in PM to avoid the heat and humidity. The garden opens at 5am and I arrived around 7am to find many people already there. There are many great trees and they are marked. The garden is more park-like that botanic-like. There is a separate Orchid Garden that is excellent and requires an entrance fee.
,,Worth the trip,5.0,,"Not exactly an oasis of tranquility - lots of people! - but a welcome change from concrete and buildings. Beautifully landscaped gardens with a rich variety of plant life, and the Halia ginger-themed restaurant was a treat. (NB Plenty of non-ginger options if you don't like ginger). Loved the whole experience. Also, entrance is free although you need a ticket to see the orchid gardens. I think it was about $10 - $20."
,,Simply wonderful,4.0,,"Very rich in foliage,well laid out and wonderfully maintained,one can visit this garden umpteen times.The garden attracts not only serious students of botany and horticulture for whom there is so much to see,learn and admire,infact an experience of an university itself,it also attracts thousands who can enjoy a simple jog/walk in the lap of extensive greens.During my stay of about a month in Singapore I visited the garden seven times."
,,So much green in the middle of the city.,5.0,,Kudos to the govt for maintaining so well in the heart of the city. Great place for a run or a change of scenery for a family stroll. Literally a breath of fresh air in Singapore.
,,It Was Part of the Tour but Wasn't Dissappointed,3.0,,"As the title states, its one of those places you should see but may not look to do it again on the next trip (unless you're really into orchids and plants in general).

It was a good experience and very picturesque, its amazing how they take very good care of their greenery and its nice to know that the local government puts great effort and attention into supporting more environment friendly projects.

No regrets seeing this,"
,,Lovely but soooo hot!,5.0,,"It is a great place, so peaceful away from city but we did pick a hot day. Great for a walk, seeing some unusual plants and learning a bit about botany"
,,Education at leisure,5.0,,Very Nice garden offering pleasure with learning. Very Good Collection of plants & trees. As a part of a team event we enjoyed visit to this garden.
,,Peaceful,4.0,,Beautiful gardens to walk around. Healing garden is closed on Tuesday's which was a little disappointing. The place was quiet and very easy to get to. Would go again. Not suitable for elderly (if not used to walking a lot) as the gardens are rather large.
,,A cool place on a hot day.,4.0,,"The days 34 degrees and near 80% humidity were left at the front gate when we visited these gardens, and we enjoyed rambling around and looking at all the many varieties of flowers and statues on display here. The gardens are well set out and easy to follow, with seats here and there for tired legs, or just to sit and appreciate where you are, away from city noises.
One of our group had trouble with the steps there due to knee problems, but if you take your time there, it should not be a problem to negotiate. Do not try to rush it in under an hours visit, this is a place for a relaxed enlightenment. Take your time here."
,,Perfect place to enjoy peace and quiet,5.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens is a nice place to enjoy peace and quiet away from the city crowd of Singapore. Tip: This place is perfect for a morning or sunset jog!
,,Beautiful way to relax,5.0,,"Really lovely way to relax and take a stroll, it's compact enough to do it in 2-3 hours. Beware there's no smoking in the gardens or the car parks attached to it."
,,Absolutely Awesome,5.0,,Thought it would be another Botanic Gardens to fill in time...absolutely not. So much to see. The Orchid Gardens are brilliant for only $5 entrance fee! Spent 3 hours leisurely looking around and could have spent longer. Good cafe and amenities. Highlight - saw squirrels!
,,Excellent evening picnic,5.0,,Enjoyed the open area concert with 3 grand kids(1-4yrs) and very good environment for kids to play on the large grass playground. Nice evening walks along the park and jungle track.
,,A peaceful oasis,5.0,,"We found getting to The Botanic Gardens very easy by using the SMRT, we arrived at the bottom of the gardens but this enabled us to enjoy walking through the gardens to get to the other areas. Neither my husband or I are particularly interested in gardening but both enjoyed getting away from the bustle of the city and recommend allowing at least half a day fro your visit. There is no entrance fee for the gardens and only a small charge to access the Orchid Gardens."
,,Great place tto visit,5.0,,"This is a place to walk, relax and enjoy great gardens. Even in the rain. There is plenty to see and you can spend hours there"
,,Beautiful and free,5.0,,You could easily spend several hours just wandering round here. We particularly liked the orchid collection (for which there is an entrance fee). There's a nice cafe serving drinks and light meals as well.
,,Floral amazment,5.0,,"If nature and flowers amaze you, Botanic Gardens is not to be missed on your trip to Singapore.Its collection of Orchids is amazing and worth paying for."
,,Nice greenery,5.0,,A huge outdoor park that is a good place for a stroll in the early morning and in the evening when the weather and the sun is not too hot. Surrounded by greenery and many plants. Spacious and the kids loved running around in the spacious outdoors.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful place for a walk in the early morning and late afternoon. Avoid during the heat of the day and on Sunday's when it's usually packed with people having picnics. Great little theme gardens within the overall area too. The evolution garden is very well done, a progressive walk through time. It's probably the best I've seen and enjoyable for adults and children alike. Nice little cafe down near the orchard road end of the gardens, or high end restaurants at the opposite end. To walk directly through the whole park from end to end is around 2km. Also a good spot for a run, with a loop of the park around 5km and regular drinking stations. Look out for the free concerts held some weekends around the lake. I recommend catching the downtown MRT line to botanic park station and walking through the garden towards orchard road, stop off for a coffee and snack at Food for Thought cafe at the end."
,,Must see,5.0,,The gardens were excellent and easy to find using public transport. Your will need a couple of hours to explore it properly
,,Wonders of Singapore,5.0,,I have an walk through of complete location. Some of areas with flowers is an extraordinary Beaty. I can say has more than 100 thousands types of Trees in this garden.
,,Oasis in the centre of town,5.0,,Wonderful day spent wandering around the gardens - the area is well maintained and offers plenty of photo opportunity - plenty of spots to sit and reflect - eat / coffee available at different a points - well worth a visit.
,,Exotic Surroundings,5.0,,"I was on a City Tour in Singapore a year or so ago and the tour bus operator suggested I stay in the gardens because I could get back to Orchard Road quite easily. I was in the Gardens for 3 or 4 hours and could not believe that I wasn't in another world! What a beautiful place, the flowers, the orchids and the structures. I have never seen anything like it before and probably never will again. Congratulations to Singapore for this exquisite place with such a beautiful arrangement of floral exhibits I have ever seen."
,,Really worth your time.,5.0,,A fascinating look into Singapores past . Beautifully laid out and extremely well maintained. Just go!
,,Garden in the city,5.0,,"This historic (free entrance) gardens are located very close to the heart of the city. Nearest MRT access is via the Botanic Gardens MRT (Circle and Downtown lines), which bring you to the Eco Lake (eastern) entrance of the park. My traditional entrance is via the NParks HQ, which brings you into the heart of the park. The park has a surprising amount of hidden treasures and habitat variety tucked away within a relatively compact 82 hectares, and without reference to the map, it's easy to miss some hidden treasures within the nooks and crannies. The National Orchid garden is a ""garden-within-a garden"", and additional charge is payable for entry to the orchid garden. Exploring the entire park may take surprisingly long - we took 60 minutes, and even then, missed out the Orchid gardens and many of the other sights. Peace and solitude are not a feature of this garden - even at early dawn, the park is filled with joggers and tai chi'ers. Crowds may thin out at midday as the park may get very hot under the tropical sun.
My personal parts of the garden to date: the evolution garden, which brings you through a Jurassic-park like history of plants. There are three separate lakes to explore, with the most dramatic being Symphony lake, where the ground gradually falls down a tended slope and ends with the symphonic platform.
There is something for everyone here: but you have to enjoy greenery and tended paths."
,,Best to go in the evening,3.0,,"If you like natural stuff, here is a good place for you to relax and enjoy. It is easily accessible via Mrt now can reach easily. Better bring some bread to enjoy feeding the fishes in the pond^^, If you like walking and shopping, you can actually walk to orchard road."
,,"Flowers, Flowers, Flowers, Trees",5.0,,"Every kind of flower and tree! Wonderful! It's a great place to visit in the afternoon when it is hot! Block out plenty of time, to stroll through. A very peaceful place."
,,A stroll in the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Wonderful trees and ferns. The turtles were fascinating. Beautifully kept, a real tranquil spot. I could have spent all day there; it is now accessible by MRT."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,So surprised the gardens were free! Only a $5 fee for the Orchard garden which was definitely worth it! Best botanical garden I've ever been too. Nice getaway from the city.
,,Relaxing but too many people,3.0,,"Visit botanic garden by train.

This park is very good access from botanic garden station, from Orchard takes 15minutes walk.
You can see some animals like lizard and squirrel.

I don't visit orchid garden,
but I don't recommend for tourists for limited time(except who like orchid),
this place is world heritage but nothing special to see.
Recommend someone who stay in Singapore city area to enjoy nature."
,,lovely,5.0,,a lovely experience. so much life in these gardens to entice the senses. would highly recommend to anyone.
,,I am so lucky,5.0,,"I get to visit this beautiful garden daily. I have never once been disappointed with the quality of the park. I exercise there in a group, meet friends for walks, listen to concerts there, take my family there for picnics. It's a must when we have visitors as well. First thing in the morning is stunning. The Colours are glorious and seeing everyone exercising before work or play is wonderful. I love the huge classes of Tai Chi, sword work classes and bootcamps, all nationalities participate in the park which is how I view Singapore, harmonious.

The site deserves its world heritage ranking. My only piece of negative feedback would be the staff working in the park driving the buggies could be a little more friendly professional and welcoming. A smile goes a long way. The gardeners / Cleaners who work tirelessly always have a smile and nod."
,,nice fragrant morning jog,5.0,,love jogging from st regis to the botanical garden in the morning. enjoyed the short loop and green and fragrances from different flowera and plants.
,,Must visit of Singapore!,5.0,,"I have lived in and travelled to Singapore since the mid 1980's. There have been many transformations in this city-state, but few as dramatic as the Botanical Gardens.

What used to be a ""nice colonial leftover"" that most avoided cuz it was ""just too hot to walk around"" is now a World Heritage site and a fantastically done up garden.

It is very well sign marked and there is so much to see. Plan to spend a few hours. It is still hot as blazes so an early morning visit would be the best.

It is probably one of the best things to do in Singapore these days..."
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,"The Botanical gardens are really large and nice, I spent hours here going around and discovered many beauty scenes. However, it was extremly hot, so you miss bring water and a large hat. Free entrance."
,,...an evergreen nature park...,4.0,,Enjoy a guided walk into a tropical rainforest and be fascinated by the ever evolving jungle or cover the gardens at your own leisurely pace to take in all the amazing floral & fauna spread throughout plus of course the amazing orchids and natural & landscaped corners of this haven. Free musical performances are sometimes conducted on weekends...
,,A beautiful santuary in a busy center,5.0,,"I spent a lot of time walking these gardens most days. Good running and walking areas, something new on every end. Of course it's very hot but there are many shady spots to stop and admire the sculptures, plants,waterfalls. Huge spacious areas for picnics( but don't leave your rubbish behind!)
Best of all is the orchid gardens, you do have to pay, but it's definitely worth it. This is most spectacular display I have ever seen. Enjoy nature and relax! Take your camera it's got so much to capture. Take your water too!"
,,Up there with the best.,5.0,,"If you love gardens and a walk, somyourself a favour and head through before leaving Singapore. We only visited because we had time but were so relieved not to have missed out. It's free and contains a beautiful display of orchids and rare plants. The Orchid Garden is contained within, also a must see but costs to enter."
,,Weekly fix!,5.0,,"This is one wonderful place for...the serious botanist, families, picnickers, couples, dog walkers, joggers, tai chi and chi gong groups, zen meditators, music lovers, bird watcher...the list goes on.
Late mornings to the afternoons tend to get hot but the tress and plants love it.
Crowded on weekends but that goes to show how great these gardens are."
,,worth this trip,5.0,,"this is right place to spend some time, relaxing, watching beauty of nature in really peace :) Staff is really helpful ,there is no traffic, take an UBER and go there!"
,,Family Heaven,5.0,,"Clean, green, children friendly. It's a great weekend hang out places with family and friends. Beautiful restaurants, many choices, not the kind for tourists at all! Absolutely local hang out place!"
,,Good activities for a few hours,5.0,,The park is massive and has a lot of beautiful flowers. The cool zone is a welcomed break from the heat. The only part that requires admission is the Orchid section and it is only $5.
,,Botanics,4.0,,One place you can visit over and over and enjoy it each time.The Botanical gardens is also very good place to teach kids revflora and fauna.
,,Beautiful tranquil orchids,5.0,,"The orchid gardens are a must see for anyone who enjoys flowers.
A huge variety of beautiful colours and types of orchids and rainforest trees and plants.
Ticket cost $5 for adult and children under 12 were free. There were some consession prices as well.
Wear comfortable shoes and if you don't want to walk up a hill go to the right path on entrance not to the left.
The gift shop had some beautiful souvenirs but they were a little pricey."
,,Lots to see,5.0,,"Our main purpose for our visit was the Orchid gardens really, but the gardens have so much to see and it was great especially for an amateur photographer like myself but with the sun beating down it soon got a bit too much so the camera had to be put away. The lake at side of the orchid garden is amazing with the amphitheatre just giving it something extra special. Lots of signposts so you cant get lost. Have lunch at the Italian across the road at the MRT station, it’s delicious."
,,Orchid garden !,5.0,,Absolutely love this little gem ! The orchid garden is beautifully curated and well maintain. There is also ample space for the kids to run around and explore the natural surroundings . Shutterbugs remember to get your cameras for this place is a photographer's heaven !
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,We visited the Botanic Gardens early in the morning as heat/humidity slightly lower then and it is a big place to explore. it is open from 5AM. First stop was the orchid house which was everything I had expected. The orchids are magnificent. It cxan be very hot/humid here but there are a couple of 'cool houses' on the way around so you can cool off before you continue. The whole garden is really well designed. Recommended and right by MRT station
,,Beautiful - one of the best anywhere,5.0,,Leave to Singapore to create an indoor rainforest when they are located on the equator in the rainforest zone. But that's how meticulous the designers were of the outdoor and indoor exhibits. A combination of beautiful plantings and specimens with two indoor attractions (we only did the mountain rainforest) and it is all beautiful. A great morning walk - be careful when it gets hot later in the day. The mountain rainforest is highly recommended and worth the separate price of admission. The rest of the gardens are open to the public for free.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"A huge variety of different gardens such as the healing garden, orchid garden, evolution garden, etc. Definitely a place you could go to a few times to see the entire thing!"
,,Beautiful Botanic Gardens.,5.0,,Well worth a visit to see an amazing display of tropical plants that surround the paths as you walk around.Also has a Ginger Garden and a Orchid Garden which are must see.. Refreshments are available which is good on the very hot days.
,,The long and winding road,5.0,,"A truly humbling experience when you walk on a path lined with trees which have seen so so so many years gone by... wish they could talk and tell you tales of all they have seen and heard.

Interesting to see young ones going about their jog/ exercise and some just strolling.

Dinner at the restaurants tucked away in the center serving delicious food with some fantastic service just adds to the whole experience.

I believe they have some great music concerts there too... wish I can be there for one when I visit it next... and also carry back some of the jam being sold."
,,Nice gardens to spend your morning or evening at,4.0,,Large gardens to walk around in Singapore. Easily accessible via public transport. Orchid gardens are within 20 mins from the Botanic Garden MRT.
,,Good park in the heart of the city,4.0,,"Good green area. The kids had fun at the park, with ponds with tortoises, swan and pigeons. They have a special children park, Jacob Ballas, good time for the kids. Clean park which is enjoyed by people of all ages, family and friends. Free access."
,,Nice even for a person who dislikes gardens.,4.0,,Don't really like gardens at the best of times but this one was good. Was extremely hot when walking around but it is Singapore which is hotter than hell in general. Was a good ice cream shop half way through and the swinging seat things near the Taglin entrance were fun.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This place is about the only place I remember from a very long ago trip and it is just as, if not more, memorable now. Shady and serene, it is definitely worth a some hours of your time."
,,A beautiful place,5.0,,One of the few free places to visit whilst in Singapore. I spent hours here walking all over these beautiful gardens easy to get to with MRT or busses.The more you walk the more beauty you discover. Don't miss this treasure while in Singapore. Bring a hat and water.
,,Beautiful & Extensive,4.0,,"The Botanical gardens are very beautiful and very large. I started rather early in the morning - a very good idea so it's possible to see a lot of the park before the heat is too bad. The Orchid Garden is wonderful and well worth the small fee. I was able to see about 3/4 of the park before I was too tired to go any farther. There is a lot of shade and many benches - very helpful. The only downside is that there were not very many labels to tell me the names of the plants which is why I did not rate it as excellent. I saw so many beautiful and unfamiliar flowers and plants all over Singapore and I had hoped to find out their names at the Botanic Garden and didn't learn anything. Yes, there were some labels, but not enough."
,,Greenery everywhere,5.0,,"It's a wonderful attraction located practically adjacent to Orchard Road. It is 150+ years old but it is a peaceful haven for locals and tourists alike. There is something for all age groups. Many fitness freaks use the peaceful environment for their running activities without the chaos of the traffic and the associated noise.

It requires a certain basic level of fitness as the Botanical garden path is undulating and there are many instances of uphill and downhill slopes so the elderly need to proceed with caution. It's important to carry sunscreen as the garden is exposed to the elements. There are small covered wooden shelters for conducting picnics.

This is a unique place to locate swans both black and white in the various waterbodies. There are many sightings of monitor lizards especially around the water bodies but they are small and harmless. There are quite a few places to feed koi fish with specially prepared fish food.

The Orchid Garden is a must see attraction, though the entry fee is separate but reasonable. There is also a Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage in the centre of the garden. It is a wonderful atmosphere to listen to live music during concerts."
,,Infinite photography possibilities,5.0,,Fantastic natural spot in Singapore. I strongly recommend to pay the $5 and step into the orchids garden. Photographer? Wide-angle and macro are a must!
,,Lovely park,4.0,,This is one of the nicest parks I have visited well laid out good directions plenty of shade to sit and relax or do as the locals do take a picnic and chill under a tree
,,Natural beauty,5.0,,"Wonderful park, well worth a visit. Better to do earlier in the morning before it gets too hot. The Orchid Garden is well worth paying up for."
,,Lunch amongst the orchids,4.0,,"Took time out while enjoying Singapore's remarkable Botanical Gardens to have a light lunch and a refreshing cool drink at the cafe. Greeted by friendly business like staff with menus and offers to stay in air conditioned comfort or outside amongst the tree ferns and orchids. Mr ""Castro "" was our waiter who guided our lunch time selection, delightfully pushy but knew instinctively how far to go. Attempted several closures on the cafe's new salad dressing, that appears to be currently on promotion.
The meal arrived promptly along with drinks, fresh, tasty and well presented. Enjoyable meal with friendly banter from an extremely efficient waiter person"
,,The swan lake is so serene,5.0,,"Beautifully cared for gardens and so much to see. Loved the Lake and the pagodas dotted everywhere. The cactus garden and the swings under the frangipani trees, the orchid garden, the ""little rooms"" everywhere you meandered! Just lovely."
,,A terrific taste of the tropics,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Garden is widely considered the best in Asia, and deservedly so. It has several remarkable sections, including orchids (it has developed numerous hybrid varieties that are now widely commercialised), medicinal plants (arranged by the types of ailments they treat), an evolution garden (with numerous ancient, extinct, and fossilised species),and a fragrant garden that is a real treat after dark when the flowers send out their scents. It also has a children's garden, and allows pets (on a leash). It's a popular place to spend a day, for both Singaporeans and visitors. And it has earned recognition as a World Heritage site from UNESCO, giving a global endorsement to its quality. Interesting that it was nominated as a Cultural Site, which is certainly appropriate given the role it plays in science, technology, and tourism. It might not have the artistic attractiion of the Gardens by the Bay, but it is more natural and conducts significant research that is widely recognised as being of top quality. But for the visitor, a pleasant walk through the garden is sufficient reward in itself."
,,Beautiful.,5.0,,When we arrived at the gardens we saw a tour of the rain forest was about to take place. We joined the tour led by a retired gentleman who was so knowledgeable and we thoroughly enjoyed. Had we just walked around the rain forest alone we would never have notices or appreciated all the things that were pointed out.
,,Avery nice place to walk around and learn about plants,4.0,,"Garden is a declared World Heritage Site. Spread across about 65 acres of land has a good collection of plants world over. They have developed theme gardens like evolution garden, palm garden, fragrence garden etc. Around the lake they have developed a palm garden with a stage for concerts. Must see for all plant lovers!"
,,One of my favs places in Sg,5.0,,"This is one of my favourite places to hang out in Singapore. Spend a few hours walking around the garden, you may actually forget you are in a busy city. The cafe is always busy and I supposed the food is quite good. It's charming and tranquil."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"This gardens exceed our expectactions !!! Orchid garden is a must see !!! There is a big area to visit, so take enough time to stay. The best way to get there is MRT, the station with the same name."
,,Simply Beautiful. Worthy of its World Heritage Status,5.0,,As far as botanical gardens go this has got to be one of the finest I have ever seen. The gardens are free to enter with the exception of the orchid garden but as it only costs $5SGD for an adult it is more than worth the price. The orchids are spectacular. There are nooks and crannies everywhere for a quiet sit down or just to enjoy the surroundings. The gardens are a credit to the city. The maintenance must be huge and yet it obviously gets done as everything is kept to almost garden perfection. Well worth the walk to take in the beauty of this place.
,,Must visit for some peaceful time,5.0,,"Excellently maintained by NParks, Singapore, Botanical Gardens should be must-see attraction for any tourist. One gets to see variety of Flora from across the world.

Huge place - So carry good amount of water, wear loose clothes, and avoid walking directly under the sun, to have a great experience."
,,Wonderful place with nice children garden,5.0,,"The place was serene, huge and clean. The children garden was nice touch and you can only enter if you have children with you. There is a water play area for kids so don't forget their swimsuits and swimming diapers!"
,,"Lovely gardens, great kids area",5.0,,"We took the train here on our first day in Singapore. We wandered the gardens for a while which are vast (considering the size of Singapore) and themed into groups. We went to the Children's Garden which was great. The only disappointing thing was that the water play area was closed. Our boys (6 & 8) loved the tree house play area as did we because we could just sit in the shade and watch them. The whole tree house play area is well shaded.
Do take lots of water as a didn't find too many places to refill our water bottles. For the main areas of the gardens, do take an umbrella as there are lots of open space which get pretty hot and sunny. We took and used umbrellas in these sections.
We headed to the main headquarters in the centre of the park for lunch. The adults shared a pizza and the kids had fish and chips. All were reasonable priced for such an establishment. The food was indeed lovely and the setting beautiful, even though it was busy (being a Saturday). Staff were very helpful and polite.
There is a lovely gift shop there that is a bit pricey but has some wonderful gifts for the botanically inclined.
The gardens have wide and level sealed paths so pushing a wheelchair/stroller would not be a problem. A little hilly in parts, but nothing that should dissuade you from coming.
It was a really great day to start our holiday."
,,Pure delightful!,5.0,,This is a must while visiting Singapore as we were overwhelmed by the beautiful sights of the gardens here. It was a wonderful day and we had lunch there also !
,,What an amazing place!,5.0,,Only had four hours as I was meeting the grandchildren off the school bus so concentrated on the orchid garden. The walk from the visitor's centre stimulates all the senses! Such a paradise in the middle of this busy city. Senior tickets at $5 ! Once again I want in the middle of the week so it wasn't too busy! You could go every day for a week in order to take it all in! Magnificent!
,,A shady garden in the tropical setting,5.0,,"The gardens are magnificently tropical and whilst there we would recommend paying the fee to see the orchid garden, it is wonderful and fragrant.

The gardens are a leisurely walk from the Orchard Road shopping precinct (about 2kms) and the gardens are enormous and with more time we could have seen a lot more of them.

As it was we were there for two and a half hours and saw about half of the gardens. It was a hot and humid day but the gardens provided some welcome shade and cool nooks. Highly recommended."
,,Beautiful tropical gardens,4.0,,"I'm a frequent visitor to the gardens with my family. The vast lawns & shady trees bring us away from our busy schedules, giving us the much needed break over the weekends. Love the cafes where we can enjoy a cuppa soaking in the nature. Well located just outside Orchard area."
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"The gardens cover a very large area and divided into sections. My favourite the Orchid Garden costs seniors $1 or others $5 to enter. An interesting walk thru the ginger garden with the best flowering time of year to visit is between June and August. Other areas include childrens garden, trellis, bougainvillea and bamboo collection, lakes and plenty of eating choices."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Lovely few hours spent walking round here. Great gardens and there are a few shops and a restaurant in the middle.
,,Crown Of Garden Country,5.0,,A full day activity which needs lot of patience to walk and see the efforts behind concept. This world Heritage site is age groups must visit attraction.
,,Well worth a look,5.0,,"One of my favourite things to do on vacation is to go to Botanic gardens, I have been to a few now but this is by far the best. There is an amazing selection of exotic plants and flowers and is set in a beautiful location right in the but somehow you feel detached from all the noise and busyness.

They also offer boat rides around the lake but unfortunately the weather did not permit us to do this but this would be something I would love to do if I were to return.

The cost may initially seem a bit steep but defiantly worth it if you like plants and flowers or even if you just want a nice peaceful and relaxing walk."
,,I love running around here,5.0,,"Whenever I stay in Singapore I tend to be at an hotel close to the Botanical Gardens so I can run there in the morning.

Its great to see lots of people from young to old, run, do circuit training, tai chi, yoga and just about anything else you can think of.

It can also get rather crowded at times on the smaller walkways.

Anyway love it here"
,,"Lovely gardens, free for all visitors, but take an umbrella, as weather may suddenly change.",4.0,,"Lovely gardens to stroll. Lovely plants and foliage . Please take a raincoat or umbrella as it rained whilst we were there. Lovely gift shop inside as well, with a cafe."
,,Beautiful and well thought out,5.0,,"We had a wonderful day at Singapore's botanic garden. We really enjoyed the layout of separate sections, especially the medicinal use, the gardens through the age, the foliage garden, the ginger garden, and so much more! The fact that the gardens are free is more than commendable. We did also visit the orchid garden though which was not expensive and worth paying for. There are several food and drink outlets within the gardens too which is great on a hot day. Despite a lengthy visit we still didn't see the entire gardens, we'd be more than happy to return though."
,,Wear your walking shoes!,5.0,,"I was totally unprepared for the Singapore Botanic gardens. It was so beautiful. I wish I had worn my walking shoes and packed some water - sunscreen is a must. There is so much to see and so much space to cover that if you have love for gardens, you are going to want to spend a great deal of time here. There are plenty of walking tracks around here that lead you through the large number of plant environments the gardens have to offer."
,,Well worth a look,4.0,,Not being an avid green thumb I was skeptical about visiting the Botanic Gardens. However it came recommended to me. I was glad I took up an offer to walk the grounds. It was well thought out and very well kept. A great getaway to enjoy the nature side of Singapore or even go for a jog should you enjoy the humidity
,,Enjoy a good morning walk back to Orchard :),5.0,,"Grab a map (at the entrance with MRT) and start walking all the way to Tanglin exit , and further down to Orchard Road! If you want , you can also stop by one of the cafes / restaurants located within Botanic Gardens for a hearty breakfast. Picnic will be another great option as well."
,,Lush Tropical Landscape,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are a must visit for anyone interested in plants and flowers. An oasis of calm in the city. You can walk around the immaculate pathways and admire the beautiful tropical plants.
,,Large park where you will feel very hot!,4.0,,The Botanic Gardens is a very large park with a big lake where you will see fish and turtles...and some lovely statuary. It's quite a long walk from one entrance to the other and I have to say on my visits I have found it to be incredibly hot. It can be quite tiring walking around but the trees are varied and you may see mynas and some more exotic birds. I have also seen a very large monitor lizard there. Highlight is the Orchid Collection which has a cool house where you can cool down. There are several eating places including the excellent Halia restaurant and there is a good gift shop. The ginger garden is interesting and you can buy a delicious ginger drink. At Halia you can indulge yourself with a refreshing non alcoholic ginger jive cocktail.....alcoholic cocktails are also available! If you are spending a few days in Singapore it is worth a visit but it wouldn't be a priority for me if I only had a short stopover....apart from the Orchid Collection which is fab. The gardens are free except for the Orchid Collection for which there is a small charge. Accessible by MRT or taxi
,,Local and tourist a must to visit,5.0,,"Nature at its best.
Local or tourist, here is the place if you love nature and flowers. Big hectares of land, caters to nature. Wide selection of flowers to see. Good restaurants amidst the sanctuary. Just wander around and enjoy the fresh air. Great for strolling, picnic, jogging and relaxation. Accessible by train, Botanic Garden train station or even bus from Orchard Road."
,,A tranquil setting in the midst of a bustling city-state,5.0,,What an array of fauna and flora. Perhaps the best botanic gardens outside the UK Time well spent in between the hustle and bustle of shopping in Singapore
,,A large garden of Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore Botanical Garden is such great garden to visit, where you can sit with your friends just for going around to enjoy the smell of the grass and trees. Or perhaps you wanna be there with your love ones. Anywhere you can have chances to take great puctures, since this garden can be your perfect natural background. I was there with my new friends, we took pictures anywhere. I had great time here. And will come again next time :)"
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,"Black swans, fish and ducks in the lake; abundant orchids; every kind of tropical plant and trees, some of which are very old. A beautiful place to wander and ponder."
,,Beautiful Sunday morning,5.0,,It is a beautiful garden with great area for picnics and some outdoor strolling paths that lead you to various spots of beauty within. The mesmerizing swans at the swan lake and the orchid garden is a must to see. There are also outdoor performances at the stage built on top of the pond. Overall wonderful day spent
,,'Free Fresh air',4.0,,"Go there every Sunday morning, enjoy the fresh air and quiet garden. Love the orchids and the tropical flowers, there are many type of trees. If you don't like the hot sun, you may walk into the rain forest and occasionally could spot some beautiful birds, squirrels and owls too"
,,Singapore Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"Wonderful experience that keeps giving! An amazing ""Must Do"" that is very educational. Allow 3 hours at least and don't miss out the Ginger (free) and Orchid Gardens ($5 or $1 for over 60s)."
,,Who're We Kidding,3.0,,"Cannot understand why this is UNESCO World Heritage Site ( UWHS ) . It's pretty impressive and not bad at all, but how can it even begin to compare to other UWHS like Angkor Wat ?!?!?!"
,,Early morning visit,4.0,,A wonderful garden to visit. Fascinating plants and beautiful surroundings. We made the mistake of going mid morning and it was just too hot to enjoy it properly. It opens early in the morning and that would be the better time to go. Very well cared for.
,,Peacefull..,5.0,,perfect place. very peacefull and nice place. you feed your eyes and your soul.. price is a bit expensive.
,,garden of beauty,5.0,,"a wonderful respite from a busy life... the garden refreshes the soul,,, the mind and the heart.. great place to stroll specially in early mornings"
,,Wow!,5.0,,"If you like orchids, this is worth the trip. Plenty of varieties and displays. Be sure to take your camera."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"Spend the whole day there and really enjoy the ambience and spectacular flora and fauna. Don't rush it, there's way too much to see and enjoy. The orchid garden was fabulous, such an amazing variety of flowering orchids. Well worth the day!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Tropical paradise in a beautiful city . This is a must visit place whilst in Singapore . The fauna and flora are simply stunning . The gardens are free to visit but there is a small charge for the orchid garden but worth every penny .Easily reached by the MRT or the hop on hop off bus . Give yourself plenty of time as there is lots to see . There is a lovely cafe serving a good choice of food . A good place to go for breakfast before the heat of the day kicks in . Also lovely to watch the locals perform tai chi . So peaceful.
,,Greeny,5.0,,"paid for 2 tours. The guide just left me at the Botanic garden where no public transportation because he didnt mention where to wait and I wait at difference place. I asked to cancel the 2nd tour 48hours in advance but Viator said the local agent Tour East wouldnt refund!!!

I called local tour agent...no APOLOGY. Only blaming I was responsible and ""FUNNY"" that only 4ppl were left behind.

Itinerary included 15 mins 5 place which gem factory is not in itinerary.

VIATOR will only gave me their terms and conditons! They sold me to the local agent!!! They hv nothing to do!!!

If you want to try how to be abandoned under hot and no transportation... go for their tour!!! EXTREME EXPERIENCE!!!!"
,,Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage site,5.0,,"The gardens deserve their latest accolade bestowed by UNESCO. Unfortunately, with fame comes more popularity and the gardens are overrun with people especially on the weekend.
Look out for historic trees some of which have been there for 100 years, and take time to walk around Swan Lake and Symphony Lake. You must also go into the orchid enclosure.
Some new additions are the herb garden the research facility.
Corner House is a colonial bungalow in the garden serving only a degustation menu, pricey but worth it. There are other eateries worth trying like Halia with a beautiful wooden terrace and jazz on Sunday.
If you are very lucky you may encounter the resident monitor lizards who are territorial and live in and around the the lakes.
Enjoy this classical retreat from the city while in Singapore, it's worth your while."
,,Heritage trail,4.0,,Back to nature stroll and embrace the openness. It was nice to visit the old oak tree in the compound. An opportunity to pick saga seeds as its trees are rare in Singapore nowadays.
,,A lovely gentle walk,5.0,,"I love visiting the botanic gardens - there are many different routes to take and it is very well signposted. Local people love coming here for picnics under the trees, but it never seems terribly crowded as there is so much space. Last time I went I spotted a kingfisher by the lake, where there are also turtles."
,,A safe and beautiful Botanic Garden with its very own Swan Lake,5.0,,"This is truly a beautiful garden - make sure that you allow at least a half day to enjoy it. There are so many interesting areas to visit within the garden, especially the National Orchid garden. We also enjoyed a welcome rest and a ginger tea at the café in the ginger garden. Dennis, our waiter, was excellent - very friendly and knowledgeable. The gardens are open until midnight!"
,,Sacnctuary,4.0,,A lovely hideaway from cosmopolitan Singapore. The garden is well maintained. There are excellent opportunities for great photography.
,,In the heart of the city,4.0,,Just off of Orchard Rd the Botanic Gardens are a great escape from city life. You can just enjoy the trees and ponds or see some unique orchids. As a local there are often concerts or events which are fun to attend. Great place for kids to run around.
,,Great place to chill out at no cost,5.0,,"This is a huge garden, exceptionally presented with its manicured lawns & well kept arrangements. Fish, Turtles & Swans can be easily seen on Swan Lake. From the Frangipani garden with its many swings for all to enjoy to the Sun Dial garden or the Bonsai garden up to the Gingers on our way to the Orchid Garden, the only paying part of the garden & 2 restaurants to choose from there. About 7 throughout the park. The amphitheatre looked magnificent surrounded by water & plants."
,,A beautiful garden you don't want to miss bisiting,5.0,,"I know Singapore is all about food and shopping when you come here, but if you have time to spare visit the botanic gardens. It is a beautiful place to relax your souls , encounter the rainforest of Singapore and see beautiful orchids. If you are here on a weekend check if there is a concert going on. The fields will be filled up quickly with families in tow with picnic baskets. It is such a wonderful relaxing occasion. Singapore is a beautiful garden city but a visit to the botanical gardens completes the experience"
,,botanic gardens,5.0,,these gardens are well worth anyone visiting them if you are in Singapore they cost nothing to get in and you could spend all day just wandering round admiring the plants and lakes. All the staff were so friendly and helpful.
,,Flower gardens extraordinaire,5.0,,"Stunning gardens with an array of flowers. Concert stage in middle, with pond, with fish and monitor lizards just for fun....they are big! Lovely place to have a wander in cooler part of the day. And best of all it's free and open all day"
,,Great place to spend several hours.,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens is more expansive than I expected. Such a variety of trees and plants as well as a beautiful lake with swans and turtles. Plenty of places to sit. Limited food available. Entry is free.
,,Beautiful.,5.0,,"Peaceful, beautifully maintained, and also housing the Orchid Garden, which is simply stunning. The gardens are extensive, so give yourself plenty of time. There is also a large restaurant which offers good value meals."
,,A Must Visit UNESCO heritage...Singapore Botanical Gardens.,5.0,,I really love the orchid gardens with so many different varieties of orchids & bursts of Colours. It's just beautiful walking around & admiring the different orchids named after celebrities & VIPs around the world. Admission is $5/ pax & free for kids into the orchid gardens whereas for the rest of the gardens it's free admission. Also the swan lake & Ginger garden. If you have kids do pop by at children's garden. Lots of eateries within the gardens. We had lunch at the Casa Verde..pricing is very reasonable & great food as well.
,,Definitely worth a visit and it's free..............,4.0,,"Amongst the high rise concrete jungle that is Singapore, the botanical gardens is a breath of fresh air. The noise of the city is never far away but at least you are surrounded by green.

There is an excellent orchid section that only costs the equivalent of £2.50 to enter. The whole garden is very well designed with many of the trees over a hundred years old. If you like Kew Gardens in London then you'll love this."
,,Excellant allow plenty of time.,5.0,,"A beautiful oasis in the middle of the city. A real escape from the hectic life of the city. A great place to visit. Allow plenty of time. There is so much to see, we've been loads of times and still see things we've missed before. Try and get there during concert season, the concerts are fabulous!"
,,a nice day out,5.0,,A lovely day out well maintained very green and calming with a big lake with swans and if your quick you can get a photo of a monitor lizard or 2 nice sculptures and its free The Orchid garden has a small charge but its well worth a visit
,,An oasis in the city,5.0,,"The visit to this location coincided with the weekend break and perhaps this did diminish the experience a trifle. It is easy to locate and there are numerous hard surfaced pathways that are suitable for wheelchairs and well sign posted at reasonable points to enable the area to be navigated. A variety of boards showing your location and where you may wish to go are listed alphabetically in English.
The park is packed with joggers of all shapes, sizes and sexes, clearly indicating how safe it is for women and children alike. It was also nice to notice the dogs on leads being taken for walks, or being carried, and the water fountains used by both people and animals alike (not to my liking).
There are literally hundreds of trees of many varieties, but all having come from warmer climates that supported the growth of them. The information boards provided gave some background as to their origin and reminded the visitor of the part Europeans paid in developing Singapore to what it is today.
There is a large lake with a central island and this perhaps is the nesting area for the two white swans. Walking round, a small ""monitor"" lizard, rodent, squirrel and a variety of birds meant that our interest was kept alive during a particularly hot day. That the Europeans only ""suffered"" from the heat was obvious, as the various families played games, ate their food and generally used the area in the old fashioned ways a park used to be used,
There are, as you would expect, a gift shop and benches scattered around the area and soft drinks readily available. The gardens are very well maintained and it is really hard to rationalise the fact that it is situated in the middle of this vibrant city."
,,very green and peaceful,5.0,,Lovely garden with nice water bodies and tracks to jog and walk. A day well spent. Got great food options as well. Look out for the park concerts that happen here. Again one of the best parks i have been to.
,,Really lovely bring water,5.0,,Gets really hot and humid walking around so bring water and enjoy the lovely plants and trees. There are swans in the lake too.
,,A very big park,3.0,,"This is basically a very big park, every three has a small plate with its name on it but no further information is given. It is beautiful and very well maintained with different sections but all in all i missed the more informative part of a botanic garden. Still a great place to stroll around and escape the noise from the city."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"Take the MRT to Botanic Gardens and you are there. Large gardens to amble around at your leisure, with wildlife wandering freely. The Orchid House is well worth the entrance fee and a highlight for orchid lovers."
,,Stunning. Gorgeous.,5.0,,We enjoy gardening and walking. This combined the best of both! The Orchids are so beautiful-could easily spend a day just enjoying them!!
,,Lovely garden for running,4.0,,"This is a beautiful garden with lots of interest and variety. I use it for running when I stay at the Shangri-La in Singapore. It is a great place to run with easy to follow, well sign-posted paths and very safe."
,,Relief from the concrete jungle that is Singapore,5.0,,"This was a pleasant contrast to the sky rise landscape of tall buildings. We only covered a limited area but what we saw was beautiful. Orchids were special part even though small charge for this part of the garden. Asia was a new experience for us therefore seeing different species of birds, reptiles butterflies in a natural environment was exciting. Some of the lizards were quite large. The only negative aspects were our European bodies struggled with the weather being hotter and more humid than we were use to. The modern desire to take millions of photos was wearing as groups blocked the view of some exhibits whilst they performed numerous selfies or adopted ever more ridiculous vain poses. I would definitely return if in Singapore again."
,,Visit with my wife,4.0,,This gardens is spectacular. Take a day to explore the whole garden Fantastic. It is abolutely worth every minutr you spend there.
,,A must see,5.0,,This botanic garden is the most impressive we have ever been to. We spent a whole afternoon there and still only saw a third of it. An absolute must while visiting Singapore!
,,A garden of Eden,5.0,,"Stunning array of flora, so well maintained. You hardly feel that you're in the city, feels like you're amid nature in a forest. There are many theme gardens, you can spend many hours and peacefully walk around. Locals gather for many activities and fitness, some walk their pets and dogs too!"
,,Relaxing and enjoyable,5.0,,This is an indoor man made mountain with a giant waterfall and gardens of ferns flowers and plants of all kind. You walk all around it up to the top and back amongst the cool environment. There are many wood carvings and sights to see on the way. It's very enjoyable and a great escape from the heat.
,,If you like nature never miss this garden,5.0,,"I go to this garden every time when I am in Singapore, sometimes even twice. The garden is large and it is impossible to see the whole garden in one day. At least I do not know how to do it. So, every time when I go these I am targeting a specific section of the garden. My favorite one is the orchid part. In fact this is the best orchid garden that I have seen until now."
,,"Love this place, especially at night",5.0,,Just get lost in these gardens! I usually jog there at night. Closes late. Many restaurants within the park.
,,Favourite Place in Singapore,4.0,,"An oasis in the middle of the city. Step inside, and within minutes you a million miles from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Beautiful flowers, grand trees, myriad birds and reptiles, and great free concerts and events.

A deserved point of pride among Singaporeans (and adopted Singaporeans like myself!)."
,,Green Green Green,4.0,,Its a big garden. Need almost half day to explore it. S$5 for enterening orchid garden which is part of this garden. Good place to walk and relax. Can do good photoshoot as well. Well maintained garden.
,,Amazing Gardens,5.0,,"Spent nearly a whole day in this amazing place! So many beautiful plants, gorgeous orchids and many more unusual plants."
,,Variety of plants and flowers,4.0,,"I almost got lost in the garden as I was to mesmerize by the beautiful surrounding of flower and plants. There are a few section and I love the Healing Garden the most as it potray and show plants that can be use for medicine and cure even serious health issues. There are so much information and beauty to absorb in just a few hours. I suggest spend a few hours here, walk slowly or briskly and explore all the garden here. It's worth it."
,,Love and fantastic for orchidee lover,5.0,,I really love this place. For me need litle more indication sign and description of the garden . I think i should go wan is the season and i shoud ask because allot orchid was still no ready. But was also nice
,,A great escape from the bussle of Singapore,5.0,,We caught the hop on hop off bus to here and were impressed the moment we enter the gardens. The gardens have a huge variety of plants displayed in different areas and each area is unique. The only down side was it is not easy to navigate even with the map and signage is somewhat confusing at times. Overall though we are very glad we visited and considered it one of the highlights of our stay in Singapore.
,,Beautiful mature gardens,5.0,,Lots of interesting plants and orchids. It was a very enjoyable walk around. We went in the morning so it was not overly hot. Take a bottle of water with you. Only S$1 for pensioners.
,,Gorgeous gardens,5.0,,"This place is huge! We got a lot of walking in this day. We took the MRT to it and the bus out to orchard road.

The gardens are so clean and pretty. We even saw a huge lizard there. Pay the $5 and see the orchid house. Well worth it!"
,,Nature runaway,5.0,,"Botanical gardens are huge! If you want to cover it all you should divide it at least for 2 days. The surroundings are very pleasant and clean. Visit evolution and fragrance gardens, walk around the lakes and definitely visit and Orchid Garden (it is a must). Bring plenty of water, there are refilling stations around."
,,A nice timeout from the busy city life,4.0,,The garden is very well decorated and organised. I walked for about 2.5 km from one end to another. It's a wonderfull place for jogging and leisure walking.
,,Unforgettable Experience!,5.0,,"Absolutely fabulous! I was amazed about how incredibly neat and clean Singapore is. The way they design and arrange and manage this park is very impressive. There are so many different attractions. You don't need to be a fan of trees or flowers. Taking a stroll and jog is also highly recommended. The evolution garden is a must go for nature and science lover. I thought I was in the middle of Jurassic Park at one point. There is great basin attraction that resembles Jurassic Park as well. The garden has the hint of Central Park, Hawaii, New Orleans, and Amazon Rain Forest... More importantly, it's completely free, very neat and clean."
,,Lovely Gardens,5.0,,"We make it a habit to visit botanical gardens wherever we go and we were very happy we did here in Singapore.
The gardens are really quite extensive. We'd intended to take a bus to one end, walk though and get the MRT back but we couldn't locate the right bus stop from where we were so we ended up doing a circular route arriving and departing on the MRT.
Well worth the visit, next time we'd plan to spend more time and take a picnic."
,,"Excellent, very big",5.0,,"We loved the Botanic gardens. It's a huge garden, but very beautiful and easy to find your own peaceful secluded part."
,,Singapore,5.0,,It was mind-blowing garden. It felt like being in heaven actually. So relaxing and at the gift shop the staff were really sophisticated and calm and polite.They send such good vibes actually.
,,Green & clean,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Garden (accessible via Botanic Gardens MRT station on the Downtown Blue Line) is an oasis in the middle of a city filled with skyscrapers. Entrance is free. Its a great place to picnic with family or snooze under a shady tree. Black swans can be spotted in the pond. There are covered shelters too, though not too many. Numerous trails. A children's park also exists with a mini cafeteria. Also home to the Orchid Garden (there's an admission fee for this). Bring plenty of water/ drinks while visiting this place."
,,Brings lots of water,3.0,,This place is big and free and big! Bring lots of water when going here especially during summer. Bring an umbrella as well if you can. Lots of opportunity for Photos and there are restaurants inside and outside the garden
,,Beautiful Gradens,4.0,,Lovely gardens.We came here because we went to the Orchids Gardens.Whilst we had a bit of a walk around we found it too hot to stay out and really enjoy the gardens..probably best to do in the late morning or early evening .
,,Beautiful Tranquility in Singapore,5.0,,"I spent a good couple of hours here by myself wandering around. There's lots to see, beautiful flowers, wonderful gardens and a little highlight for me was the turtles in the lake. It's part of the tour bus route, so worth a jump off that!"
,,"Good day out, lots to look at around every corner",4.0,,"Large, green area obviously enjoyed by locals as well as tourists. Well laid out with good signage and plenty of places to eat and drink or take your own and sit under a tree of by the pond."
,,Great orchid garden,5.0,,I had a great experience of exploring the botanic garden in Singapore. It's huge and has various of theme focused sites. I love the restaurant next to ginger garden. The orchid garden is nice and I managed to get a discounted price by showing the traveler pass.
,,Lovely free way to spend a morning or afternoon in Singapore,5.0,,"Not only are the Singapore Botanic Gardens FREE, but they are also absolutely stunning. From the rainforest to the bonsai to the bamboo, there is so much to see here. I came on a cloudy/borderline rainy day, so I was speedwalking somewhat to beat the rain, but it still took me about an hour to cover the entire gardens (minus the orchids, which you have to pay extra for, so I skipped). It is a very relaxing atmosphere, and I could have easily spent another hour here, had the weather not been threatening. If you have time free to relax in Singapore, this is a great option."
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,My second time at the botanical gardens and it was just as good second time around. Advise go early because of the heat and take plenty of water. Have breakfast in the cafe - the food is good value and delicious. A good mix of local favourites and western food. The gardens are beautiful. You can spend the whole day there. The highlight is the orchid garden and is better than any of the other botanic gardens I have visited all over the world. Take your time to appreciate how beautiful this place is.
,,GO!!!,5.0,,Easy just off the metro. Nice place to spend the day strolling the park. I would go back again and again. Many families there enjoying a nice after noon.
,,The exquisitely beautiful National Orchid Garden is a must-see! :),5.0,,"You could easily spend 3 hours in the lovely and serene Singapore Botanic Gardens. I highly recommend a visit to the National Orchid Garden, which houses the world's largest collection of orchids. The vast and exquisite array of orchids and exotic flowers were absolutely stunning to look at so make sure to bring your camera with you to take some amazing pictures! I also spotted a spotted dove inside the garden haha (pun intended). The botanic garden itself is free for visitors to enter whilst the National Orchid Garden is priced at just 5S$ for adults or 1S$ for students and senior citizens.

I'm not surprised the gardens became Singapore’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site as it is outstandingly beautiful. The flawlessly maintained gardens are perfect for a quiet and relaxing walk. You can also sit by the lake with a good book and watch the swans elegantly swim by. The Botanic Gardens MRT station is very close to the entrance of the gardens making it easily accessible by public transport.

Definitely bring some mosquito spray with you as when I was sitting on a swinging bench to rest, I saw a mosquito land right on my leg and I had to squish the pesky little bloodsucker! Bring a water bottle with you as well since you can easily spend a few hours in here admiring all the captivating plants and wildlife. I even saw a massive spider the size of a hand yikes! A cockerel strutting its stuff around the garden also gave me a good chuckle. Nature-lovers, you will definitely not regret a visit to the gorgeous Singapore Botanic Gardens! :)"
,,My fav singapore spot!,5.0,,"If u only have one day in Singapore do not miss the botanic gardens! It is simply beautiful and relaxing and free!

Green green and more green! Take a bus from busy Orchard or Holland village for a dose of nature! It has its own train stop so very easy to access!

If u have time do not miss the orchard garden...its the biggest variety in the world and only $5 entrance!

Best time to go is anytime but stick to early morning and late afternoon as it is a stunning time of day, peacefull and u can watch all the locals and residents exercising!

If u happen to be around over a weekend - check the online calender for free open air concerts on sunday afternoons!

Just love escaping city life to this special place!"

Truly a refreshing place to go around."

Very well maintained, a good spot to go with family and kids with the play mood. You have to walk for about 20 minutes to reach the Orchid Garden.

If you love plants a must go. If you love to just walk through the greens this is the place."
,,"Ahh, the beautiful Singapore Botanic Gardens - a joy to behold and a pleasure to stroll",5.0,,"One of Singapore's finest and most enduring attractions is the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Recently accorded the honor of being the first and only tropical botanic garden on the UNESCO’s World Heritage List. It is the first in Asia and the third botanic gardens inscribed in the world following Orto botanico di Padova and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

,,Well maintained,4.0,,Within the heart of the city is Singapore Botanic Garden.It has ver good collection of plants and flowers.Very refreshing!

,,Lots to see,5.0,,"Easy to get to, the Orchid gardens are beautiful and worth a look at just $5 entry free. The gardens are otherwise free with lots of different areas you could spend hours wondering. There is a cafe restaurant, toilets and water fountains easily accessible.

Nice cafe and restaurants are there too.
Don't miss the beautiful orchid garden (with small fee) and make sure to walk all the way to the lovely pond. I would love to go to a concert at their open air theater in the garden someday!"
,,Orchid Search,5.0,,"Well this probably was the best experience of seeing all types of Orchids ever - especially growing naturally in all types of settings. When we finished we were both keen to book another tour visit to see these exotic plants in a natural habitat.
There were hot houses and cool houses for different species - absolutely stunning."
,,Beware of lizards,3.0,,"The botanic garden is so vast and hard to be crafted whole area for family, but atreasure for sport lovers, plant lovers and so. Beware of huge lizards and shower rain."
,,"Not only plants, but also black and white swans there",5.0,,The garden is huge with different types of plants. Those who love green must like this place. There is a swan lake there with some white swans. And there is a black swan in another lake.
,,Sprawling Wonder,4.0,,"Visit during dawn or dusk as the heat can really be bothersome considering how wide this park is. There's a lagoon with ducks wading. Good place to run, do yoga, read a book or just simply detox from the digital world."
,,Do Not Miss This Stunning Experience,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens of Singapore are an absolute must see!

Never have I been to an outdoor attraction so meticulously maintained and as beautiful as this. It is stunning when you factor in that the majority of the park is also free of cost for visitors. The ground, sculptures, and rare species of trees, plants, etc. are wonderful and the setting is so relaxing.

For a small fee, you can go into the Orchid Gardens and see some of the most beautiful nature again just painstakingly cared more.

I would visit again and again and if I lived in Singapore this would be my regular space for outdoor exercise."
,,A Step into nature,4.0,,"We went here by off chance, and I am happy we didn't pass this oppurtunity. Although we didn't go into the selected gardens because of entry fees, the areas which you walk around for free are magnificent. However, I wouldn't recomend going without drinks and snacks, because there isn't a whole lot of spots to grab something to eat and drink (in the free area anyway)"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This facilty, spread over a huge area, offers a fantastic evening range of plants, shrubs plus the wonderful Orchid Garden. The site is quite hilly, but wheelchair friendly, and beautifully laid out."
,,Real walk in the park,5.0,,"My mom is a botany enthusiast, so she had a whale of a time at the park, identifying most plants by their biological names while i was quizzing her with the tags hidden. Don't miss the orchid gardens as well."
,,Beautiful orchids,4.0,,Visited the Botanic Gardens as part of the city tour of Singapore while en route to a tour of Australia so time was limited. The section of the Gardens we saw was beautiful with such a large variety of orchids some of which were named after visiting dignitaries and royalty. Well worth a visit.
,,"Beautiful grounds, art and orchids",5.0,,"Free to enter and on the hop on hop off route, this place is huge! Locals picnic and do wedding/grad/engagement photo shoots here. There are cafes & gift shops. Lily ponds, water fountains and sculpture along with tree & plant specimens keep your eyes happy and your mind at peace. There is a fee to enter the National Orchid Garden which is well worth it. Gorgeous orchids of every size & color abound!"
,,great place to see,4.0,,the place is must if you visit Singapore and it's near the hotel with the pool on the roof worth to visit and see the view.
,,Walk in a park,3.0,,"it was sunny day ,unfortunately i had to visit this in the middle of the day ,so it was hot and humid .like the flora i have seen they and the coolness that trees provide .hats off to the crew that maintain greenery among the high rising buildings of Singapore.MRT station make the visiting so easy ."
,,"Lovely day out, but get used to the humidity",4.0,,"A beautiful garden, very cheap to visit and a good day out to walk around and relax. easy to get to by cab (and cheaply), there were a couple of school groups walking around while I was there but the gardens are so big I rarely saw them. Maps are available but honestly it's much better to just wander.

A word of warning, if you get hot easily. you will sweat buckets!"
,,As beautiful as flowers can be!!!,5.0,,"You can spend a whole day here! Green, green, green, and COLORFULL as it can be!!! Never seen such a beautiful varieties of orchids and other tropical flower at one place."
,,Really nice Botanical Garden,5.0,,I've been to a bunch of botanical gardens mainly in Europe / N. America and this ranks up near the top. I'd highly recommend going here if you like flowers and nature
,,A good commune with nature,5.0,,We enjoyed the relaxing stroll around the place. We love The different flower varieties in the gardens. The whole experience is so relaxing.
,,Beautiful place to wander,5.0,,"Arriving by cab mid morning, the gardens were very busy with ex-pats, families and school groups. I grabbed a map but just wandered the beautiful paths. Despite the large number of people there, it was not crowded or noisy. The gardens are very well maintained and provide a lot of information about the various plants. Definitely worth the visit to the Orchid House, truely beautiful. My most favourite part though was the Garden on Evolution. So well thought out and executed, it was very clever and very informative. Take water, however you can buy drinks around the park. I purchased mosquito repellant at the gift shop, but didn't need it during the middle of the day. Would defiantly return."
,,"Large green area, good for running at night, but very hot",5.0,,"Large green area, good for running at night, but very hot at day time in night, you could see cats around if you are lucky, good for running but not easy one you have to know, can visit nus and take a aircon rest inside"
,,Beautiful & Huge,4.0,,It is beautiful and huge with variety of plants and flowers and huge lakes. the Orchid garden is not to be missed.
,,An innercity oasis treat,5.0,,"These gardens are well laid out, good paths and very attractive adding well to the garden city image. Well used by locals and visitors. They open early, which might be a stretch for holiday makers but an idea if you want to avoid the heat. Highlights are the rainforest walk and the orchid gardens (the latter have a small charge but the rest is free). The cool house really is ""cool"" - otherwise keep to the shade or visit the cafes or shop (good selection and T shirts). Be sure to take a hat, water and suncream. Also, make sure you have the map from the info centre as wayfinding isn't always easy. We struggled to find the agriculture plants. Interpretation is quite limited apart from the orchids and cool house. It would be nice to know more about some of the plants and trees. You can access by subway (MRT station at the Bukti Timah Gate easiest) and buses. Best value food is Food for Thought at the Botany Centre and a good coffee and cool drink are at the Cafe Verde by Park HQ with an attractive outdoor setting. Tip, if you are caught at the Tanglin Gate end (no MRT) you can get a taxi around the corner at the hospital."
,,A nice place to visit,5.0,,"This is a good place for families , couples and friends especially those natural lovers . I am a natural lover , I like to travel around country sides and undeveloped areas , this place is well organised and maintained , it is definitely a good place."
,,A Great Place to walk and chill out.,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are lovely. to get there is easy as there is an MRT station right at the entrance. There are paths all around the gardens, plenty of greenery, lakes with fish, turtles and some water monitor lizards. The lizards do go out for a walk sometimes, but we only saw one lying beside the lake. It is worth a visit, with kids plenty of space for them to run."
,,Beautiful show in the evening!,5.0,,Very NICE place! if you visit you must wait for the show in the evening! I believe there is a couple of shows TOTALLY worth it!
,,Tranquility in the midst of a bustling city,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is an island of peace and tranquility in the midst of the bustling city of Singapore. You step within its walls and you are in a whole new world of flora and some fauna.
The amount of trees and plants stored there is amazing. Well manicured undulating lawns, shrubbery and shade transport you to the haven of beautiful smells and plants. In the middle are the orchid gardens which will take your breath away. I have recently been to the Botanic Gardens in Colombo, Sri Lanka but this although just as hot, is three thumbs up.

Other niches are the Bromeliads collection and the Temperate Plants air-conditioned enclosure. Great for cooling off.
There are eateries at two locations in the Gardens where one could stop for a cool juice of a cuppa tea or coffee. Up market restaurants lurk quietly among the trees, needing a little searching asking around. The obligatory souvenir shop is a bit more obivious, for obvious reasons!
If you love plants, go take a gander about and enjoy your day!"
,,Nice place,5.0,,"Make sure you go in the cooler times as at times not much shade. Otherwise a wonderful green oasis, take the rainforest walk, see the Orchid Gardens or sit by one of the Lakes"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"We had a one day stopover in Singapore and decided to take the MRT from Changi to the Botalnical Gardens. The MRT is right next to the entrance of the Botanical Gardens, very convenient. We enjoyed the peaceful and beautiful gardens, away from the hustle and bustle. The cafe and shop in the centre are in a beautiful setting and worth a visit. The orchid garden is a must. It's beautifully designed and the orchids are absolutely divine. I highly recommend spending 2-3 hours if not more in the gardens."
,,Great Free and Fun - Must Do,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens are an incredibly vast and impressive setting. And they're free!

One can easily fill hours looking through all of the different exhibits and environments (make sure to go through both the Rain Forest and the National Orchid Garden).

Definitely a must do while in Singapore"
,,Must see gardens in Singapore,4.0,,"The gardens are easy reachable by public transport as there is a MRT stop right next to the entrance.

If you really want to visit the gardens in a proper way, prepare some time for this. We walked around for a couple of hours and did not even see half of the garden.

Deep in te gardens, there is the national orchid garden which can be visited after paying a small fee. We can highly recommend this part of the garden as well."
,,A glimpse of the Garden of Eden! 💕💕💕,5.0,,"Stepping into the Botanic Gardens is such a memorable experience especially the Orchid garden which I am a true blue singaporean is hopelessly proud of! It is worth the visit, but remember to have plenty of water in place for hydration and certainly mosquito repellent is a must!"
,,Orchids galore,5.0,,"The Singapore botanic gardens are beautiful examples of rainforest plantings. The orchid garden is a good hot walk into the gardens but well worth the effort. They have bamboo gardens, helleconia gardens etc. There are usually some groups doing tai chi, playing games or family groups just enjoying the wonderful sights."
,,Hot visit!,4.0,,"We went to take a look but it was extremely humid the day we went so we didn't stay for long, however it is lovely and worth a visit, plus it is free, except to go into the orchid garden. If you arrive and want to leave by taxi you may have a bit of wait for the taxi as they do not line up and wait at the gardens."
,,A fun filled morning,5.0,,"We went there on a Sunday morning by the newly completed Downtown Line MRT train.

The weather was very kind to us and it was perfect. Being a Sunday, the place was crowded with the foreign maids enjoying their picnic. There was also a heritage event going on which give Singaporeans free entry to the Orchid Garden.

Overall, it was a very pleasant and fun filled morning. It was amazing that we came across not one but two monitor lizards and a beautiful swan at the pond.

Advice to visitors is to wear casually and with comfortable shoes.

A beautiful garden to behold."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Very extensive with much of interest. Well worth a visit. Rainforest walk is a highlight. Not crowded and easy to access.
,,Peaceful place to rest and enjoy nature,5.0,,The Botanic Garden is huge. Enjoy strolling through the different parts of the park. The Royal Orxhid Garden is worth a visit. Take a rest in one of the cafes or just enjoy the nature! We walked from the north end to south gate and enjoyed every minute!
,,My favourite part of Singapore,5.0,,"The gardens are amazing. Apart from lots of trees, wide open spaces, public events, a ride on train etc, the highlight for me is the orchids and bromeliads. Top of the world class and superb range all year around. Worth a visit to Singapore just for this."
,,singapore botanic garden,4.0,,"A nice place to visit. the place does not boast of as many flora for a tropical country, as there are other places with a richer collection of plants. But the layout is good & well placed. the enclosure of the orchids is fine."
,,If you like flowers you must go,5.0,,I had been there in may2016 It was wonderful and went to National Orchid as well. I love nature and the way that they conserve different kind of flowers .It is excellent to take a big and relax break apart from the downtown.
,,A gem of green for Singaporeans and visitors alike,5.0,,"Singapore is much greener than many expect and the Botanic Garden is one of the reasons. Easily reachable by yellow circle line and apart from the orchid garden free, it provides lakes and walking/ running paths, tropical flora and is beautifully maintained. Best time to visit is in the morning when temperatures are still cool. You can also join around 100 ppl practicing the free Chinese Gymnastic class calmed Dao-yin (a form of preparation for Qi-Gong) that takes place close to the main entrance every day at 8:00. If you are not Chinese it's quite an impressive sight. If you fancy dance moves, walk ahead, there is a super nice older guy dressed in white leading a dance class (also daily around 8:00) in front of the entrance of the orchid garden. If you come later in the day, the garden still provides shade and boardwalks under the canopy of ancient trees, it will just be warmer. Oh and look out for the monitor lizards, the turtles and the beautiful birds."
,,Serene and relaxing,5.0,,"A great way to spend your day (rainy or sunny) and wander through the jungle, the japanese garden, the orchid garden etcetera.."
,,World class gardens,5.0,,One of the best botanical gardens in the world in the same league as Kew Gardens near London. I like to go there in the early mornings when it is cool & quiet.
,,loverly afternoon in the gardens.,4.0,,"both my wife and i are avid gardeners and the chance to visit the national orchid collection in singapore whilst we where there was a chance not to be missed.
The gardens are laid out on the side of a small hill with good paths for old and young .We had a great time the plants and settings where just fab"
,,Lovely.,4.0,,"Beautiful and calming. We stayed almost half a day here, just walking around, and were not bored once. Lovely place!"

,,Absolutely Fabulous!,5.0,,"Wow! These gardens really are a credit to all the people who have made them so great. Everything about them is so well done. There are species from all over well displayed and in fabulous condition. Of course the orchids are too good to miss. So many of them flowering the day we went. Singapore has many spectacular gardens, but these are amazing. If you like gardens don't miss these."
,,A good green stretch in middle of concrete jungle of singapore,5.0,,"Although tiring but it is one of the well-maintained gardens maintained in the world. Having a few birds as well as the orchid gardens and a couple of restaurants serving fresh good food makes it worthwhile.
They regularly host picnics and events in the huge central garden."
,,Singapore's Unesco Heritage Garden,4.0,,"Lovely landscapes filled with various variety of flowers and trees. Lovely place to take a slow stroll in this city, away from the buzzing citylife. The outdoor amphitheatre comes to life over the weekends where there are usually performances held."
,,Just beautiful!,5.0,,"These gardens must rate as one of the best in the world. Set in an expansive parkland setting you could spend a day finding something new at every turn. Tropical plants of every kind thrive, as do the rainforests, and it was pleasant to wander through them and enjoy the shade provided while marvelling at the size of some of the trees. Plenty of rest areas are provided along the paths as well as cafes and quality restaurants. Your senses will be filled at this lovely location!"
,,A highlight of our visit to Singapore,5.0,,We spent nearly a whole day here and loved it. As well as being a large green space with interesting plants it has many species of animals to look at from spiders and dragon flies to monitor lizards and one green snake (up high!). If we had stayed another day in Singapore we might well have gone back for a second visit.
,,Fantastic Park to Walk Around,5.0,,"After travelling to many countries, have to admit that they have made a fantastic park considering the size of land Singapore has.They have some opera schedule that worth to watch, might want to look out for the event schedule. Probably not the biggest park you ever see, and the weather quite hot to walk around during day time. Try to visit them in the morning or late afternoon-evening. They have some restaurant as well. Look nice, but have yet to try."
,,turtles,5.0,,Very cool and one of a kind. The place is very large and one could spend the whole day here. I would recommend coming here for a bit of romance as well. The turtles were everywhere and swimming in the ponds.
,,Better than Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,Its huge and well spread. Very calming and green. Must visit for children. There is also a swam lake and a bonsai garden which are worth a visit.
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"These are one of the most beautiful botanic gardens I have ever seen and they stretch on and on! Wear comfy shoes and be prepared to walk. The Orchid Gardens were particularly spectacular. There is even a sound shell where you can sit on the grass and listen to live music.
When next in Singapore make a visit here and give yourself plenty of time."

,,Gorgeous Park,5.0,,Beautiful park that makes anyone feels relax and calm. The orchid park is a must visit for all tourists and locals. You will not regret.
,,An absolute must for garden enthusiasts,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens remain my number one destination every time I visit Singapore and it ranks in my view in the top ten gardens world wide I have visited. The layout is beautiful, the forest walk is a must if you are a tree lover, and the orchid garden is a treat. There are specialised collections throughout of gingers, heliconias and frangipanis and lovely buildings of traditional architecture scattered throughout, some of which are utilised as restaurants, cafes, offices, shops and public rest and view points. For the patient visitor, there are squirrels, Monitor lizards, geckos, snakes, amphibians and lovely birds, butterflies and insects to spot, all of which have made the gardens their home. For avid gardeners like myself, the plants are well labelled for easy identification and there is a wealth of display ideas that can be adapted on a smaller scale. Gardens by the Bay may have the wow factor for the engineering and construction, but the Botanic gardens are far more restful and serene and will delight anyone with an interest in gardens and all things botannical."
,,Excellent Garden,5.0,,A must when traveling to Singapore. Gives one a feeling of relaxation even without going far. Visiting the place when its drizzling/light rain gives it a different misty experience like youre in a forest
,,Botanic Garden,5.0,,Whether you are just out for a stroll or fancy taking in some of the themed areas such as the evolution garden or Jacob Ballas Children's Garden there is something for all. Our kids especially enjoy feeding the fish!

,,Beat the Hustle and Bustle,5.0,,"If you want to beat the hustle and bustle of busy Singapore city then this is the place to visit and very handy by public transport. Stroll through the beautiful and relaxing gardens and take in the sights and smells. A great place to go to get some peace and quiet in a city of rush and noise. Take a load off and bring something to eat and relax, you will be glad you did!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Stopped off here as one of the stops on the hop on hop off bus which resulted in little further use of the bus. The gardens however were well worth the time and I would recommend this for anybody who has a few hours available and enjoys gardens.
,,Big but worth the trip,4.0,,It's large! We did have a small walk round but the highlight is the orchid room!! The different orchids named after famous people. Pay the extra it's worth it!
,,Lovely home to the unique Orchid Garden,5.0,,"Totally worth visiting beyond the orchids, though. 20 minutes away from downtown by public transport, warmly recommended to all nature lovers."
,,Fun Sunday Activity - Bring your Camera,5.0,,"We enjoyed the Singapore Botanic Gardens during a recent business trip to Singapore. The best part was the Orchid Garden.

,,Beaty in the city,5.0,,"Walk about the gardens and take in the sights and smells of the plants, enjoy the quiet and relax.Take time to see the many differing plantings from around the globe."

A stunning place with the most lovely trees and plants, a Great Lake with swans, a good restaurant and the most amazing orchids.
Not far from Orchard Road, there is no charge for entry and buses and the MRT are close by.
Obviously biased to SE Asian flora the displays are wonderful and the trees mature and tall.
There is an auditorium where you sit on the grass and listen to concerts with a picnic.
A must visit place."

,,A brilliant day out which costs nothing.,5.0,,"This Botanical Gardens is excellent. There are so may things to see apart from the obvious garden plants ,trees etc. The lakes are brilliant and have many turtles,catfish and eels....we had a great time there. There were also many large lizards as we walked round the grounds and of course many exotic birds.
Only caution is that the cafe ( which was very good) was rather expensive so would cost a bit for a family. It did rain on our second visit but no problem!"
,,"Botanic Gardens, a haven of peace",5.0,,"Beautiful, well maintained gardens. well worth visiting. Lots of space to wander. Also contains the National Orchid Collection within it's ground. Recommended"
,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,"Visited the gardens to fill a couple of hours and it was just magic. So pleased we went there. No entry fee to the main gardens - we went through the Nassim Gate. There was a ridiculously small fee for the Orchid Gardens- $1 because we are seniors! It was breathtaking and such a treat to see so many varieties. Plenty of scenic spots to sit in the heat and the cool house and the mist house were were beautifully laid out with spectacular displays. Take water and make sure your camera/phone is fully charged, there are so many gorgeous shots to be taken. Be prepared for the usual high priced mementoes at the exit gate."
,,World class,5.0,,"The domes at these gardens are like nothing I have ever seen before. We spent 4 hours going through them. A must see attraction for anyone visiting Singapore.
Climate controlled to allow plants from different countries to thrive it also allows a break from the Singapore heat for visitors."
,,Great day,5.0,,"This is a wonderful place to visit in singapore, and it is free. You can get there very easy by the MRT, the station itself is called Botanical Garden."
,,Spectacular Orchids displays,5.0,,"The botanic gardens were just beautiful, well tended, easy to walk round and jaw dropping. It was the most colourful and delightful of all the botanical gardens we saw on our trip round the world."
,,Stunning gardens with the Orchid garden as a n amazing bonus,5.0,,"These are the most fabulous gardens you could ever wish to visit and free of charge. The collection of plants, the setting and the layout make this a must to visit. For a small charge you then go into the Orchid garden what a collection of this species and superbly presented. Well worth a visit."
,,A must place to visit!,4.0,,The Botanical Garden is one of the main attraction of Singapore and it is definitely worth a look. By Chance we stumbled on a rehearsal performance by the Singapore Philharmonic Orchestra along with a Traditional Chinese orchestra and that took the cake. The Stage located in the middle of the pond is a unique feature. The Orchidarium is another feature you would not want to miss. Overall a ++++ experience!
,,Singapore Botanic Garden-One of the best garden for old and young.,5.0,,"Singapore Zoo-One of the world best for old and young. We used to go there for morning/evening walk. It is free to walk around. Orchid Garden is just round the corner, there is a small fee to pay to go in to see the orchid.
Good for all people who enjoy and love nature. Good place for family outing for young to old."
,,Beautiful and HOT,4.0,,In my many trips to singapore this was my first trip to the gardens. It was beautiful well layed out. But I didn't anticipate the extreme heat and humidity. It's was very uncomfortable. May be it will be better in a cooler time of the year.
,,Nice way to start the morning,5.0,,"A visit to the Singapore Botanical Gardens is probably the best way to start a hectic day be it on holiday, business or even as a local resident. Great plants, lovely atmosphere, easy to locate in the heart of the city. Convenient MRT and BUS access. Car Parking can get hard on the weekends so public transport best, walk or cycle. Parking fee reasonable. Take water as walks can last upto 30 - 40 mts each. Great Jogging and walking tracks. Good place to walk your dog (leashed ofcourse).

If you go early between 7-8am lots of Tai Chi classes on the rolling lawns to join in but mostly in Chinese. Soothing to even just watch and enjoy.

Nice cafe inside. Very popular for Bfast on weekends.
Nice restaurants for lunch and dinner. French Fine Dining restaurant located in a heritage building, could be considered $$$$. But classy. A bit of a walk from the car park so not for a wet evening and try not to wear heals.

Best time to visit early morning 6am - 8am. Could get very humid during the day."
,,Morning run,5.0,,"Love this place as almost Everyday run by .. I get to watch the swans, birds , pp working out,....the beautiful trees.. It is amazing place in the middle of the city👍😀"
,,More than a Botanic Garden !,5.0,,"Being an avid traveller, I have been to many Botanic Gardens around the world and therefore shunned this one for a long time
esp since I stay in Singapore.
Finally I decided to visit it on a Sunday morn with a friend and regretted not having come here earlier !
With its slopes , theme gardens ( Healing,
Fossil, Orchid etc) , lakes etc you can spend a few hours here without getting bored. Not to mention the abundant energy
you witness as the local residents run, do Tai Chi , Yoga , walk some cutest dogs etc.
Actually it is the only such place I have visited where the locals out number the tourists esp on a Sunday morn!
More importantly there are reminders aplenty that it is an old heritage park - old
huge trees , some with roots really spreading out few metres , some touching the sky.
Round up your experience with a breakfast at one of the buzzing restaurants which welcome dogs as much as they do humans!!"
,,Singapore Botanical Gardens,5.0,,Whilst in Singapore a visit to the Botanic Garden is a requirement. It is so relaxing and the range of plants is fantasic. The Gardens are found at the top end of Orchard Road (about a 5 or 10 minute walk away) When we were there last there were some 2 metre high Orchards likewise there are many plants like the stag Horn / Elk horn and lots of creepers. Any one who loves plants and even those who dont will enjoy the experience
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful grounds, lots to see. Easy to get to - I walked from Hyatt at Orchard and Scotts Rd. Go to the Orchid Garden while there."
,,Humid plus!,5.0,,We visited the Singapore Botanic Gardens a few days ago. We enjoyed the Orchid Garden in particular. The spectacular colours and varieties of orchids was amazing. The Cool House provided a few moments of welcome relief from the extreme humidity we experienced despite it only being 9 o'clock in the morning. Well worth a visit but make sure you hydrate!
,,Paradise,5.0,,It is a magical place. The plants are arranged nicely. The explanations and the signs are very clear.
,,Excellent for a quiet walk.,5.0,,This is a lovely place to just wander along in peace. There are numerous trees and plants to be seen. Easily accessible by bus or taxi or within walking distance from some areas. The orchid garden is located within the gardens and is well worth a visit.
,,So pretty,5.0,,Here was have a beautiful gardens and lovely atmosphere. Great with children and lots of staff who speak English. Highly recommend.
,,a must visit!,5.0,,"Such a nice free facility! If you're visiting you have to check this place out.

You can't miss the ORCHID GARDENS. Singapore's national flower is the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid. And these gardens are absolutely lovely. So many places to take photos - you don't even need a filter to make them look good. They typically cost 5/adult to go in but if you're a student it's 1. When we went they had a promotion and the entire orchid garden was free.

The rest of the park was quite nice as well. It's less floral and more trees and plants. I would say it takes about 2-3 hours to walk through the entire park. Most people just come here to sit and relax on the many benches and the grass."
,,Green spaces,5.0,,I loved the gardens. The tropical environment supports many different doe its of plants. The evolution walk and foliage gardens were particularly attractive. Lots of space and not very crowded during the week.
,,Beautiful well tended gardens,5.0,,Worth a visit - a lovely place to wander around. The orchid garden is amazing. I have never seem so many well tended varieties in one place. if you need a bit of shade or shelter from the rain there are plenty of little pagodas around the gardens.
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"A must for every visitor to Singapore! Free admission and just beautiful. You can also visit the orchid center during the visit. We visited via one of the local hop on/hop off bus companies, which made transportation to and from the gardens very convenient."
,,Wonderful garden with no train facility,4.0,,"Built in the 9th century, Singapore Botanical is one of the best gardens in the world with outstanding and luxuriant Orchid Garden and Ginger Garden. The garden is populated with over 10,000 plant specimens with 1000 species of Orchid and 2000 species of hybrid orchid. It is located right off the subway stations within the city. There is no admission charge with a free wheelchair but there is no garden train available and travel on foot including wheelchair is the only way to get round 3 or 4 miles (distance from north to south is 1.6 miles). Singapore is a tropical island with very high humidity and visitors from North American may not accustom to walking in such condition. It is recommended to drink a lot of water and spent at least 3 to 4 hours to enjoy the garden. Singapore has been suffering from the air pollution from her neighboring countries and please take precaution for those who may have respiratory conditions."
,,Beautiful gardens and lakes,5.0,,"Thouroghly enjoyed the gardens.we walked to swan lake were can see beautiful swans, turtles and large fish swimming around naturally. Their are lovely swings and seating areas all around . Its beautifully kept and maintained.we didnt go orcids as ran out of time but heard good things"
,,Nicest Running Track you will Do,5.0,,"I jogged to the botanical gardens from just up the road and once I entered it felt like I left the city behind and was exploring a rainforest. There is great variety there and even a boardwalk rainforest section. It's very relaxing and plenty of grassed areas to stretch, do yoga or just lay down. The grounds keepers were very particular and everything was maintained to perfection. Even sweeping the leaves from the walk ways daily. I Will be having another jog here before leaving Singapore"
,,visit here before the gardens by the bay!,3.0,,"I made the mistake of coming here after visiting the gardens by the bay. Sadly these gardens pale in comparison.

It seemed like nothing more than a large park, with very little to see, and I left feeling a little disappointed.

Still there are parts which are lovely, as the gardens are very well maintained and looked after.

I enjoyed just ambling round, although in the heat it is very tiring.

The orchid gardens are located within the park, but you need to pay to enter them. Walking around the botanical gardens is a free attraction.

With anything bring lots of waters, it takes several hours to walk the gardens."
,,Relax,5.0,,"After a long flight we thought it would go good to chill out in the botanical gardens wasn't disappointed the most impressive gardens Ive ever been to, The wealth of vegetation will take you years to see."
,,Top FREE botanic garden & kids stuff,5.0,,"Were travelling with a 2yr old and loved this garden!

It's FREE and has a really good kids garden area. And the gardens themselves are really good too. Well maintained. Lots of space and shade from plants when its too hot.

A great place to watch Singaporeans relaxing."
,,A great attraction !,4.0,,"My wife and I visited the Botanic Gardens when we were last in Singapore, almost a year ago and we decided they were well worth a return visit. We had a lovely stroll through the extensive grounds, where entry is free and decided to pay to see the orchid trail -5 sgd for adults, 1 sgd for over 60s !
All in all, a very pleasant morning !"
,,Free well-maintained Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Great attraction in Singapore. Well maintained and not too busy. Staff was helpful in providing band-aids when I needed them.
,,Beautiful View,3.0,,Open 5am until midnight. Can walk gardens early before the heat.well maintained. Free. National orchid gallery there. I could have stayed here all day - we wandered around the Orchid Gardens
,,Explore this Singaporean Wonderland,5.0,,"A must but go early or late evening to enjoy this wonderland of garden right in off orchard road, singapore. The gardens are glorious with a tale as you walk thru. A not to be missed if your a keen gardener and plant lover"
,,"Spectacular gardens, but it's difficult to breathe",4.0,,"I loved this place, it's miraculous. However, there is no way you can walk after spending some time there, the overdose of oxygen is incredible mixed with the humidity."
,,Lovely late afternoon,5.0,,I did not have sufficient time to explore everything I wanted to in the park. I am interested in tropical plants and I thought the book and gift shop was great for that. Staff were quite knowledgeable and friendly and I got some great books on their reccomendations that I wouldn't have found elsewhere on orchid growing in tropical climates. I had an outstanding Italian dinner in the restaurant located near the bookshop and just a beautiful walk back at sunset through the huge old tropical forest trees all the way back to the subway. Just sublime!
,,First rate Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"I could have stayed here all day - we wandered around the Orchid Gardens (stunning), the Ginger Garden, and through the beautifully designed Evolution Garden. The orchids were the reason I went, but the rest of the gardens are just as amazing. There was a concert going on in the large ampitheatre, and I would have loved to have sat and watched like so many other families, but unfortunately didn't have time.
At the end of the day, the lights came on, and we sat in a big grassy area by the lake watching a group yoga / meditation class, with families playing all around us. It was just lovely."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Open 5am until midnight. Can walk gardens early before the heat.well maintained. Free. National orchid gallery there. Worth paying $5 entry.
,,Natural and created beauty,5.0,,"These gardens are magnificent! And then we only saw the southern half with Swan Lake and the Orchid Garden. The plants are lovely of course, but then there are the water features and the wonderful sculptures. So much beauty, natural and created. Entry to the gardens is free, but you pay to go into the Orchid Garden. I had imagined a large greenhouse, but it is an enormous mostly open garden. A magic place. A small downside was that near the entry we bought two almond magnums which had cold frozen chocolate coatings but liquid ice cream inside! A clever trick, but not good for eating! Perhaps it is a good idea not to try to see all the gardens in one visit. For $10 you can take a taxi to the south end, and then similarly take a taxi back from the centre. I loved the beautiful sculpture by the south entry, and also the swans sculpture in Swan Lake. Our visit was for three hours, but it was the humidity, not lack of things to do, which brought it to an end. This is a must for visitors to Singapore."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"As with every attraction I have been to in Singapore the Botaniic Gardens are wonderful, so well planned and lots of creative flair. Free too. The rest facilities are plentiful which is just as well since I was there for four hours. The orchid garden is well worth the five dollar entry fee - three if you can show a tourist travel pass. I wasn't aware that Singapore calls itself a 'garden city' before I arrived. Very appropriate as there is greenery everywhere. Nothing more beautiful and restful on the soul than this place, I should think."
,,Peaceful Day,5.0,,"A great way to spend the day running, napping, picnicking. This pretty peaceful party is a nice escape from the business of the city. Clean and zen."
,,One of the best place in singapore,5.0,,Botanic Gardens is a must to see in Singapore. A troll around the park makes you feel so great. For kids you have Jacob Ballas Garden there and they would love to go there.
,,Lungs of Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing natural beauty, truly the lungs of Singapore. Soak in the sights of trees that are hundreds of years old and flowers that you may have never seen before. Excellent for a picnic, bike ride, jog or walk as well."
,,Magnificent walk around,5.0,,This place is a joy to behold. Lots of walkers and joggers and so clean and well maintained. Staff even sweeping the road and paths. Take a bottle of water and a camera.
,,Lovely morning,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a very relaxing and beautiful place to spend a morning or afternoon in Singapore.
Everything is well maintained and clean, as everything else in Singapore, and they have different gardens with various themes that you can enjoy.
I liked the Rainforest a lot and, due to the humid hot weather right now, you really feel like you're in the middle of one!
The Singapore Botanic Gardens have their own MRT stop and the entrance is free of charge. To visit the National Orchid Garden inside the fee is 5$ and it is totally worth it.
I felt so relaxed and happy after walking around here, highly recommend it!"
,,Stroll in the park,4.0,,Magnificent gardens and FREE entry! Impressed that there are no barriers to this public facility and the kiosk was reasonably priced. We bought a value packed picnic hamper and sat on the grass to enjoy tranquil surroundings. Highly recommend!
,,Just Singapore,4.0,,"My friend was working in an office inside this garden so I had a chance to come here because some places like this never have in my plan when I travel. I'm a person who prefer the natural places more than artificial places like this. Anyway, it is a good place to hang out and relax with family or friends right in the city."
,,Tranquil,5.0,,Had a lovely few hours strolling through these gardens. It's amazingly peaceful and quiet and everywhere is immaculate which is standard for Singapore. We particularly loved the turtle that came to see us at Swan Lake and wouldn't leave.
,,Bigger than expected,5.0,,"You could easily stroll around for a few hours without seeing everything. It is mainly a mix of a well kept parc, lakes and even a Unesco-protected piece of rain forest. Expect for the Orchid Garden it is free of charge and certainly worth a visit. Only downside is that it can get very hot, especially due to the humidity."
,,Beautiful garden - very large,4.0,,"The garden itself was a little hard to get to using public transportation , and you have to walk a long way from any bus stop, which is not that fun during a Singapore heatwave.
One you get to the garden however there is quite a lot to see . The garden is very large so again you have to walk a lot but it is worth it.
The orchid garden inside is amazing so don't miss that area ."
,,The best,5.0,,"One of the best botanical gardens I have ever seen, large open spaces no expected to find in this city state, well kept and vast variety of plants."
,,Garden lovers,4.0,,This park is truely beautiful. Not much bird life which I thought was a bit odd. Well worth th visit. The treetop walk is great too but not if you are scared of heights. $8 AUD to do the walk.
,,A great day out,5.0,,"Had a lovely day just walking around the gardens. A very beautiful and relaxing place to go. So much to see, the gardens seemed to go on forever which was so lovely, you can almost forget your in a big city."
,,This is a lovely spot on earth!,5.0,,"SBC is just a beauiful garden for walking day or night. Enjoy smells, sounds, quiteness, flowers etc etc. They also have a few places to eat, and we've been very happy so far! I'm there all the time :)"
,,Naturally,4.0,,"Near MRT Botanical Garden (our entry after exiting MRT station and exit at the Holland road). Matches with family, cool place, naturally, it could be for jogging, lots of benches resting places, gardens and swan lake. Free entry (except orchid)"

,,wonderful,4.0,,"Well laid out, themed gardens, mainly foliage plants but the variety of form was amazing. Never felt busy even on a holiday weekend"
,,Average garden with lot of walking,3.0,,We went to botanic garden during day time in the month of March..and it was too hot..we didn't find anything too exciting except the orchid garden at the end which is also almost 4 km away from the main entrance.
,,Botanical Gardens....Singapore,5.0,,"These Gardens are free to the public and have a pleasant restaurant/café to sit and enjoy the rest !! there are lots of benches and grass to sit on (maybe take your own picnic) and take in the views. Also you can discover the Rain Forest and watch armies of ants marching through! great fun...Also of course a real MUST..is the Orchid House/Gardens..these are magnificent and should not be missed.. the entrance fee is only ""small money"" for the delightful displays...access can be via the MRT (train) or by bus/taxi...comfortable walking shoes is a good idea...you are given a plan of the gardens so you don't repeat yourself as there is so much to see...for every age group."
,,Walk in the amazon belt..,4.0,,There is a good belt of forest stretch which is nice to walk through.. The orchid garden is also absolutely gorgeous!! We walked along the stream to get out of the place.. It's charming.
,,Lovely walk,5.0,,"So great to see all the families and locals using the gardens - it was very lively with picnics and parties. A wind band was doing a sound check on the grandstands. Kingfishers dodged kids and turtles to swoop across the pond, skimming for food. Flowers everywhere. Free to enter the main areas. Bring insect repellent patches - I was bit multiple times by midges."
,,Truly Beautiful,5.0,,"Truly beautiful, great to see squirrels and the odd large lizard just walking along peacefully. The integration with Singapore's history is excellent."
,,Simply Beautiful,4.0,,"We visited the Botanic Gardens in April with our two boys. It was very hot and sultry, but the giant trees in the gardens make the walk around the gardens more pleasant. We loved the Orchid gardens which is housed within the Botanic Gardens. You will see some of the most beautiful orchids here. I could not stop clicking pictures with my phone. This place is absolutely beautiful. Definitely a must see if visiting Singapore, especially if you love flowers."
,,Full Day to see it all,5.0,,"These gardens are well worth a lengthy visit.
It will take you a while to see the just the orchid garden let alone the rest of the gardens. You can get there by bus too which is a bonus. Singapore is very warm so be prepared to go slow and drink lots of water. Definitely worth going to."
,,Gorgeous. Well designed. Don't miss.,5.0,,"We love these gardens. An example of many types of vegetation and habitat. Not only educational but a total visual delight. If you love nature - do not miss this small well designed botanical snap shot of our natural world. The only thing missing is the wildlife... frogs and others....but this is all about plant life.
Don't miss the short film in the video room....on climate. Excellent."
,,Nice walk with lots to see,4.0,,This is much more of a central park than a botanic gardens although there are areas which are more garden. Check on closing times. Accessible by public transit
,,"huge, hot, and interesting",4.0,,"Wear comfortable shoes and light clothing, you'll be very hot. The gardens are huge. There may have been a map to take with you, but I didn't find it. So we wandered more than we might have intended. Lots to look at, but bring water; you will sweat."
,,Surprisingly delightful!,5.0,,"Singapore's Botanic Garden is MUST SEE while in S'pore. We were amazed at the variety of the plants, including fabulous, unique orchids. The entire garden complex is thoughtfully organized with clear pathways and signage. We took a leisurely tour with a guide and enjoyed the entire experience. Even with the humidity of the day we were comfortable, and often we were covered in the shade of large luxurious trees.
Enjoy!"
,,"excellent garden, free",5.0,,"This place is beautiful - you can spend many hours walking around, to discover interested flowers and trees, and fascinating garden layouts. The garden is free. It is of course an out-door place - not a perfect place in the tropical weather."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"Beautiful and hugely extensive gardens. Free entry to the main gardens and only $5 to the orchid gardens, which are recommended. Lots of walking so try to avoid really really hot days. Busier at the weekends but bags of space for all."
,,Oasis in the city,4.0,,Easy to get to with an MRT station right outside. Fresh air and very relaxing. The different plants are awesome.
,,love this spot,5.0,,"Never got bored going to this botanical garden, since we don't have one in Lombok. Kids took their scooters and play all day long. It's a non-smoking public area so really glad spending time here. Don't worry if you don't bring your own lunch, there are some restaurants inside the garden and they taste really good."
,,Go Early,5.0,,"The gardens are spectacular and educational, but the heat was too much. We went after lunch. It opens at 5am for a reason. Highly recommend going as early as possible."
,,Magnificent!,5.0,,"Magnificent! Wonderfully planned with diverse flora, both native and from other countries. Great place to walk and spend time with the family. Look out for the musical events periodically held in the Gardens. Probably the best place in Singapore for both locals and tourists - one will keep coming back."
,,always beautiful,5.0,,One of Singapore's best attractions. Pity there is quite a lot of construction work going behind the ginger garden.
,,Beautiful Botanic Gardens,5.0,,We spent half a day at the gardens and could have stayed a lot longer only seeing about a quarter of them. We didn't have time to go into the orchid garden which I believe are amazing definitely a must do next time :)
,,Nice view,5.0,,"I visited Botanic Gardens by chance when I was about to meet a friend of mine in Lee Kuan Yew Public Policy School. The park is pretty spacious, greeney and clean. Worth visiting!"

,,Very beautiful,4.0,,I spent a few hours wandering around the gardens. There are lots of different sections with different flowers and styles. You have to pay to go to the orchid gardens but it is worth it due to the quality and variety on offer. The gardens are easy to get to with a station nearby. Avoid the restaurants and cafes as they are expensive. There are a few water fountains around. I don't see the value in paying for a tour as it is great to wander around on your own.
,,World Heritage Botanic Garden,5.0,,Still my favorite gardem in Singapore. The fact that it has become the UNESCO World Heritage site makes it even sweeter. We were there to enjoy a free concert. Will be back again.
,,A must see place!,5.0,,Bring your camera because you are going to see an exquisite garden of orchids. The price is very reasonable. Allow at least half of a day to see this place. The MTR comes right up to an entrance so there is no problem in getting to this place from anywhere in Singapore.
,,An impressive display of plants organised in a logical manner,5.0,,"After an initial morning list I returned to the gardens on three separate occasions. As a keen gardener and long time botany student I was extremely taken with the Evolution Gardens both from a visual display and educational information boards located along the ""evolution pathway"". I was lucky enough to be close by a ""cave"" during a torrential downpour and sheltered with two of the gardeners responsible for maintaining the Evolution garden (one from Singapore and one from Bangladesh) and was educated in the working conditions of a garden employee!"

,,Nature,4.0,,I love the Botanic Garden's ambience. Its a nice place for picnic and pictorials. We had a pictorial there for my girls 7th Birthday. I love how the dried leaves coz its gives a dramatic effect for our pictorial. Its a nice place to visit when your are in Singapore.
,,A nice place to spend the afternoon,4.0,,This is a nice botanic gardens. We didn't see much wildlife but the garden was maintained and quiet. Would bring an umbrella for shade through as its quite exposed in areas. A nice place for a break from the city.
,,Tranquil,5.0,,The gardens are well laid out with many interesting venues that cater for the public. Well worth a couple of hours to stroll around.
,,Nature with love and care,4.0,,One will truly admire that Singapore even situated near the equator was able to preserve nature so that the temperature would be tolerable. The orchids are so nice and beautiful.
,,Beautiful orchids,4.0,,"Spent half a day and barely scrapped the surface. No wonder it is world heritage listed. Orchid gardens are stunning. Beautifully landscaped. Lunch at Halia restaurant in the grounds was divine. Saw squirrels, birds, monitor lizards, cicada (which were incredibly noisy for their diminutive size), butterfly's, and a narrow head green snake all while wandering around. We will be back for sure. Take water with you as its incredibly hot."
,,Great Botanic Garden,5.0,,Botanic Garden is one of the most popular attraction in Singapore. The garden is huge and collects plenty of tropical plant species. The landscape and plants are well organized with identification information on it. The garden was clean and well maintained. This garden is very good for family and kids.
,,Nice place to visit in Singapore,4.0,,"This attraction is free, but if you want to go the orchid garden you need to pay like S$5 or something. Overall, going there has always been pleasant experiences for my family (we live in Singapore). The garden even has a corner for kids with water play, sand, slides,etc. However, I feel that I signage does not do a good job and one may find himself/herself going through the long way to get to his/her desired destination in the garden."
,,Holiday,4.0,,The botanic gardens are well worth visiting the are emmence with all different species of plants you could easily spend the whole day there
,,Botanical gem,4.0,,IWe didn't manage to walk around it all - it was too hot and too far! We enjoyed one of the lakes and fed turtles and catfish. A few yards further on we spied a sleeping monitor lizard - glad he remained asleep. The variety of trees and flowering bushes and plants is simply stunning. There are many different areas and I'll just have to return to visit them all. The orchid garden is a must.
,,Astounding gardens with orchids and much more!,5.0,,"Be sure to visit the botanic gardens in Singapore, easily accessible by the metro. The garden is huge, but easily navigated and contains diverse ecological zones. I have never been an orchid person, but was blown away by the hundreds of varieties of this amazing flower. Highly recommended."
,,Great with kids,5.0,,"We went here a few times with the babies who loved seeing the swans, buying fish-food and feeding the fish, etc. Its also lovely to go for a walk. However, given its Singapore beware the heat and the mosquitoes. Both tend the creep up on you!"
,,Group Outing,4.0,,"It was a wonderful outing with some church friends - starting the walk from the Bukit Timah entrance and covered all the trails. However, be prepared of the huge crowds particularly on a public holiday. On nornal weekdays, the experience is much better with lesser crowd. Nonetheless, it is one place that one would want to revisit. Food Canopy, just outside the Raffles Building car park is a good place to fill up before starting your walk."
,,Hours of meandering,5.0,,"Take your time to wander the vast Botanical Gardens. From the easy access of the MRT it can be a most enjoyable day. It is hot, take water, hat and umbrella. Take time to look and enjoy the huge variety of plants attractions. The map provided is just a general indication and you need a nit of flexibility when following it. The gardens are beautifully kept and enjoyed by various exercise groups and locals for exercise. Most interesting from all aspects. The Healing garden and Fragrant garden were really different."
,,Simply beautiful and worth seeing.,5.0,,"I visited the Botanic Gardens at two different times of the day, first in the evening to go to a restaurant located in the center and then back to go jogging during the day.

Being from New York, the Singapore Botanic Gardens offered completely different foliage, beautiful scenery, wild lizards, birds, animals I had never seen before and more.

It is some what scary at night, just because you don't know what the sounds are or what is scurrying by. But it's fun and I will never forget that experience. Whatever the restaurant in the middle was, was delicious and had great wine. I believe the name of it was, Halia.

I also think the gardens has won several prestigious awards for design. Simply beautiful."
,,Glorious,5.0,,"What a wonderful place to visit...and most of it is free. Singapore is pretty well provided for in terms of landscaping and given how densely populated it is, there's a remarkable amount of green space. The Botanic Gardens are a real treat. It's clearly valued by the city... I hate to use a cliche but it's an oasis. You won't regret paying a visit."
,,Large & Well Stocked Garden,4.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens are large, about 2 kilometres from one side to the other, Good paved areas lead through the garden, it houses the Orchid Garden about half way between the bus stops. Well stocked and has some unusual and interesting fountains toward the centre. Well worth a few hours stroll if you love the natural world."
,,Exquisite,5.0,,"Huge, beautifully done, informative, ethereal world. Extensive orchid displays. Requires several hours to explore."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A wonderful place to enjoy a morning walk --you can see something different everyday. Beautiful blooms and statues; birds and monitor lizards too! You can always see people having a picnic or doing Tai Chi or Yoga. One of my favorite places.
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"Absolutely loved the botanical gardens, I went twice in three days. I was so excited to see several types of hummingbirds, huge monitor lizards and lots of plantain squirrels everywhere. The plants were beautiful and I loved the healing garden, just pay in mind the healing garden is closed on Tuesdays."
,,Huge space full of interesting paths and areas,5.0,,"Despite the heat, we wandered around here for over 4 hours and still didn't see all the areas and pathways on offer. You can get the newly extended Downtown MRT line here from Town in several stops and it drops you off right at the entrance gate. The landscaping is beautiful and it's a lovely way to relax in the middle of a frenetic city."
,,Excellent view,5.0,,Its stunning...a must visit place..so colourful n beautiful...free entry!!even outside food is allowed..
,,Must Bring an Umbrella,3.0,,a beautiful view that can relieve our stress. But don't forget to always bring an umbrella because the unpredicted Singapore Weather. Better if we visited at afternoon.
,,Wonderful place to visit if not raining and it has many interesting plants to see and read about.,5.0,,Good for weekend breakfast. Met a friend who lives in Singapore and enjoyed this place very much. After breakfast we strolled around the gardens and took some photos of the kingfishers catching small fish.
,,The smell of this place is lovey,5.0,,Just too casually walk round and take in the various fragrances is absolutely magical. We also found it very clean and tidy.
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,"Lovely gardens in the City with interesting trees and animals - we saw the black swans and some turtles whilst we were there. Only reason it's not 5 stars - there are no monkeys (I was told there would be so I did go there expecting to see monkeys, so I am bias)"
,,Unbelievable amount of greenery for a dense over-populated city,4.0,,"There are many areas within to explore. It is worth the visit, but one must be a fan of the outdoors and have plenty of time. Beautiful different sections and perfectly maintained. Easily accessible as well.
However, with dengue being so rampant in Singapore today, one must be extra careful especially if travelling with little ones or the elderly."
,,Unexpected treat,5.0,,"We were not planning on you g to the gardens as we only had ~ 2 day stay, but our trip was extended and if nothing else we thought it would be good exercise to walk around.

However, the gardens are beautiful and there are about a dozen different areas (evolution garden, orchids area, medicines that come from gardens, etc) and each was very cool.

While this easily takes up half a day, I recommend it for any holiday."
,,Stunning - A MUST for all visitors,5.0,,"Beautifully well maintained gardens and lots of variety to keep interest levels high. There's lots of room in the park, which is good as it can get very busy. The gardens are BIG - I think it took us a good 5 to 6 hours to get round all of the different parts (with lots of drink and air con stops along the way!)

You'll be able to see Turtles and a host of fish in the varies ponds and lakes and monitor lizards often spring up, along with the birds and insects there really is lots to see.

The Garden has a children's only section and several (very good gift shops) and a lively restaurant at the main taxi drop off point.

If it's raining you're going to get wet as there's not too much cover, additionally if it's a bit day you will bake - locals make full use of their umbrellas / parasols here!

Too Tip - buy some fish food from the varies machines by the top lake, you'll make lots of friends!"
,,Gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens separated into sections. It takes a day to amble around them all at a slow pace stopping for lunch and a sit down to watch the world go by.
Take a camera as the orchid garden is simply stunning, we had to pay a small fee to get in which we didn't mind as the actual gardens are free. We saw lots of wildlife, butterflies, dragonflies, monitors and even flying snakes. The restaurant food was divine and the speciality cold drink with honey was simply delectable."
,,Donna,5.0,,A definite must when visiting Singapore. The orchid garden is absolutely fantastic. Our advise is to go early in the morning when it's cooler. Also if you go early you can joint in the morning tai chai class with the locals which is good fun.
,,Beautiful gardens in the city,5.0,,"Went here today with my partner and left amazed by the size and beauty of this place.

Everywhere apart from the orchid gardens are free access to the public we spent three hours there but could easily have half a day there if you so wish!

Avoid the kid day heat by visiting early morning or late afternoon.

Beautiful a must try"
,,A must visit,5.0,,Best is orchid garden They have maintained very well Do bring lots and lots of water and good quality hat Coz it takes 2-4 hrs

,,Perfect for a morning jog,5.0,,"This is a magical place, and it's available for jogging! I especially enjoyed the evolution garden: it starts with only rocks, then come lichen and moss and then the other plants, in the order that they evolved on our planet. What a fun idea, and very well done!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Again these gardens are amazing.. the beautful trees and flowers.. what a peaceful.morning had.. and its free to go and walk around. Some of the attraction like the orchids you had to pay for but it wad really reasonably priced..
,,A little slice of heaven,5.0,,"I went to the botanical gardens with the intention of only staying 1/2 an hour, but ended up walking around for almost two. There are so many beautiful things to see and I barely touched the surface.

I particularly liked the rain forest, although hot and sticky, that was where the least amount of people with selfie sticks were.

I highly recommend going here if you have the time!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Great place to visit and walk through - go early or later in the afternoon to avoid the heat of the day. Beautiful gardens in the middle of a big city.
,,A truly beautiful outing,5.0,,"After receiving some unwelcome news, my wife and I spent a most enjoyable and relaxing several hours strolling around this beautiful destination. Don't think twice. Just go. You'll love it."
,,Morning walk,5.0,,We went in the morning which is cooler. Do take time to enjoy the plants and flowers. It really helped to slow down the pace of life esp in Singapore. Beautiful and theraputic.
,,Great place for a long walk and different trees,5.0,,"Wonderful place for a good long walk and we noticed pond with few tortoise, birds and fish as well. You could notice lot of different trees and plants along the path maintained properly by the staff. Entering this Garden is free of cost. However few attractions inside this park like Orchid garden is charged at a nominal rate."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,The botanic gardens of Singapore is well hidden in the heart of Singapore. A well preserved area that you can walk for hours around. The scenery is wonderful and plenty places to take photos and it's free. You can bring a picnic or eat in the number of eating areas around the gardens. This place must be visited if you are planning a visit to Singapore.
,,Well worth a visit...,5.0,,"Huge botanic gardens in the centre of the city. Easily accessed by road or MRT.

No entry charges (for main gardens) and so a perfect place to escape the bustle of the city when the weather is in your favour.

Particularly liked the rainforest section - some incredible specimens that pre-date the gardens - possibly by hundreds of years.

Make some time on your trip to Singapore to spend a few hours here.

You won't regret it."
,,Fascinating nature!!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore you have to visit the Botanic gardens. It will last half day because it is very large terrain! It has a fascinating nature and very good descriptions about the flowers, trees and other things you can see! An amazing orchid garden!!
A Must Go in Singapore!!"
,,Great place to take the kids on weekends,4.0,,"We come here quite often, although it has probably been a few months since the last visit. Starting at the main entrance and walking around 3km to the exit at the Botanic Gardens mrt makes for an entertaining morning for the children, with stops to feed the fish along the way."
,,A must see,5.0,,"A very large place that makes the best of Singapores flora. Very nice specimens are displayed. Especially peaceful in the morning. You can spot lots of locals who came for a run and early morning excerises. But if you are determined to see all of the park, be prepeared to walk a lot!"
,,A definite must to visit,5.0,,"These gardens are beautiful and well looked after and it is a good day out. Within these gardens is the National Orchid garden which is an additional cost, otherwise the gardens are free. If you are a senior citizen you get a reduction on the entrance fee, you just need to show proof of age. The orchids are well worth seeing and they have an excellent collection. Within the gardens are individual gardens to see like the ginger, the sun, the sundial, the healing gardens collectively and several more. There are also 3 lakes, so pick a lovely day and enjoy."
,,A very special place in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens are very beautiful and have so many unexpected views and places to see. After you visit here a number of times, you will have your favourite tree that you come and talk to. OK, maybe that's just me, but the point is that you can develop a personal connection with this place so that your mood will lift every time you come here. My favourite area is around the Visitor's Centre (entrance opposite Nassim Road) because there is more shade and variety - also the café at the Visitor's Centre is very nice too.

Naturally, it will always be hot and humid here (except in the evenings) so you should bring plenty of water and schedule café stops after you have walked around."
,,Stunning Garden,5.0,,If you're a lover of gardens and/or flowers you must visit. You could spend a very long time here just taking it all in. So beautifully designed. No point going if it's not a beautiful sunny day.
,,Relaxing Place in SuperCity,5.0,,"While visting Singapore for the first time we spent a morning at the beautiful Botanical Garden, a soul soothing place. Don't miss it! And don't miss the Orchid Garden, you have to pay entrace fee though but it worth it!"
,,fabulous,5.0,,"greatly creative on all levels,its a place to stroll and take in the beauty,even tho sometimes the heat is challenging"
,,Fun day with kids,5.0,,"My husband and I had a one day stop over at Singapore travelling to Australia. We decided on spending the day at the zoo with our two sons,hoping it will be cooler. The Zoo is amazing,beautifil and green,well kept animals,a fun day we will never forget."
,,Heavenly gardens,5.0,,"One of the top five things to do in Singapore. We were lucky to see it at its best on a beautiful sunny day. It is a good walk (or jog, as the locals do) in beautifully kept gardens full of fabulous tropical plants and flowers. The National Orchird Garden is inside the Botanic Gardens and is well worth seeing whilst you are there.
The gardens can be very hot and humid and biting insects are about - be prepared!"
,,One of the most lovely places in Singapore,5.0,,"We bring our dog there and just enjoy basking in the gentle sun and watching other families. For dog lovers there are even fountains for water for dogs.

The cafe food is good. You can see ponds there with swans and there are those foot paths with stones for great health. Most importantly, there is a diversity of plants all tagged and a good place to teach young child more on plants and their properties. If you are tired, you can rest at pavilions with shades.

Because of the positive energy, people are friendly and really wonderful. There are also others doing chinese qi gong and fan dance there.

Botanical gardens is very accessible by mrt or bus and stop almost right at the entrance. I m proud as a Singaporean that we have such beautiful places."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,"Stunningly beautiful, and time consuming. We could have spent days here. Easy to access, and there for all to enjoy. Congratulations Singapore, a magnificent place."
,,Tropical Heaven,4.0,,"If you are looking for a most exotic location with the best examples of tropical plants in the open air this is it. Easily reached by taxi or bus and soon the metro this is a must for anyone with a few hours to spare. The orchids are arguably the largest and best in the world. Some blooms are as large as a person's head.
Unlike the Gardens by the Bay which is only a few years old, the Botanic gardens are the result of over 150 years gradual development. The landscaping is exquisite with grassy slopes leading to a lake where a pavilion at the side has concerts and recitals from time to time."
,,One of the best Garden I ever been,4.0,,"When you decide to go Botanical garden in Singapore, you make a right choice. The garden was recently certified as World Heritage Site, truly a garden built and developed by English"
,,"Good visit, shame about the rain!",4.0,,"We love gardens and the Singapore botanic garden is well worth a visit. Really liked the orchid gardens, but probably did not spend long enough as it started raining. Took some great pics though"
,,Fabulous flowers,4.0,,About half an hour stroll from Shangrila Hotel Orchard Road. This was amazing. So relaxing to walk around. The colours of the flowers wer stunning.
,,Its simply breathtaking .....,5.0,,Earlier i thought it was just an ordinary garden...but it much more than a garden when i visited. Must see when you are there in Singapore
,,Not worth going,2.0,,I liked but it's not worth visiting compared to other sites in Singapore. The weather was very hot and couldn't enjoy walking
,,Found parking full,4.0,,"I drove a car and bit stress to find out a parking as there were so many vehicles. I came at noon that is why so fully. I suggest to go by train, easier and efficient. Nice garden with plenty of orchids…"
,,Wow...so beautiful!,5.0,,This was by far one of the highlights for my trip...so peaceful wandering the gardens...from the rain forest to the Orchids...to the healing gardens. many benches to sit and reflect and take in all that nature had to offer!
,,No Interest in Botany? Doesn't Matter,5.0,,"I am a 25 year old male from New York and I've never really had any appreciation for botany and don't typically visit gardens. However, the beauty of these gardens can be appreciated by anyone. Prepare yourself for a lot walking and be sure to bring water if you're going during the warmer months. You will not be disappointed visiting the Singapore Botanic Gardens."
,,Best Orchid & Botanic Garden Ever!,5.0,,"Amazing widest range of orchids we have ever seen and truly we were at the right time to visit last year in July 2015 as it was their SG50 and they had a special orchids arraignment around the garden and main building area.

Recommend to go with family and friends and children would enjoy it too! May get hot and humid so make sure you are dressed light and with a short handle umbrella if you are going during the monsoon season.

They have a very nice cafeteria too and excellent desert there!"
,,Orchid Garden is Educational & Relaxing,5.0,,"The Botanic Garden has 2 Gates entrance - bukit timah gate is the MRT (Circle Line) and tanglin gate. I started from Tanglin, a smooth walk overlooking the greenery and towards the VIP Orchid Garden area. $5 per pax. Learnt about how Singapore foster ties using special named and hybrid orchids.

Good walk for the body, enrich the mind and soul. Take it as a photo journey. ;) Along the way, many babies and expensive dogs can be seen as families and friends gathered.

There is a cafe Casa Verde or something which has all day breakfast and then head out to bukit timah gate."
,,Gardeners Delight,4.0,,"If you like tropical plants, this is place to visit. It is well laid out with so many plants that its beyond belief"
,,"If you only have time to see one place in Singapore, this is it.",5.0,,"If you only have time to visit one place in Singapore, then Botanic Gardens is the place to go. You will find a huge varieties of trees, plants, and flowers here. And of course, the orchids. Visit early in the morning between 6:30-8:30 or after 17:00 to avoid the scorching Sun. Orchard road, the shopping belt of Singapore, is just a 5 mins stroll away."
,,Singapore's Best Garden UNESCO World Heritage Site,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden VIP is a must visit, $5 per pax additional ;) Interesting way to de-stress by walking in the VIP Orchid Garden.

Rest of the garden is free admission. There are 2 gates, Tanglin or Bukit Timah.
Circle line is Bukit Timah gate.

Learn about how Singapore foster economic and national relationship thru Orchid Flowers! Singapore is indeed small nation but powerful one with friendly economic ties."
,,Beautiful garden experience.,5.0,,If you are looking for an escape from the busy streets this is the place to go to for that relaxing time. You can walk for hours or just sit and enjoy the wonderful landscaped gardens and the shade houses.
,,Don't overlook these gardens!,5.0,,"Now that there is the massive garden complex over at Marina Bay the Botanical Gardens could be forgotten. Whatever you do ensure you visit these as well, tranquil, dream like colours and plants, beautiful meandering walk ways, ponds, hillside views, and again covers a huge area. AND it's FREE!
The Orchid gardens like nothing anywhere in the world, definitely worth paying the extra to view these, this is Singapore's national emblem and to see the real thing breath taking.
Paths and walk ways well sign posted, and friendly staff to assist if you're not sure where to go. Shady places for sitting which is a must!
Found the AA City Map Guide book of great use for a suggested walking tour to follow, starting at the Tanglin Gate
Great choice of eating places too for every budget.
Again like the Gardens by the Bay get a taxi to save your energy levels for this superb experience."
,,Lovely Stroll to Relax and Learn,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens is well loved by Singaporeans. I saw many families picnicking in the heat...and a number of wildlife photographers poised for a shot (one was pointed to a hummingbird nest, one pointed up into the canopy at two huge owls). The heat was a bit difficult to handle, but I woudl highly recommend the gardens. I took the hop-on-hop-off bus out there, and it was great."
,,Good place to chill,3.0,,Is a good place to chill but quite confusing inside. They should provide portable maps at the beginning of the entrance
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A lovely few hours spent among the trees. Singapore does so well at keeping things green in the midst of a major world city.
,,A magical place,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are sensationally beautiful, and their new status as a World Heritage Site is totally well deserved.They are large and very well maintained, and I like to run there in the early evening when the sun has gone down and it is a bit cooler, but you can visit them any time and enjoy a walk in the meadows under ancient trees or visit the lovely Orchid Garden with its gorgeous display of orchids from this region. I also like the cool house and its plants from the misty tropical highlands. While admission to the Botanic Gardens is free, there is a SGD 5 admission fee for the Orchid Garden, but it's well worth paying for that. Make sure to bring a camera for some great shots of unusual plants! If you enjoy running, wear warm weather running clothes, sunscreen and a hat; if you just want to walk, flip flops will do, but sunscreen and a hat are always a good idea. The Gardens also have a few restaurants and cafes. I take all our visitors to the Botanic Gardens and no one has yet been disappointed by them."
,,Free and incredible - no reason not to!,5.0,,"We spent the morning at the gardens and we very impressed. The park is massive, with plenty of unique areas - healing garden, orchid garden, fragrant plants, etc. visitor/refreshment centers can be found scattered throughout to get a much needed break from the heat.

This is easily accessible by public transit, and a short distance (if you end in the right area) from Orchard st to wander into shops afterwards.

It's also free (except for $5 for optional the orchids ), making it a no brainier! Definitely recommend!"
,,Great if you're into botanics!,5.0,,"Consider wandering around even if it's for a short while, a great walk surrounded by fresh air, feels great after living in China for 6 months. The gardens are extremely well taken care of, orchid gardens are a must-see. Great for a short stroll just before your flight back."
,,a wonderful place,5.0,,"a wounderful place in the middle of a city. that is, besides many other things, what makes singapore so special. we are going to return there on our next visit in december this year."
,,Great track for morning run :),4.0,,I thought it was 'easy' track but apparently this huge garden has various altitude which makes the running more challenging. Go to the 'swan lake' and feel the serenity although you don't see any swans :). The fresh air will make you want to stay longer at the garden.
,,A place so serene,4.0,,"Easily accessible by car and carpark is available. They have sovernior shops and places to have a cup of coffee and rest your tired feet. Place is so well kept, so serene, so much greenery and tranquil."
,,"Peaceful, clean and beautiful environment",4.0,,"We took a stroll through the gardens in the cool of the evening. Gardens are stunning, and there are lots of quiet areas for reflection. The orchid nursery is a must see. Unforgettable!"
,,Oasis in the City,5.0,,"Take the MRT or the Hop On Hop Off Bus or a taxi to the National Botanic Gardens. It is best to visit in the early morning as it is cool and while some of the walks are shaded many areas are not. Early morning is also the best time to see locals going about their everyday life such as jogging, walking dogs, picnicking or relaxing. Plants on the sides of the paths are labelled so there is plenty for the plant enthusiast to see and learn. In the small pond where children can wade in the shallows there are turtles which come quite close. We also saw many turtles and a strange lizard like creature in the large lake. During our visit we paid to enter the National Orchid Garden. As we had taken our four year old grandson with us we also visited the free Jacob Ballas Garden for children. Many children were enjoying the play areas, one with sand and slides and were also climbing a tree that had low thick branches. As well there were trees bearing fruit growing in this garden, an education for a child who had never seen tropical fruit growing. This garden is located closer to the MRT entrance than to the other and has a cafe that caters specifically for children. Other cafes are near the Orchid Garden and the Hop on Hop off bus and taxi rank entrance. Take water with you as it does get hot when you are walking around. I recommend the National Botanic Gardens as a place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore."
,,A sanctuary,5.0,,"The lovely greens! It's a vast space of all the shades of green. The trees are old and massive; the orchids are of all colors imaginable; The grass is green and inviting; the lake and swan are perfectly content. The children's garden has a treehouse slide and a water play area so bring some change of clothes. There is also a small cafe at the children's garden entrance for drinks and snacks. It's free of charge general admission, and $5 for the orchid garden. It's hot but there are plenty of shady areas. Bring hats and sunglasses."
,,Well worth a wander,4.0,,"You can't go to Sinapore without wandering around the beautiful Singapore Botanic Gardens. So much love and care has gone into creating these gardens and it's clear the staff of today are dedicated to protecting the history as the surrounds are so beautifully manicured and maintained. The gardens will cost you nothing but it's well worth the $5 entry fee to go into the National Orchid Garden where the shapes, sizes and colours of the flowers will impress you no end. It's hard to imagine in this day and age you can spend a day at a major tourist attraction such as this for just $5. Well done all concerned!"
,,A lovely afternoon walk,4.0,,"We were in singapore for a week in March and spent the first afternoon here. The kids loved it, just being outside seeing the swans and picking up sticks. A great place to good to."
,,Beautiful and big,5.0,,"Lovely gardens and wildlife. Free to enter, but do pay Singapore $5 for access to the orchid house. Good choice of eateries and restaurants. Plenty of helpful staff enthusiastic about sharing their knowledge."
,,Picnic in the Gardens,5.0,,Good place to sit down and relax. Nice place for the children to run around and play. Bring a picnic basket if you just want to have a relaxing afternoon with your children without spending too much money.
,,Sunday Morning Walk,5.0,,"An UNESCO Heritage Site now. My country one and only Heritage Site.

Leisure walk will see little lakes with its wildlife. Swans swimming around. Walking through the tropical rainforest, seeing flowering and non-flowering plants, ferns, fungus etc. Hear the birds chirping in the air. Water fountains dripping. Naughty dogs met each other, started barking, once a while. See butterflies and bees working on flowers. It's just many colours added onto this garden. Returning all to nature.

Many joggers running about. Seniors in groups doing exercises or taiji. Some ladies at quiet corners practising yoga. Pet lovers walking their dogs. Some others drinking morning coffee or eating breakfast at the cafe. The many greens reduce the heat, a haven for fresh air.

A great place for morning or evening walk. I prefer the morning walk... more cooling, can also see the dews on plants."
,,Flora at it's best,5.0,,"You could spend the whole day just wandering through these gardens. Stunning orchards, ferns and trees. It was so hot that I had cut my time short. I would visit again either early morning or when the day is a little cooler."
,,Just for almost one week excursîon.,5.0,,"Hats off. In a very limited space, every moment of enjoyment is there. What a classic beauty to behold."
,,peaceful in the morning,4.0,,"A beautiful environment away from the streets, I went in the morning and it was lovely and quiet. I especially enjoyed the orchid garden and learning about the horticultural species."
,,Tropical wonderland,5.0,,"When the Singaporeans decide to do something well, they do it 100%. The Botanic Gardens have been around for over a century and they are a credit to the island republic. There are many routes through the gardens, The only fee charged is if you want to see the national orchid gardens."
,,Huge garden nice for kids,4.0,,This is the 3rd time i going there. I dont know i just like to go there just for jogging or just relax. We can feeling the fresh air and everything its so green. My kids so happy can playing with some activities in some playground. Just relax and enjoy your healty and fun with family!
,,Awesome,4.0,,Smooth and peaceful hours at this place. Highly recommend the cool house.Or just lying lazy around without worry.
,,Good place to see tropical garden,4.0,,Should go early and give a whole day to enjoy the garden. Orchid garden has a lot of variety. Bromeliad plants are beautiful. Should have some chairs for senior citizen to rest.
,,Fabulous flowers,5.0,,"Especially the Orchid gardens, this place has the most fantastic selection of flowers I have ever seen. It is a definate must see for any traveller to Singapore. Easily reached by bus or taxi (cheap), there are acres to see and lots to do when your there"

,,Rainforest and orchid extravaganza,5.0,,Spend a couple of soothing hours in this beautiful garden. Rainforest walk with many interesting and informative signs; the orchid gardens are spectacular! Cloud forest glasshouse was fascinating and we really enjoyed our trip here.
,,Marvellous!,5.0,,"This really is a must-see! Well-laid-out, with an incredible collection of plants from all over the world, beautifully maintained. Most have helpful information nearby."
,,A peaceful place,3.0,,"We went there with family in the evening time. We took the Metro (MRT) to reach this place and it was a good travel experience. As we reached here, there was some construction going on near the entry side. But the garden was awesome and very large. Despite of being evening (playful) time, we found the garden very quiet and calm and was a peaceful place. The lake inside the garden has beautiful species such as tortoise, ducks etc. which the children enjoyed to gaze at."
,,Take your time,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are huge. We found it difficult to cover all the areas as you were constantly criss-crossing the park, so take your time if you want to see it all. Easy access from MRT/buses. We came in at one end and exited the other."
,,Get Away in the Center of Brick and Mortar,4.0,,"I first discovered the Botanic Gardens when I went there for a run at 7 am on a Saturday morning. I honestly couldn't believe this place, with its green open spaces, existed in the middle of Singapore.

Since then, I've visited multiple times to enjoy it's atmosphere, listen to live music, eat good breakfasts, people watch and have picnics.

This really is a fantastic place. However, and because of the reasons listed above, it can also get very crowded, especially on Sunday's. So pre-plan and have a great time."

We enjoyed some sunny weather and then some heavy rain (which cooled the atmosphere and allowed us to relax under a quiet shelter in the gardens).

We went on a weekday morning and it was very pleasant walking around the gardens and lakes. Be prepared for plenty of walking as it is a very large site but is reasonably flat.
The small charge to enter the Orchid gardens is well worth it and we have never before seen the wide variety of beautiful blooms.
If you enjoy gardens this is a 'must see' whilst in Singapore."
,,Wonderful way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"We visited the gardens, it's free admission to enter and just a very small charge if you want admission to the orchid section within the gardens (well worth the extra few dollars).

Even though it was early in spring, virtually everything appeared to be in full bloom."

The gardens are well laid out with a large lake in it which contains turtles . The gardens are well signposted to help you find what you're looking for. Plenty of facilities within the gardens. The only thing you have to pay for is the national orchid garden but it is well worth the money, in fact 60 and over only have to pay $2 . This is truly a tropical paradise."
,,Beautiful World Heritage Garden,4.0,,"The garden has been exist for more than 150 years and was inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015. The garden is 74 hectares and took me 5 hours to walk from one end to the other. The garden is open to public free of charge daily from 5am to 12am all year round. There's a Orchid Garden within the garden. Entry to this Orchid Garden is chargeable but at a very low price of SGD5.00 per entry.
This is a very beautiful gardens with lots of common and exotic plants separated into various themes and sections.
The garden also provided many resting pavilions and gazebos in case you are tire or rainy day. Drinking fountains also can be found at various locations.

,,Beautiful flowers and plants relaxing on a hot day,5.0,,We went there on a hot day of April 2016...it is recommended to go there in February as it is cooler and you can enjoy walks without worrying about sun burns. Or do what we did to bring an umbrella. The garden is beautiful and there are water fountains that you can soak your self in if it gets too hot.

,,Extremely Interesting,4.0,,we arrived just as the heavens opened but this is Singapoe after all! Spent a fascinating 3 hours there but barely scratched the surface of what was on offer.
,,Gardens and Orchids,4.0,,"Allow plenty of time, make sure you visit the orchid house and displays.

Look for the bronze statues hidden in the trees, flowers , vegetation and Lawns.

Taxi to and from is the best option.

Note the taxi rank within the gardens as if you leave by the south exit flagging a taxi down may be difficult due to the road works in the area.

See the water fall , good photo opportunity.

Great afternoon activity.

Spot the Lizards sunbathing amongst the trees bases.

Very clean, no litter and well kept and maintained."

,,A beautiful afternoon wander,5.0,,Def a spot to visit!!! The orchid garden is beautiful but if you don't want to pay there is still lots to see! A little slice of calm in singapore!
,,Lovely bit of downtime strolling,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens are gorgeous and easily accessible via the botanical gardens MRT metro stop. The station literally sits beside one of the gardens many entrances.

When we visited we had to endure a thunder storm but even during that storm the gardens were still a treat to see and in Singapore the thunder storms never last long and the sun dries everything out fairly instantly.

The gardens are free to enter which is another bonus and there are plenty of wide open grassy spaces where a picnic can be enjoyed. The one part of the gardens that requires an entrance fee is the orchid garden that is well worth the 5 Singapore dollar fee. There are some gorgeous variations of orchids to see and the gardens are spotless and perfect in their beautiful layout.

If you fancy a couple of hours away from the city then this is the perfect place."
,,"Lovely location, but food under par",4.0,,"Stunning architecture and gardens. This is one of those few truly unique, and uniquely Singaporean, locations.
However, the beauty of the location does not make up for the borderline passable food. Some of the food presented was good - the beef sliders - but other offerings were poor.

Even so , is recommended this location for the tourism or local, wanting to view a little beauty."
,,-,5.0,,Good experience and nice place to visit I have seen many plants I have never seen before And the service in the entrance counter also very good
,,Good Informative Too,4.0,,"it was a good experience, especially the Orchid Garden.. huge collection of Orchids. calm and quite place"

,,wild life in the box,5.0,,"see what is within the planet of unique thing in one place, nicely designed and good work in arranging things arround"
,,A nice escape from the busy city,5.0,,"We went here as it was on our to do list from our previous visit to Singapore,
We were lucky enough to be there on a perfect day, it was not too busy and not too hot or steamy, the gardens are beautiful and make you forget that there is a city just outside.
We were a little hungry when we got there so decided to have Brunch, Unusual but very nice French toast and Bacon with cream.
The many different types of areas were interesting, but I was disappointed that it was the wrong time of year for the Frangipani Garden, I could only imagine how Fragrant and Colourful the trees would be.
We only had one annoying issue, We found it easy to get to by Taxi, but near impossible to get a Taxi back from there, we and quite a few other people had to walk over to the hospital to get in a very long taxi queue. I can not see why they do not have a taxi stand there.

but besides that it was worth a few hours to stroll through and relax before going back into the traffic."
,,Excellent,4.0,,"weather we ca not change as it was hot, rest is amazing... we had a nice walk in gardens... i suggest they also must arrange some gold car for families who are having kids or senior citizens as walk till swan lake is alot."
,,An Oasis in the City state,5.0,,"Amazing and diverse, great for fun in the sun, picnics, runs/walks, pet friendly - and free to all. Never gets old."
,,Heartbeat of Singapore gardens,4.0,,"If you look at the map, you would be amazed at how big this Botanic Gardens is. And it'd better be, for on weekends, and even every evening, it is jam-packed with people!

I have yet to explore more of this area. I need to return again some time soon!"
,,Everything in Singapore has a touch of class,4.0,,"Coming to the Botanic Gardens was an inspirational experience, beyond Botanical.

,,Magical experience,5.0,,"Even if you are not a flower person, one cannot fail but be mesmerised by the orchids on display. I could have spent more time in the gardens quite happily. I brought the orchids all home on memory cards - ready to download and amaze my friends!"
,,Good on its own but exceptional with the Orchids,4.0,,"If like us you thought the Orchid Garden was much further out than the Botanical gardens you might be inclined to miss these two attractions. The whole experience is delightful --if! you take your time. In these temperatures it is madness to rush. The whole garden is extensive but with very good signage and paths. The section dedicated to the orchids is a wonderful display of flower colour and design.
The main gardens are free but there is a reasonable charge to see the orchids.
We visited in blazing sun but it would be nice to visit in the rain, if only for the slightly cooler temperatures."
,,A wonderful place to spend the day,5.0,,"We spent a whole day walking round the Botanic Gardens and still didn't see everything. Lots of parts to the park, lots of space, clean and well maintained.

Very clean, gardens are beautiful, washrooms are accessible anywhere you go and unlike other countries, you do not have to pay when you need the washroom. Foods are cheap and many selections from Ameican, European, Asian, etc. Recomended time to go though is February as April to June is too hot."
,,lovely place,5.0,,"One of my favorite place in Singapore to have a picnic. I would usually have them at the lawn in front of the symphony stage.
There are a few restaurants, an orchid garden (entrance fee required) , a mini waterfall and even a swan lake. A very serene feel to it. Just keep in mind that the place can be very dark after 7pm and it's not that well-litted.

Things people usually do here:
1. picnics
2. take walks or a jog
3. swan lake
4. watch performances
5. take pictures at the mini waterfall
6. bridal photoshoots
7. orchid garden (entry fee required)"
,,Lovely gardens,3.0,,"Whilst it was lovely and beautiful, I did realise that unless you are a devoted garden fan, it is probably not the best way to spend your time. I managed to get lost trying to find the orchids - gave up after a while. The healing garden is interesting, but I was a bit bored after awhile."
,,"See a bit of home, more of local and lots of other countries gardens",5.0,,"This is well worth the trip, allow a couple of hours minimum as there is a lot to cover. The garden is sectioned by country and has clear makings of the many varieties of plants. Its a warm walk as is any where in Singapore but well worth it."
,,A dream garden,5.0,,"Botanic is a very beautiful garden , I loved to have my early morning and early evening walk in there, I loved it when not much people there yet it just like a garden of paradise, there's a lake,a swan lake and the orchids garden was amazing, the place where very good for picnic too.."

,,UNESCO World Heritage Site.. and no wonder!,4.0,,Singapore's very own UNESCO world heritage site! A very well curated garden and a welcomed green oasis in the middle of densely populated and built-up Singapore... A tip for visitors: Check to see if there are any free concerts on the weekends! Nothing beats having free live orchestra/ jazz music as you kick back on your picnic mat and enjoy some red wine UNDER THE STARS! Simply magical...
,,MUST VISIT,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Garden is one of the best in Asia. It has an Orchid Garden with many different species and scientific breeding of cross breed of orchids.

It also has many different plants, bushes and one will be impressed on the beautiful spacious lay out. Botanical Garden also make one feels calm, peaceful and healthy as the air is very fresh. It has a tropical forest and many different gardens especially there is a Garden for kids

A good picnic place and it also has some good restaurant."
,,My favorite!,5.0,,"I visited this area for multiple time because I like it a lot. Very convenience because it's located near to MRT station. Botanic garden is just calming and relaxing.

,,A Garden of Many Flavours and Sights,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Garden is one of many flavours and sights. By flavours I mean that there is always some event going on in the Gardens itself be it a Jazz or Rock concert at the Symphony Lake or a line up of floral arrangements by the local schools. It's never boring.

The one thing I really love about the Gardens is that its great for running in especially in the early morning (at 5.30 am) or late in the evening. One can just run the meandering paths from the main gates all the way to the back gate at Cluny Road, enjoying the coolness of the dark and greet the coming of dawn. You also get to see interest groups gathered for yoga, tai chi and other forms of exercises.

The Fragrant Garden and Healing Gardens are my favorite parts and I'll always plan it into my route just to breath in the soft fragrance from the plants. Best time to visit is in the early morning or evenings."
,,A beautiful oasis in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,This is a gorgeous place for old and young alike. I am fortunate to live beside it. Not only is it a beautifully curated garden but for children there is a real sense of adventure with ponds full of fish and turtles and monitor lizards roaming about. The Jacob Ballas Children's Garden is a must for anyone with kids. Really recommend making this UNESCO heritage site a stop on your Singapore visit.

,,Picnic at the botanic,5.0,,"Nice chill places. Feed the turtles at either of the lakes. (Bring your own dollar coins, there is no change machine for the fish food vending machines. )

I like the swings. Bit rusty so hopefully you aren't wearing your Sunday best. It's just nice and relaxing.

I even saw a big Komodo dragon walk past me. Very cool."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit if you're staying in the city beyond a day or two. Tranquil, even on the weekend, and a lovely way to escape the busy streets.

,,Serene garden in a modern city.,5.0,,"Singapore has many parks and greenery but this recently inscribed UNESCO 150year old park left by the British is not to be given a miss if you drop by the garden city. A huge habitat where families can gather to enjoy the flora and faunas, children will have fun exploring the park, the only downside is that it can be very hot during the summer months so always bring your umbrellas and water bottles!"
,,Just beautiful!!,5.0,,"I walked 20 mins down the road to get here from where I was staying, went into the gardens at the MRT Station entrance(Cluny Rd. Entrance) The gardens are just beautiful and serene and lovely. It's a good walk around to see most of it, it's pretty hot so expect to get a bit sweaty!
Easy to get around, sign posts are everywhere."
,,So peaceful,5.0,,We spent a leisurely day wandering around these beautiful gardens and I would definitely go back again if I have the opportunity. A good way to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and an easy metro ride from town. The orchid gardens were amazing and I fell in love with the Swan Lake. There are a number of cafes and restaurants where you can grab some good food and a refreshing cocktail and there is lots of useful and interesting information posted along the way. A Singapore 'must see'!
,,Our gardens are Singapore's First UNESCO World Heritage site,5.0,,"It is one of the most beautiful sites where you can experience flora and fauna of all kinds from all over the globe. We have a Orchid garden within where orchids hold the names of Prime Ministers, Presidents and dignitaries who have come to visit Singapore and been honoured with this custom. Our national flower is the Vanda Miss Joaquim, one species of orchids.

You can find people, old and young exercising in the garden as early as 5am in the morning. It is a lovely time of the day to just meditate in the midst of all of nature's sights and sounds.
The Swan Lake is a major attraction in the gardens. It is home to many species of aquatic plants and fishes. We have a Bonsai garden, Sun garden, Healing garden, Rain forest, Ginger garden and so many others.

Do go there and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Have a happy adventure."
,,Pride of Singapore,5.0,,"visitors will enjoy this UNESCO heritage garden! Full of unique tropical plants n trees species.

Special mention: orchid gardens, tropical secondary forested area(look out for sighting of the wild cockerel family). Visit between 6.30 8.30am, or 5.30-7pm is ideal to enjoy the freshness of morning dew, or the cool tropical afternoon in Singapore. Walk or jog as you like after which relax at any of the cafes in or at the garden fringe.

,,gorgeous,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are on our 'bucket list' whenever we visit Singapore for their green spaces, stately layout, delightful hidden corners and also for odd activities going on there such as Tai Chi classes. It's always interesting to see what has been added to the collection (medicinal plants are the latest I believe) as well as to re-visit old favourites such as the orchid garden. If you prefer just to wander about there is a range of different environments to enjoy from the rain forest through to the fossilised section. Explanations are clear, sign posting is excellent and the watering holes by the main entrance offer some welcome refreshments (Singapore's heat and humidity can make for energy sapping perspiration)."

It is truly a sight to behold. The work that went into creating such a terrific display of flora is a sight to behold. We especially loved the waterfall and the trail surrounding it.
,,A very special place,5.0,,"We've been living in Singapore for a couple of years now and the Botanic Gardens never fail to fall outside of our most recommended spots on the island. The nature is just BEAUTIFUL, the atmosphere is one of calm and wonder and the size is perfect for a morning or afternoon wander. Explore with a partner, friends or family and don't miss the rainforest walk, concert stage and Orchid Garden...it's worth the few dollars!"
,,Visit is a must,4.0,,Very nice surrounding. Will definitely love by nature lovers. Ideally for family to have a relaxing time. Try visit in the afternoon. Quite distant though from the train.

,,Well maintained,3.0,,"Nice garden to visit. lots of greenery, well maintained and everything is kept very clean and maintained."
,,Educational garden,4.0,,It has many varieties of plants and it is very educational because under each plant or tree will be the description of it. It is a great place to walk around with your family and friends and to learn more about nature
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The most beautiful garden I have ever visited!! Everything is clean and well kept. The orchid pavilion is amazing and there is a space for award winning orchids and orchids named after celebrities and world leaders. Try to go in the morning when is not hot or humid. We encountered an excursion of pre-school children and that made our day!!
,,What a well kept and well laid out gardens.,5.0,,"What a pleasure it was walking through the gardens, where the staff were so polite and really worked hard to keep this treasure so very beautiful.

,,Nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of Singapore,4.0,,"Huge place for a nice stroll after dinner, definitely not in the afternoon under the blazing sun. Plenty of picnic spots for gatherings and chilling."
,,Nice to get away from the huddle and bustle of the city,5.0,,If you are needing a break from the pavement then head to these gardens. They are immaculately presented as you would expect in Singapore and have some amazing areas to venture. Even if you just want to have a nice picnic it's a geat place.
,,Nice place - must go.,4.0,,"Just one of the places you need to visit if you have some spare time in Singapore. I spend about 3-4 hours, both inside as outside. Unique setting, never seen before."
,,Great parks and formal gardens,5.0,,"Great place to visit, but it can be hot so take a drink. Start at the visitor centre (get a taxi here) then walk down through the park. The orchid garden you have to pay for (well worth it) otherwise its all free. At the end you can wander onto Orchard Road for a bit of shopping if that's you bag."
,,Most Beautiful Botanical Gardens!,5.0,,"I visited this Botanical Gardens in January 2016. It was FREE! The grounds were so gorgeous and everything was meticulously manicured. Nothing was out of place anywhere! The gardens were clearly tended to by experts and every little detail was perfect! The orchid gardens were a small fee but had every variety of orchid known to man! This is a very easy place to walk and spend a whole day! The coffee shops, restaurants and gift shops were high quality!! I will visit again next time!"
,,Beautiful Green Garden,5.0,,It was a well organized garden with various plants and hybrids. The distance from one end to another can be quite menacing but the colorful plant there will please your eyes away. The orchid park is cheap enough; 5 dollar for adult and 1 (ONE) Dollar for student and you can see a lot of mesmerizing orchids within your grip. Bring your camera! Worth it
,,Free - no entrance fee,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens to visit. We spent 3 hours walking through the gardens which I believe is a UNESCO Heritage site. The great thing about Singapore is that there is a railway station every junction, so travelling is extremely convenient."
,,A great botanical garden Nd world heritage site,5.0,,"No one should visit Singapore without visiting the wonderful botanical gardens and in particular the orchid garden. The whole area is beautifully landscaped, reflecting its mid 19th Century, essentially English origins. The variety of trees and plants is breathtaking and they are well labelled for those who are interested. Go early though before the temperature is too high and be prepared for a hot and tropical experience. Take water!"
,,So beautiful,3.0,,It's an absolutely beautiful garden with so much to offer and looking at the pictures on here we barely saw any of it. Being that were not from that type of climate we struggles to find shade and you really must wear sunscreen cause you can't hide from the sun! Worth a visit if you love flowers and can handle some serious heat and sunshine.
,,Pretty garden!,5.0,,"We took a walk from botanic gardens mrt to orchard road, nice for friends and couples who love walking and don't mind the heat! Always something to look at along the trail! Especially nice in the morning"
,,Eden Garden,5.0,,"opens from 5 a.m. to 12 midnight every day More than 10,000 species of flora is spread over its 82-hectares area… it is worth the visit with whole family…."
,,Unesco garden with old history,5.0,,"Enjoy in a great park with all national tree, plants, lake, and a long time history garden around 160 years. It is convenient to travel and walk here and see a lot zones in the park via MRT blue line station Botanic garden and access to the park directly. I spend time 2-4 hours here to walk around."
,,green oasis - paradise for runners,5.0,,"Singapore has a very disciplined traffic, so it's easy to see people jogging and running on sidewalks and around the city. I usually stay next to the botanic gardens as they are the perfect spot for a nice run. You can enjoy a wonderful surrounding, lakes, trees, wild animals, ..... amazing. Over the weekend it can be pretty crowded; pay attention to that"
,,Tranquillity in the heart of the city,5.0,,"I love this place. It is best in the early morning, at around 7.30, when the air is cool enough for a wander. It is also lovely to watch senior citizens who gather near the Orchid Garden for their exercise - tai chi. Sometimes you'll find owls staring down at you and monitor lizards scampering to get away from you. Such a beautiful place that makes visitors forget they are in a densely populated city."
,,Good for an midday run,5.0,,"Went for a beautiful run around noon, there is lots of beautiful scenes to view as you stroll or runs around! Would be great for a lunch as well"
,,Beautiful and lush!,5.0,,Spent a few hours wandering the Botanic Gardens in Singapore - very beautiful and wide variety of plants and flowers. The ampitheater is impressive and wandering the grounds is a lot of fun.
,,Inner peace,5.0,,"It's the best place to take a break from the hustle and bustle city life. You can jog, walk, dog walk, take pictures (selfie, wefie, or professional/amateur photography), or even eat and drink here. I thought I was visiting a park in London, it's just so British-like. Not forget to mention, there are swans in the lake."
,,Just lovely....,5.0,,Take a hat or umbrella and some water! It is hot at the gardens however the greenery is so beautiful and there are some cool corners. The trees are spectacular. What I really like is that this is a 'living' space where people come to picnic and play games as well as admire the trees and plants.
,,If you love parks and flowers then go,3.0,,"We went with children and friends and they got bored easily. However, if you are visiting Singapore and not familiar with some of the tropical plants and like orchids you should definitely go! Be prepared to walk very long distances. Take water bottles."
,,"not enough time to see the site, you can stay longer, and make your own way home",3.0,,"the trip was from a common area, the ride was very short, the time at the site was limited, this is a very pleasant experience but more time is needed."
,,What motivates Singaporean to get up at 5am,4.0,,"Singapore had been criticised as a modern concrete jungle which has lost its soul. The rapid urbanization had destroyed much of the ""old"" that most foreign travellers yearn to see.
The government had embarked sucessfully on a program to make Singapore a Garden City, definitely greener than most great cities in the world
This Botanic gardens had been there since time in memorial right in the heart of city. It is a UNESCO World heritage site.
you have to pay to drive into the city but you can walk through this garden for free (except for the orchid garden)
This is where friends and family, young and old gather for a healthy walk and exercise at 6am for the fresh clean air, before it gets hot and humid and polluted with exhaust fumes. This is priceless.
For some, the attraction is the breakfast at the exit gate"
,,This place was simply incredible and free,5.0,,"I absolutely adored walking around the gardens. I got lost many times but there are lots of maps to help you back on track.

I found it difficult walking around in the heat and there were no places to buy drinks outside of the main entrance.

Look out for the big cat fish in the lake."
,,An Orchid Lover's Delight,5.0,,The best part for me of the Botanic gardens was the National Orchid Collection. The entrance fee is cheap and you can wander around approximately 85 hectares planted with the most wonderful orchids seen in their natural habitat. It is very well laid out and there are paths for wheelchair users. There is also a café. The orchids are situated in the middle of the Botanic gardens so there is about a half an hour's walk to access it.
,,All biomes under one roof,4.0,,"Great experience if you are interested in flora but if you are the type that thinks a tree is a tree is a tree, green n brown then skip this place. It is well maintained and the mind boggling varieties of orchids is worth the ticket price.
However once inside The Cloud Forest experience is amazing so if you are short of time or disinterested in the other flora head straight for that. A sight for sore eyes.."
,,beuatifully designed,4.0,,"the different sections of the gardens are well thought trough and just walking around there makes you appreciate nature so much! i think i spend around 3 hours just wandering around! its a paradise within the modern, fast moving city!"
,,A lovely way to spend a few hours,5.0,,Absolutely immaculate grounds which are free except for the orchid garden. However this must not be missed as it is fabulous even if you don't have a great interest in orchids. Suggest that you go early in the morning. There is a decent restaurant if you want to extend your visit.
,,Bit disappointing,3.0,,I first end visited this on my first trip to Singapore and remember being considerably more impressed by it than this time...may be time has taken its toll on it felt a bit dated and sad...may be still worth a visit as located in a nice open green space in Singapore ..a rarity so enjoy!
,,A nice park,3.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a nice place to visit. It is a very large park and good for walking, jogging and see different beautiful flowers. You can also see lizards and black swan there.

However, when I visited there at afternoon, it was too HOT for me. I advise you to visit there at a cloudy day."
,,Great morning tour,5.0,,Only for those who can walk and walk and walk. Best toured in the morning to avoid the sweltering heat. Accessible by MRT. Wheelchair by request .
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"So much has been written here already, so what's left to add? Maybe this: we live in Singapore. We come here a lot. For walks, to jog, to see flowers, huge lizards and trees. It's worth coming. Don't miss it."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is a beautiful park that is absolutely free to walk around. There were lizards strolling across the lawns and groups of school children enjoying the peaceful gardens. stunning. There is a visitor desk where you can collect a map of the garden.
,,A must!,5.0,,"The gardens are a beautiful and tranquil place in the middle of this busy city. The orchids are beautiful, the whole gardens is well kept. The hop on hop off buses stop here. It's free entry, although you do pay to visit the orchid garden, well worth it. Give yourselves a few hours to enjoy the space."
,,Fun Jog,5.0,,"Had my morning jog at the botanical garden felt so good. The fresh air, the scenery..loved it ! I also do the trail run.. Ho ho ho..for once you forgot that you are in a sprawling city..very nice ! My mother (79) love doing her morning walk here also and she can walk for more than 5 km without being exhausted..thanks for the scenery ! Go to Swan Lake to get the best spot for selfie :) Highly recommend for those who need a short get away from all the busy and dynamic life of Singapore."
,,Exquisite,5.0,,"The climate in Singapore is hot and humid and like being in the hot house in Kew Gardens, but outside. As a result the world heritage site Botanic Gardens have a wonderful display of flowering plants that is probably unrivalled elsewhere. There is no other advice except to make the visit."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"By American standards, this park is stunningly beautiful. Situated in the midst of an urban center, this was an oasis, which is well worth a visit."
,,A lovely oasis in the middle of a sprawling city.,5.0,,"At first I thought upon arrival( adding the mrt has,a gate at its doors) it was going to be a place similar to Kings Park, on a Sunday just full of people. As there were plenty filling in.
Decided to go the opposite way and I lost the crowds,until i returned back to the gate.
I spent near on 5 hours in the garden. Leisurely strolling around, looking at the many plants. A rainforest section still exists in one area, the only surviving one in Singapore. An orchid garden, $5 entry fee. Bromelaids, ferns water features big open areas, heaps of bouganvilleas. The only disappointing thing was the time of year I went as most plants were not flowering and pictures suggested otherwise.
I did like the idea of small springs aroubd the trees. These had the trees name on and are designed to expand with the trunk.
There is a map, I walked from one end to the other and by the time I had finished signs were everywhere directing me back to the mrt station.
Would recommend a visit, pack water and nibbles, but you can get food there but could get pricy for a family."
,,best garden in singapore,5.0,,excellent place in center of city for jogging or play around with pet or children in the morning. The air is so good.
,,A must-see when visiting Singapore,5.0,,This amazing garden is a slice of solitude in the middle of the busy city. The map for walking around is very helpful and it's easy to spend 4 hours viewing all the beautiful flowers and plants.
,,Beautiful gardens - a little too many paths,4.0,,"It is difficult to get lost in these gardens but even so there are some spectacular views. The view looking across swan lake from a bridge at the end of path will stay with me (the side where you cannot see the huge statue!)
A good place to while away the hours."
,,one of the most beautiful botatical gardens to see,5.0,,"This beautiful garden was a stop on our hop on/hop off bus tour. We spent at least 2 hours walking thru the most gorgeous orchid garden and floral gardens. The lovely grassy open areas would have been perfect for a picnic for a family or special time. The variations of walkways, flowers and foliage were such a surprise. If you have the time, it's definately worth a walk."
,,The Orchid Garden is beautiful. So many types of orchids to see.,5.0,,There are a lot of other tropical plants to view as well. We also went to see the Ginger Gardens. Don't forget to look for the Red Dragon Flies at the lily pond!
,,Beautiful to walk through but avoid the midday heat!,5.0,,Such a beautiful spot. I used to run through daily with my baby and never tired of it. Try to go there early morning and late afternoon otherwise it does get uncomfortably hot.
,,Great outdoor park for nature lovers,5.0,,"This place is huge and well-kept. It could get very hot during the day. Better bring water with you. Plenty of them. There are some reststop cafes inside, but better be prepared right. You will need plenty of water while exploring here. It's great to see so much greeneries this well organized and maintenance inside a city. We bumped into some animals along the way too.

I love the lake and the swans area. Very relaxing seating there watching the swans. I also enjoy the symphony concert that happen to hold here during our visit.

The garden at a whole is free and open to public early everyday. However, if you want to visit the Orchid Garden, there is S$5.00 per adult entrance fee, and only S$1.00 for seniors."
,,Lovely peaceful day,5.0,,"The Singapore botanic gardens are a lovely peaceful getaway from city life, very relaxing and calming with lots of beautiful wildlife to take in and enjoy. Ate at the campus restaurant in the gardens which was inexpensive and delicious! Perfect day out when on a budget. (And the MRT drops you right by the gardens)."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is an amazing place in every sense, beautiful, the orchid section is one of the most beautiful things I have seen in my life. Worths the long walk, please don't dare to miss it"
,,Wander through the park,5.0,,"Really pretty .. Never thought that this city could have so much green .. the different types of plants, trees and shrubbery are all labeled for those who are generally interested in the species of foliage .. as for the rest of us its a very peacefull place with plenty to do .. put on your hiking boots and explore ( make sure you wear propper foot wear if your planning to cover every section."
,,A highlight of my trip -- one of the best gardens I've visited,5.0,,"The expansive botanic gardens are some of the best maintained I've ever seen. I loved the variety of plants, including the heritage plants. Wandering around, trying not to get lost -- this garden is not to be missed. You can forget you are in the midst of a city, and just enjoy the plants and flowers! Follow the map if you must! Be sure that you stop in the Orchid Garden (for a fee). (I had planned to spend only a couple of hours, and four hours later I was still wandering in the midst of the garden!)

TIPS: Dress in cool clothing, bring water, and wear comfy shoes. You will do a lot of walking! There are plenty of places to rest, so take advantage!"
,,Most amazing orchids,5.0,,"Make sure to visit the Orchid Garden which lies inside the Botanic Gardens. It is a real pearl and offers the most beautiful collection of Orchids that I have ever seen. As an Orchid is the national flower of Singapore, the Orchid Garden is not to be missed when having some spare time in Singapore."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"A special place in tropical Singapore.
Peaceful way to spend an afternoon.
Some interesting wildlife as well - we saw a large lizard wandering.
Best to start at one gate and work your way toward the opposite end of the gardens.
Probably best to take a taxi there and back.
Well maintained."
,,Busy on a Sunday with dog walkers!,5.0,,"We went to the Botanic Gardens on a sunday mornng when it is obviously a popular spot for the locals to walk their dogs, which is fine as we are dog lovers but something to bear in mind if you are not. The gardens were lovely, very big, we only saw a small part as we did not have the time. Would be a great place to go jogging rather than on the busy streets. As always, there are cafes, gift shops and drink stands."
,,"Beautiful, if you are a plant lover.",3.0,,Was taken here as part of a tour. Really pretty but the weather was way too hot and humid to be outside for such a long time. Other than looking at plants not really much to do but very beautiful place.
,,Worth the excursion form Orchard Road.,4.0,,We took the MRT to the Gardens which was a good way to spend a morning. Lots of open space as well. Well signed to get around and at the bottom is a food hall serving what could almost be classed as Street food. for the price really good value.
,,There is a Swan Lake in Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,The place is very quiet. I went there after giving birth to my daughter and I enjoy the peace there. That is twenty three years ago. Up till today I never forget that place.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Went with 2 teenage kids. Was a bit sceptical but as it turned out we all had a great day. Very hot and humid and a bit of walking to do however the orchids on display were amazing and beautiful. Would highly recommend and would do it again.
,,Oasis of green,5.0,,"Fantastic garden in the city. Easy way to travel is take the MRT to Botanic Gardens station, you then enter at the top of the garden, walk down through the various sections and come out at the bottom where you can either take a bus back to town or walk down to Orchard Road to do some shopping. There are various eating places in the gardens of reasonable standards."
,,Great place for a picnic and a walk - also has cafes,4.0,,"The Botanic gardens are a beautiful place to recover from jet lag. The gardens are free and are easily accessed by bus. There are taxi stands too but I found that the wait was very long. The paths have signs with information about the plants and sometimes history of the site or why the plant is the in garden. There are many pretty fountains, gazebos and sculpture. Be sure to visit the evolution garden with a history of how the earth was formed and the plant life. The gardens have several gift stores and cafe's as well as meeting space and a small museum. There is also a shell for the symphony to perform and many great picnic spots"
,,A nice stroll within the vicinity of mother nature,5.0,,"It is a huge park (an understatement in of itself as it took us 2 hrs to walk from the Bukit Timah Gate near the MRT to the Tanglin Gate closest to Orchard Road). Definitely a lot of exotic plants and trees to check out if you are into forestry/environmental studies, and it's a very pleasant walk with lots of tree shades and an air-conditioned short walkway in the Orchid Garden for those who need a cooler after walking in the drenching heat."
,,Orchid Garden and Halia Restaurant at Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Spend a few hours wandering through the Singapore Botanic Gardens, easily accessible on the metroline from central city. The Halia Restaurant (means ginger) is really a treat. Sit on the patio relax amongst the greenery, staff is very kind. The Gardens are free and many locals visit, very safe, family-friendly."
,,"SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDEN,SINGAPORE",4.0,,"This is an SINGAPORE Icon and is UNESCO World Heritage site in Singapore. The garden was established in 1859; and was designed by an English National. This accounts for the British Garden style for most parts of the gardens. The garden plays an important part contributing much to the late Mr K.Y Lee's vision of Singapore being a Garden City!!! There are gardens (Themed garden, Children Garden, Fragrant garden, Orchid Garden....) within the garden. The Orchid Garden is the most popular garden; with admission fee S$5/person. Access to the garden is good; both the MRT stations land buses stops are near the garden. There are F&B stalls and shops in the gardens."
,,Great garden to have a walk or a picnic,5.0,,The garden conducts free guided tours by volunteers every saturday morning (check their website). Great informational walk and then have a breakfast amongst the greenery!
,,Green paradise in the middle of the city!,5.0,,"Wonderful park for Sunday strolls, jogging, openair concert venue, orchid garden... relaxing! Recommended!"
,,Lovely,4.0,,Visted the Orchid garden only as tour we were booked on only allowed time for this section. The Orchid garden was well maintained and exotic really lovely.Well worth a visit. There is a small gift shop and toilet facilities at this part of the garden.
,,One of Diamonds of SIngapore,5.0,,"This is a must visit for all who visit SIngapore. If you want it is all free, you don't have to pay a penny. My Wife and I visited on a Sunday afternoon when the local people were enjoying their day off. The park if full of nooks and crannies with different walks and hideaways. This is a place to relax and enjoy the place. There is no pressure or hard sell.
We took the MRT to the Botanic Gardens stop on the downtown line and walked through all the way through and got the bus down to the top of Orchard Road. Half way though we stopped at the little cafe and had a couple of smoothies (S$9) which were not expensive. The gardens are paved and are accessible in the most part for the disabled but be aware there are hills, not steep ones but they are there. This park is used by locals and tourists alike as a place to unwind. You haven't been to Singapore if you don't come here. Everybody loves this place and it is quite special. Like the rest of Singapore it is spotless and is treated with respect.
If you so wish you can pay for the Orchid Garden (S$5) which is spectacular which I will cover in a separate review. It is that good."
,,Beautiful and well kept,4.0,,The gardens were stunning and included a lot of variety! There were very informative signs posted throughout the gardens but the highlight was definitely the orchid gardens for me as this was the only spot with bright colourful flowers which I felt the rest of the gardens were lacking! Well maintained lots of staff on duty.
,,"Excellent visit, but it's not only the plants but the Wildlife in here!",5.0,,"Expect the unexpected if you visit this Free attraction, and you might not be disappointed! We were very surprised with what we saw as we walked around and I am not only talking about the plants."
,,Great place for a run!,4.0,,Ran from hotel (shangri-la) near Orchard Rd and loved the experience. 8km round trip with me going through most trails.
,,BLISS !!! The perfect way to get away from the bustling world around you in Singapore.,4.0,,"As soon as i walked into this garden i was transported to different world
So tranquil and relaxing, sprawling greenery the perfect way to get away form the bustling world around you in Singapore.
They had a lovely lake in the middle with ducks and swans, the perfect setting for the perfect pictures
You really should swing by this place if your in Singapore"
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"We loved the Botanic Gardens! So big & so much to see! Orchid Gardens well worth a visit too... look out for all those dedicated to famous people! The restaurant is great too... good choice of meals & snacks, quick service, great prices! Don't forget your bug spray & water though!"
,,If your stay is short dont worry about a visit,3.0,,"The gardens are really nothing special, very manicured. I prefer it when the plants are able to grow naturally. I agree with another reviewer I don't understand why it is a UNESCO site. It is free but you have to pay for the Orchid Garden which is worth a visit. I came from the Botanical Gardens MRT so had to walk to the other side to get a map and find out about the Orchid Gardens. If I lived in Singapore it is definitely somewhere I would go to chill out, have a picnic, take the kids and commune with nature. The gardens are better than the Marina Bay Gardens and Supertree Grove."
,,Orchids beyond imagination!,5.0,,"Try to spend a good portion of your day here. So much variety, beauty and well manicured. Perfect place to include on your tour."
,,Orchids,5.0,,"This is a free garden except for the tiny fee of $4 to see the orchid garden and it is wonderful , worth every bit and more. Such a beautiful calm spot , it rained while we were there but so hot it was a nice relief , but there was plenty of cover spots. Easy to get there by public transport , bus driver was great . Taxi home as we were tired and that was good taxi outside the gardens . Singapore should be soo proud of their beautiful garden well worth the visit."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Very nice place to take photo. This time of the year it was very hot. So better to go on around 3pm or morning. Took lots of photos. There was restaurant and shop in the middle of the garden which is very useful to have cool drink. To discover all the garden it need all day. Lots of flowers.

Remember to get good sun cream and big hat. If bring Umbrella is better. Otherwise hot sun Will destroy your nature appetite."
,,Great visit,5.0,,"We walked around the park for hours and saw lots of beautiful animals, plants and most importantly - orchids. They're my favorite flower, and if you're ever in the botanic gardens I recommend going into the Orchid Garden, it was such a beautiful place and I was able to buy two baby orchids to bring home with me. The whole park is definitely worth a visit."
,,Do not skip this one,5.0,,"As a free public resource and a unesco world heritage site these extensive gardens make for a great running route or a days exploration. Head to the Open Farm Community for the best brunch setting (& don't skip desert either - lemon tart and basil ice cream) then head in an explore the rainforest, lakes, bonsai collections, orchids ($5) and a phenomenal range of beautiful trees and flowers."
,,Everybody can find his own peace there,5.0,,"quiet,yet lots of events. many visitors ,but not crowded. nice place to visit in morning and after 4 pm. Jacob children's garden is a wonderful place for kids, and very friendly parking lots."
,,Excellent to visit anytime of the day,4.0,,"Singapore Botanic Garden is located strategically central where easily access by Mrt, buses and cars. Morning is mainly patronized by local for exercises, midday is tourists or pinics for families, late evening is again exercises or dinner gathering at few good places inside the garden. The garden is well covered by Hugh tall trees along the path, thus hardly get to have strong sunlight unless one walk at open areas. Unfortunately, the orchids garden needs to pay before visit. Otherwise, everything is perfect. It is worth for a visit."
,,Just lovely :),5.0,,"Reminds me a lot of European parks. Spent about 3-4 hours walking around and visiting pretty much all of it. The National Orchid Garden is a must see and the only section that has an entry fee. Apart from that, i really liked the lakes, especially the swan lake. Would recommend going there in the morning or after 3pm to avoid the midday heat."
,,Beautiful setting,5.0,,"Very well maintained and beautiful gardens! Several shady places to walk or sit, which was helpful on the extremely hot day we visited. The orchid garden (fee) is definitely the highlight, but we also enjoyed the other plants and flowers the gardens had to offer."
,,Okay gardens,3.0,,"The gardens are really nothing special. Don't really understand why it is a UNESCO site. It is free, which is nice but you have to pay for the Orchid Garden which is the best part. The Orchid Harden is nice and worth the visit."
,,Singapores best park,4.0,,"One of the best attractions in Singapore that are free, and its very easy to go now when downtown line station Botanik Garden is open, Botanik Garden is the perfect place for outing, exercise and to spot rare animals such as the black swan."
,,"Great place to spend a day, just precious",5.0,,So many different parts to the garden and plenty of places to eat (although some places can be crowded at peak times)
,,The nicest gardens I've seen!,5.0,,I have visited many botanical gardens all over the world and Singapore botanical gardens are second to none. Well laid out with many vey healthy species and everything is clearly marked. The orchid house is a must-see. I've never seen so many orchids! Definitely arrange at least 2 hours of your time to see a nice sample of these gardens.
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,We walked through these gardens to get to the National Orchid centre. This is a wonderful peaceful area where you can get away from the hussle and bussle of Singapore. Loads of shrubs and trees and a lovely lake.
,,Love it so much!!!,5.0,,"This botanical garden is one of the Singapore heritage that being recognized by UNESCO.

There's some restaurants inside here. And the food quiet good with good price too.

A lot of people bring their family, children here. You can have some exercise here too.

I love the part of Orchid garden, herb garden, which is more quiet. Whether you come here alone or with your friends or family, it's still fun to go around here.

You can see lots of plants from around the world with good and neat site arrangement. There are also plant grouping based on its savour like digestive, reproductive, medicine etc. It is suggested to visit there in the morning to avoid hot weather during the day."
,,Escape from the city,4.0,,The Botanic gardens are a ideal escape from the hustle and bustle of the city of Singapore. There are several different displays and water ways dotted around the gardens and to visit them all would take up some time. We just entered from the MRT station entrance and walked through coming out at the orchard road entrance taking in whatever we stumbled across. You can see several species of animals including birds lizards and even a turtle / tortoise. It can get warm under the sun but there at least 2 cafe's / shops where you can get a drink and shade from the heat. Well worth a afternoon or morning visit.
,,Gorgeous!!,5.0,,"This place is huge and absolutely beautiful! So many gorgeous plants, flowers, trees and lakes. After three days of walking all over Singapore, the Botanical Gardens had a reflexology path, that made our feet feel so much better. The whole place is just awesome!"
,,"Big, fresh, and peaceful garden to escape the city",4.0,,"I love this park because it is located in the heart of the city yet it is so peaceful and you could enjoy the fresh air. The best way to come here is by MRT Botanical Garden station. Then you can walk or jog to the other side which has a bus station in front of the Gleneagles Hospital. There are many pathway options that you can choose. The best timing to go here is on around 3pm-5pm.

,,A trip highlight,5.0,,"The botanical gardens would have to have been one of the highlights of my trip to Singapore. I only wish we had had more time to explore and take it all in. My Great Great Grandfather was one of the English Botanists who established these gardens so I loved seeing the results of his work and study all those years ago. I loved the contrast between these gardens and the new Gardens by the Bay ... As new and modern as those gardens were, this garden was soft and gentle. Beautiful sculptures throughout and amazing plant displays, I can't wait to visit again one day with more time to wander through."
,,Didn't get to see the beauty of it,2.0,,It might have something to do with the timing of when I went. It wasn't the most beautiful botanical garden that I have visited. It was very nature like but just not what I expected it to be.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens are a must see when travelling in Singapore. Its amazing how you can be in such a busy place as Singapore but yet in beautiful gardens. Singapore itself must be the cleanest city in the world but the gardens are something else!!
,,Nature in the centre of the city,5.0,,"Some very rare plants and trees on display, besides hundreds of common plants. Many of them are explained with boards and illustrations for the benefit of the visitors. However, this needs to be done for many more plants.
The Orchids collections and cross breeding of them as displayed in the VIP Enclosure are the real gems. Fascinating and very interesting display.
One must be prepared to walk at least 4 to 5 KM. Since Singapore is a humid place, carry a lot of water / fruit juices with you. A nice place for family picnics."

A lovely place to wander round and enjoy the flowers and plants on display not to mention the wildlife we encountered. A tropical paradise! It amazed us that there was no entrance fee to these gardens with the exception of a 5 dollar charge to enter the Orchid Garden which was spectacular and more than worth it. There is also a very nice gift shop to browse selling quality goods, as well as restaurants etc dotted around for when you wanted something to eat or drink. We also liked the fact that there were shaded areas which were a welcome relief from the heat! I would recommend anyone visiting Singapore to make time to come here!"
,,A must to do in Singapore,5.0,,Had a really great dat day. We hoped of the open deck tourist double decker bus and spent about 2 hours their just walking thru the gardens it was well worth the time spent their.
,,Deserving of its Unesco World Heritage badge,5.0,,"The last time I visited here was at least 15y ago. I remembered trying to catch tadpoles from one of the ponds and admiring the sun dial. Beyond that... didnt find anything remarkable. This visit was a pleasant surprise. The well laid out gardens, landscaping and different features are world class. There were restaurants dotted about, shaded pathways, interesting sculptures, scents of all kinds and of course the symphony stage.

I now visit here regularly to come for a jog, covers around 5km for 1 loop. I also saw some sort of giant lizard coming out of the bush to enter the swan lake and huge catfishes in there. Good place for families."

,,Dazzling Orchids,5.0,,Stroll through the gardens and prepare to be amazed by the glorious displays of orchids and plants. Definitely worth a visit to enjoy the wonders of nature.
,,Beauty and serenity defined,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens was not somewhere I had expected to be 'Wowed' by so easily. But it is so immaculately maintained, is a home to many interesting and varied plants, trees, and animals (we saw squirrels, turtles, fish, lizards and even a couple of impressively large, yet sufficiently distant spiders)... and is free to enter! Expecting to spend perhaps an hour here, we stayed for three. And could have stayed longer, as we barely saw half of it. A lovely haven of calm and tranquility, in a city of many extremes."
,,Beautiful place. Good for a picnic. Free music events. Highly recommended,4.0,,"Amazing gardens, massive lung in the big city easy access via SMRT..
You can spend easily the whole day walking around the gardens. Beautiful green landscape and nature sounds surrounding you. Good place for a picnic with friends or for a family day, and popular among locals.

,,Could easily spend a day here,4.0,,"We arrived at 8:30am and spent 4.5 hours here. We would have stayed longer if all the eateries weren't rammed. The garden was beautiful and aside from the orchid garden, it was free of charge. You can watch locals practising tai chi, doing yoga and see normal life. You can walk through gardens set up to be like they would be when dinosaurs are around, go through scented gardens, walk through a rainforest, see the ginger garden. It's also open till late into the evening."

Don't miss the VIP orchid section with varieties that are created in this garden. It's wonderful strolling around, exploring the orchids with birds chirping in the middle of a city. I also walked through the rain forest section with tall tropical trees and unusual bird sounds. Not sure I can add much to what has been written previously other than to echo that it's beautiful and well worth leaving Orchard Street stores to reconnect with nature."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,Plan to spend at least a couple hours here and take in the lush gardens and magnificent orchids. It's best to go early to get some relief from the heat. You can plan to have lunch at one of their lovely restaurants . We just had a cold beverage but the food looked quite good.

,,Very lovely,4.0,,"The gardens are very beautiful, and also very large, so you need to allow at least 4 to 5 hours to visit, but even this won't be enough time if you want to see the whole gardens, particularly the Orchid Garden. There is an MRT station directly outside."

,,Amazing Gardens by the bay!,4.0,,The Botanical Gardens of Singapore are just lovely. It is quite big area with many places to visit inside like the Orchid Garden or the Ginger garden among others.

,,World heritage site indeed,5.0,,Peaceful and tranquil - acres of lush green gardens in the centre of Singapore. There is also a kids gardens that is kids friendly.
,,Biggest orchid flower garden,5.0,,I have seen multiple botanic gardens but by far this is my favourite. Although one has to pay extra 5SD to visit orchid garden but it was totally worth it.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Really you should not miss this oasis in the middle of town. Easy to get to from any Orchard location. They do an outstanding job of keeping this place manicured. If you have 15 mins - take a walk.

One of the most bueatuful orchids cultivated here is the National Flower of Singapore.
This very Location can e easily reached by subway Trains or one of the hop on/off tour busses, or by taxi cabs.
Singapore Botanic Gardens shall no be missed out when visiting this phantastic busy town."
,,Better to go early,4.0,,"Better to go early - didn't see all of the Gardens and the Orchids we wanted to see, was a very hot and Humid Day. we went really early, saw the water fall, the lake with Turtles , and a Huge water monitor ( lizard) . This is a Free place to Visit , some parts you have to Pay. The Gardens Flowers are very Beautiful , pity we couldn't stay longer it was to hot. Loved the Ginger Garden"
,,Peaceful Gardens,4.0,,"For those with a passing interest in all things horticultural, a visit to the botanic gardens will be a pleasant couple of hours. If plants and flowers floats your boat, it will be an excellent activity. Lots to see, plenty of walking - take water!"
,,A short walk in the garden with Taiwan friends ...,4.0,,"Previously when I bring my overseas friends to this garden, I don't anything special about it until today when I walked into the VIP Orchid Garden and got the chance to admire all the beautiful, gorgeous and award winning orchids. They are definitely worth your visit to spend some time with them. And to put icing on the cake, when we about to exit, we were given a musical treat by the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. Seeing the audiences lying on the slope of the open grass patch make me feel that there is some social life outside the stressful city life."
,,Green peace in a hectic city,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a haven of calm in this hectic city. Don't confuse them with the Gardens by the Bay, which is a modern confection for undiscerning visitors.
If all you want is a gentle walk through interesting trees and shrubs, this is for you. If you are a serious student of tropical botany, you will find nowhere better to study the results of nearly 200 years of endeavour. Take your camera, and take your time - allow at least half a day. The best place to start is at the main entrance, although taxi drivers will want to drop you off at one of the other gates, as it will be then easier for them to pick up another fare.
Start by looking at the specialist sections to the east of the entrance, and wander round the large lake.
If you have not seen it before, pay the small extra to see the orchid garden.
We then recommend you to meander slowly down to the Tanglin Road gate, not forgetting the interesting modern sculptures.
Don't forget to take a bottle of water."
,,Orchid delight,4.0,,"As part of a city tour we visited the Orchid Gardens here - time didn't permit us to do the whole place. Next time! Even if you are not into botanical gardens, this is a must! The array of orchid species on display was staggering. P.S. Don't let your wife loose in the gift shop without supervision ☺. A definite ""must do"" in Singapore. Highly recommended."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,If you are into nature and plants this is a great place to visit. We took a taxi from Orchard Road and it cost $6sd. The gardens are free to walk around but the orchid garden costs$5sd. The gardens are vast. Take plenty of water. Well worth a visit.
,,A lovely visit,4.0,,"Wish we could have stayed longer to see more of this beautiful place. On a very hot and humid day, we were not really comfortable walking around.

definitely the place you cannot miss when visiting Singapore !!!"
,,Amazing Orchid Displays,5.0,,"Spent a pleasant few hours touring the Botanical Gardens. An amazing display of orchids and other plants. And if you look very carefully, you can see birds and other creatures in the bushes and trees. Very interesting tour, even for non-plant enthusiasts."
,,Great fossilised garden,3.0,,"A very good botanic garden but not up to the expectations I had been allowed from other reviews. Very clean, Unfortunately quite dry when I visited but easily occupies several hours. Right beside the underground MRT so very easy to get to. Well worth the visit but struggles to compare with classic botanic gardens around the globe."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,Beautiful Botanical Gardens - make sure you visit. And best of all its free to get in (Just have to pay a small entry fee into the Orchid Gardens - but that is the highlight of the park) Recommend getting there early in the morning to escape the heat and humidity and crowds.

,,May Be Best in the World,5.0,,"One of the loveliest travel days my wife and I have ever enjoyed. From the spectacular open air Orchid gardens (including the high jungle enclosure), to the huge variety of plantings throughout, with the long, leisurely walks to take in every imaginable type of regional trees, these gardens offer a myriad of plant environments almost all of which are open air and natural in arrangement and presentation. Just a sublime day, with a wonderful cafe lunch thrown in. Gorgeous."
,,My favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of the best botanic gardens I have been to anywhere in the world. I make a point to stop by every time I come to Singapore (2-3x a year). It's big enough to spend an entire day walking around a mixture of manicured and natural settings. Keep an eye out for water monitors in the water, or even sunbathing on the trails."
,,Its all right,3.0,,Nothing fascinating about the place but its good to walk around in maybe in the morning or evening when its slightly cooler.
,,Garden getaway from the city,4.0,,Clean and a nice place to stroll around to get away from the busy city. You might also catch a glimpse of some local wildlife like monkeys and monitor lizards!

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I live near by to the botanic gardens and when I have time in the mornings to go for a peaceful walk it makes my day, especially in the cool early morning or evening. Lots of space to walk around with hidden ponds and for children, lots of fish and tortoises to see. Great to do exercise in as an open green space in Singapore."

Could spend a whole day there and still come back for more."
,,Beautiful and huge garden! Love the pond and the greens!,5.0,,A very structured garden in the middle of the city allows people to enjoy the nature or picnic on the lawn. Relaxing and quiet. Best time to go during late afternoon / early evening to avoid the heat.
,,Picnic in tranquility,5.0,,"Beautiful place. One of the few free attractions in Singapore and as it's serviced directly by the HRT, it's well worth visiting.

Easy to walk around with only a few gentle slopes, the gardens demand you spend a couple of hours to appreciate them. There's plenty of space to find benches or secluded areas to yourself to just take your time to absorb the gardens majesty. Peaceful, tranquil and full of architectural interest with ponds, statues, bandstands, waterfalls and features and artwork thoughtfully placed.

Whether visiting to purposefully explore, armed with a picnic or just to breathe and escape the heat, the gardens a well worth visiting - A must see attraction."
,,It's FREE,5.0,,"The park is one of my favorite parks in Singapore. Not too crowded, very convenient for walks or jogging. No need to pay, FREE.

,,Truly magnificient gardens,5.0,,"Like the National Orchid Gardens, an entry-free attraction well worth visiting. You are able to wander around at your leisure and take in all there is to see, including a small monitor type lizard we saw basking itself in the sun."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Having first been to Gardens by the Bay my hopes for Singapore Botanic Gardens were high, and I wasn't disappointed. I only visited part of the gardens, saving the rest for a future date, on this occasion visiting the Orchid Garden and had intention of also visiting the Swan Lake, however access wasn't possible to the lake on this day.

The Orchid Garden was stunning, many different varieties planted throughout. Many stayed throughout the garden add interest, and gazebos and seats scattered around time to sit and reflect on its beauty, and perhaps momentary relief from the day's heat.

I look forward to one day returning and seeing more of the gardens."
,,Beautiful FREE gardens,5.0,,"What a wonderful experience! Many different types of plants and vegetation in a beautiful (natural) setting. I would recommend arriving early morning. With the plants and surroundings, it gets very very warm and very humid quickly in the day."

Lots of people doing lots of things, from Thai chi to quiet walks or just enjoying a seat by the lake. A beautiful place"
,,Peaceful escape from the city hustle & bustle,5.0,,"Large gardens to explore covering a wide range of flora and fauna from around the world. Keep an eye out for the kimono dragons that wonder around as well as some huge butterflies.
Some interesting fauna only found in Singapore, including the last remaining tree of its kind.
After the hustle and bustle of the main town, this was a calming break for a morning."

,,Awesome !,4.0,,"We were there by our family. I'm sure everybody enjoyed it very much ! It was so hot, but not important ! I suggest everyone to visit and enjoy it ! It is really a part of paradise !"
,,Great for a brief getaway,4.0,,"Went several times on several different occasions. In my personal opinion, if you're a tourist coming to visit Singapore for the first time, Botanic Garden might not interest you much since there are many other more popular tourist attractions out there to visit.
But if you're a frequent visitor looking for a nearby place for a leisurely walk or picnic in the evenings surrounded by greeneries, then this is definitely the place for you.

The white gazebo there was a great place to take pictures as well. Many couples do their pre-wedding shoots here."
,,Really beautiful,5.0,,Visited via the MTR and really easy to negotiate round. Gardens are truly spectacular especially the Orchid Gardens. The park is free with a nominal charge to see the orchids. A lovely way to spend half a day.

,,"Beautiful, peaceful place.",5.0,,"Great place to spend a few hours strolling thru the beauty. We saw some people watching a Hornbill nest waiting for the bird to come feed its young. We waited awhile but, had to get going as we had a lot on our schedule. But, look out for hornbills if you are there. Free admission except for orchids. Buses take you right to the gardens."
,,Chilling,5.0,,"I loved everything in Singapore, this is top touristy list, but worth it. For flower lowers a heaven."
,,Nothing exceptional,3.0,,Go here if you have not much else better to do. Or if you're an outright botany loving person. It's pretty and well made but there's nothing particularly unique about it.
,,Green Harbour,3.0,,"Very cool gren place by a hot summer day. The entrance is free and it's big so you dont see the cars , the skyscrapers. Strolling in the shadow of beautiful trees and bushes is good escape from the civilisation. Different parts of the garden propose different landscapes. The best of course is the Orchid Garden."
,,Nice.,5.0,,Beautiful morning or evening walk. Bring food and enjoy picnic there. From 11am to 4pm the weather too hot and humid.
,,SBG for a green eye,4.0,,"The Singapore botanical garden (SBG) is a great place to be in, early in the morning. Enjoy a nice jog in the park and drop into the great Orchir garden to eye Orchids of all colours and hues. They have a cool house in case you feel hot. Go with your entire family and have a fine pinic."
,,Visit the Botanic Gardens along with the National Orchid Gardens,4.0,,"The Botanic Garden adjoins the Orchid Gardens. The Botanic Garden is free and offers an array of very well maintained trails with excellent signage throughout the park.

It was great to see people of all nationalities and all ages walking and jogging through the beautiful setting."
,,Wonderful wandering greenery,5.0,,"This is a wonderland that, like any garden, is not strictly natural but surely a lovely way to see Nature. In a bustling city [and Singapore is that], it is a charmingly serene escape to see many types of plants not often seen elsewhere. Free."
,,Fabulous botanical garden,5.0,,"In Singapore, which doesn't provide much by way of entertainment, visiting these gardens is a must. And within the gardens, the orchid garden is spectacular--one of the largest in the world. There are orchids that were dedicated to (and named for) famous visitors such as presidents and prime ministers. The gardens are extensive and walkable, and there are special events from time to time (such as music on a large grassy plain). There are several restaurants and gift shops."
,,worth a visit,5.0,,"We have visited the Botanic Gardens numerous times over the past ten years and we are always discovering something new in the gardens that we haven't seen before. Our favorite gardens are the orchid garden, ginger garden, fruit tree collection, healing garden, bonsai garden and frangipani garden. It is $5 Singapore to enter the orchid garden hut only $1 for over 60's. It is well worth the money. The frangipani garden is charming as it has old fashioned swings throughout the garden and fun for any age group to have a swing. Also of interest is the world heritage tree in the Botanic Gardens. It is featured on the Singapore $5 Dollar note."

Make sure you use your sun cream!"
,,Stunning and it's free!,5.0,,The botanic gardens are huge! There is so much to see and do here and you could wander for hours or just pop in and do one exhibit as you wish.

National Orchid Garden offers largest display of orchids in the world. Mind boggling collection, one better than the other. The colours and shapes transport you to some other world. Jacob Ballas Children's Garden is the favourite of children. Themed garden, Healing Garden, Fragent Garden and Foliage gardens are the other gardens here will make your senses go wild.

A must visit place."
,,Escape the city,5.0,,"If you a flower or garden person this is not to be missed. It is also a great place to escape to when you tire of Singapore city hustle and bustle. There is lots of shade to escape the heat. If you are using the hop on hop off tour bus, choose the route that includes the garden and save a cab fare or a long walk. You can easily spend half a day. It is one of the few places where you can see a remnant of the original jungle habitat of the island. The Orchid garden (fee needed) here is also well worth the visit. Some will same you don't need to see the Botanic Garden if you are also seeing the Gardens by the Bay but they are quite different, with very different atmosphere and emphasis, GBthe B being much more artificial and contrived appearing (and expensive)."
,,An oasis of tranquility in the city,5.0,,"Could not believe we were in the middle of such a modern busy city. So peaceful, so beautiful, so relaxing. Pay for the Orchid Garden, it's not expensive and full of colour. They change the plants often to keep it looking great."

The orchard garden was the highlight. Use the MRT to get there, by far the cheapest way."
,,Excellent Excursion,5.0,,"Just make sure you include this on your visit to Singapore. It's free, the gardens are huge & well-maintained. Just take water and pace yourself."
,,The best Orchards you'll ever see.,5.0,,"If Flora interests you, then this is a must see. In March, an early visit, one misses the crowds and the heat. The Hop on Hop off bus is the best way to see this attraction."
,,Tranquil charm,5.0,,"We walked around this site in a tropical storm, remember to take the all important umbrella, it was beautiful despite the rain, I think for people with mobility problems a small train or carriage ( like the one in the botanical gardens in New York) would help all ages see the areas more easily. I loved it"

If you have young children you should also visit Jacob Ballas children gardens!"
,,Beautiful sprawling gardens,5.0,,"The Gardens are a great place to a quiet walk, or a picnis, or to throw a Frisbee on the lawns. There are different types of garden within the wander through, I particularly like the evolution garden. It's also worth checking out Symphony in Gardens that run on select weekend evenings, these are free and wonderful"
,,Good for nature lover.,4.0,,This place is recently awarded to be the singapore heritage garden with some oldest plant that more than hundred years old.It a place not to be miss for nature lover.
,,Gorgeous gardens,5.0,,"It was a long day in the heat and humidity but well worth it. The orchard house is worth the $5.00 entrance fee. There is a train around the garden but you miss quite a bit. You can also get the underground train there.
It was lovely watching a local couple have there wedding photos taken there."

Entrance is free except for the exceptional Orchid a garden where a nominal charge is made.

The cafeteria is very busy but reasonably priced.
To make the most of these gardens you need to allocate a full day to visit to truly see the full range of stunning fauna."
,,Wonderful Gardens,5.0,,"A beautiful place and well worth a visit. A short walk, just 5 mins from the MRT. You don't need to be into gardening and know all the names of the flowers and plants to enjoy a peaceful stroll around these beautifully manicured and breathtaking gardens (little signs tell you the names of exactly what your admiring). I have some wonderful photos and memories of the Botanic Gardens and it doesn't cost a penny entrance fee. Highly recommended."
,,A must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,Truly a wonderful time to walk through lovely gardens. If you visit every 2-3 months then the colours all change with the growing patterns. You could spend the whole day but would need some stamina to hold out against the humidity
,,Amazing walks,5.0,,"I recommend going early in the morning before it gets too hot, but the Botanic Gardens has some great walks. My daughter loves the treehouse at the children's garden. Also, check out their website. They have some pretty good free events every couple of weeks."
,,Singapore 3 places to visit in 1 day,5.0,,"Botanical Gardens-Raffles-Marina Bay
Before shopping or buying a MRT/ticket you will need local currency the Singapore $. In 2016 around $2 per £1. When changing stirling often the highest exchange rate is in the country you are visiting.
Only take $10 bills as the highest denomination, as it is easy to pay in $10 multiples, rather than pass over a $50 bill and then have to count quickly, whether you have the correct change. In a hurry it can be an unnecessary stress.
With One whole day to spend in Singapore, there are three Must Do’s.
1. Have an early start and go to theBotanical Gardens - Pick up the MRT Circle Line to Botanical Gardens. This Garden is a UNESCO World Heritage Park. Not to be missed. The paths are well sign posted, leading to 3 lakes with fish and terrapins. The park has many specimen Heritage trees. If you like Orchids, you will have a treat. If you are not sure about Orchids you will be blown over by the varieties. This garden has 1000 species and 2000 hybrids. Also visit 6 different themed gardens, Healing-Fragrance-Foliage-Evolution-Ginger-and Childrens gardens.
There is no charge to enter the Botanical Garden. Open from 8am to 6pm.
The Orchid Garden is free to children-50p ($1) for pensioners and £2.50 ($5) for visitors below 60 years old. Money well spent!

2. Raffles Bar – After lunch and your visit to the Botanical Gardens, experience a Gin Sling at the Raffles hotel.

3. Marina Bay Gardens – Having relaxed in the bar, take the MRT to Marina Bay Gardens. There is plenty to see and two enormous glass domes filled with tropical trees and plants. In the evening the gardens are floodlit.
To add to your experience and very close; view the Marina Sands Hotel that is like a yacht suspended in the sky. From exiting the gardens, the hotel can be visited via an escalator. Once in the hotel you can make your way down to the basement that has an air conditioned shopping mall, with many places to eat.
It also has a Gondola to sale on.
A refreshing way to end the long day.
Enjoy your visit"
,,a place of green and harmony,5.0,,"enjoyed our visit to the gardens, lots of space, lovely walks, the rain forest is excellent, good food places and lots to see and visit within the gardens"
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"If you like nature and enjoy walking or just want relax under a tree. Then the Botanical Gardens is worth a visit. The gardens has various display sections, like the spice gardens or rainforest walk. Their is also a gift shop and a place to eat."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The place is really nice, very relaxing and the orchids are just amazing. If you like flowers you are going to love this place."
,,One Of The Wonders of The World...or Should Be,5.0,,"Can't say enough about this supremely beautiful and enchanting Botanical Garden. You could spend a week here and not see everything. So wonderful and wondrous. And, it is FREE. Would gladly pay top dollar to visit if it were required. Must See,,,"
,,Great Place to Stay in Touch with Nature,5.0,,"We went with few other family friends and their kids. The place is really nice, specially my kids the pond area where goose and turtles were roaming."
,,an amazing garden,5.0,,"One of the best gardens we have seen; plants and gardenscapes from all over the world, including tropical jungles. There were many people working on the gardens, keeping everything trimmed and clean; perhaps that explains the numbers of people practicing yoga, doing exercises, strolling about, shepherding enthusiastic children, etc. Certainly a highlight of our week in Singapore."
,,Large Gardens,3.0,,"The highlight of the Botanical Gardens is the Orchard Gardens. It is a wonderful garden with many different small areas with varieties of orchids. It is worth going to the Botanical Gardens just of the Orchard Gardens. Other than that, the rest of the Botanical Gardens is lots and lots of trees and grass with a few small specialized sections. Not much for tourists to see . Don't do what we did. We took the MRT to the station near the east entrance to the gardens. We thought it was great that the entrance was just feet from the MRT station, but we then had to walk and very long way across the gardens to reach the Orchard Garden. I recommend saving time (and a lot of walking) by entering through the southern entrance. The Orchard Garden is a reasonable walk from there."
,,Fantastic gardens with plenty to see,4.0,,"A relaxing place to visit and escape the frantic pace of Singapore city. The gardens, lakes and scenery in general as well as the Plantain squirrels make it well worthwhile. We caught the hop on hop off bus to and from the gardens which was a good way to see some the city along the way."
,,A walk in the park,5.0,,"A definite must when visiting Singapore. Swan Lake is lovely. Do visit the Orchid garden, beautiful. Lots to see & do. It's free, small fee for Orchid garden."

There's a bandstand in the middle that houses concerts

,,OUTSTANDINGLY BEAUTIFUL,5.0,,If you like gardens and flowers this is a must do in Singapore. There is such a wonderful feeling of serenity and the orchids will never be seen anywhere in the world like here. The other recommendation is the wonderful restaurant called the Corner in this garden - enjoy both smells and have fun
,,Always pleasant to visit,4.0,,"My wife and I visited the Botanic Gardens again, to take a stroll and enjoy a quiet moment away from the bustle of Singapore. This was our third visit to the gardens and, as with the other visits, we came away happy we went.

There is good diversity in walking paths and gardens, meaning one can really have a different experience on each visit. Whilst we didn't visit the Orchid garden this time, I hope to return soon as it was one of the more memorable spots.

We also had lunch at Halia, the fantastic restaurant near the Orchid gardens. Highly recommended if you are looking for a nicer lunch whilst visiting the gardens.

It had been over a year since we were there last, but everything is as we remmeber"
,,Beautiful orchid gardens and well worth a visit,5.0,,Spent a morning here. Very peaceful and tranquil place tending over a large area just north of Orchard road. The orchid gardens are a must see - bring a good camera.
,,well laid out walkways beautiful!,5.0,,"go early in the morning and enjoy the coolness before gets too hot. Enjoy a lovely breakfast - choose local or western - washrooms clean, delightful way to start the day."
,,Relaxing!,5.0,,"Relax and take a walk or have seat on a bench or on the meadow in the big, green botanical garden. Full of plants, flowers, ponds and animals it is a must to go to see."

,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"The Gardens are wonderful with plenty of different areas to explore. Whilst the Botanic Garden us free, the National Orchid Garden has a modest fee - but so worth it. The orchid displays were beautifully laid out and the many varieties on display is mind boggling. This us a must see."
,,Nice walk but not a priority,3.0,,"It was a nice walk in the park, literally. Lots of interesting sculptures and plants, took us about 2 hours including the Orchid Garden. But the Botanic Garden shouldn't be your priority if you have a packed itinerary, just do the Orchid Garden."
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,You need to go early or late in the day as it is very humid and walking round becomes a chore. There is a cool garden with alpine plants and I think everyone in the gardens tried to get in there to cool off.
,,Stunning Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"A free attraction which is a great place to spend a day. Even if gardens are not your thing, you should visit if only to walk through the rain forest section. This is the closest thing to getting to a real jungle without the dangers of getting lost. You still need plenty of insect repellent though."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"This is a great way to spend the day with the family. The walks are great and the scenery is beautiful. The food at the entrance is good and the staff friendly. There is a kids garden which is great fun with a tree house and loads of other activities.

Great day out and it's free"
,,Truly spectacular,5.0,,"I came in the morning sharing the park with joggers(!), families and a few school classes. I looked like rain but I lucked out. The gardens came highly rated so my expectations were high. And I was not disappointed.

I made it through various parts of the park, such as the evolution section (interesting to walk through time), remedies (nicely done and really interesting) until I came to the main attraction. When you visit make sure you have plenty time for the orchids.

There are so many different exhibits of truly amazing orchids. Words cannot express the experience. And they have a little story around them like the VIP orchids.

This was my first stop in Singapore and I am glad it was. Spectacular. (Bring plenty of water)"
,,Wonderful gardens,5.0,,"The gardens are free and immaculately kept, not a weed to be seen! Well signposted. Definitely worth a visit"
,,Free entry,4.0,,Wonderful garden. Good for evening stroll. Entry is free of charge. You can easily spend 2 hours walking inside this big garden.
,,The orchid garden is fantastic,5.0,,This is well worth a visit. The hop on hop off bus stops right outside. The gardens are absolutely beautiful with every type of orchid ever heard of. Many are named after famous people. The paths are extremely well maintained and where there are steps I understand there is always a way around for wheelchairs. Highly recommended.
,,Beautiful Huge Garden,5.0,,"Was very convenient to get to the Botanic Gardens as the new MRT station is open now. Beautiful, huge garden. Easily spent about 3 hours plus there and got lost! Definitely this is UNESCO world heritage worthy. It is certainly the biggest botanic garden I have been to within the world. The Orchid Garden was beautiful, definitely you have to go there. Ticket to the special Orchid Garden is $5SGD for adults. Currently, all students get free entry. Lots of people having picnics as well at the Botanic Gardens. You can encounter chickens, roosters, swans, turtles, lizards, and large squirrels. Butterflies all over the place as well!"
,,more extensive additions,4.0,,"coming out from the underground brings you to the newer tracts. With more natural-looking bamboo thicket and leafy additions. This allows more relaxing time. Hope the authorities will continue in this vein, as one tires easily of man-made contraptions."
,,"Don't miss it, the Best Urban Jungle in Asia",5.0,,"Whenever I'm in Singapore we go to Botanical Gardens for a walk, to see the amazing variety of tropical trees and plants. Go on a weekday morning or you'll be dodging crowds, but perhaps weekends offer better exercise, an obstacle course of waddling, loud, trail-blocking tour groups! Recommend getting off the main paths for a more quiet experience. Don't miss the Orchid Garden."
,,Great way to enjoy a little peace and quiet in Singapore,4.0,,It's a beautiful place for a quiet or romantic stroll and it also has alot of activities going on in the weekend
,,Visit the orchids for the best experience,4.0,,We enjoyed the gardens generally but it was the Orchid centre (for which you have to pay - the gardens themselves are free) which made it worthwhile - a fantastic range of plants in flower and the garden set out in a really clever but compact way. And we saw an enormous iguana which was quite a surprise (fortunately on the far side of a pond). Although it was busy it didn't feel crowded. It's wonderful to see plants we normally only ever see in little pots in Marks and Spencer growing in the 'wild'.
,,Calm park,4.0,,"Calm park with a beautiful view in there .. Andd also the nasional orchid flower , the most powerful attract in botanocal garden .. You can relax with education !! 😊"
,,must be seen,5.0,,"i really enjoyed visitng this garden,its really unique and in my point of view its of the attractions that should be in ur list."
,,More a family n friends gathering place,3.0,,"The arrangement and management of the garden is excellent though ! There are more groups enjoying a get together on the Boon Lay side than variety of plants. It is clean, clearly marked and directed properly. On the Visitor's Center side you get Healing and Fragrance Garden with a real collection of plants. There should be clearly two parts- one reserved for family activity that should be of course free. and the other- the genuine Botanical garden -presenting variety of plants. But it is one of the 'must' in Singapore."
,,"Beautiful orchids, everywhere",5.0,,"The gardens have a vast display of beautiful orchids of various species, with some you only see in books. That;s because Singapore has an ideal environment that suits the growing of orchids, ferns and tropical plants. So, Singapore is hot and you should were a hat and use sun screen."
,,Lovely gardens in a city centrre,4.0,,"A haven in a city centre, Singapore botanical gardens are well worth a visit. I would recommend going early morning to see as much as possible before the heat and humidity get to much. The gardens have lots to offer with the rain forest, orchid gardens, lakes and walks."
,,Wonderful variety of tropical foilage,4.0,,"This is a great place to take a stroll in the park with friends or by yourself. It's quite a big garden, and also very popular amongst locals and foreigners alike. There aren't descriptions of all the different types of plants, but there are a lot of areas to admire the different plants being grown. It's a huge garden to stroll in and quite easy to get to from MRT."
,,not as beautiful as I imaged,3.0,,"I came here in the afternoon, it was not as beautiful as I imaged. But my friend told me that you should go to Botanic Garden at night, when the lights are on."
,,Just so hot!!!,3.0,,"Beautiful gardens- free to visit and just $5 to enter the Orchard garden. Easy commute via MRT. However, I left it too late in the day and it was hard to enjoy due to the heat. Glad I came, but wouldn't come again. Especially when Gardens by the bay is so impressive."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This place is just beautiful. It's difficult to find such a place in a modern country like Singapore. These gardens are spread over a vast area. There are many flowers and trees and beautiful things to watch in the garden. Since itvis pretty big it might take half a day to complete it. But worth it! There is a small lake in here. Its a beautiful place to click pics and we saw many couples who had come here for their pre wedding shoot.
,,A Must in Singapore,5.0,,"These Gardens have deservedly been granted World Heritage Site status. For more than 150 years the SBG has been a haven for those in Singapore who love and respect nature. The huge range of plants will give satisfaction to professional botanists and people who simply enjoy a walk in the country. The landscaping is impressive and forms an excellent background for the more formal items such as the research facilities and the Orchard House. Visitors should look out for notices about events such as concerts; the setting for these is superb. As can be expected in Singapore there are plenty of places for a drink, snack or full meal. The Corner Restaurant is establishing a good reputation in the region for its Japanese cuisine. These excellent gardens a worth at least half a dy of any visitor's time.."
,,A Garden with More than 1000 Species of Orchid Plants,5.0,,"If you like flowers, the National Orchid Garden is highly recommended for a visit. It has a collection of more than 1000 species of lovely orchid plants and also hundreds of orchid hybrids artificially bred by botanists of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Many of the hybrids are named after well known politicians, celebrities and royalties. That makes the visit a very interesting one not just for colorful flowers but also for photo shots with the orchid hybrids of your favorite personalities. BTW, the entrance ticket is affordable at SGD5."
,,Singapore Trip,5.0,,"This is a wonderfull place to walk around, the colours are amazing, take plenty of water as it can get very hot, there are a couple of cafes on site."
,,A Walk In The Park,5.0,,"We love the gardens. It was very crowded on Sunday but you can still get a spot for you to sit on the grass and enjoy the weather. The orchid garden was big, to my surprise. Don't miss the Halia cafe/restaurant. Love their dessert!"

,,Nice walk,5.0,,Such an ejoyable walk. It was really nice and my baby also enjoyed it a lot. She walked longer than she normally does. I love the palm trees collection. The staff at the reception was very helpful and friendly. The best part was the orchid garden. With only 5 $ I coul enjoy a large collection of orchid.
,,Good place for walking and execising.,4.0,,"This ia tropicana feel kind of park, with plenty of plants,flowers u may find in the park.if u love going to park and also a first timer visiting in sin, u may consider going to this place for a walk. Advise: going early in the morning, to have some fresh air receiving for your body : )"
,,Steamy,5.0,,"Take plenty of water, hat and shade umbrella, but these gardens are well worth it - finish up at the fab Orchid display. There are a few little cafes within"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Large spread out garden. I am no botanist or true gardener. Such a nice setting & so nice to see it being used & enjoyed by locals. Not as many flowering plants as I hoped (I obviously missed it early in the season change from humid to monsoon). Being so spread out & hot we probably did not make the most of it. It's free entry (except for orchard section). Great eatery set ups. Very well maintained.
,,Serenity in the middle of cosmopolitan,5.0,,It's an incredible feeling when you are strolling in the garden .. Experience it in early morning is the best moment !
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Great place to spend time with a loved one, family or on your own for some peace. Outdoor concerts are there sometimes to enjoy and it's just a really neat place."
,,Nature Lover,3.0,,If you love nature and the park is where you prefer to unwind. You can head down to the Botanic Garden. Don't forget your picninc basket and a good book. There are many great shady spots to just sit and relax. It's a fairly big 'garden' afterall.
,,You feel like you're in paradise!,5.0,,"A great experience!, everything is o beautiful, calm an serene! A unique variety of plants and trees and of course orchids in all colors you can and can't imagine!!! You can spend hours in there. Definitely worth visiting if in Singapore!"
,,Epitomy of the Garden City,5.0,,"Now gazetted as Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage site, the Botanic Gardens epitomises the vision of both Singapore's founder Sir Stamford Raffles and founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. Not many know that Raffles himself was a keen naturalist, and he developed the first ‘Botanical and Experimental Garden’ at Fort Canning. In 1859, all his efforts culminated in the founding of the Gardens at its present site. The Botanic Gardens is als connected with Lond's Kew Gardens because Kew-trained botanists had a hand in its development in its early days. As the main place from which the harvesting of the rubber tree was researched, it also played a pivotal role in the early economy of Malaysia.

This attraction is a well-maintained assortment of gardens worth taking a stroll through - and which will cost you nothing! There is a large pond with swans in it, and back in those days when I was schooling, monkeys also used to roam the place!

When I was a boy my parents - like many other parents - used to brings us kids here to have picnics or to appreciate the greenery and the flowers. Because it is nice - and free. Among the places which left a tinge of nostalgia for me as a kid was the Sun Clock, the animal-sculptured plants and the Pavillion.

Performances and concerts are held here from time to time, and for food lovers, there is also a food court, resturants, cafes and other eateries. And you can shop at Gardens Shop after eating.

This place is ideal for cycling or running. And running can be done either within the gardens, or outside along the road acting as its perimeter, as the gardens is bordered by Holland Road, Evans Road and Bukit Timah.

There is also a herbarium, a lab and a library which may be of interest to botanists or enthusiasts.

Personally, I like to take walks through the Rain Forest in the Central Core and along the Swan Lake, as I find these walks stress-busting and recuperative.

The good thing about this place is that its accessibility. It is within walking distance from Orchard, and one of its exits is served by Botanic Gardens MRT station."

,,Bougainvillea,5.0,,"There are many varieties of beautiful bougainvillea near the MRT train station of the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
We can see many different colors of the bougainvillea here.
Visitors are busy taking pictures. Some bougainvilleas are as tall as the trees, measured about 10 meters or more. Resting under the shades of the big bougainvillea plants is fun and relaxing.
If you are bougainvillea lovers , you must not miss this portion of the gardens."
,,Magnificent Gardens,5.0,,"Walked around the gardens for about two hours this morning, an absolute highlight. Obviously lots of tropical plants, orchids and bromeliads a stand out, rain forest and other ""zones"" very interesting. Lots of different areas. Very well maintained. One of the most beautiful botanical gardens I have been to."
,,morning jog,5.0,,"One of the best part about singapore is their Botanic gardens.

,,Awakening of senses,5.0,,"This entire city is green and the botanical gardens are the height of greenery. Tranquil, beauty beyond words, families taking strolls down the many enchanted paths, people jogging, having lunch at the cafés, really relaxing. If you disregard all the walking in the humidity."
,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens- An oasis in the heart of the city,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic gardens is situated in the heart of the city's shopping belt and an easy walk from Orchard Road. Each day before the break of dawn, young and old flock to the sprawling gardens to jog, meditate, exercise or simply to enjoy the freshness of the morning mist. Slow moving silhouettes of Tai Chi and Qigong practitioners can be seen in exclusive nooks and corners of the gardens. As walkers pass each other, a simple nod of the head or a smiling whisper of ""good morning"" serves create a great atmosphere and a good start to the day.

The Botanic garden serves as an oasis and a refuge throughout the day. Entry is free and there are pockets of amenities such as food courts, rustic restaurants and kiosks which are subtle and does not overly commercialise the place. It takes perhaps 2-3 hours to explore the various features of the gardens in a leisurely pace. The gardens are very well featured and maintained but manage to retain its natural charm and authenticity.

Bring your sandwich lunch in and find your favourite corner to chill out for an hour or so. Do not forget your camera! Lots of photo opportunities. It is a favourite wedding photo site for the locals. You will find yourself being drawn back to the gardens every day!

,,Heaven on earth.,5.0,,"Singapore Botanical Gardens has rightfully been recognised as a world heritage. It is a delight to visit the gardens and no one trip is ever enough. Every visit leaves you wanting to go there again, soon, very soon. The beautiful orchid gardens, to the foliage garden, to the absolutely amazing evolution garden, to the Symphony Lake to just a walk through by the Heliconia,it never disappoints. And the ambience it adds to the music in the park by the Lake is an experience not to be missed.
Like I said, it always leaves you wanting to visit again, and again and again."
,,A really lovely peacful day out,5.0,,"I just love to roam around the gardens here. It is always full of great people watching.
locals with families and tourists flying solo or also with families. They have so much to offer and it is always changing. There are concerts in the park, movie nights and other special events so be sure to look out for them. The park is quite large, extending from Tanglin all the way over the Bukit Timah Road. you can do half or all. I really wish they would introduce a bike path somehow along the edge of the gardens. Stop along the way and read up on the features in the garden, some have a very rich history and interesting story to share. It is a lovely, peaceful day out."
,,My quiet place,5.0,,"Sg botanic garden I must say is a place I frequent when I feel like I need a quiet and peaceful place to think things. The area of the garden is quite large so I'm pretty sure you'll have your own spot. The place is clean and well maintained, has clean comfort rooms. Interesting flower museums. I advise you to bring your own food and drinks if you go there so you can have a small picnic after you go round the area. Also a good place if you want to go jogging or exercising, enjoy nature with your family, or if you want to go on a date but with a tight Budget or if your alone and you just want to enjoy your own company.. It's a nice place to relax and unwind and just lay on the grass, stare at the sky.... Great place for nature lovers."
,,World Heritage garden,4.0,,"Worth a visit 4 nature lovers. Lots of variety of vegetation 2 see. The orchid garden is beautiful 4 orchid lovers. No plucking of plants. Fined if caught. The monkey pot tree, a cousin of the cannonball tree is something one should see becos the seeds hang out like big balls. Its quite amusing. Bring mosquito repellent. Morning is best as singapore weather is very hot & humid in the afternoon. Bring a small towel & water. Sometimes evening open air performances are conducted there. Check their websites 4 times & dates. Photography is allowed so bring your cameras along. Have a jolly good there but please dont litter our beautiful garden. Enjoy!"
,,Beautiful and Clean place for picnics,4.0,,"Beautiful and Clean place for picnics, a walk in the park or some simple kite flying. With the occasional performances in the evenings it makes the night walks much more romantic and appealing."
,,A UNESCO Heritage site that is as beautiful as the day it was first planted,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBC) has always been one of my favourite places in Singapore because it just holds so many fond memories of my growing up years till today.

I remember when I was little my parents would bring my siblings and I there to feed the fish and swans (not so encouraged these days because the park wardens don't want the animals to get sick). So those times were wonderful times of simple fun.

Then when I was older, I brought my girlfriend there for many of our dates - she loves being near nature, and plants just make her happy. So the place became our favourite for long romantic walks in he evenings.

Well, eventually I married her :) And when the kids came along, SBC became one of our favourite places for family picnics and enjoying the free musical performances at the stage area. It was also a useful place to visit for the kids' botany projects from school. I still remember spending hours with them taking photos of different kinds of plant categories - and there are many, many varieties to study there!!

And now, the kids have all grown up, and I hear they sometimes go there for their dates with their special someone too! My wife and I still enjoy going there on our dates, and our favorite places are the Cool House and the Orchid Garden.

So yes, whether you are a resident in Singapore, or you are a visitor, I would recommend SBC as a ""must see"" - for the huge variety of plant life to learn from, for a romantic hiatus (especially in the evenings when it is cooler), for a place to bring the kids and the dog and to let them loose, or just a place to find some solace from the madness of everyday life."

As the weather is very hot in Singapore I would recommend that . I would also say to visit the Botanic Garden best during the week as on weekends it is groweded with domestic helpers who use the Botanic Garden to meet and hang out.
The Botanic Garden is a beautiful place and it is rich in Nature and really beautiful to visit. I prefer the area with the lake and the Theatre so peaceful and quiet.
Not to miss the great Orchids ."

,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Love the beautiful, immaculately kept gardens. Would have enjoyed it a lot more if the weather wasn't so hot. Highly recommended to go on a cloudy or not-so-hot day. It's free and it's great for bringing kids with their scooters (with adult supervision). A word of caution: only scooter in areas where the path is flat. There are certain areas in the park where the path is steep and therefore dangerous for young kids to scooter.
Also a nice place to go for a jog or brisk walking early in the morning."

,,Beautiful place to admire nature,5.0,,"Whether you are a tourist or local resident, it is one place worth going to as you can admire the tranquil, rustic and nature surrounding. Remember to visit the iconic Tembusu tree. Sadly, you can't sit on the famous branch of the Tembusu tree. It's now being fenced up. Many beautiful trees to admire. You may just want to go there to locate the many different sculptures."
,,Green Heaven of Singapore,5.0,,"The place was a green heaven in the long list of things you could do in SIngapore, which most likely centers around shopping areas and variety of choices of entertainment, no matter what it is, it doesn't beat anything like Singapore Botanic Gardens, a lush park painted with nature's pallet from end to end with it's sprawling varieties of plants and scenery, You could do all sorts of outdoorsy activities like playing frisbee, jogging, or just a casual walk across it's compound that will serve you plenty of botanical knowledge if your interested. Best to go with friends and families and spend time napping in the grass while chatting your days a way with a glass of wine and a book you dream to finish until sunset set's in. The are restaurants inside the park surrounded by tall trees and vegetation's as if you are enjoying your coffee and steak inside a Jurassic Park . I was exploring solo when i went here, but i'll definitely bring my family to spend a day-out here next time i have the chance."

,,Out of this world,5.0,,"Beautifully maintained gardens and I particularly loved the archways pictured covered in ""Grandfather's Beard"""
,,Well Preserved Park,5.0,,"Nice park to chill out especially on weekends or to join some open exercise classes in the park. The location is accessible by both bus and MRT, but I'd recommend to use bus instead if you're planning to join the open classes there as the distance from bus station to the open area where the classes are conducted is nearer compare to the MRT station."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a must see for any visitor to Singapore. A very pleasant place to wander and enjoy the atmosphere.
We spent the best part of a day in the gardens, including the Orchid garden. Easy to get to by MRT. Interesting gift shops. Numerous places to get something to eat.

,,Pleasant Walk,4.0,,"We had not been here for aboutn10 years so it was on our to do list.
Entering from the main gate the lake is on the left, a footpath enables you to get close to seeing the fish and terrapins. Besides looking at the beautiful plants spare time to look into the trees and see different and colourful birds. The orchid garden is a paradise to walk around. The gardens cover a very large area and I feel more path side seating would be an asset. Make sure you have a large umbrella as it easy to be caught out in the open. We managed to get cover under a pergola with about 30 others, we were in the middle so remained dry. After 30 minutes sun was back out."
,,What a charming place,5.0,,"This was the furthest point on the hop off tourist bus so we decided it would be a good place to see the sights.

Aside from the orchid garden (an absolutely must see) this place really is worth a look. It is a lush park filled with amazing plants and scenery. In particular don't miss the walk through the to rainforest which is both amazing and off the beaten path. We saw spiders that were no less than 4 inches long - astounding!

There is a modest fee to get into the orchid garden but the park itself is free, all the more reason to put this on your Singapore list!"
,,Pretty cool place!,4.0,,"Went here in the morning and spent a whole day walking around the neighbourhood. Great place to see - beautiful, clean, interesting and a lot more! Definitely worth going and spending your time. It's free entrance and provides some refreshment places."
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,Beautiful and sprawling on the edge of the downtown area. The orchid garden (entrance fee charged) is clearly the highlight but wandering around the rest of the grounds makes for a delightful few hours. Grab the free shuttle bus in front of the main entrance to visit the hip Dempsey Hill area for shopping and food after.
,,Beautiful oasis in the middle of the city,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Garden is a great beautiful lush escape in the middle of the city to exercise, walk or simply relax. Accessible from different point of the city, it is very convenient to get to whether it is by foot, MRT, bus or car."

Within the park there are several specialist displays, Orchids being the principal one which does have an entrance fee, otherwise the park is free."

,,Great to walk around,5.0,,"Came here with my parents and my wife during our visit to Singapore. It was an amazing place with acres and acres of park/greens. Not far from the city and easy to get here. We came here via taxi and there's a user-friendly taxi stand whom tells taxi on main road that there are customers waiting. The souvenir shops are handy although as with all souvenir shops, its slightly pricey.

With regards to the gardens, there are a few specialised gardens for you to visit but my favourite was the orchid garden. There's always a spot to just rest and enjoy the fact that there is such a vast garden in the middle of a busy country like Singapore. Good to just walk and enjoy the fresh air."
,,Superb,5.0,,"Large, lush, well tended. The Botanical Gardens were a highlight of my week long visit to Singapore. I have never seen the massive lily pads ' in the flesh' before. Wow. For those less energetic, or less mobile, the hill may be problematic."
,,Expansive with captivating flora,4.0,,"I'm normally not a garden visitor, thinking trees are trees and flowers the same. But this large garden has many themes and places of interest to even me. Different plants, vines and trees caught my interest and was worth the visit. Take the MRT to the Gardens stop and relax and enjoy the Gardens."
,,A Timeless Classic ... But can get a bit crowded sometimes,5.0,,"Still one of the best places for a picnic in Singapore. Its a very large large place and while the Swan Lake is a deservedly popular destination for family picnics with nice shady views of the lake, the rest of the park is well worth exploring as there is much to enjoy and I always find something new. There are some well preserved heritage buildings that are mini museums, and then of course there are the Orchid Gardens which despite its slightly expensive entrance fee, is still worth a visit. Regardless of the weekend throngs there are plenty of quiet places where you can savor the considerable charm of this age-old attraction. One of my favorite spots in Singapore."
,,Acres and acres,5.0,,Singapore is most definitely a city of parks. The botanic gardens as well as having the Orchid Garden has also a number of specialized gardens. Bring your walking shoes as distances are large.

Recommend it, but maybe check the forecast before you go."
,,A lovely way to spend a morning... and free,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a real jewel to enjoy. It was certainly cooler and fresher than in the city. It is well laid out and you never know what wildlife you are going to stumble upon. While the majority of it is free, the National Orchid Garden is not but it will not break the bank and is well worth a visit. Easy to get to on the MRT or by bus."
,,Last day at Singapore,3.0,,"Since i don't really like flower, it quite boring to be there. We have to walk around 20 km to reach the national orchid garden but don't feel like what we expected to be.

,,Well Worth A Visit,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore the Botanic Gardens are well worth a visit. The gardens are beautiful especially the orchids. The gardens have good facilities, restaurant and a very good gift shop. Best way to get there is the hop on hop off bus."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,This was our first trip out in Singapore the day after we landed. These are beautiful gardens and free to the public. They are well maintained with excellent variety. Plenty of walking - but beware with temperatures of around 33 degrees and high humidity it is hard work - but well worth while.
,,Best garden for light exercise,5.0,,"Been to this garden for 30 years, swans and fish, orchid and ponds, good place for picnic and spend time with children doing nothing much.

Easy to reach via the hop on -hop off bus network.
,,lovely gardens for quiet wander,5.0,,"Lovely gardens for wander around. The Orchid gardens are within the main garden. We got caught out by heavy downpour, nowhere much to shelter, bit of a challenge getting a taxi back to Clarke Quay - long wait and system a bit unclear."

Orchid garden is another must see, you can have lots of macro shots, can see the hybrid orchids that you have never seen before. I enjoyed the nature walk a lot today and suggest to everyone"
,,So peaceful,5.0,,We stopped here as part of a hop-on and hop-off tour and as there were other places we wanted to visit we didn't spend as much time here as we would have liked. The grounds are so well kept and it was very peaceful walking round. It must be wonderful to live in Singapore and to be able to spend time in such a beautiful and free park.

,,Beautiful with a touch of the unexpected,5.0,,"We caught the hop on hop off bus (yellow line) to the gardens which are a few kilometers out of the CBD. They are set in a very up market suburb with lots of embassies and diplomatic residences which are interesting in their own right.

The gardens are magnificent with mature trees and winding paths and interesting water features,the front entrance was beautiful with tall trees and water features in a series of round gardens. the unexpected part was the evolution path which follows the earths history from when there were no plants (400? million years ago) which is a barren rock garden through the start of the planting (mainly ferns) through to the first flowering plants 14 million years ago and then to the present time.

Entry to the gardens are free with a $5 charge to see the national orchid garden.

There is a great gift shop as is to e expect ( I have never been to a botanical gardens that didn't!) The cafe food is very good but they were unable to identify whether anything on their menu was gluten free for my companion so perhaps best to avoid if you have allergies."
,,Lovely nature,4.0,,Incredible range of green stuff. Main attraction is orchid garden which was the busiest section.. Still easily manageable. The rest of the giant garden was free to explore with very little traffic. We spent 4 hrs and saw all 3 main gardens. Worth a trip.
,,nice walkabout,5.0,,"The garden is quite big, so I advise to visit it early in the morning, or later in the evening to avoid heat strokes. Great place to get away from the city madness."

,,Impressive tropical Display,4.0,,"If you can visit the rain forest, the trees are really imprssive and you will find some good informations about the trees. It can be nicely warm so prefrably you stay in the shadows of the huge trees."
,,Botanical garden,4.0,,The garden with orchides is fantastic and the display is set up very well. Recommend a visit if you are in Singapore
,,Walk and Nature,4.0,,One of Singapore's famous garden. Be prepared for walking trough the huge garden. There are much fauna n flora. Benches are make available for short rests. Water bottles can be refilled with water points. Lots of exercising crowds in the early mornings and evenings. Quite a steady stream of Tourists as well throughout the day. There are a few eating places. Yiu can spend a whole day here as there are special exhibits areas as well. A great place to walk your pets as well. Just that you need a hat or cap with the weather. A cooler day would make this place a great visit.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,The gardens are lovely and are now UNESCO Heritage listed. Very centrally located and nice to visit to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. An early morning visit is recommended
,,A touch of paradise,5.0,,"Beautiful plants. Gorgeous orchids. Set in tranquil gardens. A perfect, relaxed stroll with cafe and shop to enjoy."

,,UNESCO!,5.0,,Not a lot of foreigners seems to know that this is a Unesco heritage site. Can get really hot in un-shaded areas. Hope they grow more trees that can provide shade in the area.
,,An amazing place for full day stroll,5.0,,"Beautiful orchid garden (for a small fee), ginger garden (currently in renovation) are really interesting. This is a perfect place for walking around, enjoying free views of tropical flora and chilling out on the grass. You may even see a few big lizards!"
,,A wonderful 'must do',5.0,,"Definitely a 'must do' on a visit to Singapore. First established in 1859 it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is internationally recognised as a leading institution of tropical botany and horticulture. Going back as far as the 1920s new techniques in raising orchids were pioneered and in the National Orchid Garden you'll find the largest display of orchids in the world. But you don't have to be passionate about orchids or even a gardener to enjoy a visit. It's a wonderful 'green lung' for the people of Singapore who visit to walk, stroll, jog, run, picnic and relax. Visit in the early morning or early evening when it's cooler. Some of the paths are quite a steep climb and challenging in the midday heat. We travelled by MRT to the Botanic Gardens stop on the Blue line which is right next door to the Tanglin Gate entrance. The Gardens are open from 5am to 12 midnight daily and entry is free with a small charge for the National Orchid Garden. You'll also find signage to a Ginger Garden, a Healing Garden (open 5am-7.30pm, closed on Tuesdays except when Tuesday is a pubic holiday), a Fragrant Garden, a Foliage Garden and an Evolution Garden. The National Orchid Garden is open from 8.30am to 7pm daily admission is $5 for adults and $1 for senior citizens 60 years and above and free for children 12 years and under. There is also a free to enter Children's Garden for children 12 years and under which is open 8am-7pm although it's closed on Monday except when Mondays are public holidays."
,,Lovely oasis,5.0,,"On a hop on bus tour we noted that the Botanic Gardens were one of the stops so we decided to visit. The highlight was the Orchid Garden. There is a tiny charge to enter but it is well worth every cent, the main gardens are free. Wonderful opportunities for photography or simply enjoying the beauty of nature and the skill of plant breeders."
,,Beautiful place to visit.,5.0,,Absolutely gorgeous! Glad we took the metro there and spent the afternoon. Saw lots of beautiful landscaping and benches scattered throughout to sit and enjoy the scenery.
,,Oasis of peace and beauty within the busy city,5.0,,"This is a must to visit if you have the time. It provides a welcome break from the more commercial side of Singapore. Unbelievably, entry is free and the gardens contain the National Orchid Garden which has only a very modest entry charge for what must be the most spectacular orchid garden anywhere. The botanic gardens contain large open areas as well as lakes and more formal garden areas and it is worth planning to spend most of a day here if you can spare the time."
,,See and feel how an equatorial climate,5.0,,"If you would like to experiment an equatorial climate on your own and you like nature, then Botanic Gardens is for you: plants all over the place, a lot of flowers (everywhere, not only in the Orchid Garden) and even a tropical forest. It's also huge, so prepare to walk a lot!"

,,LOVE this!,5.0,,"Be sure to visit early in the morning so you could tag a good spot for picnic or just to look around. As later it will get crowded with people especially during the weekends. Apart from that, a veryyyy nice greeny ambience, so calm and peaceful with the hills and trees. Bring your kids along!"
,,Nice place for a stroll,4.0,,Lovely spot to walk around and relax. Recommend doing this in the cooler part of the day as there is not a lot of shade in some parts of the garden. Very relaxing.
,,Wonderful Park,5.0,,Peaceful except for the crowded but absolutely stunning orchid collection. Locals go there for their early morning walks.
,,Great way to acclimatise,4.0,,"Went here on the first day of our holiday and it was a great way to relax, slow down the pace and potter around beautiful gardens with some interesting learning. Loved the orchid garden too. And the lime juice in the age to cool down."

,,A world class location,5.0,,"This is a facility for gardeners, expert botanist no most of all for the greater public. It is a feast for the eyes and senses. There are lakes, hills, parks, walkways all packed with colour. The National Orchid collection is fabulous and all of it is FREE"
,,Just loved it,5.0,,This was part of the hop on hop off bus stops and the first one we did.We thought we may be able to do it in an hour but even 1.5 hours wasn't enough.Take a packed lunch and just relax in the amazing gardens and sit by the pond watching the turtles and monitor lizards swimming by.We were so impressed.Make sure you do it

,,Gorgeous well kept gardens,5.0,,"We really enjoyed walking around the Botanic Gardens and it was obviously popular with the locals with picnics, a wedding and lots of family visits going on. The Orchid gardens were beautiful, well worth the small payment to go into that area. We were unlucky that it rained heavily for about half an hour during our visit but actually some of the plants ,especially the big leaves, looked really lovely with the water on them and it didn't distract too much."
,,Beautifully manicured walking space,5.0,,"Great spot for a long meander or a short run. Get off the MRT at botanical gardens.
Solo-travelor friendly, family friendly. Take a nap or keep moving. Free admission. $5 admission to orchid garden, which I think was worth it. Chgeck the park website for free outdoor performances."
,,A Beautiful Attraction,5.0,,"This was located near our Orchard Road hotel so we were able to walk here-15 minute walk. Surprisingly, the gardens are free! The only area that charges is the Orchard Garden and that is very nominal-$5 regular, $1 for senior citizens. What a beautiful way to spend a day. I would recommend getting an early start as it does get hot in Singapore. So many flowers, trees--the design is stunning! Don't miss this!"
,,One of the most enveloping gardens I have ever visited,5.0,,"Not a sign of city, paradise in reality, not enough time to emerse ineself. Largest orchid garden with thousands of types and hybrids. You will not be disappointed. Free admittance except $5 for orchid garden but only one dollar US for seniors. Best value in town. Take time to enjoy it all , but plan it earlier in the day since the humidity will hasten your visit. Check times for the evenings which might be another option. After 11am it gets really sticky but truly this is better than all the shopping and man made attractions in Singapore. You will not regret it."
,,Fantastic gardens and free,5.0,,"We visited these gardens while staying in Singapore as we had been recommended by friends. We caught the metro ($2.20 from Chinatown) and were amazed to find they were free to enter. I think there was a charge for the Orchid garden inside but we didn't go in there. There was so much to see with lots of different plant areas, eating places, lovely shops and toilet facilities. There was even a children's garden where adults couldn't go in unless they took a child in. We spent half a day there and still didn't see everything. A definite must to see in Singapore"
,,Simply amazing place,5.0,,"It is really big park and a lot to see. If you go there, make sure you have at least several hours or better half day for this activity. Orchid garden is not free of charge."

,,Best place for family walk in Singapore,5.0,,"First time in many years that we visit the Singapore Botanic Garden. This time, we brought along our 3-month old twins daughters. Car parking was a bliss at the visitor building. The walkways for the pram and disables are plenty in the garden. The greenery was refreshing and the weather was not too humid.
A wonderful walk for the newly initiated."
,,A great Oasis in The City,4.0,,This was a really big green oasis mixed into a big and bustling city. Beautiful Orchard gardens and great walkways with small places to sits dread android someone space and greenery. Wouldn't say it is a tourist attraction but is a nice free activity out...
,,Very tranquil in the hustle & bustle of Singapore,5.0,,"Loved walking through the gardens, even though the plan was not quite accurate or to scale, but we are mappers! The Halia restaurant was perfect on a very hot day, with delicious food & refreshing drinks (& excellent bathrooms!)."
,,Excellent free experience,5.0,,Easily accessed from the MRT the mature gardens offer something for everyone. A visit is free unless you pay to enter the Orchid garden. There is a path round that is accessible for disabled or pushchairs and lots of other paths. We had lunch at one of the cafes and it was fair value.

Tucked amidst the hustle bustle of the city, it is a delightful feast to the eyes, mind and soul! Have a lovely time and be warned its too vast to cover within few hours! Head to the Orchid garden first and move on to the rest and plan a picnic for the entire day. Photographer's delight of course! Have a great time!"
,,Nice stroll. A must go if you have time.,5.0,,"This garden includes many smaller gardens. You get to see many kinds of plants. It's a wonderful LONG walk. I don't see many tourists there, mostly locals. If you like flowers and plants this place is highly recommended."
,,Blooming beautful,4.0,,"Only spent an hour or so here from a hop on/off, before the rain set in, bus but will return to do more as we live in JB and can bring children and husband back for a full day visit."
,,Orchid garden is a world reference.,5.0,,"The gardens are all breathtaking, from the 1500 species Garlic garden to the 35000 species Orchid garden the place is so well planned out and manicured with a great history dating back to the early 1800's. Beautiful mix of modern and mature. I have saved the Healing Garden for my next trip as time was limited on my first visit."
,,Lovely Morning!,5.0,,"Too much area to cover the whole thing. We walked through the ginger forest, orchid gardens, and bromeliads. Easy paths, beautifully maintained. Great place to escape from the city"
,,Morning Refreshment,5.0,,"Botanic garden is genuinely recommended for those who are searching a place for exercise, yoga, jogging, relaxing activities and even studying.

,,Only in Asia,3.0,,This botanical garden is very innovative and special and a visit worth. But I guess this only is what U would see in Asia. Hard to explain. But go and evaluate yourself. There is a pricetag of 28 SGD for some of the park.
,,A delightful morning,5.0,,"We spent a morning strolling through these gardens which was free entry, there is a S$5 entry fee to go into the separate Orchid gardens. We only covered half of the gardens in the time, there was a whole range of interesting things to see and rain forest walk was good. We lunched at the cafe where the food was very good."
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,A must visit for every tourist. It is beautiful and very interesting on how they manage the gardens.
,,Lovely back to nature Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"the Healing Garden beckoned me although I'm healthy. It was a pleasant stroll to see so many healing plants and to think about the properties of health within. I always go thru a fragrant garden and so this was no disappointment. The scents wafted my way and the blossoms were lovely. I only had a little over an hour in the garden, but I could have happily spent the day there. The little gift shop offered me a spot of tea and I purchased an adorable teaball for my cups at home. Well-marked paths, plenty of photo opts."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful garden in the middle of the Singapore. Lovely place to take a walk with your loved ones. Lot of young brides and groom come here for pre wedding photo shoot.
,,Beautiful sight,5.0,,"It has the perfect ambiance, very relaxing and calm. The orchid garden is very beautiful, very romantic place. I suggest for you to bring umbrella and mosquito repellent. I hope they put a bicycle rental so it wouldn't be too tiring to go around the place. It is too big and we didn't have enough time to explore the whole place."
,,An Outstanding Tropical Garden,5.0,,"We visited the gardens with a tour guide, but it's easy to visit on your own. There are plenty of tropical plants here including hundreds of orchid varieties. You can spend an hour here or all day if you just want to find a quiet spot and meditate. Make sure to take your camera with you if you like taking photos of flowers."
,,Fantastic place,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are enormous and you can walk for miles. This is one of Singapore's free attractions - no entrance fee.

There is plenty of flora and fauna to see and the place is peaceful, spacious and not at all crowded. Watch out for the art work throughout the site! Very interesting.

I was a wee bit disappointed that I did not see many flowers, but guess this may have been due to the time of year (January), however, we paid the small entrance fee and visited the Orchid Garden where I was blown away by the variety and colours of orchids on view.

I would definitely recommend a visit of at least 4 or 5 hours to enjoy the Gardens."
,,Take the time to visit,5.0,,"Another place of memories for Me, loved the peacefulness of the Gardens. The Gardens are very well maintained as are the Lakes. I ran out of time to visit the Orchid Garden, but will endeavour to visit next time I am in Singapore. I would also love to be there when there is an orchestra playing at Symphony Lake - I imagine that the sound would be lovely travelling over the water."
,,The best ever,5.0,,Have been here many times and am always bowled over by how fabulous they are. Best attraction in Singapore

,,A nice place to spend the evening...,3.0,,The Botanical Gardens are a must visit. The entrance is free but you have to pay for the Orchid gardens. The Botanical Gardens is a nice place to have a nice walk and a small picnic with family and friends. You can relax in between the greenery.

,,Fully deserving of status as Unesco Heritage Site,5.0,,"Recommend going in evening, just as light is fading, the temperature will be dropping and the gardens relatively quiet. A super opportunity to get a feel for how much of Singapore would have been before becoming a building site. Gardens are sympathetically and subtly lit at night. Have a meal at any of the restaurants at end of your walk. Good value and quality...unique setting."
,,Perfect getaway from the city,4.0,,"I love parks, so if you love nature, botanic garden is the most accessible and beautiful park you can visit. There is several entrance. The easiest is to take the mrt and alight at BOTANIC GARDENS. circle line and downtown line both works. If you are looking for food, there is some restaurant in the garden, or you can cross the road to Cluny court and have some bites. It's a nice small man with supermarket. So you can also get some stuff and go for a picnic:) There's a small park that allows water play for kids, as well as some play ground. So don't worry that your kids will not have fun. Bring along mosquitos patch thou, and umbrella, just in case:)"

,,"Nice Park, But I Wouldn't Call it a Garden",2.0,,"I really don't understand all of the great reviews on this place. If you grew up in a city where there are no green areas I can understand. But this place I would not classify as a botanical garden. It's really just a very nice park. And as for the Orchid Garden, I saw more orchids at Changi Airport than I saw in this ""garden."" And I'm not exaggerating. Just look at the Visitor Photos posted. You know what you see very little of? Flowers! Lots of green, and a few orchids. To me, this was a complete waste of time. Save some time and go to the Gardens by the Bay. Those were spectacular."
,,Breath taking!,5.0,,"You must visit the Botanic Gardens of Singapore. The entrance to the Gardens is free. Only entrance fee is for the Orchid Garden which you must see too. You can spend the whole day enjoying the plants and flowers. There are quite a lot of places where you can rest and have tea, coffee or cold drink. Also, there are a couple of very nice restaurants.

Loving walking tracks and themed gardens and lakes.
Plenty of parking and well serviced by public transport."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Be prepared to spend some 3 hours at least and don't go if you are sensitive to heat as it is quite tough out there. Make sure to also pay the extra to enter the Orchid Garden.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Must make time to see!! Very relaxing and easy to get to by taxi which are very reasonable. Take a picnic or find a lovely place to sit and stare. The ORCHID GARDEN IS WONDERFUL!

,,Beautiful orchids and very clean,5.0,,"A beautiful garden, as we went in February not very much in flower except the orchids which were stunning.

Everything is so clean and pristine, well worth a visit, you forget you are in the hustle and bustle of a city while you are strolling round."
,,Beautiful place for a nice stroll,5.0,,A must-do in Singapore. The Botanic Gardens are a UNESCO World Heritage site. Don't miss the Orchid Garden. Loved this beautiful oasis celebrating Singapore's national flower.

,,UNESCO site worth a vist,4.0,,This UNESCO recognised botanical garden is worth a visit even if for a brief period of time.. I went in the late evening or rather night and missed the beauty of the place in morning or during day time yet the experience was quite good to take a stroll in the widely spread garden.: should not be missed.. The kids will too love it with the children park but be sure to be there early for them to enjoy

,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,A beautiful spot to spend a few hours wandering about. Additional charge of 5$ each to visit the Orchid garden which is well worth it. Walked through the rain forest and the ginger gardens. Excellent place to visit.
,,A day in the Beautiful Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"We visited the botanic gardens to fill the day before flying home in the evening. After arriving at 9:00am we visited the foliage garden, evolution garden, and Eco lake.
We payed for entry into the orchid garden ($5 SGD), which is utterly incredible and completely worth the small price - make sure to visit the orchid house which has the VIP orchids, and also the mist house, which contains some of their prize winning orchids (which are absolutely wonderful).
We had lunch out in the food court of a mall located near one of the gates, and then came back to visit the healing gardens, swan lake and other areas we had missed earlier, leaving the gardens eventually at 6:00pm
All together it was an utterly fantastic day, which tired us out to sleep on the long flight home!"
,,Mrs,4.0,,"This made for a great afternoon's walkabout. We discovered buggys later, however but had covered most of the grounds by then! There was even some wildlife there. A bride and groom were also having their photo shoot there when we visited this scenic place."
,,Simply a must-see in Singapore!,5.0,,"This is arguably one of the best botanical gardens in the world. It is, in my opinion, one of the top Singapore attractions and should not be missed.

Entrance is free, although you do have to pay if you want to go into the orchid garden. I suggest skipping it and focussing on the other areas of the garden, such as the healing garden or the evolution garden which are informative, free and less crowded.

Keep in mind that most of the gardens are outdoor exhibits. It can get very hot and humid here, and you will have to do quite a bit of walking."
,,Just Gorgeous,4.0,,Take your time to wander around. It is just beautiful. The medicinal garden section is fascinating. I learnt things.
,,A wonderful green oasis in a vibrant city,5.0,,"This large city park provides a lovely experience with a wide range of plants (including the national orchid garden for a small charge). Entrance is free and it is served by its own Metro station. There is plenty of open grass for picnics etc. You will need nice weather, but there are some shelters and a decent range of eating places."
,,Jewel in a gem,4.0,,Lovely cultivated gardens in the middle of a busy place. Highly recommend the orchid garden and it has many interesting sculptures

,,A great place to escape the hustle and bustle...,5.0,,The gardens are so tranquil it's quiet easy to forget how close you are to the centre of the city. The gardens are vast and there's lots to see so make sure you're wearing a comfortable pair of shoes. I'm currently 19 weeks pregnant and visited on a hot day so I had to take it slow but there's plenty of places to stop and have a rest. The fragrance garden was a particular favourite of mine.
,,Tranquil,4.0,,"Singapore does it well. Hard to believe you are surrounded by city. Link you visit with a 24 hour Singapore bus tour pass. We bought a ticket in the afternoon and then used our pass the next morning to visit the gardens. People of all walks of life exercising and walking their dogs. Lots of trails and so well planned you feel like your lost. It's free and beautifully kept, enjoy the hard work over 100's of years of many."

Free, so it is a bonus in the midst of all the shopping and it's nice to go and walk around to learn a lot about Singapore Heritage and there are some gorgeous flowers there and plant work. Didn't catch anything at the Orchestra area but it was impressive to look at regardless. Side note, it is really big! Keep an eye out for wildlife in the water areas too, I managed to catch some really cute baby turtles!"

,,Innovation,5.0,,"These gardens are just amazing and not to be missed. The big tree walkway costs 5SD worth it. Every evening the light show at 7.45 a real must, with musi and free. If you have children bring bathers as they will have such fun splashing in water fountain specially for them.. Not over 12 though! There is payed entrance to some area that is up to the individual but the whole place is amazing."

,,Most beautiful place in Singapore!,5.0,,I have walked through the Botanical Gardens for 15 years and each day it is a welcomed delight to enjoy peace and tranquility in the midst of a busy Singapore. The gardens are well tended for but allowed to feel very natural and not overly manicured. There is also no charge to enjoy this national treasure. There is a small fee for the Orchid Gardens.
,,Transported Away,5.0,,These beautiful gardens are a must for lovers of plants water falls and orchids. The lush tropical surrounds are cooling and refreshing to walk around and soak up the energy a garden gives to humans
,,Not Overly Impressed,3.0,,"Other than the Orchid Garden we found the rest of the gardens to be somewhat bland and boring. We arrived by MRT which takes you to the far end of the park. As the park is huge, be prepared for a long, hot, sweaty day."
,,Wonderful place to be with nature,2.0,,"We accessed the botanical gardens using the city explorer. We walked through the gardens which were free and then paid a small charge to go into the orchid gardens.

The only thing is the ""Swan"" Lake no longer has lakes...I suspect they've been eaten by the giant monitor lizards that are now swimming around lazily?"
,,Orchid Garden,4.0,,"It is very big botanic garden in Singapore, the forest inside made Singapore weather become cool & fresh."
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens have a wonderful array of plants. My favorite part is the Orchid Garden. The displays are outstanding with so many varieties and colors,

,,Something new every tine,5.0,,"I've been to the Botanic Gardens many times but I find something or somewhere new each time. On my last visit I encountered a black swan and a small banana orchard. Lovely place for a stroll, a picnic, treasure/nature hunt, or an educational foray."
,,Botanical Gardens the best in the world,5.0,,"Using the ""Hop on hop off""bus we visited these magnificent gardens which are some of the best I have seen in the world. So clean and tidy with beautifully laid out lawns, lakes and plants. A day could be spent wandering around though we could only afford ourselves a couple of hours before continuing our bus tour of Singapore."
,,A beautiful place to experience peace,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens in Singapore has a lot to offer. Peaceful and serene you get to experience nature as well as get to see beautiful Orchids at the Orchid Garden which is part of the complex. Being a keen photographer I have been to the place many times and have been lucky enough to see a couple of species of Owls in the complex as also photograph a Kingfisher which you will find very often at the lake as also a couple of eagles near the Swan lake. If you want to get away from it all and enjoy a day of peace and be with nature, the Botanical Gardens is the place to go to"
,,Beautiful romantic place,5.0,,"A romantic beautiful place. It's a must for a visit in Singapore. Don't forget a camera, there are lots of spots to be captured."

,,Beautiful place to be!,5.0,,"Really worth a visit, beautiful surroundings - hop off the open top bus tour for an hour and have a look around!"
,,superb place to visit,5.0,,beautiful gardens offering a tranquil day out. must visit the orchid gardens too well worth the $5 entrance fee. take a picnic and chill out for a few hours.

,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"The tourist bus stopped here and he hopped off. The guide gives the impression of a vast site, but in fact it is relatively small. Entry to the gardens is free, though to get into the Orchid garden does require paying for. Flowers are amazing and the birds are also worth watching (and listening to)."
,,Orchid Garden,4.0,,If you don't have time to do anything else go straight to the orchid garden - stunning. Try and avoid weekends and holidays as its busy.

,,Fantasy!,1.0,,"I want to go back here. My favourite place set in a plantation. So many different themed gardens, the jungle of which was my favourite. There were hundreds of big tortoises swimming in the lake together with monitor lizards which were a few feet long. The monitor lizards were also walking about the park which was very surprising due to their size, absolutely brilliant."
,,Garden worthy of its UNESCO status,4.0,,Amazing and massive garden that accompanied Singaporeans through the years! Really proud that they have been awarded the UNESCO status! The open area where there are live performances on stage was a cool touch!
,,Simply stunning!,5.0,,"I am fortunate to live within an easy walk of the gardens and walk the dogs most days. I love the sights and sounds heard in the gardens. The birdsong is particularly lovely to hear. I spent a few hours there the other day without the dogs which enabled me to go into the Orchid and Ginger garden and what an amazing spectacle. We see visitors crowding around the entrance everyday but as 'locals' tend perhaps to give this a miss which we shouldn't! Look out for the free concerts which occur on a frequent basis. Grab a picnic and listen to jazz, classical, etc under the stars!"
,,EXCELLENT,5.0,,It is one of the best Botanic Garden I have already see. It look like an paradise. It is a must. It is a mast go attraction
,,Great for a free day out,5.0,,"This is a massive gardens and would take a couple of days to really see everything and enjoy it. Most of it is free but there is a small charge for the orchid garden which is worth it. There are so many different, beautiful parts of this well maintained gardens that at times it feels as though you are in a national park. We went back a second day to the children's garden as it was closed on our first visit and we could have stayed there for a lot longer as there was plenty to do and the kids loved it. As well as the plants and the water there is lots of wildlife, as you can imagine, we saw several monitor lizards wandering around the paths and swimming as well as plenty of birds and butterflies, we even saw some turtles. I would recommend this as a great free day out, the only negative is that it got extremely hot in the middle of the day and there's not much shelter as you walk around so I would aim to go early in the day if you want to enjoy it"
,,Flowers mean Love,5.0,,So many and so beautiful orchids. Our visit was the 3rd and not the last. See the Mandela's giant cola.
,,One of the world's great botanic gardens,5.0,,The Botanic Garden (including the world-famous Orchid Garden) is one of the must-see tourist sites of Singapore. Don't confuse the 150-year-old Botanic Garden with the glitzy new Gardens by the Bay. The Botanic Garden is the real deal. The garden is free (there is a small charge for the Orchid Garden) and open well into the evening. A great time to visit is around sunset -- or of course first thing in the morning.
,,Visit when u have the time,3.0,,"Visited on V Day. The garden is free except for Orchid Garden ($5 entrance fee and it closes at 6pm). Ginger garden has nothing but it ok to sweat it out by walking around. Accessible by train/mrt/subway/whatever u call it (Botanic Gardens Station). Do check if there are fringe activities over the weekend, it'll make your visit more meaningful.

There are 2 exhibition blocks to visit and they close at 6pm (closer towards Tanglin Road Entrance/Exit.

Do standby a brolly and water. I'd suggest exiting from Tanglin Road Entrance/Exit if you wanna head towards Orchard Road (main shopping belt, 15 minutes walk but there are some malls you can visit along the way)"
,,stunning,5.0,,Beautiful gardens we went on an organised trip which was good but would have liked more time there. its only 15mins from city so easy to do in a taxi. So much to see and absolutely stunning.
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Having missed it during my first visit I made it sure that I visited this beautiful place, now the first UNESCO World Heritage Site of Singapore.

Its just amazing, the map helps you to navigate through the various gardens. Nature lover or not everyone will admire the Botanical Gardens. Whats more its free. The best part is the Orchid Garden.

Please do not miss this at any cost."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Fabulous park, every tree, shrub, plant and flower is manicured to perfection. You can walk around the lake and feed the hundreds of little turtles that live in there. It also has the biggest lily pads I have ever seen, perfect for frogs or for those looking for their Prince Charming! A great place to run around every morning too but make it early or else it will be too hot. The Halia restaurant which is in the park was great too, recommend it for a lovely evening meal in obviously beautiful surroundings."
,,Fauna & Flora,5.0,,This magnificent Botanical Garden is completely free to enter apart from the Orchid Garden. Really beautiful and educational.
,,One of the most amazing places in Singapore,5.0,,"I was blown away by the sheer beauty of the place. The botanic gardens are huge and beautiful.

You may walk along the numerable lakes or spend time watching the wildlife that the place has to offer or just pick a nice spot under a tree and laze around on a beautiful Saturday morning."
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"Probably the most beautiful gardens ever! We have travelled all over the world and been to some beautiful gardens, these however are just the best. It helps that the law as are so strict on smoking and littering! We loved not only the trees, plants and flowers, but the fact there were families having picnics, children playing and young adults dancing and having fun, apparently concerts and shows are put on at the open air theatre... I'd love to experience that! A stunning place that took my breath away."
,,Jazz concert at the Bandstand,4.0,,"A lovely evening spent enjoying a jazz concert and a family picnic at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, a UNESCO Heritage site. There is such a diversity of flora and fauna, we discover something new each visit. It's a perfect spot for walks, runs or quite meditation. Well done to the team there for all the effort in keeping it beautiful."
,,Well Worth a visit,4.0,,"I am interested in nature and flowers so I loved it, but my Boyfriend found it interesting and worthwhile too. Allow yourself about 4-5 hours to get round on it all."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"This garden is a well established attraction and it is beautiful.There are lots of paths and walkways and there is even a walk through some preserved tropical rainforest. Again there are bits of interesting sculptures and the orchid garden for which there is an entrance fee is amazing but well worth it to learn the history and development of Singapore's national flower. It was fascinating.
You can spend a good few hours here and a quick visit would not do it justice . This is worth dedicating some time on your trip for particularly if you enjoy formal gardens in the UK."
,,UNIQUE !!!,5.0,,"the Orchis collection is UNIQUE..with a lot of variety.The collection has some hot spots like the mist room, VIP section, cool house, bromeliad section ...

After the visit of the Orchis section, spend some time in the park where you'll discover other themed gardens like the ginger garden, the fragrant gardens etc...

and, the most appreciable... calm and tranquility...

(the park is free to access, there is a fee for the Orchis collection ; 10 SGD/Px)"
,,"""Interesting features & things to look out for at Botanic Gardens.....""",5.0,,"This is a very huge garden, with thousands of species of beautiful & unique trees, plants & flowers. We spent 4 hours here & still did not manage to see all. Expect alot of walking.

Some interesting features & things to look out for while here....

1. Go to the huge pond & stand near the edges. Immediately you can see many big fishes ( black/orange) start coming towards the edge when they see you & all looking up at you together - 'waiting' for food to be thrown to them.

They seems to know what to do when someone comes near- gesturing & hoping for food to be thrown in ( see photo). They just stay there until you move away.
Amazing, & very intelligent fishes.

2. Look out for really big lizards while strolling the paths ( not sure if these are salamanders or monitor lizards). Looks intimidating! Don't go too near them ( see photo).

3. There are many unique looking, colourful & beautiful flowers /plants all over. Haven't really seen these anywhere else ( see photos).

4. Healing & Ginger Gardens - amazing what one can learn from these 2 unique gardens about all the healing powers of so many common plants ( see photos).

5. Visit The Gardens Shop. Here one can find many nice & very interesting souvenirs related to flowers/plants. Many of which can only be found here as they are not general types of souvenirs.

The shop at the main entrance area near Visitor Centre is much bigger & has more items than the one at National Orchids Centre.

6. Food- a must for everyone. There are various dining outlets inside but if one yearn for fast food, there is one big McDonald's outlet just outside the Botanic Gardens MRT station, before you enter the garden .

Once you are on street level, you can see Botanic Gardens on the right& Cluny Court mall on the left ( a small mall of few shops/dining). Behind Cluny Court is a small tyres/batteries shop, followed by another small mall called Serene Centre. McDonald's is located on ground level of Serene Centre."
,,Great for the nature lovers,5.0,,"We spent four hours in the Botanic garden even though it was raining, we had to buy umbrella from the shop which I thought it was quite expensive. My advice to anyone going on holiday where it is summer always take umbrella with you. Orchard garden was the best."
,,Every day a Sunday,5.0,,"When I first came to the gardens, it was early in the morning, just after a light drizzle. It was cool, and though there were many people, it was big enough to not seem crowded. The grounds are huge, I almost regretted not bringing my running shoes. It also would have been a wonderful place to read, as there are many benches and cool, quiet places to relax. There's this huge pond that has fish, and a remarkable number of turtles who occasionally pop their heads up for a breath. Or scamper onto a rock to sun themselves. There are many walkers as well, and a good number of them bring their dogs for a run. Many are kind enough to let me pet their dogs or answer a quick question on their breed and their respective temperament. My next visit brought me to the Orchid garden. But nevertheless, both visits felt like a wonderful, Sunday morning stroll, much needed to ready for the busy days ahead."
,,Lovely introduction to tropical gardens,4.0,,"This was our first stop on a month long trip to Australia, and our first introduction to the tropics. Needless to say it was boiling hot and very humid, so walking at a leisurely pace is essential. These gardens allow and encourage you to do just that. They are well laid out with easy walking paths, not too many climbs, plenty of places to stop and absorb the views. Good toilet facilities and places to get refreshments. Entrance is free and it is a great place to visit in all weathers."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"My wife stayed at Regent hotel on a recent visit to Singapore. Singapore Botanical gardens were at a walking distance from her hotel. The place is very beautiful, mesmerizing and refreshing. It is a must visit if you ever go to Singapore."
,,Such a variety of orchids. Not to be missed.,4.0,,Perfectly well maintained as you would expect in Singapore. Don't follow the signs which are sometimes misleading. Just trust your instincts and let yourself be carried through the scenery.
,,Nice,5.0,,This place is beautiful.... different from the usual places you visit in singapore... very nice place... avoid going on a hot day...
,,Serene,4.0,,A beautiful place to sit and contemplate or just explore. The gardens are pristine and so green. Have a meal or coffee at the Casa Verde and enjoy the orchids at the Orchid Garden which is a stroll away.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"The singapore botanic gardens is a vast garden consisting of gardens with different sections. This time I visited Healing Garden which has plants which are useful in curing most of the ailments.

,,Opened to the locals.,5.0,,"This place is the world heritage site and there were many local ppl running/walking around the park. This is 2.7km wide and if you want to cover every place, it takes more than an hour. We visited here in the morning and it had flesh air and we felt great."
,,A GARDEN TO REMEMBER,5.0,,Unbelievable until you experience it for yourself. A world renown garden in the middle of a metropolitan city state. Plants from the past colonial time to the present world's famous orchids will fascinate you and bring your time away. It is now an UNESCO World Heritage Site.
,,Amazing green oasis in the city,5.0,,The botanic gardens are a great relief from the mid day heat. Shady walks and high quality attractions including the national orchid centre. Good range of food and beverage outlets make it a good place for lunch.
,,A Tropical Paradise,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a 156-year-old tropical garden that showcases the best and most spectacular of tropical flora set in stunning verdant landscape. More than 10,000 species of flora is spread over its 82-hectares area. There are more species of trees in Singapore than the whole of USA. With more than 150 years of history, the Gardens holds a unique and significant place in the history of Singapore and the region. The Gardens has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 4 July 2015. It is the first tropical, and only the third botanic gardens on the UNESCO’s World Heritage List.

,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,A UNESCO HERITAGE ..you can spend a whole morning here..followed by a good lunch at one of the restaurants..Must visit the Orchid Garden with a nominal entrance fee..worth it..
,,Spend a day with nature,5.0,,"A really marvellous place to visit, and it's free. Spend a day walking through the trees and visit the specialist areas. The orchid garden should not be missed. Easy access off the Metro"

It's also free, so if you're on a budget, pack a picnic and relish the cheapness of it all :-D"
,,Weekend fun at the Singapore Botanic Garden,5.0,,One of the best public garden - a UNESCO HERITAGE SITE. It is FREE and can spend whole morning. Nice place for family picnic.
,,Secret Garden...this is how I would have imagined it to be.,4.0,,"I have been here on a group walk and alone. It is definitely unique and peaceful experience. Given the climate of Singapore would recommend to go for a walk or run, either early morning around 8 am when the park opens or in evening past 6pm once its cooler.

Just remember to pack mosquito repellent, umbrella and water to keep hydrated. There are multiple exhibits to explore, and Swan lake with beautiful white and black swans (rarity). Another tip would be to go for a morning walk and enjoy a breakfast at Cassa Verda.

There are multiple entrances to the park. We took exit A, Botanic Garden MRT. An added charm to this Garden are the hidden restaurants near Cluny road."
,,Singapore's natural getaway right in the heart of the city.,5.0,,This is a great place for a walk or some outdoors fun. It is peaceful with an amazing collection of trees. The short jungle trail brings one through really mature tropical forest. There is a beautiful orchid garden that's worth a visit. Also check out the cafe at the entrance where you can take a nice break.
,,"Orchids, orchids",5.0,,"If you are on Orchid lover then the section at the Botanical gardens is a must on your visit to Singapore. A magical place to explore with wonderful archways of orchids, grandfathers moustache or air plants in profusion and a rio of colour in the orchid house, the obligatory gift shop where you can buy every type of orchid related jewellery, t-towels, gold plated orchids is never ending and the only way to exit this particular part of the Botanic Gardens. We found the easiest way to get there from Orchard road and return was by taxi, unless you are doing the Hop on Hop off bus tour around Singapore, then you can utilise this."
,,Amazing garden in a busy city,5.0,,"Loved walking around these garden, was nice to get out of the hustle and bustle for a few hours, this place is huge and you could probably spend a whole day here, if you had the time."
,,City Serenity,4.0,,"Created by the British in the Colonial era, this is a city treasure for serenity, leisure and getting away from it all. Hardly any skyscrapers to occlude your views. A quiet walk, stand by the fish ponds, enjoy the color of the Orchid Gardens within, have a snack, shop at the gift shop, take your children through the Jacob Ballas section of the gardens.

Respite from busyness, urban sprawl. Copy the taiqi practitioners in the cool of the morning or any recreational group? Sometimes you can find someone in a quiet yoga position meditating? Yeah, the un-Singaporean UNESCO treasure! Shh, go about peacefully and quietly please!"
,,An oasis in a bustling city,5.0,,This extensive gardens which if free to enter is an area of tranquillity in Singapore. In addition to the well laid out gardens area lakes which are well stocked with several varieties of fish and provide additional photographic opportunities.

,,Live with nature in Metropolitan,5.0,,"Big Garden in the big city. Botanic garden is located in the big area of Singapore Island. They collect tropical plant togther. Young can learn which one are. Also, this place is insubscribed World heritage site from UNESCO in 2015"

,,An Oasis among the Skyscrapers,5.0,,"The place is so large it could take a full day to explore and enjoy so if time is limited as was ours, select a section and spend your time there. We chose the Orchid Pavilion and Ginger Area and spent a very pleasant 2 hours. More orchids and varieties than you can imagine, ponds, fountains, pools and beauty all around."
,,What a nice place!,5.0,,"Take the Downtown Line MRT (Blue), abd get off at Botanic Garden Station. Follow directions and you are at the garden in no time. Admission is free except for the Orchid Garden (5$ per adult).

The Fragrant, Ginger and Healing Gardens are a must.

It is preferable to tour this attraction early during the day or later in the afternoon. Bring lots of water. Some people may need sunscreen, while others may need mosquito repellent.

,,What you would expect,4.0,,a mix of asian and european flora. The orchid garden is damn impressive. Some nice lakes. A few good cafes etc spread throughout. Good venues for events. Very hot and very little shelter/seating though.
,,Lovely,5.0,,"I love that place. Besides the fact that it reminds me when I lived in Singapore and used to run in that park, the variety of trees is extraordinary. Trees you never heard of and and feel of what Singapore may have looked liked many moons ago before people built the island.
I love the trees that were planted by Lee Kwan Yew in 1955 and more. A great feeling to be next to a legend."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"spent a wonderful afternoon here despite inclement weather, the walks through the grounds are magnificent"
,,World class gardens,5.0,,"And, they have a great restaurant so plan on eating there. Admission is free to the park (pay to enter orchid exhibit. Bring liquids since it gets hot walking. Very interesting specimens, some wildlife (monitor lizards, dragonflies, damsel flies, giant forest spiders) and, as with everywhere else in Sg, well organized, spotlessly clean and run by friendly, polite people..."
,,Probably one of the best botanical gardens you'll see,5.0,,Very impressive gardens. I love visiting botanical gardens in whatever city I visit. This is one if the better ones I've seen. Check out the waterfall and the orchard gardens as well.
,,Loved the archways,5.0,,"I really enjoyed my trip to the botanical gardens. I had previously visited 30 years ago and remember the gardens from then. We started with lunch at the restaurant which was really nice and then we walked. Although it was humid it was beautiful to walk in the garden and some of the plants were amazing. Loved the ""grandfather whiskers"" on the archway."
,,A green oasis in the midst of the city,5.0,,"This is a Must See attraction, very easy to get to with a bus. Entrance is free and it is best to start earlier in the morning when it is cooler. A fantastic place to walk around, see many beautiful trees. The orchid garden does charge a fee, but it is more than worth it! You will see a great variety of gorgeous orchids in a beautiful garden setting. Like most things in Singapore, the Botanic Gardens are first class. And if your hotel does not have a gym, you can join the many runners in the park."
,,A favourite place,5.0,,As it was out of town it was a 25 min journey direct on central line from nichol highway . Well worth the trip
,,A park 10 minutes from the city,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a gem hidden at one end of Orchard Road, the shopping district. There is a track that leads to an old patch of tropical rainforest that has been there since the 1800s. There are trees from India, Madagascar, coffee trees from Indonesia, and a riot of flowers the names of which I cannot pronounce. In particular, there is a tree with a low-hung branch that stretched parallel to the ground for three metres. It is now cordoned off with a fence as tourists tend to sit on the branch and have their pictures taken. Once you are in the garden, the noise along Orchard road becomes far off. There is quiet and repose. Here. Only 10 minutes from Orchard Road."
,,A must if in Singapore,5.0,,"A beautiful place to visit a must when in Singapore, a great for a run, stroll or to take kids it is a very large garden so research it before you go and decide what you would like to see, there are a few places to eat/drink while there enjoy and have fun, its totally beautiful. There are a few things to do with kids there..."
,,oasis of calm despite humidity,5.0,,wonderful to feel some nature in this green but urban jungle of Singapore.... especially recommend the national orchid garden which thought a bit fragile in places still reflects the nature that was here before Singapore and will be once more when it is gone.. unless we manage to save nature first before we destroy our species...
,,A most excellent garden within the Garden City,5.0,,"I often bring my two girls here to feed the fish at least 2-3 times per month. You can either buy capsules of fish food for S$1 each or bring your own - we come here often enough that we bring our own! There are many places to feed the fish and we always have a great time trying to feed the turtles instead of the greedy catfish. Once, we even saw a 2-meter long monitor lizard swimming in Swan Lake.

We also bring my daughters' little scooters for them to get some exercise as the paths are wide and allow joggers, pedestrians and little girls scootering on them, all at the same time! Parking is plentiful, and food and drink can be had at Food For Thought which serves good breakfasts during the weekends."
,,Standard for the world,5.0,,"Singapore's nationald botanical gardens are a fantastic way to spend some time. They are exquisitely maintained, and the presentation is awesome. They are equally paired with the National Orchid Gardens, both of which make a fantastic outing. Coupled with the new futuristic Gardens by the Bay, Singapore is ""THEE"" city for greenery, gardens, and cleanliness. Enjoy!"
,,Serene,4.0,,"We spent half a day walking through the gardens and also the National Orchid Gardens. The Gardens are beautiful and very peaceful. This is not normally an activity I would do but one that was enjoyed by me and my family, highly recommended."
,,Love the place,4.0,,The Botanic Gardens are definitely worth visiting. Take a stroll and enjoy the tropical atmosphere. Check online before going whether you could even combine your visit with an open air concert on the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage. By the way: the al fresco terrace of the Halia Restaurant is a good place to rest and have a drink. And you should not miss the National Orchid Garden too (the entrance is next to the Halia).
,,UNESCO Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"No wonder it is an UNESCO heritage site. Trust me. With different garden theme and lots to offer to individuals, couples, friends and family with diverse interests. Watch out for evolution garden (photographer delight), healing garden (health conscious), fragrant garden, foliage garden, orchid garden etc. Sat free guided tours are also thrown in for those keen to find out more e.g. healing garden tour (1st week), rainforest tour (2nd week), orchid garden tour (3rd week), heritage tour (4th week)."
,,Just Ok,3.0,,"Many many different kinds of trees, flowers and etc. but quite boring. If you passionate of green then must go :)"
,,Searching for beautiful places,4.0,,"Nice place to stroll,jog, run... the day when you need to clear the stress of the week that passed. Been there several times. Brought some of my friends on some occasions, attended a birthday celebration as well, Mostly I stroll by my self."
,,Another beautiful botanic garden,4.0,,"This has the advantage over Gardens by the Bay of being fully mature and obviously has been allowed to mature and develop fairly naturally. Having said that, there were themed gardens and the Orchid House for a small payment, was well worth seeing. The signage was a little confusing at times but we did manage to navigate ourselves round quite well and see all that this oasis in a busy city had to offer. Highlight? Possibly the healing garden."
,,Great place to walk,5.0,,"Recently recognized as a UNESCO world heritage sight, this garden has so much to offer. The best part is that its free and you can spend as much time as you like. There is so much to explore. Do look out for the free performances that are held at the gardens at the Shaw Foundation symphony stage. Visit the orchid gardens at a small fee and visit the Jacob Ballas children for free where there is a playground and water play area. Adults have to be accompanied by a child 12 years or younger to gain entry into the children's garden."
,,Beautiful gardens to adventure around,5.0,,"This is a beautiful garden with a wide variety of flora. Everything is well kept and it's a nice pace away from the city. Bring a water bottle and some lunch to really take your time and enjoy it. I think we spent 4 hours exploring and favourites were lying in the grass in Palm Valley, the Rain Forest walk and feeding fish and turtles at Symphony Lake. Really relaxing, easily accessible right by the station and well worth the visit!"
,,Good place to walk and relax,5.0,,Excellent place to relax and walk about. You can enjoy the greenery and fresh air. For dog lovers you can see dogs or bring your dogs here for a stroll. Easily accessible via mrt.
,,a beautiful place to roam around and get clean air,5.0,,"Coming from Jakarta we are always looking for a good way to get our nature fix. The gardens are highly recommended as a beautiful place to roam around, breathe some clean air and relax. It was also fun to see all the locals getting out to enjoy the space."
,,Unique Gardens,4.0,,Many varied gardens. The orchid garden was the most memorable. So many colorful varieties. Many named for famous people who visited the gardens. The healing garden was interesting.
,,A must see and an escape,5.0,,If you have a couple of hours to kill and don't mind the heat (unless you viist early morning) then this a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore
,,Nice morning walk,5.0,,Came by mrt to the botanic gardens station and the gardens entrance is just right next to it ! Walked in a nice cool morning breeze but come with insect repellant. Like the lake and so much greenery everywhere.
,,Excellent Venue,4.0,,This is a place for both locals and tourists to enjoy. The landscaping is top class and the gardens are perfectly manicured. This is an example of what Singapore does best. Good for exercising or just a relaxing stroll for both families and individuals. The restaurants there are good but somewhat pricey. I like it best when they have free concerts and you can just lie on the lawn to enjoy the concert.
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens - UNESCO Heritage Site,5.0,,"This is one of the loveliest botanical gardens in the world! Luscious greenery, beautiful blossoms (check out the Orchid Gardens), giant tropical trees - truly a wonderful garden in a city state.

Meet people on their morning jogs, walks, Tai chi, yoga, etc. See newly married taking outdoor photos in the park. A dog friendly park.

Easily accessible by public transport. Explore the kids' garden and end up with a coffee/meal in the cafe."

,,"Large beautiful park, relaxing",5.0,,"The park was recently named the unesco heritage site. Lots of plants, trees and flowers in the park. Great place for a walk and picnic."
,,Orchid Lovers,5.0,,It is a very well kept garden complete with all types of plant collection. The focal point is the Orchidarium and you just can't stop taking pictures of the orchids as each variety seems to be more beautiful than the next. It is no wonder that the Singapore Botanical Garden is now a world heritage garden. There is no fee to enter with a small restaurant and a souvenir gift shop. Perfect place to get away from the bustle and easy to get there by public transportation. We much enjoyed walking through the garden.
,,The orchid garden is a must,4.0,,"This is a well known attraction in Singapore. It has a large easily accessible pathways and is scrupulously manicured it a style and with the attention to detail you would expect from Singapore. Nice day out for a stroll around, there are shaded areas to find relief from the sun on hot days. Cafes, gift shops and toilets with drinking fountains are easily found. I do urge you to visit the orchid garden and take a good camera with you. The colours and varieties are all here. I have already earmarked a few photos that that I intend to have framed when I return home."

,,A Tranquil Oasis in the City,5.0,,We visited the Singapore Botanic Gardens in January 2016. We were so pleased we took the time to visit the Gardens; they stretch over 2.5km from North to South and contain so many species of beautiful flora and fauna to please every visitor.
,,Great place to walk,3.0,,"Love nature? This is the place for you. Make sure you bring water with you, the walks maybe tiring but don't worry you may quit when you want! Overall a good place to distance yourself from the noisy and crowded city of Singapore."
,,Great place for reading books and picnic,4.0,,I usually spend time in this place reading books or having picnic with family or friends. Best place to have picnic is near the Symphony Stage which most of the time have a free performance which you could enjoy.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"So much bigger than expected. Take plenty of water. Parking was cheap, plentiful and easy to access. We wandered around symphony lake and also did the orchid garden for a small fee and the healing garden for free.

There are wide, smooth paths, options around stairs and plenty of shade and seats.

Pick up a map at the gate when you enter so you can find the toilets."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Although there is a lot of building work on the approach to the Botanical Gardens it is well worth the effort. The National Orchid Garden is definitely worth allowing some time for. It is possibly the best orchid display anywhere in the World. The lake with the stage in the centre is worth enjoying particularly if a concert is taking place. It can take a good 2 hours to explore. For the inner person there are restaurants and cafes to be enjoyed.
,,Peaceful walk through beauty,5.0,,"The botanic gardens is a great place to go for a walk or run and see a lot of variety. We even came across a meter long monitor lizard. Take a picnic lunch if you plan to stay a while, and don't miss the orchids."

A huge parc, well provided with all kinds od tropical plants and trees in a very natural setting . Especially the Orchid garden is a must see. Advisable to visit in the morning when the temperature is still acceptable."

,,Oasis in the city,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a tranquil oasis in the city, peaceful and big enough not to feel crowded even on weekends. You do not hear any traffic from nearby roads. Also, it's free of charge (except for the Orchid Garden which is worth paying the entrance fee). Monitor lizards of all sizes roam Botanic Gardens, with a bit of luck you will spot one or several. Botanic Gardens is easily accessible by MRT (exit at the equally named station)."
,,Great place for a run,4.0,,Want to enjoy some great sites while you do a little cardio? This is a great spot to just be active and enjoy these beautiful gardens. From the St. Regis its just about a 10 minute jog.
,,Nice way to spend your afternoon,5.0,,You can't miss the ORCHID GARDENS. Singapore's national flower is the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid. And these gardens are absolutely lovely. So many places to take photos - you don't even need a filter to make them look good.

,,a pleasant day out,4.0,,"Caught the 106 bus from the city and was here in 15 minutes, great. This attraction is free and has recently been added to the UNESCO World Heritage list; and deservedly so. Clean, wide paths, not too steep paths, very friendly and relaxing. This is must do activity while in Singapore.

Watch for the squirrels in the gardens and don't forget to feed the fish and the turtles at the entrance."
,,Beautiful and relaxing,5.0,,"Met friends for lunch here and a stroll through the gardens. If you're looking for lush greenery, interesting plants, tranquility away from the shops in Orchard Road and some peace and quiet this is highly recommended. If you're from the UK look out for the black swans too!"
,,Must go here!,5.0,,"This is the most wonderful, clean and peaceful place to be to get out of the bustle of the city. Different areas for different plants, healing plants etc. A really great place to be."

Impeccably clean, beautiful, lush terrain, friendly people and a diamond paradise in Singapore. Take your time and enjoy these gardens. We certainly did today!"

,,Beautiful and full of variety,5.0,,A large garden free of charge which has a real variety of interest to suit all ages and garden interests

,,Beautiful botanical gardens,5.0,,Easy to access. Free entry. Lovely visit spoiled a bit by the annual haze. The orchard garden is a very worthwhile a visit.
,,Outstanding Walk amongst Nature,5.0,,"One of my favourite places in Singapore, this place is like a quite Oasis during the day away from the noise of the downtown. Amazing for a morning or evening walk, it allows a great outing for the family."
,,Great place to relax with the kids- for free!,5.0,,I took my 3 kids here to enjoy some cool lush surrounds- Singapore can get a little hectic! We loved exploring - and since I grew up in the tropics I was able to teach my kids about some of the plants . The hardest bit would be the long walking distances- which were hard on my youngest- also as they weren't used to the humidity. It was great to find a small water play area near a large sand pit- all the small children were playing in the fountains (built for this purpose)- as we had our swimming gear with us (always take it just in case!) the children spent about 2 hours playing in the water having a great time while I lay on a bench and watched- perfect!
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"In the middle of the city this place is amazing, real nature, the entrance is free of charge, but don't miss also the Orchid garden inside, only 5 dollars fee but amazing place"
,,A beautiful park even for non botanists,4.0,,"With as many trees and shrubs as you can imagine in a Botanic Garden in the Tropics and vistas which catch the eye even of the most uninterested landscaper these gardens are a must and you can spend as much, or as little time there as you wish. Definitely worth a visit and an enjoyable walk for most."
,,plants and flowers,4.0,,Very nice place to have a walk even if your just cutting through to Orchard Rd. A thing to do in Singapore
,,Get away from the shops,5.0,,"If you have had enough retail therapy, then take two hours off and visit the gardens. Absolutely stunning and well worth the visit. The orchideas are a dream. Take a walk around the lake and visit the or orchideas gardens and rain forest .

Nice and flow, but taxis are a pain. We had to wait thirty minutes."
,,Kids park is great,4.0,,"I just wanted parents who looking for something to do with kids that this is a great place with a kids area, BUT the kids area is at the far end of the park from Orchard Road. We were thrilled when we finally arrived - tree house slides, pond, small splash pad, etc. But, having walked two kids through the entire park, they were done before they even arrived. Please note there is a small cafe at the kids park, as well."
,,Great nature display!,5.0,,The garden was simply stunning - you enjoy a nice walk through the attraction. It was clean and well kept. Recommended for all.
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"The gardens ,apart from the amazing Orchids ,were a bit disappointing .Big trees that we have seen in many other botanical gardens of the world ,it has a quite nice area where a few bonsai have been displayed but the rest is not worth a visit unless you feel like walking or jogging in a quiet area."
,,Very peaceful,5.0,,"These gardens are so restful, peaceful and beautiful. The gardens are a lovely place to spend an hour or all day, just sit and listen to the bird song or take a stroll along one of the many paths and see where it leads you. Look out for beautiful birds along the way."
,,Weekend,4.0,,A pleasant place for walking around and also for slight break from Singapore. People are relaxed and a place where you can eat in peace.
,,A lovely respite in the midst of the city.,5.0,,This garden is so well designed and cared for. We spent an entire morning there (best time to go). We also had lunch in an excellent cafe on the grounds. It is all beautiful. Many wonderful photo ops.
,,Don't miss Botanic Gardens!,5.0,,"These gardens are huge and beautiful. I was there for almost 3 hours and only got through maybe 1/2 of it, but then again I was taking lots of pictures. Immaculate. Beautiful. Peaceful. The morning started with lots of people walking or running. Later on the families came and some tour from schools. Still quiet and worthwhile. I will be going back the next time I'm in Singapore. Just delightful."
,,Highlight of our trip,5.0,,"We had an amazing visit here, starting with a presentation on the history of the Gardens and followed by a guided tour. The quiet beauty of the Gardens cannot be overstated. The calmness and serenity in the midst of a huge urban center is so welcome."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Wherever it is, botanical gardens are not to be missed. This one is no exception. Spanning across a few acres it covers all the varieties of plants and trees and flowers."

,,The place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"This place is just a treasure to be visited. Many areas are planted more than 100 years ago. Enjoy the ""rain forest"" walk"
,,Nature Sanctuary,5.0,,Don't just visit the National Orchid Garden. Talk a walk in the Rain Forest. Travel back in time at Evolution Garden. Have a picnic with the black swans along Eco Lake. Go for a job along the Red Brick Path. You will not be disappointed.
,,One word... WOW,4.0,,A must to anyone visiting Singapore. The site is free ans you only need to pay to enter the Orchid Garden at $5 per adult. Bring your lunch and make sure to visit the rain forest trail
,,Relaxing Place in Singapore,5.0,,"We arrived very early to Singapore ( 6am) and this gardens were the best idea to start our day early.

Gardens are open from 6 am and you don't have to pay a entrance fee!

The park is huge and there are some cafes in the venue.

We visited Orchid gardens and its worth to visit ( entrance fee was 5 singapore dollars)

I recommend you to go there by taxi ( taxi fees are not that high in Singapore compared to Europe!)"
,,Beautiful and relaxing,5.0,,"Take the hop-on, hop-off bus to get here. It's beautiful. You can walk through it for free. Take your time. Take your lunch. Relax and enjoy the beauty. It's simple and very diverse."
,,Best botanical gardens,5.0,,"Beautifully maintained green space and FREE. We did pay the 10singapore dollars to visit the orchid gardens within the botanical gardens and this was well worth the price. Such an array of beautiful orchids.
The gardens are huge so you need at least 2 hours but more if you can spare it. The hop on hop off red bus drops you right in the car park and it's just 2 minutes walk into the gardens. There are eating places and toilets inside the entrance but take a bottle of water when walking around."
,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are the most beautiful and best kept I have ever seen. Orchids, Ginger Garden, Heritage Trails...and so much more. The gardens are close to Orchard Road so easy to get to. Wear comfortable shoes because it is so gorgeous here you walk for miles to see everything. This really is a ""Must See"" as other Trip Advisor reviewers have said. A real 5 star attraction."
,,Great place for a wonder and chill,4.0,,I thought it was really good. I enjoyed just wondering around the paths. It didn't feel like you were in a city which made it relaxing and peaceful
,,wonderful way to spend a relaxed sunday afternoon....,4.0,,Beautiful gardens for chllining out - Eatery choices to relax in or kiosk options. An oasis of green including optional Orchid Garden.
,,Beautifully manicured gardens with good facilities,5.0,,Beautifully manicured and maintained botanic gardens with a good snack bar for refreshments. Amazingly there is no entrance charge to this lovely facility - a tranquil oasis in busy Singapore. The Botanic Gardens MRT stop is right next to one of the park entrances so access is very easy. A great place to spend at least half a day on a stopover.
,,Amazing place!,5.0,,One of the best botanical garden I have been. Very educational! Loved the roses garden and the medicinal garden. Easy to walk around eventhough it is a big property. Free entrance is a plus! Fee to be applied for the roses garden.
,,"A ""must visit"" in Singapore",5.0,,"The botanic garden is huge - about half the size of Kew Gardens - so on a hot day (are there cool ones in Singapore?) it would be difficult to see it all. But from the main entrance onwards it is just stunning. A mixture of jungle, tropical trees green open spaces etc. Paths are well maintained and disabled friendly. Look out for the (non aggressive) giant lizards in the undergrowth. It must rate as one of the best in the world. And it s free!!"
,,A bit of peace & quiet,5.0,,"Located relatively close to Orchard Roaf shopping district, the botanic gardens is an expansive array of areas dedicated to preserving & displaying plant life from around the world. Multitudes of meandering paths criss-cross the grounds leading to lakes, streams, greenhouses, & plant specific gardens. Of special note is the Hibiscus Garden containing a plentiful array of hibiscus & similar plantlife. Cost is 5 SGD. Due to the physical size of the gardens I suggest taking the MRT to the Nortern entrance of the garden &, after working your way through the park, exiting from the Southern entrance onto Napier Street, where you can easily catch a public bus. Or vice versa. This will save you doubling back. Highly recommended."
,,Beautifully maintained,5.0,,"Although it was raining the day I went , had a great time ! When it rained 3 or 4 strangers huddled under a shelter and we all started to talk , what a great opportunity to reflect on everyone's opinion and excitement !"
,,A huge area to wander around,5.0,,Easy to get to by public transport and then to walk around. Many different styles of gardens and they feature plants from many parts of the world. well worth a visit as it is very peaceful.
,,Green walk in the city,5.0,,"This is amazing and free of charge experience (only Orchid garden asks for entrance fee, which is 5 SGD :-)). I enjoyed my Sunday walk, with a bit of music (that day tehre were rehearsing before a big classical concert) so it was double relaxing."
,,Lovely for a stroll,3.0,,"Enjoyable, and there are some pretty nice sections. Try to go before dusk, as the lights come on once the sun goes down so you get to enjoy the park in the light and fading sun. It's free too, which is great for us budget travellers."
,,Lovely green space,5.0,,"A place for peace of mind, if you want to see a calm and slow life in Singapore.

I love how well preserved this garden is, it's clean and really relaxing POI after you spend a day at bustling downtown or Orchard roroad. I went there using MRT so I also had a chance to see the tranquil living area and the cozy coffee place opposite the station."
,,Enjoyable walk and good bird watching!,5.0,,Singapore has such nice outdoor space and its also well maintained. We enjoyed walking from one part of the city to another through the gardens. I spotted some good wildlife too with a hornbill and a monitor lizard!
,,A lovely peaceful place to visit,5.0,,"There are some lovely and interesting plants and trees in the garden, worth a visit. We really enjoyed walking around here although we did feel that the signs were a bit hit and miss in trying to find your way round.

The park is well visited but you never feel crowded though. Easy to get to from the station."
,,Perfect to see the nature,5.0,,They multiple types of Orchards. One should spent 2-3 hours at this attraction. any time less then this is not worth
,,Nice place for a stroll,4.0,,This is a nice collection of gardens and good for an afternoon stroll while waiting for the light show
,,Green Peace,3.0,,"A peaceful green area in a Garden City . It's extensive , so you'll need at least half a day to see a good part of it ....... and this can be exhausting in the heat and humidity if ( like us ! ) you happen to be a ''mature'' couple . But there are shady ares in which one can sit and relax , and there are food outlets for those needing them .
We found it wasn't the easiest place to get to , or away from . Although there are buses, we decided to take a taxi from near Orchard Station to the nearest entrance to the Orchid Garden , which we explored over a couple of hours . We then took another couple of hours ambling/exploring southwards through the Botanic Gardens in the general direction of the main Tanglin Gate . Here there is an acceptable little restaurant , and the very helpful staff at the Information Desk phoned for a taxi to take us back to Orchard ."
,,A MUST SEE in Singapore,5.0,,One of the most amazing Btanical Gardens in the world. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and rightfully so. Acres and acres of amazing landscape installations. Do not miss the Orchid Gardens. There is a separate charge for it but well worth it. Singapore is essentially one giant rainforest and humidity can be debilitating so bring lots of water with you and an ice towel from your hotel if you can. We spent about 4 hrs wondering about and probably only saw 25% of it.
,,Green paradise,5.0,,Orchid garden and children's park are my favorites. Landscapes are outstanding too for relaxing or jogging.
,,Lovely place to visit.,5.0,,This was a beautiful and lovely place to visit and the gardens are spotless and kept very clean. Singapore is a very clean place and you don't see any rubbish on the ground.
,,Wonderful orchid garden!,5.0,,We really loved our visit to the botanical garden and the highlight was definitely the beautiful orchid garden - so many exotic species. There is a good cafe to cool off when you've been round the site. Highly recommended.
,,Take some time to explore!,5.0,,We really enjoyed strolling through the botanic gardens but as it was directly after a flight from Europe we will need to go back to truly appreciate everything on offer. I took so many photos and I've enjoyed looking back over them to see what I missed with my tired eyes!
,,BOTANIC GARDENS,5.0,,This is an ideal picnic spot in the heart of the city with lush greenery and lakes. It's really green and peaceful..There are some live orchestra shows which happens here but you need to check the timings in advance...
,,Peaceful and beautiful,5.0,,"This is a spectacular garden - well designed and maintained. We only ended up walking about half of it as we had done so much walking already and the humidity finally defeated us! (but it means we will just have to come back). Some really well presented gardens, interesting fish in the lakes, and just great to walk around. The Orchid Garden which is in the botanic gardens is also worth a visit ($5). We got to see a big monitor lizard (?) go for a swim which was really cool."
,,One of the nicest places on the Island,5.0,,"We lived there for five years and this spot was near to home, we loved it lovely walks and facilities there, try it yourself."
,,Beatiful!,5.0,,"Very nice park to take a walk and see the flowers and nature. With a large variaty of plants and trees and also small animal. We saw people jogging, practicing sports, tai-chi, walking around. good to go with children"
,,Taken away by the beauty and peacefulness,5.0,,This is such a beautiful and peaceful place to visit. Do not think you a visit the Gardens in half a day. It took me a whole day to experience the entire gardens
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"SUBLIME. I was lucky enough to visit the garden on my first day in Singapore and couldn't help but return 3 more times before my trip home. The Singapore Botanic Gardens was honored last year as an UNESCO World Heritage Site (only 1 of 3 gardens have been granted that distinction along with England's Kew Gardens and Italy's Padua Gardens). The Park is organized into 3 ""cores"": Tanglin (the oldest part of the garden; heritage core;Swan Lake), Central (tourist belt;National Orchid garden, ginger garden), and Bukit Timuh (educational; Eco Lake, children's garden). All parts of the gardens are connected by looping pathways so there are multiple ways to get to any one destination. You feel completely separated from the skyscrapers and bustle of the city even though the Garden is located a mere 5 minutes from the busy Orchid Rd."
,,Amazing parc,5.0,,"You want to spend a half or a full day walking in a beautifull park? that's the spot. In addition, go for a walk in the native jungle at the Reservoir"
,,Best Free Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,Spent a very peaceful hot afternoon walking the gardens. Beautifully maintained and very user friendly. We wish we had more time to spend more time in the gardens but we were on a time limit. Next time in Singapore will visit again and allow more time
,,Well Designed Garden,4.0,,Very Well Designed this garden. We can see here huge varietied of plants. It based on out of the city and perfect place to visit in weekends with family. Its has different views of the garden such a beautifull place . Weather is not that much good but we were enjoyed the nature of beauty.... Must go there and enjoy
,,A nice way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"This park is ENORMOUS! Beautiful and well cared for. This is not a quick stroll, so come prepared to spend at least 3 or 4 hours enjoying the beautiful scenery."
,,fabulous gardens,5.0,,A must see if are interested in gardens...the orchid garden (a small fee)is the best I have seen. There is a ginger garden and several others. Food is available..and good. If go in afternoon an umbrella is needed as showers are common.
,,The only place for peace & quiet in Singapore,5.0,,"The Botanical gardens of S'pore are a must visit when in Singapore. It feels like this is the only non-materialistic place in Singapore that not money driven.

What's great is that you can visit the gardens for free and hopefully it will remain this way. It's a hidden gem of peace & quiet. I wish S'pore had more places like this."
,,a very big place full of grasses,3.0,,not a lot of interesting flowers and most just come for picnic and excursion cause the admission is free. drink stalls and vending machines are very few and weather is too hot to really cover the whole place...
,,"Very lovely concept, world class",5.0,,"This is an oasis , a haven in a busy city. Very well designed ( as is everything in Singapore) vast, with lakes and walking areas and a lovely cafe. One can see a huge variety of plants, water plants, orchids, nature, geese and have fresh air while you laze around.
Perfect place to relax and have fun with family. Next time we will take pics and put them here."
,,Rain in the Rain Forest!,4.0,,We were rained on in the rain forest and were protected under the canopy cover for a short time till the rain stopped! The gardens offered many unique exhibits including the orchard garden with dedicated VIP orchards showing historical value. Overall another relaxing and informative place to visit.
,,Has to be the best place in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is impressive in many ways, but as a city state one would be forgiven for thinking it is an urban jungle. The Botanic Gardens puts this perception to rest. It is truly sublime. We visited on a day when there was a tropic downpour, but this just added to its appeal. There is a great food court and the gardens themselves are a marvel of organisation and beauty. Don't miss the Orchid Gardens which is a separate attraction."
,,A calm quiet sanctuary,5.0,,"Such a beautiful, peaceful patch of green in a large city. Beautifully landscaped - a vista around every turn in the path. Breathtaking!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"I spent a week in Singapore and second only to the food this is the best experience there. Huge park that you could probably visit 25 times and still discover something new. Animals, plants and history in a great atmosphere.

,,Oasis of Green,4.0,,"Singapore's only UNESCO world heritage site is an oasis of green in the middle of very urban surroundings. Comprised of many small gardens like Ginger garden, Orchid Garden and foliage garden - it is a excellent to walk amidst nature. Crowded with expats walking their dogs all over, is need lot of endurance to do it one day.

If you have time split your visits to Botanic gardens - see couple of gardens a day. Go early morning, gardens are open from 5 AM onwards."

The highlight of the Garden is most assuredly the Orchid Garden contained within. The variety of Orchids is like no other we have ever seen before.

We highly recommend this as part of your Holiday experience in Singapore.

Have included some pictures in this review."
,,Beautiful Place,4.0,,"You will see variety of plants, birds and animals here. Great view for picture taking. Singapore is tropical country, so expect that it's a bit hot during daytime, choose what you will wear wisely. Wear comfortable shoes/slippers. Just be prepared that you will be walking couple of kilometers around. Bring a tumbler or bottles, there are free drinking fountain inside. Selfie stick is a must-have. Haha"

,,Lovely garden,4.0,,Nice place.beautiful and well maintained garden.very huge.Do not miss the orchid garden.It is very lovely!
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,One of our favourite places to visit in Singapore..you can easily spend a day here viewing all of the gardens and there is a well stocked cafe for drinks and snacks or a meal for lunch. The map can be a little hard to follow at times but there are plenty of signs to help you get back on track.
,,Lovely!,5.0,,This is just lovely. Make sure you take a blanket and a picnic and just chill. It was so nice and peaceful and easily accessible by the MRT. Definitely worth the trip.
,,Fantastic and free.,5.0,,There is a wonderful range of interesting and unusual plants for the plant lover. You can just wander about and relax in the charming atmosphere away from the hustle and bussle of the city.
,,SG Botanic gardens,4.0,,"One of the green space in singapore. Lot of flowers, plants and it is a very large space to discover. When i was there, i found a little chipmunk run across the trees. Very relaxing and peacefull"
,,One of the Best. A Singapore Must Do,5.0,,Gorgeous gardens in the garden city. The orchid garden is particularly brilliant. And easy day out. Just take a tax. The hop on hop off buses get expensive if you have 3 or more
,,Hmm ee but not really worth it,2.0,,"Very disappointed with this, Sure they are free but the signs and the map DO NOT match, it is very confusing to try and walk around. Many of the plants do not have labels and a couple of staff we asked had no idea . Food and water was EXTREMELY expensive at the central food 'stalls/restaurants' the items in the gift shops were very expensive and not value for money.The orchid garden there is no where except the at entrance that says it cost money to enter."
,,Average Garden,3.0,,"I reached to this garden via Hop On bus (yellow line). This garden is very simple and entry is free. Garden has sign boards but not enough to guide easily. Garden has few restaurant also with selected food. Inside this garden you'll find National Orchid garden, Healing garden and small theater few more gardens."
,,Orchids,4.0,,"Just a brief visit with time to visit the orchid garden. I never knew there was so many variety's. It was very informative, a great attraction."
,,Gardner's Dream,5.0,,These gardens are just beautiful and is a must do if you like orchards especially. Very interesting and when you think you've seen something special then something else appears. This is a must do if you love gardening.
,,Never disappoints.,5.0,,"Every time we come to Singapore we visit the Botanic Gardens. It's a beautiful place with so much to see. It's beautifully cared for with lots of space for people to walk, jog, play with their children and relax with a book. Although much of it remains the same - the lakes and the walks - we frequently discover areas we have not seen before. I know that we will keep returning."
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,A beautiful big tropical garden. It features one of the few rainforest areas left in Singapore and the most wonderful orchid garden. There was a jazz by the lake concert happening while we were there which unobtrusively added to our enjoyment. More time and a picnic on one of the many grassed areas would have made it a perfect visit.
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,Have now visited these gardens twice with friends. They are a great way to spend a few hours. You can watch the numerous exercise classes that are in the mornings. A few nice places to grab a drink as well.
,,Attractive point for tourists,3.0,,Various of.plants including some of them people hever heard of... Regarding biological diversity maybe it's not a good idea to collecting so many species with potential risk of hybrid mixes...anyway it's a fantastic place for learning and spend leisure day with friends.
,,Cool walk,4.0,,"Very pretty, very clean, lovely cool walks on a humid day (what other sort is there in Singapore!). Lots of wildlife (monkeys,lizards, birds, etc) and a nice reasonably priced cafe/restaurant in the middle.
Not far from the middle of town so easy to get to and easy to get a cab back.
Definitely recommended."
,,Great escape from CBD,4.0,,Extensive gardens that are well laid out and highlight tropical plants. Great area to relax and recuperate from the hustle & bustle of downtown.
,,relaxing environment,5.0,,"This is a huge garden where you can see all sorts of plants , which are very fascinating. There's also a large lake inside , where you can see different fishes and the beautiful group of swans"
,,Impressive and relaxing,5.0,,"Visited these gardens on a warm day, but still easy to get around. Impressive statuary, much of which has been donated. Wonderful plants and trees and the whole area is astonishingly tidy while not feeling overly manicured. A definite must do to make a change from city sightseeing."
,,Singapore Orchards Sensation,5.0,,"A lot of you have visited Singapore perhaps more than once. The Botanic Garden, reachable by train, is a huge area of tranquillity. You can spend ours walking or picnicking in this park. Thanks to the very tropic climate all the plants are lash green. But the Gem of this park lies within it, the BEST ever seen ""Orchard Garden"" one can imagine. Just the variety of different coloured orchards, not to mention the many different shapes of orchards you can admire, leaves you breathless. Your heart jumps for joy, your face will be shining and most of all, your camera will be non-stop
running hot. Don't forget to take close-up shots or in clusters. You will thank me for reminding you to visit this amazing garden where Nature is the King. Do ENJOY
Rudi
."
,,So little time...,5.0,,"I had hoped to spend an afternoon strolling the grounds and enjoying a picnic. Sadly my errands took longer than expected. I toured as much as I could enroute to/from the orchid gardens in the two hours I had before leaving town.

The grounds are well maintained and there are placards detailing the various plants, trees, foliage, etc. There are numerous signs as well as brochures with maps so it would be difficult to get lost. Lots of benches for sitting and enjoying the views. Staff is friendly and helpful.

Handicap-accessible and just steps from an MRT station (or two) and a bus stop.

I hope to visit Singapore again and if so, I will come back here. I know my dorm mate spent two days here. I can understand why as it is so peaceful. I also saw a girl running around the park. That's a great idea!"
,,Beautiful!!!!,5.0,,"Best gardens I have ever experienced!!! They have a medicinal garden featuring plants and herbs beneficial to the health of all body parts and ailments, with information provided for each plant. They have an evolving garden which is very educational, and even more impressive....a fragrant garden!!!! An absolute delight to the senses. The gardens are so tranquil and quiet. If you like frangipani then you will also love the gardens featuring an abundance of frangipani.
Not being much of a shopper, I generally avoid souvenir shops, however due to the high humidity, we had a quick respite in the souvenir shop and unexpectantly bought really high quality souvenirs. I recommend anyone going to Singapore to save their time by going straight to the souvenir shop at the botanical gardens to buy their souvenirs. Along with the high quality, there is an excellent variety. Best souvenirs in all my travels."
,,My number one garden,5.0,,"Spent the whole day there, it's huge, excellent plantings, well labelled, it's free and very well cared for with lots of gardeners about. Has the added bonus of the Orchid garden which is well worth visiting for $5 or $1 if 60!
On par with Kew, my number one in the world. Only downside, being so large and wanting to see everything, it's that good, my feet gave out before I'd finished!! Also see Orchid garden review."
,,Botanical Bonanza,5.0,,"A most calming and relaxing way to spend half a day. Tai Chi groups, Amazing plants and animals. Would love to spend longer here, perhaps next time."
,,A treasure trouve for plant lovers,4.0,,It is a place to know how the nature looks like.All the trees and plants made me fresh.I think it's a nice place for a picnic.
,,Beautiful day out with family,5.0,,"My wife and I took my mother-in-law and young daughter to the botanical gardens for a day out. We only expected to be there for 3-4 hours but ended up staying for nearly 10 hours.

The orchid garden was phenomenal even people who only have a slight appreciation for flowers would be blown away the the beauty and splendour of Singapore Botanical Gardens.

To cap off an absolutely wonderful day the Israeli philharmonic orchestra played Valvadi' Four Seasons in a free concert.

A truly wonderful day."
,,"Nice place for friends, couples, kids et al",4.0,,"Lovely place to spend few hours. One can run, jog, play games, frisbee, picnic it out with kids, or just chase butterflies. Lotsa open space wih greenery all around - what Singapore is known for. My toddler was all excited to see turtles in the water crawl towards him, lovely sounds of birds, a music concert that's free played at the symphony theatre- amazing sound. Get your Mat, picnic baskets, sandals and you're ready for a lovely time!"
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Beautiful garden. Huge, huge place. Definitely too hot for lunch. We went before 12 noon and we melted! Best time to go is very early in the morning or late in the afternoon when it's cooler. We were not able to walk leisurely as my daughter just wanted to be carried. It was seriously too hot. We missed so many spots. Took the MRT from Bugis and walked through the garden to get to the main entrace at Tanglin gate & took the bus going back to VIllage Hotel. On our next trip, I would prefer to take the bus to start at the main gate & stroll around then end at the gate near the MRT station. There is also a children's park where kids could play at the fountain and get wet so bring extra clothing for them."
,,It was nice for a walk,3.0,,"It's a nice area for a picnic and a stroll, there's a lot of green area but I think the national orchid garden was the best part in my opinion!"
,,"Green, Beautiful and peaceful",5.0,,"Botanic gardens are extremely well maintained. As soon as you enter you know how nature looks like. All the trees and plants make up for beautiful surroundings. They are well situated near Botanic Garden MRT although on their site they suggest to come from Orchard MRT. It is really hot and humid during rainy season which is almost all the time. Be sure to carry an umbrella there. Also, make sure you don't have any allergies with certain plants. My wife touched a plant and she got allergic reaction."
,,A beautiful start to the day,4.0,,"The Singapore botanical gardens are must for any visitor to Singapore. It's a huge area of natural beauty right in the centre, only minutes walk from tanglin road. The orchids are spectacular and range from tiny delicate specimens up to those the size of plates. I didn't realise there were so many types, and all so stunning. There were tai chi classes taking place and anyone can join in. We also saw groups of runners but that was too energetic for us! Be sure to have your camera fully charged and plenty of room on your card as its hard to stop taking photos. The bromeliad house was really interesting and all the walkways brought something special. We didn't have time to stop for something to eat, however there are places suitable for anyone's taste. The shop at the entrance had a good range of gifts and I'd advice you to take an umbrella and enjoy every chance you have of visiting this wonderful garden."
,,Very beautiful garden,5.0,,Beautiful garden are must see while in Singapore. One of the best gardens I love ever seen. The garden is located in the close to the CBD and close to transport. Overall a must see while you are in Singapore.
,,An unmissable delight,5.0,,These spectacular gardens are beautifully maintained. There are many different areas. All have wonderfully informative signing. We never tire of walking in this green oasis of tranquillity.
,,A Great Post-Nuptial Photoshoot,4.0,,Singapore Botanic Gardens is now officially a UNESCO Heritage listed site! It is uniquely tranquil and lush green oasis in the middle of the busy city. This is one of the best location of a photo-shoot (like what we did). And the best part is: it's free !!!
,,Botanic gardens,4.0,,Great place but humidity makes it difficult to do justice to whole gardens. Taxis are not easy to get when leaving
,,Serenity in a metropolis,5.0,,"If you want to just get away from the busy streets of Singapore, this is the place. Large green fields, narrow lush walkways, it's got it all. To explore the entire park takes a couple of hours if you do it at an leasurely pace. It can get pretty hot so be sure to bring drinks and if you're going around sunset make sure you brought something against mosquitoes"
,,This is a must,5.0,,"If you are stopping over or holidaying in Singapore a visit to the Botanic Gardens should be on your list. Board a Hop on Hop off bus,see the city on your way then alight at the gardens. Walk through the entrance, enjoy a coffee at the excellent café then stroll for as long as you can along the paths enjoy the atmosphere then see the orchids.
You can visit shops anywhere but these gardens are not be missed"
,,fabulous!!!!,5.0,,"These gardens are wonderful with surpirses around every corner. One visit is just not enough. There's a 5 Singapore dollar entry fee to the orchid collection, a small price for such an utterly magical experience. Within the gardens there are areas devoted to rain forest plants as well as a tranquil lake. Look out also for the many coloured butterflies. Cannot recommend highly enough as a must see place."
,,It's huge! don't miss it.,5.0,,"Went here on a Sunday Afternoon. The gardens were full of family's and couples having picnics. We would have done the same but had limited time. In about an hour and a half we took in the beauty of the lake area, then walked through the ancient forest around to the other side with the healing garden. If you want to see it all you would need at least three hours and a lot of energy. It would probably be about a 5km loop from the train station, to the other end and back. I would suggest going in the late afternoon so it would turn into evening as the garden looked as though it may be illuminated at night. Toilets are also few and far between but you can always use the ones in the tube station."
,,Beautiful and peaceful.,5.0,,Visiting the Singapore Botanic Gardens and National Orchid Garden is a wonderful (but hot) way to spend a day. Just hydrate and make sure you bring a camera.
,,Awesome Place to Visit,5.0,,Singapore botanical garden is a wonderful place to visit with family. Its entry is free however one needs to buy tickets for the most beautiful Orchid garden. Worth seeing place and lovely moments to relax in beautiful green environment with intelligently planned landscaping. I liked the Healing garden also which provide plants helpful for cure of different diseases just by inhaling air close to them.
,,Lovely walk,5.0,,Massive gardens with all sorts of plants. Various themed gardens for those who are interested in certain areas.
,,Huge garden - You could spend days there,5.0,,"We concentrated on the orchid garden and spent more than 3 hours there before spending another 2 hours in the main garden and we only covered about 1/3 of the area of the entire garden. The outdoor environment in Singapore is hot and sticky so be prepared for the heat. That is what makes these plants grow in such amazing profusion. Hop-On, Hop-Off bus stops here."
,,Immaculate Gardens,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens open at 5 AM for the fitness fanatics, but it's easy to enjoy the gardens early in the day before the heat becomes oppressive. Wear comfortable shoes, as you'll be covering a lot of territory if you see it all. Everything is kept in perfect order--a treat for the senses."
,,The best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,The botanic gardens are a tropical paradise. Although we are not avid gardeners this was a beautiful place at zero cost to the entrants. There is a small charge for the orchid garden collection which is well worth visiting. Absolutely stunning.
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"We had a few hours spare one afternoon so we caught a train to the Botanic Gardens. What a splendid way to waste away the hours. There were people everywhere picnicing, having wedding photos taken or just simply taking in the beautiful surrounds. If you love nature, trees, flowers and some wildlife then this is the place to be. You can walk or if your a fitness lover run on the numerous paths and tracks. It's well worth the fee to enter the Orchard House and Garden. There are fabulous orchards throughout. Visit the fish pond and buy some of the fish food to feed the large fish and turtles. You will need a quite a few hours if you wish to see all the attractions. Recommend taking some water to keep hydrated."
,,Tourist visit,4.0,,Very nice and quiet place and - extremely clean and neat! Saw a rater big leguan close to the path. A nice visit in a capital fuld of life.
,,Good morning activity,5.0,,Go early as it gets hot.it is free so good for those on a budget. The orchid garden is extra but well worth the money.Again try to go early in the day unless you can stand the heat.
,,Orchid garden,5.0,,Never seen anything so beautiful. A must see for visitors. If you want to stay for lunch it is best to reserve. There was no room for walk-ins the day we were there
,,Singapore's oldest gardens.,5.0,,"- Tropical, ""English-style"" gardens with themed sections. - The National Orchid Garden in the premises features a well-presented collection of many orchid species. - Lots of wide walking paths to all areas of the Gardens."
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,Love this place. There is something to suit anyone who loves plants. Some beautiful trees. Also saw birds and very large lizards. A place of beauty in the city.
,,Lovely park for a walk,4.0,,We didn't spot many flowers but different kinds of trees and very nice paths for walking. There are a few very big lizards there so take care. There were people having photoshoots for their wedding there which was very nice to see.
,,It had the WOW factor in my opinion,5.0,,I loved the Botanic Gardens despite the heat. It is over 150 years old so lots of big trees and lots of shade. The Orchid Garden was amazing lots of different kinds and colours. There were plenty of places to get water and air conditioned gift shops when the heat got too much. Really relaxing and plenty to wander around. Will have to go back as one visit is not enough to do it justice. Had a taxi rank so was easy to get back to my hotel.
,,Botanic garden,5.0,,We spent whole afternoon enjoying this lovely garden. The walk is easy and interesting under trees. It's so peaceful in the center of city
,,Just a splendid walk through a tropical garden,5.0,,"A great park to stroll and wander through, full of extraordinary trees and plants, there is a large section just full of “bird of paradise” plants of different variations – and all for free!! The main draw is the National Orchid Gardens, which has an entrance fee of $5 or $1 if you are over 60 (and have proof). There are a large number of seats and covered seating areas to relax after walking in the high heat. Try and visit the mist house which contains a large number of orchids in a small area. The whole park is well maintained and the staff were very friendly. As has been said before but recommend you wear some comfortable footwear and bring water. If you visit the VIP orchid garden, you can see the orchid named after Princess Diana and the one named last year by the William and Kate. Public transport links are good although the MRT station is a bit out on a limb at one end of the park and then have to walk a bit of a distance.
If you are visiting Singapore I would highly recommend a visit to the park."
,,Brilliant... fantastic... no word are describing it properly,5.0,,"The very long walk, the rain shower were forgotten as soon as i got into this orchids paradise... Please take a minut if you have the chance to see the garden keepers so as to notice how they do produce this islands of colours"
,,Beautiful garden to spend an hour,4.0,,"The orchid garden was beautiful with many different varieties of orchids. It was well sign-posted and had different sections, the cool room, mist room etc. I spent an hour looking around and taking photos."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"The gardens were beautiful and very interesting to walk through. I live in America, so all of the plants were completely different from what we have at home. I felt like I was walking through the set of Jurassic Park! There are food options within the park which is good, but I would definitely recommend taking water and snacks if you go during the summer months!"
,,Green!,4.0,,It's beautiful with all the plants and everything. We saw lizards (I think?) Did not spend long there but liked it .
,,Paradise in the heart of city,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Garden is a great place to relax, enjoy and educate oneself on flora and fauna. It is huge and needs lots of walking to go from one section to another. I wanted to cover both lakes and they were far from each other. Though Singapore is warm and humid, walking under trees in the garden was not bad with nice breeze.Water is essential for such long walk. Good pair of walking shoes are also another need for the long walk and climbing steep places.Many people come in there in the late afternoon to enjoy. We took the SMRT and got down and Botanic Garden Station and the station was juts adjacent to the park. There are maps and road signs everywhere to take the preferred routes. We came here in 2013 and wanted to go back to this place and explored the ones which were not covered in our earlier visit."
,,Probably the best botanical garden one can see,5.0,,"The Botanic Garden were our must see spot in Singapore. They are simply amazing and even on a scorching hot day they offer great experience and an opportunity to cool down.

The access to the gardens is free, the plants beautiful and lush, one can wonder for hours around this large area of greenery and one can also have a picnic on a perfectly cut lawn.

The must see attractions are the two domes housing plants from different regions of the world and the cloud forest artificial mountain. Both are well worth visiting.

In the evening - at 7.45, there's a light show happening just by the main group of artificial trees. It is spectacular and yet again - free. Lying on the ground and watching how the massive tree towers lit up in variety of colours is an unforgettable experience, better even than the laser show from Marina Bay Sands."
,,Always Fresh and Great,4.0,,"Is a great garden to walk about, fresh and re-fresh. Besides, is FOC for going here and I always fancy the greens. Lots to learn here and good place to relax after a long week of work. Is easy not to to get starve as there are few restaurants around to be choose. Lovely garden and wonderful landmark. Easy access via mrt and bus. Love it!"
,,Rainforest,4.0,,The gardens are huge and take the form of a large public park. They contain an original piece of rainforest which is fascinating and awe inspiring.
,,The Ikea of Gardens,3.0,,"I suggest if you have kids, skip this. This is like an Ikea store. Don't get me wrong, it has a lot of exits, but most exits are not accessible to the metro or other forms of public transportation. Go here if you really looooove flowers and plants and you don't have such in the country you're originating from. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes. It is a bit of a hike going to the orchid areas so prepare yourself. Check the weather as well before going because your only shelter when it rains will be some trees and some structures that you come by every half a KM."
,,A must for a Singapore visit,5.0,,No charge! Stunning and peaceful within the heart of Singapore. Well laid out with shelter in case it rains. Such an amazing collection of plants together in one place. Wear comfy shoes and bring water - you will stay longer than you think. The Rainforest is a lovely shaded walk. Make sure you go to the Orchid garden ( 5 dollar charge but worth it - 1 dollar for OAPs but make sure you take evidence).
,,Great place to spend a relaxing day,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a great place to spend a relaxing day away from the heat of the city. They are easy to get to via the MRT or city tour buses and entry is free. The gardens are big enough to spend the entire day strolling around and the most interesting part is the orchid garden, which has an entry charge, but it's only S$1 for over 60s - amazing value not to be missed!"
,,Really good,5.0,,This is really one of the best botanic garden I have visited . This is declared a national heritage and has a lot to see . Best for photographers and play lovers and also peace lovers
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Impressive building, very cool construction. Beautiful plants. Quite an enchanting and relaxing place"
,,An oasis of calm,5.0,,"In a sea of Singapore frantic activity, the gardens offer a couple of hours (at least), where you can wander through the various different environments and watch the world go by. A number of fun cafes and restaurants within the gardens mean it is also a great place for lunch."
,,Peaceful educational,5.0,,This is a big area so make sure to have some walking shoes. This whole area is educational and interesting with the facts of how people found and used plants and flowers for some many different things. Don't forget the amazing perfume of the flowers.
,,Fantasy Gardens Abounding with Flora,5.0,,Take your walking shoes because the gardens are expansive and breathtaking. A great way to get some exercise for the day and to titillate your senses with the abundant variety of Asian flora and even fauna in these lovely gardens. Simply lovely. Carry a water bottle for it is truly humid and hot in Singapore and you will be exerting yourself.
,,Very well maintained,5.0,,"Very well maintained . If you are in Singapore , you must visit this place , Good for walk . Inside garden , small lake is also there . It was highly humid so walking was uncomfortable but enjoyed visit . Lovely place"
,,A serene oasis in the city,5.0,,"My favourite garden in the city to unwind and escape the hustle bustle of the world in a pleasant stroll or jog. Great for singles or families doing picnics on the grassy slopes. Regular concerts are scheduled.
Unfortunately, Singapore's humidity does take a toll so it's best to visit early morning or late afternoon."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"I can see why it is an UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are many gardens within the complex. The gardens are divided into different groups, i.e., rainforest, ginger, orchid, healing, heritage, etc. With the numerous varieties of plants in the gardens there is always some plant in bloom no matter the season. There are plants from all over the world. The sidewalks are wide. Easy access for strollers and wheelchairs."
,,A break from the city rush!,5.0,,"I have walked over 5,000 miles in this park over the last 7 years. I have enjoyed every step of the journey. During the week the part is almost empty until about 10am. Weekends it is chaos after 8am. Be watchful for kids on Razors/scooters as the part does not enforce their rules posted at the main entrances. It can be quit hazardous on weekends. Make sure to bring water and comfortable walking shoes. The park is over 3.5k in total and limited options for water/food. Take your camera! The front of the park/Tanglin entrance area is more picturesque than the Bukit Timah entrance area. Enjoy!"
,,"Beautiful,,,",5.0,,"Botanic Garden,, one sentence say,,, it's totally mine blowing. it's stuff, direction, management system, natural view, etc. too much organized & beautiful. I like it...."
,,Lovely place to spend a couple of hours,4.0,,"Every time I visit Singapore I visit the botanic gardens. The only place you have to pay is to visit the orchard garden which is well worth the small fee. The gardens are very lush and beautifully kept. It can get very humid out at the gardens so to really enjoy your visit I would suggest you visit early in the day.Getting there is easy ,just catch the mrt rail.It is very cheap and a breeze to navigate."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Here you can enjoy an peaceful walk through the garden. It is very big with lots of trails. There is also a concert area.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Really enjoyed our walk through the gardens. Especially enjoyed the ginger garden. Didn't bother paying the extra for the orchid garden.

Compared to Gardens by the Bay this is not as well set out but the mass plantings and mature gardens made a wonderful display and we enjoyed it just as much.

We came early in the morning to escape the heat and humidity but the environment in January was still very warm. I would recommend starting from the orchid road end so that you end at the air conditioned station for the trip home."
,,Beautiful oasis in this busy City.,4.0,,I visit the botanical gardens on most trips to Singapore. A walk through the beautiful gardens is a must and there are always activities going on to watch or join in on.
,,Really well worth a visit,5.0,,Really well worth a visit. An oasis of peace and tranquillity and an opportunity to see beautiful flowers in a nice setting.
,,For all nature lovers,4.0,,"A very well preserved garden with lots of unusual plants, swan lake, flowers. I even saw iguana, green snake and squirrel roaming around. Very easy to reach Botanic Garden MRT Station by circle line or downtown line. The entrance is just besides the station. If you wish to buy some light food, fruits or drinks, there is a Cold Storage nearby.

Once you entered the Garden, you can pick up a free map from the flip-open drop box. Water fountains can be found in several locations. Best time to visit is in the morning or evening when the sun is not so strong and bright.

Very relaxing to spend your time there jogging, with friends, bring your pets for a stroll or leaving your children to run about, this place suits all.

My last visit, I happened to look up and discovered Monkey Pot tree. Very interesting species, look forward to uncover more species next time."
,,wonderful gardens,5.0,,"Absolutely splendid gardens. Free entrance, easy to reach (just stop at the Botanic Gardens bus stop). I spent 3 hours there and could have stayed longer. Lots of palms and orchids. The Orchidarium (this one does have a small entrance fee - S$ 5) is incredibly rich with hundreds of species. Really amazing!"
,,Very tranquil away from the hustle & bustle of the town,4.0,,"Despite us nearly melting in the heat as we decided (not very sensibly as it turned out) we would walk to the park from the town, it was one of the highlights of our stay in Singapore.
You really need to have a good half day or more to appreciate all this lovely place has to offer.
Out of town & away from the hustle & bustle the park is not only very tranquil but has masses of interest to keep you occupied for hours.
We not only did the Skywalk but also took in the Dome, both of which were well worth the effort of getting there.
If you are in Singapore we would recommend that this is well worth a visit, you won't be dissappointed."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"Really one of the best nature places in Singapore.

This park is a lot bigger than it seems - even though I have been here more than 10 times, I've never been able to explore even 1/5th of the place.

Very good spot for relaxing, having picnics, gatherings etc.

Few cons - little shelter when it rains, quite a lot of mosquitoes."
,,Wonderful Garden,5.0,,A park full of different species of plants from this region. Some trees are over a hundred years old... Simply worth a visit to garden which is also a Heritage of Singapore!! Also a UNESCO site since July 2015.
,,Amazing park for running,4.0,,"Stayed 2km from the botanic garden and enjoyed several runs in the park. Even with high temperature and humidity in Singapore, the feeling of running in a rain-forest gave extra power. For sure recommended to bring your running choose here."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens, and free to enjoy. The domed gardens were nice, but were S$28 and much of what was impressive could be seen at this garden."
,,Loved the healing garden!,5.0,,"We learnt a lot about where plants were from, it was a nice day walking around looking at everything. I particularly loved the healing garden and small waterfalls, lakes and fountains. Flowers that were blooming were beautiful."
,,Unbelievable beauty.,5.0,,"Visiting the gardens is an absolute must! Lush greenery, tranquil surroundings & a huge variety of plants. The orchid garden is just too beautiful for words. I take my dogs here for an evening stroll and am always relaxed & peaceful afterwards. You can also enjoy a cup of tea or a cool drink at the little eatery at the gardens."
,,Get away from concrete,5.0,,Singapore is such a nice place to enjoy public gardens. They take such good care of everything and it shows! A must visit if you really want to get a hold of what living in Singapore means
,,Needed somewhere to photograph out of the heat,4.0,,May have been wrong time of year as very little in the way of colour but still took a lot of photos. I would revisit if I ever get back to Singapore.
,,Tranquil rest amidst a bustling global city,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens (now officially a UNESCO Heritage listed site) is a uniquely tranquil and lush green oasis amidst the fast paced shopping district of Orchard Road. An excellent and unexpected change of pace for visitors to a modern global city that is Singapore
,,"superb, but sign posting v vague and confusing",4.0,,we arrived south eastern end by taxi and then had to go the north western end for the metro which had only opened a few days prior. only had a 2 hr time slot to reach the metro and meet relatives for lunch elsewhere. gardens are superb but allow at least a full 1/2 day to have a more thorough look. the signage is v vague and many times we headed off on a wrong path and had to retrace our tracks to find the more direct route.
,,Essential place to visit,5.0,,"Buildings and settings are beautiful, take your time going through as you may miss the fantastic views and botanicals, well worth the visit"
,,Refreshing retreat from street and highrise buildings,5.0,,"Placed in the middle of all the hurley-burley, Singapore's botanical gardens are maybe the best of its kind in the world. More plant species than most people can mention, this place is a magnet for locals meaning that here, tourists will not feel like sheep :-) If temperatures permit do spend some hours here. There is much to see."
,,Amazing range of flora,5.0,,"Fantastic to see all of the different plants in these well kept gardens, where several workers toil to make it a lovely relaxing place to visit."
,,Bountiful Botanics,5.0,,"I was here two days ago and it is a really beautiful place. A definite if you are looking for low cost Sing experiences. The garden is really large and has a variety of plants and displays. There is a medicinal plants section, a few lakes, a rainforest, the orchid garden ( which is $5 to enter but the rest of the gardens are free) and a place for kids specifically. There are many benches in shaded areas and lots of huts if you happen to get caught in a monsoonal downpour for shelter. Its was well worth the trip, take a picnic and a book."
,,Sunday Evening if you like outdoor music,5.0,,One of the best parks in Singapore. a must if you have the time to visit. Stunning park with a FREE kids play area.
,,A walk in the park,4.0,,"I'd been wanting to visit the Botanic Gardens. I finished work early one day and hopped on the MRT straight away. I went at 11am and can tell you right now it wasn't one of my best ideas. It was so hot and humid that day and the heat was the worst as I went through the tropical forest plants. I was sweating like crazy. So if you're planning to visit, be sure to wear light cotton clothes and good walking shoes.

The highlight for me was the orchids but I also really liked the flowers of the ginger variety. Such vibrant colors!

I spent three hours there but it felt very calming and I didn't even notice the time pass. It was an overall lovely visit and I would recommend this for families, a day-date idea for couples, or like me, a solo trip."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Well worth the time to explore this beautiful area. The orchid gardens ($5 entry) especially are stunning. Easy to walk around, with paths leading to all sorts of interesting places. Much better than Gardens by the Bay and the only cost is the train fare. Take water with you as the kiosks are well spread out."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Amazing walks in this garden, love it, although the heat in Singapore gets to me. Always notice new things."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,We visited these gardens around noon with minimum knowledge about plants and Singapore's extreme humid weather. We enjoyed roaming around the area but ended up sweating like a pig. :)
,,Stunning gardens,5.0,,"You should try to go early in the morning (it opens at 5 AM) when is not extremely hot. Beautifully preserved gardens, recently declared a UNESCO World Heritage site"
,,Must visit if you have young kids,5.0,,"Step 1: Go to Botanical Gardens MRT station

Step 2: Walk to the Kids Garden. Kids must be under 12.

Step 3: Enjoy the: water fountains they can play in, slides, tree house, maze and other attractions ... all free!

Absolutely beautiful park. Bring a camera."
,,Must See if You Like Plants - Our Favorite Singapore Attraction,5.0,,You will get a lot of exercise and can spend a couple of days at this mostly free historical living location. You must pay a little extra and see the special orchid section for it is amazing!
,,This garden is MUST SEE,5.0,,"Park was so amazing and beatiful, me and my husband both thougt that it was one of the best places we have ever visited abroad. Spend there ~4 hours, just walking around. I highly recommend this place to everyone - you will not be disappointed! We weren't that into spesific plants etc, but just the views and atmosphere were so mind blowing."

,,The most beautiful garden i have visited,5.0,,Wonderful garden with amazing flowers Thousands of différent spieces of flowers so beautiful You çan spend Half a day in this garden
,,Good botanical garden,5.0,,So many varieties of trees & plants. Loved this place. One of the best botanical gardens I've visited :)
,,Nice place,4.0,,Very nice place. However cant match up to gardens by the bay. However nonetheless its still a beautiful place. Great place for a picnic and just to chill.
,,Superb,5.0,,What a wonderful gift to the people of Singapore. This is a well organised ad well labelled huge garden and all free except for the National Orchid Garden. Go many times
,,Pretty Gardens,4.0,,Very casual to walk around the Gardens the Orchid gardens were just beautiful Swan Lake just so relaxing to stroll around all the various gardens were all great. The Cafe had a great variety of-foods we chose the SIA hop-on/hop-off bus that stops at many locations including the Gardens . Very Enjoyable
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We visited the gardens twice once during the day too hot to enjoy properly,we return by first morning train then taxi.
It was wonderful at first light lots of birds ,squirrels and much more pleasant to walk around and or cause no crows except for joggers.This is a must do attraction in my opinion."
,,Orchids especially excellent,4.0,,It is free entry except for modest charge to orchid garden. If you want to walk around it all allow lots of day. We spent most of our time in the orchid garden and this alone worth the visit and definitely the high point of the park.
,,The gardens are very natural,5.0,,"We spent an afternoon at the Botanical Gardens and were pleasantly surprised to find it was a 10 minute bus ride from our hotel. The gardens are very natural and look like a well maintained park with tropical flowers and foliage, I preferred this to a big glass house full of plants and a fake atmosphere. The orchid gardens within the botanical gardens are worth the entrance fee. The orchids are beautiful and there are some lovely spots for taking photos. I had a very relaxing day at both the botanical gardens and the orchid gardens, we got around the place in a few hours and took some wonderful pictures."
,,World heritage site for free,4.0,,"Great Botanic, large so allow at least two hours but good for picnics and family or fitness visits. Great displays and planting season of tropical trees and plants. You pay to enter the Orchid Garden, you may also see some of the gardens wildlife, fish and Terrapins in lake and monitor lizards and birds."
,,Runners paradise in the tropics,5.0,,"These immaculately kept gardens have to be the most beautiful place in Singapore to run.
The wide paths sweep past lakes, through woods and around flower beds providing opportunities to spot Kingfishers, Monitor lizards, Turtles, and if you are lucky - Oriental Hornbills or even a monkey.
Get there early as although there is plenty of shade, it gets hot and humid after 10am.
There are plenty of vending machines, water fountains and cafes so no need to carry lots of water.
It's open from 5am till midnight and being Singapore is totally safe to run alone at night.
Highly recommended way to get away from the city and unwind"
,,Lots of different views,4.0,,"The entrance is free and there are quite a lot of things to see. Personally i preffered the Gardens by the Sea but I would suggest both. There are several lakes with nice views, lots of plants and you can also see squirrals and iguana's roaming around"
,,Must See,5.0,,Our last visit to the SBG was 30 years ago. It has only improved since seeming more natural than before while having much improved services.
,,Nice Place,4.0,,"Very large green space in the city. Good to roam around and relax, check if there are any gigs in the park. Must see the tallest tree in Singapore and the old British era band stand. In evening time a lot of turtle come out of the lakes/ponds which is quite a sight."
,,Love this place,5.0,,"Beautiful place filled with lizards geckos and other creatures. Check out the orchards, they are absolutely stunning"
,,First Rate Gardens,5.0,,"Singapore knows how to do things up right, and it shows in their botanic gardens. I spent a full day in their extensive gardens, which were a stark contrast to the hyper modernity of the city. The orchid garden was nothing short of stunning, the best I have seen anywhere, and was hard to leave. The rest of the gardens are tastefully presented and have a serenity I did not expect to find in Singapore. The indoor garden installations are also well done, and the multi-storey manufactured ""trees"" possess a compelling sculptural quality. If you love gardens, reserve a lot of time for this one. This is a most photogenic place."
,,Very hot but beautiful,4.0,,It was 94°F and VERY HUMID. I went in January so maybe that's why. But the gardens are a must! If you're in Singapore you HAVE to go!
,,Beautiful gardens and Orchid,5.0,,Number #2 place to visit in Singapore (the number one is the Garden by Sea). Beautiful interest garden with different and exotic flowers. Do not miss the Orchid garden. Just amazing !!!!! I've never seen such a variety of beautiful and different flowers.
,,An oasis in the city,4.0,,"We had to take a cab to get to the Botanical Gardens but it was worth it. This is a treasure and seems to be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. You need many visits to take it all in but as a tourist, I would highly recommend the Orchid Garden first which has specimens of almost every orchid on earth."
,,Best place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"This is the best place for all visitors (local and oversea). It's a place must see in Singapore. Further more, it's free entrance to all visitors. There are many nice places for the seniors or the young. Spend a lazy afternoon there or have a picnic there is highly recommended."
,,"Green, quiet and calm environment",4.0,,We can walk and enjoy the fresh air in this garden. Just make sure you get clear weather if you plan to visit it. My family and I can't explore all the garden are because it was raining not so long after we arrived there.
,,Pretyy,3.0,,This was a nice attraction and the displays were beautiful. It was my least favorite attraction in Singapore but I'm a very avid outdoorsman and have seen these in real form so for me personally it was a good replica to the real cloud forest that some may never get out to see.
,,Good place for relaxing times,3.0,,Nice place to spend some relaxing time nothing new same experience found in difference places in the world
,,Relaxing place.,4.0,,A place with great calm and tranquility. Perfect for a scroll or perhaps just a day out with your loved ones to picnic. And an ideal destiny to appreciate the botanic and the greenery of earth.
,,Absolutely great!,5.0,,"A must see attraction in Singapore . entrance is free but you have to pay to go inside the orchid garden. As everything else in Singapore everything is very well maintained , clean and the specimens are well preserved."
,,Just loved it,5.0,,"I am not a big plant lover but my day spent in the Gardens with my girlfriend was amazing. I loved every minute of it. There is so much to see there and you can spend a whole day just pottering around and taking your time in each section. We saw so much and we didn't even spend all day there. There is a massive section in the middle which feel like Jurassic Park (you'll know what I mean when you go) and you can just sit there and take in the sun and the passers-by. We saw a concert there too which was brilliant and all the locals and ex-pats came out to watch it so it was a really nice atmosphere. I also got my first sighting of a big(ish) lizard there too (see the pic) so that was fun. This is just a great place to chill out and see a different part of our world, somewhere away from the hussle and bussle of the city.
It is easy to get to with an MRT stop at one end but we just walked there from Chinatown so that we could take in the city as we went."
,,Fabulous Green Space in the City,4.0,,"Singapore is lush with vegetation anyway, however, the abundance and extent of the grounds and plant life in the botanical gardens would be difficult to surpass. Wonderful area to spend an afternoon wondering through with a picnic to round off the afternoon. The only down point would be a rather disappointing children's garden in terms of the options available despite there being a sizeable space allocated."
,,"Orchids, more orchids and a monitor lizard",5.0,,"The Tropics in miniature, beautifully cared for and well signed, discreetly instructive and a delight on the eye."
,,wonderful place for a walk/picnic,5.0,,"Beautifully thought out and very well kept, paths meander through vine covered arches and under large old trees. lots of garden beds filled with colourful flowers of all kinds. lots of shady places to sit and enjoy the views or have a picnic."
,,Interesting and well maintained garden,5.0,,Its hard to imagine such lush greenery amidst the concrete jungle. But this garden provided us with the needed relaxation. Learnt about the common factors between the ginger and the banana plant . Loved the foot reflexology portion of the path. Also enjoyed the orchid garden and the amphitheater. Must visit place in Singapore!
,,Great Variety,4.0,,"The number of different gardens within the Botanic Gardens makes this an important place to see. There are buildings that allow you to understand the history and importance of the garden to Singapore, as well as space to relax and unwind. It is large enough that you don't have to worry about crowds and are able to enjoy the various gardens as your own pace and leisure."
,,Beautiful and Impressive,4.0,,Gorgeous and well taken care off. Ideal for a walk with the family or with your couple. Loved it even when it was a rainy day.
,,Must visit these Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Luxuriant vegetation, beautiful trees and magificent orchidea in a globally very pleasant environment."
,,Well worth seeing !,5.0,,The gardens are very well laid out and are very quaint with their many plants and trellises throughout.
,,"Huge Park, spend a whole day there",5.0,,"If you have more than a day or two in Singapore, go wander around the Botanic Gardens and all the sub-gardens attached to it, like the Orchid Garden. There was so much to see in and around all these parks. Handfuls of people, the occasional small shop or vendor cart, with tons of nature and good walking paths in between. Great place to exercise, take things slow, wander and explore."
,,Wonderful Gardens..,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are definitely worth a visit or maybe more than one visit. It is such a nice place to take a peaceful walk. The Orchid Garden is spectacular. Definitely a must see in Singapore.The botanical gardens are spectacular. In the heart of the heat the gardens are enclosed and all air conditioned. I am not botanical garden enthusiast but this is something to see.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I am not normally into this type of thing, but it was a stop on my tour. I was actually very cool to get up and close with nature and learn about interesting plants and Singapore's conservation plans."
,,One of the best places in Singapore,5.0,,"Must visit if you are a nature/photography lover .. dont miss the orchid, fragrant, evolution gardens.. truly deserves to be selected as one of d world heritage centers."
,,Interesting if you're into plants/botany,3.0,,I found it a bit repetitive and got lost in some areas. If you want to see some greenness after all the city life but you're particularly 'into' plants I'd suggest the Gardens by The Bay instead
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This place is as good as any gardens I have visited in the world. It is welcoming, easy to navigate, beautiful to look at and free to enter. We have been several Times with friends and family and cannot recommend highly enough."
,,Great place for family outing,4.0,,"Overall it is really nice to have a family outing there but more choices of affordable food outlet will be welcoming as they restaurants there are pretty high end. And when night come will believe that they need more lighting as it gets very hard to see without ample lightnings, especially at those high end restaurant area."
,,Rejuvenating retreat from the city,5.0,,"Spent some very nice hours in the beautifully kept and lush garden. It was fun to find little surprises of statues among all the green and flowering plants, we loved watching the fishes and turtles in the pond with the swans and enjoyed a good lunch at the Verde café.
Didn't go into the orchid garden because it was getting a bit too hot for us.
The botanic garden is definitely well worth a visit and it's easy access also for wheel chairs and strollers."
,,I love The Amazing Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"the lush vegetation, colonial atmosphere, amazing Orchid garden, morning Tai Chi , the concerts on Saturday, the lake, the ginger, the subtle charm of hidden statues between the leaves - all these are magic.. Six stars"
,,Historic and modern gardens to explore,4.0,,"Nice mix of old and new gardens and buildings. It can get busy at weekends so if you can visit mid week to get almost to yourself. Easy access by metro train to park gates. Take own picnic, find a tree and enjoy. Plenty of guides, toilets (really clean too!) and cafe but a bit pricey ... great examples of historic trees. Visit the information centre first. Don't bother with a map just wander, when ready look at the signs to get out and back to metro. Truly a green pessimist of the time, you get an occasional glimpse of a skyscraper now and again."
,,Fantastic way to wind down,5.0,,"Whether you are a weekending local or just passing through en route down under, this is an oasis of beauty and calm in the heart of the city. Where other areas feel congested, the gardens are more than large enough to always give you space. The different areas are lovely - the opera stage dramatic, the PoW steps sobering. Great place."
,,Wonderful botanical garden in heart of town.,5.0,,The botanical gardens are spectacular. It's hard to conceive who actually conceived the idea. In the heart of the heat the gardens are enclosed and all air conditioned. I am not botanical garden enthusiast but this is something to see.
,,"Beautiful, well cared for gardens",5.0,,"We walked for hours, there's so much to see and it's all very well planned out. The gardens are so well kept and so pretty. Keep an eye out for wildlife, we saw several large monitor lizards on the grass, and lots of turtles in the lakes. Definitely take a picnic and wear comfortable shoes!"
,,One of my favorite places in Singapore,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are definitely worth a visit or maybe more than one visit. It is such a nice place to take a peaceful walk. We have family that live nearby so we went everyday we were in Singapore and enjoyed it every time.

The Orchid Garden is spectacular. Definitely a must see in Singapore."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Visited as part of a Singapore sightseeing tour. Good value for money and well kept. Wet while I visited so glad the shop sold plastic pakas ! Orchids were beautiful. Could spend either a morning or afternoon wandering round.
,,"Freshest air, lush landscape thats hard to miss",5.0,,"This garden is always makes at the top of my-list when coming to Sg.

- a great walk for family where one can leisurely enjoy tropical lush set right in downtown Sg.
- The paths are also nice for outdoor running with many shaded areas, shady tropical trees. Best to come on early mornings then have breakfast here
- walking from Botanic MRT to Orchid Garden is a bit far and can make one very sweaty when its a sunny day though so better prepare an umbrella
- wear sneakers"
,,Beautiful Gardens in the middle of the city!,4.0,,Amazing and a must see. Many beautiful gardens and varieties of flowers. We loved our time walking through these gardens.
,,Beautiful gardens indeed,4.0,,"I surely wanna be baaaaaaaaaack😍😍, never get enough walking and sightseeing, nice food inside, they had drinking water and beautiful plants everywhere. Can't seems to had enough, will be back soon for my next holiday."
,,Good walking Area,4.0,,"Went for a peaceful walk in the evening, I had to reprimand kids on skateboards playing load music. The garden maintenance guys did not say anything to them. Skateboarding clearly marked as not allowed. The garden is a fun place to walk around at night as well as the day,"
,,Enjoyed this more than we expected to,5.0,,We got the hop on hop off bus and it dropped us off right at the entrance. Spent about two hours here and were really impressed with the presentation and surrounds. Nice way to spend a few hours and it is mainly free which makes it even better. Just need to pay if you want to go in to selected areas
,,Nothing great,2.0,,It's an old style garden with nothing great to see else the entry to orchid garden is through this only.
,,Do not miss the opportunity to visit these world class gardens,5.0,,Beautiful gardens and world renown orchid collection. Admission is free but small charge for the orchid garden. Not to be missed.
,,Nice Park for a relaxing time out,5.0,,"My sister recommended this Place and we were not disappointed.
Entry is free except for the Orchid Garden.
They have different sections, eg....Healing garden, Ginger garden, a beautiful man made waterfall and much more...
There is a fast Food Restaurant at the Entry which is a bit expensive but a very busy place..We had problems finding a Seat, guess because it was around Christmas.
Other Restaurants are scattered throughout the Park.

The Botanic Gardens are not far from the Top End of Orchard Road.
If you booked the Hop on Hop off Bus ( yellow line )you can get out there for a stop."
,,Beautiful and free getaway from city craze,5.0,,"My husband and I loved walking through the gardens. The area is so large, you never feel crowded like you do in the malls. The swans were a real treat to see. We recommend doing the rain forest circuit. The hike offers loads of shade and you can see ancient trees and maybe even a monkey! The orchid garden does have an entry fee, but the rest of the garden areas are free to enjoy and explore."
,,Lung of The City,4.0,,Nice place to unwind and walk around! This should be replicated in all major cities in the world. Running here should be awesome! I just forgot to bring my running shoes.
,,Orchid garden amazing,5.0,,Great visit if you have anyone interested in flowers bring her/him at the astonishing orchid garden! It costs 5 dollars but it's worthed! Go through all the garden from the vip orchids to the special ones!
,,Great for that weekend picnic late lunch,5.0,,"We went to the Botanic Gardens late at about 3.00 PM on a weekend for a late picnic lunch. It had rained earlier in the day and we guessed that there would not be as many people as there would be on a completely clear day. It seems we may have been right: ample open-air parking spaces and not much need to weave among visitors. We chose a spot on the large field some distance from the stage. There was plenty of space for everyone and it was a joy to watch the many families, clearly from many parts of the world, with kids and dogs all enjoying themselves."
,,"If you love gardens don't miss this one; amazing variety, many ""one of"" species, and larege areas to explore.",5.0,,"Go, enjoy! Good for the whole family, delightful! Fragrance garden, healing garden, ginger garden, too many to mention, but all were wonderful."
,,Botanical Garden Singapore,5.0,,Great diversity! The feeling of wild jungle is so Incredible! I hardly recommend Orchidéa Garden with so many colors and species!
,,best garden in asia,5.0,,"best kept garden of asia! flowers, trees, animals in a fantastic area absolutely well kept.
large panels clearly and easily readable about what you are watching, his history and the reason why is there. Fantastic with family, fantastic for running.
One of the very best attraction in Singapore!!"
,,Best place in Singapore,5.0,,"We had been in the Botanic Garden since 2006 . Since then we visited the garden at least once in every year. We never got bored to have a visit there. It's kind of oasis in urban Singapore. Even as tourists ,we enjoyed a lot at the botanic garden. You don't need any guide and just go to the front office. You will get very comprehensive knowledge of directions and availability of the trees and plants. If you love the flowers , this is a must go place in Singapore."
,,Free fun and shade in Singapore,4.0,,"Like most modern progressive cities the Botanic Gardens are an excellent free attraction. The mature gardens have an excellent canopy that provides great shade for family walks. The orchid gardens were a minor charge and beautfiul, there are Linda and open areas to run around too. The children's park is also fun."
,,What a nice place to visit.,4.0,,"This is a large, well-kept garden with a large variety of plants, flowers, and trees. Clean and well organized. Air is not polluted and paths are clean and directions well marked."
,,Botanical Paradise,5.0,,We visited the Singapore Botanical Gardens in December. The walk there was a bit arduous as it was extremely hot and humid; but when you enter the gates there is a beautiful shaded garden. The gardens are a work of art. You wind in and out of paths taking you to different parts of the gardens. They are themed; you can wander from Swan lake to the National Orchid exhibit. (the only disappointment was that you have to pay to see the orchids.) There are plenty of cafes for refreshments. I would highly recommend this outing.
,,A lot to see.,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens have a lot to see and if the heat and humidity isn't too much you can easily spend the better part of the day there. It is a large park well worth visiting, you forget you are in a city."
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,The whole complex is magnificent. The orchid gardens are beyond amazing - rare flowers and colors I had never seen. A must see. Wear comfortable shoes!
,,Peaceful place,5.0,,This park should be visited by morning because of the high temperatures and high humidity. The orchid camp is wonderful.
,,Nature freely available,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a ""Must See"" in Singapore. Easily accessible via Public Transport (either the Ho Ho bus or Singapore MRT), entry is free and only $5 for the optional extension to the wonderful Orchid Garden ($1 for over 60s).

The gardens are in very extensive parkland and rainforest so...take sensible shoes, water and an umbrella. The on site directions are very clear and there are good amenities available for toilets, shops and food.

The gardens' groundcover blooms are always worth the good walk around, but don't forget to look up occasionally, the birds and blossoms are truly beautiful."
,,Great place,4.0,,Great place to visit at Botanic Gardens. Surrounding has lots of greens and a quiet place to enjoy during the day. It's conveniently accessible to mrt station. There is no shelter if you are caught in the rain. Be prepare to bring along umbrella and hat.
,,"A nice break from the ""attractions""",4.0,,"- It's big, green and quiet - The orchid garden is beautiful. It's not free. - The children play area is not that great compared to Jurong and the Zoo."
,,Forest shower in TOWN !,5.0,,"Forest shower in the forest trail is my all time favorite! Breathing in fresh air, enjoying the quite times alone with the rain forest in the busy town is a great way to chill ! There are also swings located around the beautiful flowers in the garden where sunset can be seen clearly."
,,"Great location, so much fun!",5.0,,"We had a great afternoon at botanical gardens and orchid gardens! So popular, so beautiful! Botanical is for free. Orchid is 5$ but really worth it! 100% recommendation"
,,Incredible!,5.0,,"The entry into the Botanic Garden is free, but there is a small fee if you want to enter and visit the Orchid Garden.

It's easy enough to get there by public transportation, and the reception has a ton of brochures to help you navigate your way through the garden. Try it for a quiet and leisurely morning, especially if you have time to kill.

(I went around on a click-happy mission snapping photos of the various statues and sculptures in the garden. You don't have to, but it was what intrigued me about the garden! The brochure was a tremendous help in helping me explore the area, and sure enough, I'd spent close to 4 hours in this place without realizing it!)

A popular place to visit for most people who come here, so try arriving early in the morning, where your only companions are other like-minded travellers and the fitness enthusiasts.

One of the most serene and calm places I have ever been to.

P.S: Do carry water and a light snack. Also, there is a LOT of walking involved, so wear comfortable shoes and clothing.
(Do NOT repeat my mistake! I had blisters by the time I reached Sentosa, another place where I did a ton of walking, and had to unnecessarily buy flip-flops because my shoes were pinching my feet! Singapore is an expensive country, so if you're on a budget, unexpected reasons such as these can empty your coffers!)

Prepare also for the unpredictable weather of the country, carry a hat AND an umbrella!"
,,"Good for jogging, walking, close to nature",3.0,,"A good place to walk if you want to see a landscape in Singapore. Very wide area, suitable for kids to run around. If you go on Sunday, you will see a lot of people sitting and picnic on grass ^_^ few places for kids to run around, playground, they can play sand too... not suitable for those who can't take heat or can't walk much.. little shelter. not suitable to go during rainy days."
,,Beautiful Oasis within the City,5.0,,We have visited here a couple of times and find that the mornings are less crowded. The gardens are large so recommend you go even if crowded. This is a special place and a real gem for Singapore to be proud of.
,,Great place for a walk,4.0,,If you have a few spare hours in Singapore and don't mind doing some walking this this a beautiful spot to visit
,,Beautiful place but be prepared to be extremely hot,5.0,,Have had many wonderful days at the botanic gardens seeing them grow to what they are today. Restaurants are clean and provide good quality reasonable food.
,,Lovely walk,5.0,,"Really lovely gardens, fantastic FREE attraction. It was super hot the day we went and it rained some too but it was so hot it didn't matter. We also paid the small supplement to get into the Orchid House.
There is a fantastic high level walkway which gave some spectacular views."
,,Magnificent Orchid Garden,5.0,,The orchid display here has to be one of the best in the world. Well worth your time and easily reached by taxi (which are cheap in Singapore) or public transportation. I have traveled worldwide and cannot recall a similar display elsewhere!
,,Free Entry to this amazing beautiful attraction!,5.0,,"The gardens are very pretty, and go through geological time, and easy for anyone to read and understand the differences in trees and vegetation with time. You can easily spend more than half a day here going through the whole garden. Definitely worth a visit- avoid during and right after thunderstorm,"
,,Orchids,4.0,,The gardens were lovely the orchids were absolutely gorgeous. A real must to see. Staff extremely helpful
,,Pretty Nice Place to Picnic,4.0,,"Being Singaporean, it was my first time to the gardens. I thought it would be a plain and boring place but I was mistaken. The garden was built beautifully and to my surprise, they have an open concert theatre. Wow! Interesting."
,,Great place to spend the morning,5.0,,I live in Singapore with my wife a our son (almost 2 at time of writing) and we visit the Botanic Gardens regularly. The café at the Holland Road / Tanglin entrance is great for kids (decent menu and has a play area outside) and there is enough natural shade throughout the gardens that you can walk around for a couple of hours even on relatively sunny days. Jacob Ballas Children's Garden is well-worth a visit.
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,This is a most wonderful place. Do spend few hours relaxing. The center in the middle of the park sales jewelry embossed with real orchids. These are really awesome and definitely recommended
,,"Super well-organised, but relaxing.",5.0,,"Not too crowded, and you can walk on the grass, too. Good maps and helpful guides. Great orchids and trees, all carefully labeled. Large and easy to get to, in the centre of the city. Only problem is the hordes of people taking selfies. But you find that everywhere here!"
,,UNESCO World Heritage site,4.0,,"The Downtown Line came into operation recently and I capitalize on the free rides to visit this UNESCO World Heritage site before the end of the year. The Downtown Line Botanic Gardens station is located right in front of the Bukit Timah Gate. Travel by the subway MRT line is now so convenient and there are travelators between the train platform and the exit to ease your footwork.

I had visited Botanic Gardens on few previous occasions with many fun walk groups. But each time I discovered new areas that I had yet to explore. This time I took a full four hours walk right from my entry at Bukit Timah Gate and reached the Tanglin Gate and on my return to Bukit Timah Gate via another different route.

The vast wide biodiversity of vegetation, palms, orchids, trees, foliage and rainforest studded almost everywhere in the valleys, lakes and gardens make this place so unique and full of greenery and beauty.

When I reached the Tanglin Gate, I saw huge development project going on just opposite the Botanic Gardens. It was `fuming' with thick smoke and pollutants from heavy concrete piling and the loud blast and trumpet of the construction machineries filled the air. I feel lucky to be in the `oasis' in nature's hand away from the concrete deserts of humans' activities. We are a little tiny country and land is scarce. It was great wisdom that we preserve this piece of nature's land and this year, the Gardens has been crowned as one of the UNESCO world heritage sites.

While we could still hear the dim booming of the vehicles coming from the main road and the construction activities opposite the Tanglin Gate, the atmosphere in the Botanic Gardens is serene and tranquil.

It is an escapee from our hectic schedule to just relax here among the greenery and lie down on the green valley breathe in all the fresh oxygenated air from the surrounding plants and listen quietly to the rhythm of nature. The entrance is free.

Wedding photographers take their best shots at the Gazebo overlooking the Swan Lake and at the white Bandstand. Families and friends lay their ground sheets near the Eco Lake chit chatting and happily playing games while couples with their children admire the serenity of the lake as two black swans gracefully exhibit their vanity to the onlookers.

The Healing Garden educated me on the various herbs that could be planted in the tropics that have many medicinal benefits. I found the aphrodisiac powerful Tongkat Ali tree but could not find the Moringa plant that boasts of numerous curative properties.

A stroll through the rainforest at the center of the Gardens is rejuvenating and refreshing. The Bougainvilleas and Bamboo collections appears colorful and striking rich. I like the bore top pattern of the frangipani trees and the floating water lilies and lotus at the Symphony Lake. There were so many gardens to explore but I still missed some of them.

I was surprised that the NParks HQ is located within the attractions. I saw a number of the tourists having their lunch at the Casa Verde restaurant. The food looks class and a bit pricey but the ambience gives me an impression as if they were in London.

It is advisable to get a copy of the map of Botanic Gardens from the visitors' information desk so that you really cover most of the prominent gardens and collections. Those who don't like nature, plants and vegetation will find this place boring."
,,I love the rain forest walk!,4.0,,"I love the long walk, so quiet so beautiful~ don't miss it!! The black swan is so hungry, and many pigeons in the garden. It's too hot!!"
,,Our favourite garden,5.0,,"Was here every now n then. It was a great walk in the late morning with my wife. We went to the orchid garden (must do). Followed by the ginger garden before heading to the big open field where many were having picnic. The mood was relax, cool under the huge shady trees. We also checkout the Swan Lake. We spotted the big white swan. There were few big lizards sun tanning. We spent 3 good hours there. Enjoyed the every moment!"
,,Good park for a walk,4.0,,Singapore botanical garden is a nice place in Singapore where you can spend relaxing time in a natural environment. There are food courts where you can eat for cheap and delicious.
,,Nice for a stroll,4.0,,"For a relaxed morning or afternoon perfect. It took me around 2 1/2 hours to walk from the northern entrance to the southern one. My highlight was the jungle path. There you can see how Singapore would look like, when the city wasn't there."
,,Lovely location to enjoy nature,5.0,,Hubby and I had a thoroughly enjoyable time walking the grounds and then paying the Sin$5 entrance fee for the orchid gardens which were stupendous. You need several hours and good walking shoes to do this justice. Taking photos won't do the beauty of the orchids justice. Stunning.
,,The orchid garden!!!,5.0,,"Singapore is a beautiful clean city so well looked after.
The botanical gardens is the best one I have ever visited. The orchid garden is so impressive and just beautiful! Do not miss it.

,,Botanical Experience,5.0,,"If you enjoy a beautiful outdoor experience with visual beauty, smells for exotic and flowers and amazing greenery the Singapore Botanical Gardens should be on your list of To Do's. There are concerts in the open, restaurants from ultra casual to fine dining, more kilometers of walking paths than I can detail and each a wonderful adventure.. There is a healing park which is a live learning of plants and herbs and how each can help with health and healing just amazing.. I have walked the park in the sun and rain and found the adventure most enjoyable no matter the weather.."
,,Pleasant walk on hot day,4.0,,Singapore is very hot and humid and walking around the Botanical Gardens is only pleasant because of the sheer volume of plants to see and the way the garden has been designed.
,,A beautiful tranquil place in this bustling city.,5.0,,"Visited with family and enjoyed by all. Even the warm downpour of tropical rain did not spoil it.
The lake with its turtles and large catfish, beautiful tropical plants, and orchid collection make a visit worthwhile - my grandchildren were especially fascinated by the Komodo dragon!"
,,A big good park,5.0,,"It is clean, very quiet, peaceful, full of roses, flowers and plants. It is so good for you if you like green, walking, and spacious places. You have to go early enough if you want to finish it all. it is a perfect place for taking photos too and if you are a professional photographer. Very good place for family and great place for couples. Good place for picnic too. There are some beautiful human-friendly birds there too. And don't worry if you are Muslim, it is a peaceful place to pray anywhere."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This was an organised tour and we did not have long enough to see it all,but what we did see was wonderful"
,,Nice park but nothing special,3.0,,"Huge park and nice for walks with convenient access and good parking, although nothing special. Very well maintained (as almost everything in Singapore) and just pleasant place."
,,Oasis in the city,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens will always be one of my favourite places to walk in, just to unwind and enjoy the fresh air and hear the birds chirping. Especially after it rains, its really nice and cool to take a walk through it !"
,,Wonderful Place,5.0,,Wow..... A very relaxing place.. Its like you are in the jungle with different species of flowers and trees in the middle of the city...
,,Would have been peaceful but it was far too busy,3.0,,"As a place to go to think and chill out, I can imagine it is great when not on public holidays.
Also went to the National Orchid exhibit. This was free for students over Christmas which made it worth it. Otherwise, really is one for flower lovers.
Overall, as I am not a botanist, I found it an OK visit. I would like to return at a less busy time and re review"
,,Great if you love plants and long walk,3.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens will be heaven for plant lovers and joggers.
But for us which is a normal visitors it has this awesome at first experience but gruesome once you started walking for more than 1km just to reach the exit.

There's not enough bench to sit, shaded area which will make this place like hell when the rain starts to fall."
,,not as good as my expectation,3.0,,"went to this place once and I dont really findwhats good from this place. it has some of tree and plants and lakes, and most of people do some jogging around, but it was just okay"

,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"Go only if u know or love plants otherwise cannot say much . For children , they ,I saw were bored after some time"
,,Fantastic,4.0,,Despite my many trips to Singapore I had never been to the botanical gardens. It was well worth the trip the orchid displays were beautiful and the many facets of the garden are stunning. This would be a sanctuary for locals to have a picnic and relax in the lovely gardens . I certainly will be back.
,,Place of Serenity.,5.0,,"This is a ""must do and see "" attraction when visiting Singapore. Orchid displays are both stunning and outstanding! Highly recommend for all visitors. The gardens layout is impressive with many ""hidden gems"" to discover."
,,You could spend all day,5.0,,"We arrived very early in the morning and were fortunate to have most of the gardens for ourselves other than a few people jogging or out with their children in strollers. The park is large and has a number of specialty sections such as the Orchid Garden, rain forest, herb garden, Children's garden, swan lake, bonsai garden and many more. It is free to the public and easily accessible by MRT or bus. There is an outdoor cafe for grabbing a bite to eat and drink. Grab one of the maps at the gate entrances. If you are short on time, decide ahead which areas are of most interest. If you didn't know it already, this is a UNESCO site."
,,We held our Wedding there!,5.0,,"We held our Wedding at the Bandstand in the Botanical Gardens.
You can't just go there and have a Wedding, there are steps to follow.
It was nice, even though it rained.
We went back there the following Sunday to take some pictures.

It was a small ceremony, and small reception also, which took place at the 'Food for Thought' restaurant

**This is a late review, as the Wedding was on December 19, 2014."
,,Just an Ordinary Park,3.0,,Nice peaceful park but nothing really special about the place. Good for chilling out with friends and family for get togethers and picnics. Not really worth visiting if travelling alone.
,,Great santuary and good location,4.0,,Great place for santuary for all ppl from all ages. Easy accessible by train and public transports. Swan lake is very calm and peaceful place for one to relax and breakaway from stressful working life in sg. Great place to walk or stroll for all park goers. I brought my family to watch and listen to live orchestra performances. Do check out the schedules if u want to watch live performances. Great for pinics as well. Do bring some food and drinks. Highly recommended. It free admissions except orchid gardens.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,This is a must see!! Tranquil and stunning gardens. Make the time for a stroll around here. Is huge! Can't wait to go back!
,,Garden in the city,4.0,,"It is so convenient to visit Botanic Gardens via the Circle Line now. However the walk from this gate to the Orchid Garden was a little far.
We were lucky to enjoy free admission to the National Orchid Garden. According to their website, it is free admission till 3 January 2016 for students, Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and Work Permit holders (Please visit the official website for more details)."
,,"Beautifully done, but only enjoyable when you can stand the heat",5.0,,"First off, the Botanic Gardens are amazing! Every corner of a huge area is perfectly designed by what must be an army of gardeners! We walked around for about 5 hours, and you could turn a corner and the whole thing would look completely different - really well done!
The ""problem"" is that it's almost completely outside (apart from a couple of small buildings). And with the Singaporean heat and humidity, this can be very exhausting, as you'll walk several kilometres, sometimes in the direct sun. Take a LOT of water with you, and sun screen, and just assumed you'll be soaked in sweat by the time you've seen it all :)"
,,A park that is near to town and for you to appreciate flora and fauna.,5.0,,A unesco heritage site. This park is a beautiful place to visit be it day or night. Check out the swans paddling in the pond and the cafeterias that nestles in the middle of the park.Dont forget to walk in to the evolution forest and admire prehistoric like rainforest. There is also a 100 yr old nyatoh tree that has been standing strong since the mid century.
,,My feet were tired,4.0,,"Prepare to walk a lot if you want to go around this place. Bring an umbrella along with you, it rained a little bit when I came there. Orchid Garden was awesome."
,,Not a big fan of gardens so didn't like it.,3.0,,This is a very big garden but since I am not into botany that much so this was not at all appealing place for me to visit. We had to walk a lot so decided to leave the place early. Go if you are interested in seeing the different types of plants.
,,Wonderful botanic gardens,5.0,,"Vast gardens, beautifully maintained, containing grassy lawns, lakes, and some remarkable specimens of huge old trees. Plan to take your time, and lots of water. We wouldn't have missed it."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"If your looking for a relaxing day wander through the botanic gardens, it's wonderful, full of amazing beautiful native Orchids, this place is huge so put your walking shoes on, back pack and make a day of it, you'll need it to see the entire place . Singapore you have done it again. Take the kids to the tree house and play area they will love it, stop at the cafe for lunch, pick up a beautiful calendar from the gift store ."
,,VERY SHORT VISIT BUT THIS PLACE IS WONDERFUL,5.0,,We stopped here at the Orchid Garden as part of our transfer from the cruise ship to the airport. It's lovely - we actually saw some birds (weavers). You probably could spend all day at this beautiful place. Wheelchair friendly though there are some steep parts.
,,Quiet and peaceful greenery amidst the city,4.0,,"Its a great place for a picnic, or just family bonding time. Lots of little pocket of spaces to choose from, and the orchid garden is simply beautiful. Highly recommended for those that love garden and horticulture."

,,Beauty in Singapore,5.0,,This is one of my favorite places in Singapore. When I need a nature fix I go here. I love the Orchid garden. The grounds are beautiful with plenty of wonderful walks.

,,Beautiful garden lovely walk,4.0,,"Want to take a friend out but not shopping. So I said we go to botanic garden. What botanic garden what's there, I said plenty the have conductor tour too. Anyway my friends said she has not been the for many many years.
Before I plan I did some homework on the website they have conductor tour for the Orchid garden 9/10/11 am and 4pm Chinese. Free for senior Singaporean tourist only pay $5.00.
We were in times for the 10 am tour register ourself and follow uncle Edward the volunteer.
It was a beautiful walk most area had shape therefore not too hot and with tree alot of breeze.
As we walk uncle Edward explain the different plant, the flower and the Orchid their life span. The is a cool area and he also show us the VIP garden where some flower were name after them and their country.
It was really eye opening for us there was so much to learn about our Orchid garden.
After the long walk uncle Edward show us a map where we have cover it was a long and pleasant walk one and a half hour.
Amazingly unknowingly we had walk such a long distance without feel tire or bore.
Thank uncle Edward for volunteering that make a different for us. I felt maybe not many people know about the free conductor tour, many people were just wondering aimlessly not really know which direction to head to.
If we walk on our way we also will miss certain area.now we have completed the Orchid it was so lovely. The botanic garden was so well taken care off. Well done Singapore
I strong recommend fellow Singaporean to visit our beautiful garden."
,,Good walking trip,3.0,,Huge garden with not so much plant species. Shop inside the garden is costly. Nice place for a stroll or walking trip.
,,Very clean and nice for a change in Singapore,5.0,,Most of the time you only see shops but they do have green and beautiful flower around. The good thing is it's free unless you want to see all the orchard which is only $5. Very worth it.

,,"Hot, humid and nice",3.0,,"Lovely place with lots to see. Some really nice restaurants inside the gardens. However, if you do not like walking around and sweating at the same time then give this place a miss. It can get extremely hot and sticky making it very uncomfortable indeed. Go in January and February time when it isn't as hot and humid."
,,What a surprise,4.0,,"Take the MRT and surprise yourself. Where the rest of Singapore is pretty much go go go, the gardens are simply great when you want a little R&R. Lots of great areas to simply sit and veg for a while plus the usual tourist shops. Not a place you'd go if you want to be dazzled but just perfect to recharge the battery for an hour or so."
,,Very relaxing and amazing place in midst of concrete city,5.0,,"We spent an afternoon relaxing in the garden , sipping fresh juice from the food court . THIS PLACE IS Very pleasing to the eyes and also soothing to the body . We also visited orchid garden inside"

Entry is free with a small donation for the orchid garden."

,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Beautiful gardens. Orchid garden is magnificent. Could stay a whole day in the gardens. Very tranquil.
,,Beauty In The City,5.0,,"Been wanting to visit Singapore Botanical Gardens ever since it won the Unesco Heritage Award - just to see what all the fuss is all about. Finally managed to drag my partner to visit, and boy, it sure was a worthwhile trip.

This place is the ultimate! Serene and oh so beautiful! We had a nice time strolling around the gardens, appreciating and reconnecting with the wonderful nature this heavenly place has got to offer. Also paid a visit to the Orchid Gardens( for a nominal fee) - so informative! Didn't know that there are sooooo many different types and hybrids of these beautiful flowers. So mesmerizing!!

This place is ideal for idyllic afternoon picnics, quiet strolls, students on field trips, avid photographers, joggers - you name it. Everyone and anyone can appreciate this place. Best part, it's on the fringe of Orchard Road, so essentially it's a garden of peaceful oasis right in the city.

I could even picture myself getting married in the beautiful grounds of Singapore Botanical Gardens. Lovely, just lovely !!"
,,Perfect picnic place... Inner city get away,4.0,,"This park is amazingly close to the city areas and accessible on MRT (botanical gardens) and also tourist buses. It has lots of different areas to explore.. Rainforests, ginger gardens, waterfalls and wide open spaces. Someone with me at the time described it as ""the lungs of the city"" in regards to all the trees.
The gift shop is nice, with a post box for postcards, as is the Cafe."
,,A place to explore,5.0,,"This is well worth a visit, it's peaceful and has some interesting sculpture features, nice place to get away from the city bustle"
,,Well maintained,5.0,,Well maintained and beautiful gardens. You could walk on and on for hours and still be enthralled by the beauty of it all. Along the way you can learn so much more about nature too.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,The picture shown is from the Orchid Garden which is a pay as you enter section of the gardens. The gardens themselves are free to enter and are really well laid out and maintained. So lush and green.
,,Nice Walk,5.0,,The gardens are nice to walk to or good for a short jog. Explore the various sections of this park and it is a fair walk to eat before or after your visit. I recommend this as a good morning stop and a must see for travelers that are near by. visited in November 2009.
,,Large gardens and relaxing,4.0,,"Nice botanical gardens comparable to most large cities that have botanical gardens. Lots of space and spread out. Ginger garden, evolution and healing gardens all worth a visit. The Swan Lake is suppose to be a feature point but more like a dirty pond!"
,,Walk regularly,4.0,,Nice place to walk around in Singapore and away from hustle and bustle of Orchard road. Not huge but beautiful area in Singapore. Worth a visit.
,,Great place to go on weekends,4.0,,Great place to go with families. But a lot of domestic workers gathering there on sunday as it's free.. So better go on weekedays or Sat.
,,Add it to your Must Do in Singapore list,4.0,,"A well thought out garden that gets better the further you ""get in"" towards the Orchid Garden.

A bit ""bitty and tatty"" near the MRT entrance - near the turtles in the lake. And then all good.

One slight disappointment and that was the GINGER garden. we had hope to see ginger flowers as our son is ginger, but turns out that ginger is a spice. Ah well, you didn't miss much Joe. JOKE.

One request. Mums and Dads, if you have young kids, can you do us all a big favour and tell your little cherubs NOT to poke the local lizzards? I nearly had to have a word with three western Dads who thought it was quite ok for their offspring to shove sticks up the nose of a lizzard that was just going about its norml business.

Yes, those who said it is good, it is. Go there."
,,Beautiful park for a relaxing time,4.0,,"A beautiful place for an afternoon or morning stroll. You can spend about 1 or 2 hours walking from one side to the other and it is easily reachable by MRT (Botanic Gardens stop). In the weekend and on public holidays the gardens will be very crowded with groups of people going on a day out. Some great wildlife, like monitor lizards crossing your path, as well but are more rare to spot on busy days."
,,A world wonder,5.0,,"If you only ever visit one Botanical Garden in your life make it this one! You could spend days there and not see everything. Oh the orchids! And all for $1, senior rate. I think it's the world's best collection of orchids spread through outdoor beds, a mist house, a cool house and a named for celebrities collection. The garden is over 150 years old so it contains a collection of majestic specimen trees. I also wandered through the Evolution Garden. I especially liked seeing the fossilized trees and the fossil shells embedded in the pathways. I went twice on this visit and will always go back when I am in Singapore. A must visit. One of a kind, a World Heritage Site."
,,Better than Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,"A must see when in Singapore even if you been there before, a whole day is not enough time to take in all that this place has to offer."

,,Beautiful but get there early,5.0,,"Wonderful gardens -- very enjoyable

Tips:
Pick your time as the humidity is worse here due to the all the plants (especially in the Orchid Garden)

Some of the HopOn Hop Off Busses get very crowded and therefore it can be quite a wait.
If you flew Singapore Airlines, hold onto your boarding pass and get their own HopOn HopOff Bus. Cheaper and less crowded."
,,🌲🌳🌴,5.0,,"We went during the day, didn't spend to much time unfortunately as it was really hot and humid. Beautiful place to go and spend the day. Will come back here one day."
,,Singapore Gardens in the rain,5.0,,"This was a wonderful place to walk around and explore. Unfortunately, it was raining for most of the time we were there, but I bet in the sunshine it's fantastic! We went around near a lake, the bamboo garden, the roses, and more - it's just gorgeous. Some younger kids looked to be training for running/track during our walk. What awful weather conditions, but beautiful area to do so! If you have spare time, this would be a great place to relax a little and enjoy. There are many places to see in Singapore, but if vacationing, this would be a must-do. Wish the weather cooperated more!"

,,Place which puts your body and soul together,5.0,,A visit to the Botanical Gardens is truly a humbling experience that makes makes you forget you are otherwise in a very vibrant and bustling city of the world.

,,Nice place,4.0,,"A wide variety of plants to see here, Al colourful and vibrant. Everything is well kept and tidy and there are lots of photo opportunities. Definitely an attraction in Singapore worth visiting, the value for money is great."
,,Lovely,4.0,,I really loved my day there although i didn't have the the children on this trip or they would have been bored. Make sure you have water and are ready for a full day of walking. Don't go on Tuesday as I did and the healing garden was closed.
,,A place full of wonder and surprises!,5.0,,"Truly living up to its name of connecting plants and people, the Singapore Botanic Gardens is a wonderful, welcoming place for people who want to commune with nature. We visited this garden the first time in 2011. Then, because of our new interest in birding, we were inspired to go visit this garden again when we visited Singapore last Dec 4-7, 2015. We visited the garden last Dec 5. We wanted to explore its nooks and crannies for all sorts of birds and other creatures. And we were not disappointed.

Besides seeing how wonderfully maintained the SBG was-- and having been honored with the UNESCO World Heritage Site award-- we were also amazed that there were other interesting creatures like the squirrels that we saw several times scampering from tree to tree. We were also surprised that there was a good population of Southeast Asian birds that were rather friendly to humans. And the big surprise for us was when we saw the monitor lizards at the Heliconia Walk! The first one even did some sunbathing...Such a great experience for us!"
,,Nature getaway,5.0,,"While Gardens by the Bay is aimed at tourists, the Botanic Gardens are full of locals having picnics, playing sports, jogging, and generally just enjoying nature. The entire park is about 2 kilometers wide and except for the Orchid Garden ($5 admission fee for adults), there is no entrance fee.

It's actually a good thing that the MRT station is 1.3 km away from the Orchid Garden, because I really enjoyed the walk and admiring the flora and water features on the way that I otherwise would have missed."
,,Nice even on a very rainy day,4.0,,Easy to get to and worth seeing. It was pouring when we got there and had to shelter but once it dried up it was a very pleasant place to be.
,,"Exotic plants, beauty, serenity.",5.0,,"A tropical paradise in the middle of a modern city. See tropical trees bushes, flowers, among all kinds of horticulture. Most have blooms year round. Beautiful walking trails. You almost forget the tropical heat. Sometimes feels like a cultivated jungle."
,,Definitely worth a visit. A nice change from all the hustle and bustle of the city,4.0,,The Orchid House is worth a look. Extra $5. Rainforest was a nice walk. Bamboo area. The Evolution area was disappointing. Overall a great walk and some much needed exercise.
,,Beautiful and well kept garden,5.0,,"This is a fairly big botanical garden that has now got on the list of Unesco world Heritage site. There are many entrances and there is no fee. Although parts, for instance the fabulous Orchid garden has a fee of five dollars for adults.

We all enjoyed the park, liked the cool house a lot and can recommend a visit"
,,Serenity at it's best,5.0,,"The gardens are glorious and worth spending a few hours strolling round the various areas.

If it helps, I decided to take the MRT to the Botanic Gardens stop (on the Circle Line) and then walked through the gardens and out at the bottom at the Orchard entrance/exit. There is a bus stop a short way (towards the left) but as I was staying in Orchard Road, I decided to walk the 1.3km back to the hotel.

As the area is large, make sure you're wearing comfortable shoes."
,,A World Heritage Wonder,5.0,,"Really enjoyed these gardens! They are a wonderfully developed and beautifully maintained area of tropical luxuriance in the city. Take a taxi so you have the walking energy in the Singapore heat and humidity to really explore it. And the national Orchid collection is stunningly worth its admission fee. Two very special places - the ginger garden and the Halia restaurant, where ginger features strongly on the menu. Enjoy!"
,,A favorite place to run in Singapore,5.0,,"You could take a full day or even more to explore all of the hidden gems in this park. Several different themed gardens ranging from a real rain forest to lakes to orchids to herbal medicinal plants.

If you like cardio boot camps or tai chi, you can find several ad hoc groups throughout the park. If you like running, you can run for many miles/kilometers through all of the winding trails."
,,Nice place to spend afternoon for outdoor activity,4.0,,"We can do some sport or just walk around this beautiful park, and it has live music at some event. Nice way to spent time far away from the crowd"
,,Great place,4.0,,If you want to spend a day outdoors then this a great place to be. If you love plants and want to see a variety of palms and tropical trees then you should go here and at the gardens by the Bay. There is a great restaurant in the park and you can also rent it for small gatherings.
,,An immaculate display but let down by the souvenir staff,5.0,,"I went to the botanical garden and the orchid garden in the same visit (makes sense as they’re next to each other!). The botanical garden looks really impressive, theres a lot of staff there performing routine maintenance on its surroundings. There were plenty of visitors in the garden either do exercise classes, casually walking or relaxing on the grass.

The garden is a lot larger than the map makes it out to be and its quite a walk around so if you’re not use to the humidity I highly recommend cool clothing and a bottle of water. There are some shops on the other side of the garden (if you’re coming from the closest MRT station) where you can get food and drinks as well as some souvenirs. Theres also a lot of great displays and scenic walks you can do.

The only thing that was a negative for the experience was I found the staff in the souvenir shop to be pretty rude. You would ask them a question about something and they would stare at you, then start to answer then carry on a conversation with another member of staff in Mandarin. This happened a few times which made me just give up and not purchase anything."
,,A great afternoon out.....,4.0,,... started with lunch here (try local food selections) and then a walk around the lake and escaping into the shop to avoid the rain! A really peaceful and scenic environment.
,,Perfect place to spend lull time,5.0,,"The botanics is a great place for families and couples alike. With an entrance located almost right in the heart of town, and the other right in front of an MRT station, it eases accessibility for the masses.

You can choose to have a picnic or read a book while in the midst of greenery and unwind from the busyness and fast paced living of Singapore. The place is not huge, so it is possible to travel from one entrance to the other in approximately an hour."
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"This is a must hundreds of different trees and plantations, lots of birds and butterflies, you can spend all day here but take plenty of refreshments"
,,Singapore for 5 days,5.0,,A must stop. The gardens are beautiful. They take pride in the upkeep of the gardens and it shows. The area the Gardens are in can account for 3/4 of a day.
,,Healthy sight seeing,5.0,,I took my mum to walk around there. Beautiful surrounding. Perfect for elderly for not just being in the orchard. Beautiful orchid garden and rain forest area. Well done at the maintenance. Love it
,,Unesco World Heritage Gardens,5.0,,"This place is magnificent- deserving of its World Heritage listing. The gardens cover a vast area, and include many different sections, including tropical rainforest, open lawn areas, large lakes. It is too big an area to cover in just a couple of ours, so try to catch the small tourist tram that takes you on a tour. The orchid garden, the ginger garden and the palm garden are all easy walking from the entrance and are captivating. The colour and variety of specimens on show is amazing. These gardens are a work of art- nothing is haphazard- all planting is undertaken with maximum impact in mind. As in most of Singapore's beautiful public parks and gardens there was an army of gardeners on hand to ensure that every bloom, leaf, seed and nut was in perfect condition. This is a garden worthy of its outstanding reputation- it is for everyone, not just garden lovers."
,,I love it!,5.0,,This place is perfect for walking. I have never been to any place like this before where plants are simply captivating!
,,Amazing free public garden,5.0,,"Nothing beats a stroll around the Gardens. Beautifully maintained and full of interesting and exotic trees and plants, it is also home to white and black swans, ducks and waders, squirrels, multitudinous turtles and the occasional water monitor. The Corner House restaurant does an amazing Sunday Brunch!"
,,Heritage site,5.0,,"The gardens are beautifully landscaped and presented. They are a peaceful and quiet place to visit in a busy hustling city. People jog, run,walk, meander at their own pace. We spoke to a staff member and the pride he had at their park becoming heritage listed was so obvious. Recommend making time to visit the park."
,,Best Thing to See in Singapore....Heaven on Earth,5.0,,"After living in Singapore for a short 6 months...this is BY FAR our favorite place. Four visits to this beautiful place and we have stil not seen all it has to offer.
270 year old trees...Largest and oldest Palm tree in Singapore...Flowers and beautiful plants everywhere you roam....Convenient air conditioned shops or reataurants along the way...The snack bar at the Visitors Center ( Nassim Gate area...or right behind Taxi Stand) has clean WCs, Storage bins and provide you a Picnic Lunch, if you wish to eat simewhere on the Greens.
I recommend seeing the National Orchid Gardens, if you only have time for one area...Lunch at The Corner House ( former residence of Botanist EJH Corner), is pricey...but worth it. Michelin- worthy menu.
Possible to get there via MRT...But a lot of walking, ( & we're 60+ yrs. old), So, we taxi there and MRT out. Plan on soending most of your day here...You will be glad you saw this newly-designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. Best thing to see in Singapore."
,,Mosquitoes,4.0,,"it is a really nice place to spend your day doing activities with family and friends, having picnic there wasnt a bad idea at all. but if i had to give you one advice, it will be: BRING YOUR MOSQUITOES REPELLENT."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"On advice of friends we went to visit gardens and were amazed at their size and beauty and it's free to get in ! The hop on off bus stops right outside .
$5 extra to visit the orchid garden is a must it is so worth it I didn't realise just how many types there are.
Having visited Qew in London which was disappointing and cost a fortune this is a jewel in Singapore's crown
Heat permitting you could spend a whole day there easily there are plenty of places to eat there too."
,,Classic,5.0,,Always good. Jacob Ballad is fantastic for kids. The gardens itself is fabulous to walk around. Great food place you east as well. All round enjoyable day out.
,,Greener garden every where,3.0,,"This is my first visit before and after Singapore Botanic garden recomended as the world heritage site.
Its very concenient reach location via mrt train right to the front entrance gate.
You can spend the whole day activities that includes the world largest orchid garden display, tracks to do naturae walk. Big fields for outdoor activities.big ponds with plants & watch perfornance stage play. Do bring your drink & food if you intend to stay long hours.since food availability is a little inconvenience."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We had a fantastic time wandering round looking at all the different plants. The gardens are well set out. We go here via the hop on hop off bus then when we had finished walked to the MRT.
,,Heavenly particularly during their Orchid display month.,5.0,,"These are fabulous Botanic Gardens. A huge expanse of gardens of all kinds from lakes through to the Orchid displays. If you are visiting Singapore, take time out to relax in these magnificent park lands, and if you love flowers and in particular orchids, make sure you plan you itinerary to go during their Orchid show,"
,,It is a place worth visiting over and over again,5.0,,"Botanic Garden is a great place to visit for young and old. For older folks, there are a few special gardens within the botanic garden you can visit, such as the Orchid Garden and Butterfly Garden. For the young children, they can scoot around within the vast park area. It is also a good place to have picnic, if you don't mind the humidity. For us, this garden is a great place to have brunch and relax or sometimes picnic with the kids.

There are many restaurants within the park that serve good food. Our favourite is Casa Verde. We love to go there for weekend brunch or breakfast. The ambience here is the best as you can enjoy the greenery of the park while you enjoy your meal and have a chat. However, note that this place can get really crowded over the weekend as the locals like to come here in the morning with their families and also dogs.

Botanic Garden also has an outdoor stage called Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage. Here, there are free performance that you can catch while sitting on the grass and enjoying the music. Keep a look out on the dates at the Botanic Garden website on ""Concert in the Park"". It is usually very popular, so go early and get a place to lay your picnic mat.

The Garden is a huge place to explore. There is also another good western style brunch restaurant closer to the Tanglin Gate called Food for Thought. This is another popular place with families, as there is an outdoor playground next to it.

Nearby to the restaurant, you can also buy fish food from the dispensers at $1 each and feed the fish. My young children love doing this.

All in all, the Botanic Garden is a great place to visit and get away from the bustling city crowd. Just make sure you check the weather before heading here. It can get a little hot sometimes. Bring your own bottled water, buying them in the garden can be quite costly."
,,Hidden gems,4.0,,"I borrowed ishai terms in food street program hehe
I don't exactly plan to go to this garden but apparently when you need to go to nus bukit timah campus by mrt, you will bypass this garden
I see swan lake and there's black swan!
This garden can be reach through botanic garden mrt"
,,A must see,5.0,,"Singapore Botanics is really beautiful and much bigger than you'd image.

Come here for a walk with a big bottle of water (refill fountains and loos are all over the place) and a towel because it will be sweaty! Some nice cafes for lunch and my favourite is the popular Casa Verde (try the laksa!)"
,,A true pearl,5.0,,"Going to Singapore and not going to the botanical garden is a crime. This garden is that wonderful! You need time there, time to sit down and enjoy the view and the silence. The contrast to the rest of Singapore is huge. Visit the Orchid garden and enjoy the big and small flowers and all the color they offer. Do not forget your good camera, you will never see anything like this."
,,Photo event,5.0,,"We visit the gardens regularly to teach photography. The area is big and open and can handle large crowds. Parking can be a issue if a event is going on expect to wait up to 30mins or more. There are a few food places on location, would be nice if throughout the garden you could get drinks as it can be a long hot walk. The signs at the park are not to helpful nor is the app so pick up a map before you start. I can not say kids of any age would enjoy this place as it is just a big open garden. However bring some toys and a picnic and maybe. The place is filled with friends of all ages having picnics and sometimes enjoying the free concert. So a nice place to spend a date or a nice day with your spouse."
,,Ingenious Marketing,4.0,,"Orchids are common in other countries, but Singapore tries a little harder to promote its orchids business. So visiting dignitaries are invited to name new hybrid orchids using their names. Latest of these dignitaries include President Xi Jinping and his wife of China. Then there are the Risis orchids, real orchid flowers coated with gold. The National Orchid Garden at the Botanic Garden is surely a must for visitors who love nature and particularly orchids. It has just been promoted to the status of a World Heritage Site, for amongst other things, the fact that rubber was first planted in this part of the world there. Rubber of course turned out to be a great cash earner, before the invention of synthetic rubber."
,,Simply wonderful,5.0,,It's huge. Took us two days to visit and we still not see everything. Amazing that it's free. Love nature and Singapore you must be proud of these gardens as they are simply wonderful.
,,Totally stunning !,5.0,,If you only have time to do ONE THING in Singapore then make it the Botanic Gardens. There is nowhere else quite like it in the world.
,,Beautiful setting,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a gorgeous attraction. There were so many unique flowers in the gardens. It's a great rainy day tour. Accessible via public transportation and affordable.
,,Creative and beautiful,5.0,,"I visited the Botanic Gardens twice. First time we where watching an classic orchestra at the shaw symphony stage. Many people brought their picknick set. So did we and had an enjoyable afternoon! Second time we took the chance to look at the garden it self. You cant miss a tour through the orchid garden. Personally I was very impressed by the evolution garden altough we walked in the wrong direction. I tells about the evolution of flora and fauna through out the years from stone age till present! Bring your drinking water along, you will need it and it's expensive there."
,,Get lost in the city!,5.0,,Really love the jungle like surroundings mixed with civilized pathways and the sounds of so many birds. Fab to wander round and catch your breath from being in the city. Nice café and shop too.
,,worth place to visit,1.0,,"small portion of the rain forest extract , small piece of land exist among the buildings , place to rest , quiet, but crowded can reach via MRT, good for the family Surprised by the turtles on the lake will recommend"
,,"Glorious place to walk, rest and try your photography skills.",5.0,,"It was a pleasure to spend time in this free-to-visit slice of tropical paradise. The gardens are immaculately kept and are an absolute must-see on a visit to Singapore. A rainforest walk, orchid garden, ginger garden and lake are amongst the many delights and the gardens are fantastic for any keen photographers. There is also a lovely gift shop with tasteful gifts."
,,Great day out!,5.0,,"Really enjoyed this place, expected to spend couple of hours here but spent 4hrs and still didn't see all. Entry free but Paid the small cost to go in the Orchard gardens etc- well worth it! Would love to go when there is a concert on. Will go again when back in Singapore."
,,Beautiful place.,5.0,,"Whatever you do whilst in Singapore this is one of the places you must go too, its free to get in, its a massive place with so much to see and do, we spent over two hours walking and looking around and still don't think we saw everything, only thing we were disappointed with was there wasn't a concert on at the time of our visit, would love to come back and see one, you've got to go."
,,A good place to find various plantations and exercise,5.0,,"This is a well maintain garden where visitors can enjoy in the park for free!
It is easy to access through train station.
The garden itself is big and you can spend at least half day to explore the whole garden.
Overall a great place to visit"
,,Old-style garden - very lovely,5.0,,"If you are pressed for time, go to Gardens by the Bay; however, if you love gardens and would rather be outside than shop, etc., the Singapore Botanic Garden has a myriad of trails, pools, gardens (including the National Orchid Garden $). There is a metro stop that takes you to the far end, and if you walk all the way through you come out at the end of Oarchard Rd (main shopping district)."
,,It is too big to know what you really want to see,4.0,,"It is for sure the greatest botanic gardens from both the size and variety aspects. If you are not to jog in there or to have a quick look, you need to do your own homework in advance to decide which gate you want to get in and which gardens you like to visit, otherwise, you are just like getting into a maze. Normally, you don't expect one full day in there as it is too big and you should be ready to escape once the rain pours. It is definitely a place you don't want to miss as a visitor to Singapore."
,,Best half day you can spend in Singapore,5.0,,"Beautifully laid out and maintained gardens with strong sense of time depth. Good free tours at weekends and other than the excellent Orchid Gardens it's free. MRT station is right by entrance. Good eating options available. Highly recommended, especially in comparison with Gardens by the Bay."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"the botanc garden was my favorite in Singapore. i loved the beautiful central location and the flowers, plants amazing all over in the garden"
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed walking the grounds at the botanical gardens. Unique plants, well maintained grounds and very enjoyable exhibits. Walking shoes recommended."
,,"Nice, but you must like flowers to fint it attractive.",3.0,,"I was at this place with my buddy. We found it a nice place, but you must have a special interest in flowers to find it great."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"In green Singapore and despite new attractions like Gardens by the Bay, this old Botanical Gardens is a must visit. The orchid garden (paid entry) is beautiful as is the Cooled Tropical Forest and even the restaurant near the Orchid Garden is worth a munch stop."
,,"Large, Beautiful, Peaceful Garden in Singapore",4.0,,"A place for a long leisurely stroll, this large garden is actually a group of separate sections. The trees and plants are well-labelled. The park is neat and well-maintained, and there is ample space to handle crowds.

The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Parts of the gardens include a Swan Lake, Rain Forest, Healing Garden, Evolution Garden, Ginger Garden, etc. The beautiful National Orchid Garden is a part of the Botanic Gardens (with separate entry fee).

There are lots of places to sit and relax and also ample opportunities for clicking photos.

Foods stalls are available at specified places.

Entry to the main Gardens is free.

It is really great to see so much nature packed into an urban space like Singapore - also that it continues to be maintained so well."
,,One of the World's Best,5.0,,"I came to Singapore in part to see these gardens and I was not disappointed. Expansive grounds in the British tradition that highlight the botanical glory of tropical Asia. And, everything was perfect ... maybe even too perfect but beautiful nonetheless."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Great place for people watching. The gardens are huge so we only went to some parts. The orchids were our favourites. Good maps and sign posts so you don't get lost.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,The garden is very unique and offers beautiful views. It would take about half a day to walk through most of the attraction and it well worth it.
,,Timeless Experience,5.0,,Just love the place. Been visiting it since my childhood. Great for the whole family. Excellent for friends to come together and explore. Love the eco garden for children and grownups. Lovely restaurant available. A must visit world heritage site. Just make sure that you are prepared for wet weather in view of Singapore's unpredictable climate.
,,A peaceful place,5.0,,"We took a bus to here from the city centre, very accessible. Beautiful place for walks, with a lovely orchid garden (not all in flower in November). There is a cafe and restaurant, and the usual National Trust type shop."
,,Beauty In A Red Dot,4.0,,"In the heart of a Red Dot(Singapore), a beautiful park to walk and enjoy the trees and flowers. Musical play occasionally is available to the public in the evening."
,,Large,4.0,,"A nice stroll in this nice and large botanical garden is recommended. There's an orchid park within this botanical garden. Also, many large tropical plants. It's well maintained and clean, and is recommend for those who enjoy parks and greeneries."
,,Flora and fauna,5.0,,"We walked here from our hotel on Orchard Road, but the HOHO buses stop here and it is also easy to get to by local buses. We started by having breakfast at the cafe, which was great but we were surrounded by people with little happy dogs. The dogs behaved like spoiled children so it was good to escape into the garden.
We spent 4 hours strolling round and took lots of photos of both the beautiful plant displays and the many wild birds which live here. We also saw monitor lizards by the Swan pool. If you want to see them walk on the shady wooded side of the pool.
We particularly enjoyed travelling through time in the evolution garden and finding cures for flatulence in the herbal medicine garden.
Take water with you and when your bottle is empty you can top it up at any of the drinking water fountains, usually located close by the toilets. It is safe to drink the water in Singapore. Also take a camera with lots of memory as there are so many photo ops. The orchid garden located in the botanical garden can be visited for a charge, the gardens are free, but if you are on a tight budget just go to the entrance where there is a beautiful display of orchids which you can enjoy for no charge.
A great day out, but pace yourself if you are not used to the heat and high humidity and don't forget your water bottle!"
,,Nice greenery,3.0,,This is one of the nicest nature place in hot and humid singapore. You may wish to have picnic with your family there.
,,Wonderful place for a Picnic,5.0,,"I surprised my husband with a picnic here. The lush greenery & ponds around make your forget you're in a metropolis & we quite enjoyed it. I didn't see many picnic areas around so packing a blanket would be handy. I've found its a lot busier on Saturdays than Sundays. Also, you might see a Monitor Lizard (I think that's what they're called) roaming around while you're there. They aren't dangerous & tend you give you space. Lovely interaction with Nature! Best to wear comfy shoes if you'd like to see all of the Gardens as its quite big."
,,Greenery in heart of City,3.0,,"Definitely a pleasant and restful place to walk, jog and run, in the midst of century -old trees and fauna.
The magnificent Orchid Gardens is located here, and the many orchid varieties will blow your mind away.
Recently, lauded with the UNESCO Heritage Site status, the Gardens has gone from strength to strength, but it is no comparison still to the Buchart Gardens in Victoria Island or that colorful Keukenhof Gardens in Holland.
A 2 hour walk round, either in the early morning or late evening should suffice, given the heat and humidity here."
,,It's a usual Botanic Garden,3.0,,it's good have a look within the garden. but it's look like all same botanic garden. But it is well maintained
,,Escape from the city,5.0,,"This is beautiful, clean and simple If you are planning for an escape from the busy singapore city, come over, spend a day, enjoy the beauty of nature"
,,Astonishment,4.0,,It is Singapore first unesco world heritage. The name itself telling you must have a look. It is walking distant from Orchard Road. So you can plan this route
,,"Beautiful gardens, perfect for a picnic",5.0,,"Going for a stroll around the Singapore Botanic Gardens should definitely be on the to do list for any visitors to Singapore. The rainforest walkways are a highlight, as are the orchid gardens. Food for Thought, which is a restaurant at the centre of the park, provides good value picnic baskets including a picnic blanket to sit on. In case you come unprepared like we did!"
,,Photographers heaven,5.0,,"I absolutely love the Botanic Garden in SG, as well as the Orchard Garden that is also located there. I have been back several times and i have still not seen it all! Its is a great place to escape from the city and is definitely a Photographers heaven. Make sure you take lots of water and a snack :)"
,,Delightful Gardens,5.0,,It's always a pleasure to visit the gardens and this time we spent our time in the National Orchid Garden which has the largest display of orchids in the world and the Ginger Garden.
,,Serenity,3.0,,Peaceful and serene. Love the graceful swans on the lake. Got the chance to see up close. Love my experience to the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
,,My highlight of Singapore,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are manicured, and well maintained. They cater for all, botanists, tourists and a place for local people to hang out, work out have picnics and walk their dogs. It is a marvellous green space, with much to see. There are restaurants and catering to suit all budgets. The Orchid Garden is the only bit you pay for and that was beautiful and worth the money"
,,Escape the city,5.0,,"If you are wanting to escape the city life come here! It's free to walk around the park and sit down and have a picnic! Otis so lovely to see all the different parts of the garden and the garden is huge!! There are places to fill you water bottle if you need, bathrooms and places to eat. But really the beauty of nature is what will really get you wanting to go and not wanting to leave."
,,Beautiful landscaping with many quiet spaces,5.0,,"I always love a walk in the Singapore Botanic Garden as there is lots of open space, diverse range of trees and flowers. I love to picnic there in the lake evening. Love the integration of sculptures made by local artist around the whole park."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,Plenty to see in the gardens. Lots of colour and tropical plants all around and a great walk through the rain forest. Nice little cafe near the entrance where the food was lovely.
,,Terrific most do,5.0,,"Now a world heritage site, would recommend. This is something that is free and to have so much open space dedicated to nature in the heart of Singapore makes this place quite unique"
,,A Great Place to Spend an Afternoon,5.0,,"What a great place. We spent an afternoon here after checking into Raffles. The highlight were the Swan Lake, Orchid Garden and many separate gardens like the Rain Forest. This place is definitely worth the visit."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,Allow at least half a day for the visit and carry plenty of drinking water. It's very hot and humid as you might expect but absolutely stunning.
,,Lovely setting and offers s glimpse into an older time.,5.0,,This is an easy place to visit and improves your insight in Old Singapore. Very quiet and peaceful and easy to walk through.
,,A special place in Singapore.,5.0,,"A Great facility. Free to the public, excellent pathways, nominal fee for specialty gardens, easily accessible by Subway, numerous food facilities available and clean public restrooms, several gift shops to be found, immaculately maintained, of interest to gardeners, photographers and anyone who enjoys a respite in a natural environment."
,,Thè most impressive orchid variety I have ever seen!,5.0,,The botanical garden houses an impressiv variety of orchids from around the world. Definetly a must see if you are in Singapore. They have the most amazing colors and shapes. They have a gift shop where you can buy items made out of these orchids. It was a treat of nature being there!
,,Singapore highlight,5.0,,"We spent a morning at the Gardens... it was well worth the time. About half the time we just walked through gardens just relaxing and looking at all the trees. The ""rain forest"" was my favorite. There is no admission charge, so lots of local, especially young mothers with babies were there just taking I the sights. The second half of the morning was in the orchid garden. This was unique in my experience...there was an incredible number of orchids...all were beautiful. There were a lot of people in there....if I were to do it again, I would hit the orchids first. There was a charge, but it was not excessive. Also, there is a gift shop....they had lots of orchid oriented gifts.

If you visit Singapore, you really should,visit the gardens.

We got there by taxi. When leaving, we saw a sign for the MRT for 1.2 km so we decided to walk. After about 15 min, we came to another sign still saying 1.2 km....10 min later we came to another sign saying 1.6 km. We were not lost, we just followed the signs. The total walk is probably 3.5 km. I think over time they have reworked the trails and not updated the signs."
,,Tropical lush treat!,5.0,,"My wife & I experienced this truly amazing garden. The trees, plants and landscaping were some of the best I have ever seen. I would highly recommend a trip to visit this beautiful tropical lush wonderland!"
,,A relaxing place for the whole family!,4.0,,"Great for families with small kids as there's a lot of wide spaces for the kids to run! If you like to get in touch with the nature but don't want to get dirty, here is the place to be! Great place to have a picnic or read a book by the lake"
,,"great place for kids, dogs, or any one to simply lay back and enjoy mother earth",5.0,,"if you are into plants, do follow the tracks and all the little paths. the garden offers a wide variety of plants from all around the world, you name it!

the park is also open until late at night where many people choose to jog and do yoga, or simply lay back and enjoy the night sky.

Do come here if you visit Singapore. There are no negative sides at all!
The bad ratings are only given by those who don't appreciate nature!

After a day at the [park, ending it at Cafe Verde is great. You can see it on the map you are given at the entrance. :)"
,,Best Garden in Singapore,4.0,,"This garden is really well taken care. Thank you to the management and gardeners. It has nice landscapes and all the plants and trees are well planned to suit the environment, so blended in."
,,Simply amazing!,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is simply amazing! The orchids were my favourite. Outstandingly beautiful. The rainforest is nice and cool. You can stop here with the hop-on, hop-off bus services. It's really a must."
,,"Beautiful, peaceful place.",5.0,,"This is the perfect place to come for a relaxing day. Lots of people were out taking walks and having picnics. The gardens are very large and after walking around for over an hour, I didn't even make it half way through. There are lots of beautiful plants specialized gardens and best of all, it's free to come here."
,,Brilliant and free,5.0,,"A highlight of my day was a walk around just a part of these botanical gardens, entry via the visitors centre , then a cafe where you can have breakfast , then a stroll through the best tropical botanical gardens I have seen , very pretty , not too hard a walk , take water , dogs on leash obviously permitted, these gardens were a highlight"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Wow what a lovely day walking the park amongst the locals enjoying their weekend.
The Orchid garden was so pretty! Just a shame that some of the tourist had a total lack of regard for the flowers and continued to handle them! I saw one women adjusting a bird of paradise just so she could get a better photo!
I didn't let it spoil my day!"
,,"Beautiful, extensive park/gardens",5.0,,"The gardens are huge, and (obviously) outdoors, which means you are in tropical heat and sunshine and which, being from the UK, we are not used to!! But they are absolutely worth it. We walked slowly from one end of the gardens to the other - probably a 2 hour stroll not counting the time spent in the fantastic Orchid House. We went past the large Swan Lake, with several pairs of swans swimming around, apparently quite happy, although a notice informs you that they are a gift from Amsterdam, so clearly they have acclimatised!!"
,,A visit of traditional gardens,5.0,,Loved the walk through the gardens and a must do in the morning before the heat of the day and crowds. The evolution garden was also very informative and well presented Nice escape from shopping malls and eating
,,A must visit in Singapore.,5.0,,This must be one of the best free attractions in the world.A cool walk through a maze of beautiful gardens .Don't miss the orchid garden only $5 or $1 if you are over 60years old.
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"You can spend all day walking round here,as we did.It's free too!Don't miss the rainforest walk-some original rain forest and the walk takes 15 min.It's a raised wood board walk so you don't need to worry about creepy crawlies,just miss them in the storms,which seem to hit after midday in the rainy season (this month is that season).Wear insect repellant as we got bitten when we didn't.The evolution area is the best-you go through time with the plants and trees and rocks!Really felt like you were going back in time.The orchid garden is 5 dollars and is worth visiting,really pretty.They have a nice restaurant where it was 15 (about 7 quid) dollars for some nice rice with pork soup,although it did seem quite expensive for what it was.Only 4 dollars (about £2) for freahly squeezed watermelon juice!Lots of nice clean and free toilets too,as per usual in Singapore."
,,Great place for nature and flower lovers,5.0,,Been there many times already and will go there again. It is nicely sketched and lots of marvelous flowers can be found here. I prefer the more quiet areas as the garden of healing plants or the rain forest.
,,Excellent place of walkers & nature lovers,5.0,,I came to Botanic gardens by bus from Orchid. Excellent place of walkers & joggers. The foot path was very clean. There are wooden benches in shelters for those who want to take brief rest & admire the beauty. There is one beautiful swan pond in botanical gardens with a statue of flying swans. Trees are named meticulously with placards. There is one statue of a woman holding a bird. Entry is free.
,,"Beautiful, and so close to Orchard Road",5.0,,"I spent the better part of a day here, and still did not see everything. I arrived by MRT. The walks are well shaded, and there is a good sized children's garden (only for accompanied children; solo kids or adults cannot enter, which is fine). Singapore seems to cater to children in its parks quite well (and also via the mini toilets for kids in the adult restrooms all over the city :) ).

I loved the remnant rainforest. A sign there said this rainforest was only a 15 minute walk from Orchard Rd. I the returned on foot to Orchard rd quite easily. The gardens looked much farther away on the free tourist map!

All paths were lovely, and the garden was alive with birds and insects. I hope to return someday, especially with my young son to check out the children's gardens. The gift shop has lovely wares, and the food at the nearby cafe was yummy. Iced coffee is just milk coffee with ice! But a refreshing drink in sunny, tropical Singapore."
,,Oasis in the city,5.0,,It's a great place to unwind and relax. I can imagine this place is lovely during weekends/holidays with lots of families having a picnic.
,,Beyond words,5.0,,"A rain forest In a middle of the singapore city!!! There's an Orchid garden for $5, (however apart from that area there is no charge to enter) which is so incredibly worth it! There's a gift shop and resteraunt in the garden and you can easily get there via taxi, or bus. Highly recommended."
,,Always worth a visit,5.0,,"Just a great place to visit. I visit Singapore every few years and each time, these gardens are on my itinerary even with the limited time I have had in the city. The orchids never disappoint."
,,Beautiful and free!,4.0,,These gardens are a very nice way to take an afternoon off from the busy city. It's extremely large so plan a full afternoon. Don't forget to check out the orchid garden. It's beautiful!
,,Fantastic Gardens - a real must for tourists.,5.0,,"After the cactus house disapointment we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves in a real nature park. One of the best we have ever seen, trees and bushes and a fantastic Orchid Garden. One must pay a little extra for it but it`s worth every cent. The tropical weather helped us with reality of the rain forest, but after half an hour we were dry again. We spen 4 hours wandering this paradise and hope you will do the same."
,,Beautiful park right in the city,5.0,,"There are two metro lines with one stop right at the entrance. They are quite large with several specific areas like the rain forest, the bamboo garden, and a couple of lakes. The garden is beautiful and peaceful with areas for children but not too many shelters, so not advisable if rain threatens. The restaurant was excellent although a bit expensive. However, it was a great break with excellent service in the covered patio. Loved it!"
,,an island of green,4.0,,"While Singapore is a fantastic city/country, it is very urban. The Botanic Gardens is a fantastic island of green. Strolling through is very relaxing and very informative, as most of the plants are labeled. Very worth a visit."
,,Very peaceful,5.0,,A very nice place to visit in the middle of the bustling city. The highlight is the orchard garden. Plenty of unusual plants to see.
,,An oasis in the city,5.0,,Get away from the hussle of the city and experience the tranquil beauty of the Botanic Gardens. It's all free (except for entry into the National Orchid Gardens) and is an absolute joy to stroll around.
,,Another part of Singapores social and cultural heritage,4.0,,"The gardens are easily accessible by train or bus They were established in 1859 and form an integral part of Singapores social and cultural heritage as re inforced by Lee Kuan Yew in the 1960s. They are the most visited botanical gardens in the world
Overall as with all of Singapores gardens they are superb and must be visited"
,,Sanctuary of Singapore,5.0,,We have visited the Botanic Gardens twice already and its just such a peaceful and amazing place. There is a good reason that it made it to the World Heritage List.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Visiting the Botanic Gardens was one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore. There is no entrance fee and the views are superb.
,,so much to see,5.0,,"our prime objective was to see the ginger garden, but when we started looking around, there really was so much to see, our two hours there were not enough you need at least a good 4 hours to appreciate even a small amount."
,,Awesome for Botany Lovers,5.0,,Not great for those who do not like to walk...great for those who do! It has several different areas and we hit them all. We all loved it and we did it on oue own using the MRT.
,,Worth a full daytrip,5.0,,I loved the place. There are so many gardens within. Orchard Garden is the best of them all. There is ticket for orchard garden. I also loved the feel of Rain Forrest. Though it was very humid so be prepared for that.
,,One of the best garden you can visit in your trips !,5.0,,"Singapore gardens are world famous and when I visited it I saw why !
It's very close by the city center . No entrance fee , except the orchid garden that you must pay 5 sdollars.
If you are a natura lover , like me this place is for you and need many many hours to walk around , relax , take amazing pictures and of course stare the malificent theme parts of the garden.
My favorite one was the swan lake !
Tip. It's big , choose a day that you really have time to see it , and of course not a rainy day !"
,,Oh the serenity,5.0,,"This place is an adventure on its own. Stroll around the gardens, laze on the grass or grab a bite to eat.
Kids were given a oragami butterfly by a local who came up to us. The waterfall is a great place to dunk your head to cool down."
,,A peaceful oasis awake from the city.,5.0,,"Spent a couple of hours here but could have stayed much longer. A gorgeous expanse of gardens to walk around with numerous trees, flowers and wildlife to be seen. Easy to get to ( I used the open top bus) and all the usual amenities are available including food and drink which was reasonably priced. All in all this was one place which I'm pleased I visited and only did so based on the Trip Advisor reviews. If you're visiting Singapore, take a couple of hours out to come here!"
,,A peaceful place in the heart of a busy city,5.0,,"Possibly my favourite place in Singapore, the Botanic Gardens became a UNESCO
World Heritage site this year in July. Well deserved. The gardens are a gem. Fabulous trees and flowers to enjoy as well as a peaceful place to sit and relax. And entry is free!"
,,MUST SEE!,5.0,,Visited the gardens at night and wandered around the grounds until the light and music show began. Unlike anything I've ever experienced. Not just an attraction for kids and families either. Worth walking back downtown over the brides after to get the most amazing views of the city skyline at night. Would be back in a heartbeat!
,,A must for nature lovers,5.0,,"If you're even remotely interested in nature, this is a must! The collection is amazing, the grounds beautifully maintained (not that you'll EVER actually see anyone working! You'll find yourself wondering when they actually get anything done since they have such extended opening hours and there's not a gardener in sight). It's also heartwarming to see all the families who come here to picnic and spend time together. Children and adults alike are playing games like football and badminton and running around on the lawns. Nice to see kids acting like kids instead of on their phones. I feel like you could skip the Orchid garden, which is the only part of the garden you have to pay admission to. That being said, it's cheap at $5 and the Cool Room was very interesting. Outside of the cool room, I didn't find many orchids that you can't buy in any garden center most grocery stores in the US. They are arranged rather than growing in a natural fashion, so you might enjoy it if arrangements are your cup of tea."
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,"We visited these gardens as a stop-off from the open bus tour. Very lovely, good café and the best souvenir shop I have seen for a long time."
,,Beautiful and real experience,5.0,,"This is a really large park-like area with significant amount of various trees, bushes, flowers as well as animals. We saw 1.5 metre lizards walking in the walkways, enjoyed beautiful landscapes, ponds and the scenary overall. Even though there was lots of people (Sun p.m.) the place did not feel crowded, and it seemed like people are coming over with their families to enjoy picnic. Entry is 5 SG dollars to see the orchid garded, so cheap experience overall. We'd love to go there again !"
,,Great park - as long you can take the humid weather,5.0,,"It's a great park - nowadays a world heritage site... Nice to have a chill-out wall thru day or evening - just bring a bottle of water, as the humid weather can be challenging."
,,Great way to spend a day at the Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens are another not to be missed attraction but allow the best part of a day to walk around all of the gardens and visit the National Orchid Garden. It is nicely laid out and the walks all signposted so it's almost impossible to get lost. Make sure you go on a day when it is not too rainy.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"We're not botanical people but so many raved that we fit this into our three days in Singapore: very pretty, expansive acreage. The best part was the national orchid garden--gorgeous even though it wasn't the peak season (see separate review). Caution: There are two entrances. One is very near the Orchard metro. If you walk across the park and out the other end, you have to figure out a bus to get to the other metro. Or, as we did, walk quite a bit to find a taxi. Otherwise you need to walk back through the park the way you came."
,,A treat for the family,5.0,,We had a relaxing evening stroll with the kids at the Gardens. A lovely respite from the hustle and bustle of this city. The cafe Food for Thought is also quite good if you are hungry after the walk.
,,A great day out,5.0,,"Perhaps in fairness more than a day is required to explore the gardens properly - you can either take your own picnic or eat at one of several restaurants inside the gardens - but it might be wise to book if you choose the latter option. The gardens offer a number of themed areas - with emphasis upon the orchids (payment require) medicinal plants, palms around Symphony Pond and more open areas around Swan Lake. Take plenty of water with you - as you will be exploring/walking quite a lot and your camera which if you have a macro feature on your wide angle lens you will enjoy quite a deal."
,,Gorgeous Gardens.,5.0,,The largest collection of orchids in the world are in the center of this large garden. It was recently declared a Unesco World Heritage Site. You will not find a more beautiful garden on earth.
,,A must do on the list,5.0,,"Among the things that makes Singapore so special are its parks and its natural flora. The botanic gardens showcase the most beautiful of the species that flourish in the hot, humid weather Singapore enjoys. There are multiple, specialized gardens within the park, but the highlights are the ginger and orchid gardens. Only the orchid garden requires a fee to enter, but it's also unbelievably beautiful with multiple orchid varieties on display. Just remember both sunblock and a rain hat. The weather often shifts back and forth."
,,A Wonderland of Flora,5.0,,"Acres and acres of surprises if you like gardens, flowers, trees and plants you may not see anywhere else. The National Orchid Garden is a treasure not to be missed."
,,Paradise,4.0,,Great Gardens very beautiful and tropical.one of the place to visit when you like to get away from the noisy street
,,A garden oasis,3.0,,Lovely go walk around and enjoy the tropical jungle in the midst of the over-built city. A small coffee shop allows you enjoy your tea break and rest your tired feet.
,,Nice little Oasis,4.0,,"One of the few tings to do in Singapore with kids, that doesn't cost a fortune. In fact it is free. We enjoyed a few hours here one afternoon, and the kids enjoyed the open space and lakes. The kids area is mostly for smaller children, but nice and well kept."
,,Beautifully kept garden,5.0,,Various themes each with wonderful collection. Go further than orchid garden. The foliage garden is lovely.
,,Really good!,5.0,,"We stopped of at the Botanic Gardens during our open top bus tour of the city and are glad we did. They are free to enter, beautifully laid out and very well maintained. There is great variety of trees and plants and is an oasis of calm in the busy city. There is a small cafe by the entrance. Certainly worth a visit."
,,Lovely way to start a trip to Singapore - nice and peaceful to stroll through the gardens and forget your jetlag.,5.0,,"So many different garden styles (rainforest, Japanese, Ginger) and don't forget the National Orchid Garden - fantastic to see the beautiful blooms"
,,Nature at the heart of the city!,4.0,,"This one is for the nature lover in you. It's wide and green all around. Fresh air, trees as old as time and animals freely roaming on their natural habitat will greet you in an instant.

What i wish is for the graden to have more waiting sheds or booths in case of rain ( we were wet and had to walk more than 300meters under the pouring rain to find a shed ... but it was a fun experience!). Also, more posts for guides to help those who may get lost along the way.

Overall, the park is very relaxing."
,,Beautiful place for a walk and educational...,5.0,,"Loved walking around this beautifully maintained gardens, well cared for and well marked. Well worth the 1/2 day we spent there and an awesome experience...we will go back...we spent time on a rainy day and there was shelter and we loved it as we had not seen rain for a long time. It was great for the experience, particularly in the rainforest area! Might not be for everyone in the really rainy season..."
,,Amazingly Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"Really, so beautiful garden i ever had,so much greenery, Got to know different types of plants and flowers. I want to visit again."
,,Great way to spend a relaxing few hours,5.0,,I do fitness classes here but I love these gardens for picnic's or lying out with a good book. There are fishes you can feed at the Tanglin Gate and a large pond near Nassim Gate with loads of turtles.
,,Lots of Exotic Plants,5.0,,It deserves to be declared a World Heritage Site. A nice place to go for a walk and view tropical plants.
,,Lush vegetation,4.0,,Very well maintained gardens but not a huge amount of flowers - likely because of the time I went. A lot of pathways for you to walk and different sections that display different types of flora from around the world. It can be a bit of a hike to get to depending on where you're staying so do a bit of research. Make sure you bring lots of water and some sunscreen if you are going to be spending a bit of time exploring.
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,If you have visited Garden by the Bay you can skip this attraction If you have shortage of time. This is nice place and worth visiting
,,So may orchids and so little time,5.0,,Beautiful garden with a wide variety of orchids. I am an orchid fan so this is such a treat when we went as part of our Singapore city tour. So amazing.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Well worth a look when you have a couple of hours to spare in Singapore. Stunning displays and very relaxing walks through the gardens. Beautiful!
,,A beautiful garden,4.0,,"If you love to walk in nature & if your are a nature lover, this is the right place for you.Try to visit every spot as per its map.There are different holidays for particular spots. Better to check that in the webpage of National parks.There are different gateway to enter in to the Botanical garden.Check the street directory for your access point"
,,UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE,5.0,,"As a Singaporean, I am proud to share this attraction with anyone. Singapore Botanic Gardens 新加坡植物园 is classified as UNESCO World Heritage Site as of 2015.

The gardens was creatded back in 1859 and is a well loved outdoor area for visitors from all walks of life. I even recalled my parents telling me that back in the 70s, 80s (before the internet and wifi), this garden also a great place for dates.

This place is free and lots of green space around. Easily accessible with a MRT station (Botanic Gardens on Circle Line). On weekends, there are even live open-air concerts for visitors to enjoy.

The National Orchid Garden located in the gardens is a must-visit attraction. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Singapore.

Best time to visit - Early Morning. Fresh Air and take in all the greenery."
,,"Peace and beauty amidst a busy, crowded city",5.0,,"Walking around Singspore can be tough, what with all the construction going on, plus lots of places seem a bit low on sidewalks, plus it is hot much of the year. So sashay on over to these lovely gardens which will give you peaceful paths, some up and down but not too much, and lots of different things to see and enjoy. There is a little rain forest with some wonderful trees and vines, a wonderful collection of orchids, some specially bred and named after various celebrities (like the President of China, who recently visited Singapore), a greenhouse-type building that is amazingly moist to preserve the special plants it nurtures, some open spaces, and more. Take your time, enjoy watching the other visitors, and get a little peace for your soul."
,,Nice stroll in a tropical forest,5.0,,"Free access to the gardens, beautiful palm tree valley, bougainvilleas, and the herbal garden should not be missed."
,,A place for beauty and meditation,5.0,,Singapore Botanical Gardens are a wonderful place to go for a morning walk. It is so relaxing. The gardens are well cared for and excel in beauty. I always do my little meditation as I walk around.
,,Wander through paradise,5.0,,The botanic gardens are always a delight. You can spend hours meandering around the many varied gardens and be transformed by the beauty of nature. Take in a ginger tea at Halia which will revive you however hot you have been You can do yoga or tai chi. Walk your dog. Visit the orchid garden or just sit in peace Beautiful
,,An excellent oasis in a busy city,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens is a green gem in an otherwise concrete environment. Over the years, it has been expanded to take in more space. The designation of the Gardens as a world heritage site is well-deserved. Visitors interested in tropical plants will find much to engage them. There is a small vestige of the rainforest right in the gardens. The orchid garden is particularly beautiful. The best time to go is early in the morning before it gets really hot. The greenery is a balm for the soul."
,,Rainy but relaxing afternoon,5.0,,"This destination is perfect for seekers of peace and quiet, nature lovers and educational travellers. The garden was super close to the SMRT and has its own station, so no problems on getting there. Entrance is free. We recommend that you allocate one whole day to enjoy and explore the grounds, wear comfy walking shoes and airy clothes, bring sunglasses, hats, mosquito repellent and sunblock, and possibly a compass and a map if you have trouble looking for directions.The gardens are well-maintained, clean and peaceful. There are pergolas and shaded areas where one can relax and enjoy the view. There are also lots of eating places inside. We stopped at Casa Verde for lunch; it has a little gift shop as well. Beautiful location, recommended for single travelers, couples, families with children, but not so much for thrill seekers."
,,A great place for a morning brunch,5.0,,"We had a chance to walk the botanical garden on Sunday morning and then had a breakfast brunch there. I do not remember the name of the restaurant located inside, but the food was great. They also offer great natural juice beverages. The Benedict eggs were supreme. It is a bless long to have such a huge lung so close to the city."
,,Learn About Medicinal Plants,5.0,,"This place is very spacious and contains a wide variety of plants that function as drugs. Here we learn and gain new insights about plants that are useful for the treatment. Visit SBG is not recommended during the day, it just feels scorching because this place is an open area."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,A wonderful space - exotic plants - plenty to see especially combined with Orchid gardens. One not to be missed! Free entry to gardens but we paid only 1 dollar for orchid gardens which was a senior rate (over 60's). Easy to get to by public transport but we did use taxi as our hotel was a bit farther away from the gardens. Enter at Tanglin gate and walk from there through wonderful parkland and pristine gardens. Places to stop for a break on route and get refreshment and of course the usual gift shops! Be prepared for the heat though - we went early morning but by about 10 am it was hot and humid. A great place in Singapore for some greenery and open space!
,,Beautiful Botanic Gardens,5.0,,An amazing array of gardens to delight all ages ... they are very well kept and are very clean ... there is so much to see so make sure you leave yourself a few hours ... this is very accessible by MRT as you get off right there ...
,,a must vist place if you a few days,4.0,,Take the metro to botanical gardens station and enjoy your walk through the gardens to the national orchid garden ( small fee). Nice restaurant right beside the orchid gardens for lunch. We spent most of the day there.
,,Good,4.0,,"Its a huge garden...lots of greenery n walkways ...very pleasant. Within its premises is an orchid garden too, with a small fee. Nicely done. Cover it if you have an extra day...its not a must do."
,,Must visit if you're a plant lover,5.0,,This place has history. It has also been recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site. But for me it's the expansive and calm walkways that take the prize. There are countless plans here nearly placed with small cards showing their names. The central lake and it's large trees along the flank are a relaxing sight. Even the areas that are barely a few meters from the busy highways maintain their calm and tranquil. Great for a quiet evening of self reflection.
,,VACATION,4.0,,Good place to visit with family and friends. Easy access by car or bus. One can spend the whole day at this place.
,,"Beautiful gardens, an oasis in a busy city",5.0,,Beautiful gardens and very peaceful in such a busy city. The Orchid Gardens are worth going to-especially the Cool Room on o hot sticky day
,,very good,4.0,,"We walked 5 minutes or so to City Plaza to get the no. 7 bus up to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It was quite a long trip. The weather was sultry with the odd glimmer of sun and we entered by the Tanglin gate and made our way through the various gardens and past the big Swan Lake. The lake, as well as having swans, was packed with animals, terrapins, fish and at least one (because we saw it quite close) great big Monitor Lizard. After the orchid gardens, the rest of the gardens were somewhat more prosaic and it was only about 1.5km to the Botanic Gardens metro station so we wended our way there. The trip to Esplanade took about 40minutes"
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,This was worth seeing. The gardens are very beautiful. For small fee there is the orchard gardens which is worth the visit.
,,A glorious way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"Staying in the Shangri La Hotel this attraction was only minutes away by taxi. The botanical gardens are free to enter (and it is only SG$5 per adult for the orchid gardens). It really is a tranquil place to visit with plants from all around the world.
The gardens are kept immaculate by a large team of gardeners, their passion is obvious.
I am not much of a gardener myself but my wife is and this was on her to do list, however i found myself emersed in all the different flowers, foliage and statues as we walked slowly round the gardens.
We stopped for a refreshing home made drink, made from the ginger grown in the gardens, i think that cost SG$3 per drink and was delicious.
We were there for about three hours and only just scratched the surface of the park. It really is worth a visit, especially early morning (it opens at 5:30am) when it is cooler and less crowded. When land is at such a premium in Singapore they must be congratulated for keeping such a fantastic place open, in such spectacular fashion."
,,Mind blowing!,5.0,,I did not expect to like the Gardens by the Bay. Unbelievable ! Wonderful feat of architecture and beautiful gardens. Cool and enjoyable.
,,A lovely way to spend a few hours.,5.0,,Wandering through these beautiful gardens is very peaceful and quiet. The orchid and bromeliad sections are exceptional. Highly recommended on your visit to Singapore.
,,Beautiful stroll on the park,5.0,,"We have been many times to Singapore and always enjoy botanical gardens its well kept, pretty and very very enjoyable. Well worth a visit and the best thing is it's free"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Easy access by MRT (Circle Line, outside the Bukit Timah gate) or bus. Beautifully maintained, informative and very relaxing on a weekday. Highlights were the National Orchid Garden (SG$5 per adult), palm valley and Symphony Lake and the rain forest exhibit. Take plenty of water or buy from the restaurant/kiosk - surprisingly not overpriced - and make sure you have your sunscreen as some stretches of the gardens are very open to the sun even when Indonesia's incinerating the forests next door. The gardens' website also recommends insect repellent; I got away without, but better safe than sorry, especially if you have children in tow.
I was happy to spend half a day covering everything at a steady clip; if you're travelling with young children the gardens' website is a useful planning tool to maximise your time and minimise their boredom."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The wife and myself only had 3 days in Singapore and this was a must place to visit, and it did not disapoint, fantastic displays and well set out. The weather was to hot to really appreciate an extended walk around."
,,Great place for a night run,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore overnight I highly recommend you visit the Botanical Gardens for a nighttime run. It is well lit and as the crowds are reduced you can really get some pace on and see the whole park. It has a very different atmosphere in the evening providing a relaxing atmosphere if you want to escape the bussle of the city.

The orchid garden is a must see."
,,"Something for everyone! Water park, playground, space, lakes, fun and beauty",5.0,,"A great place to visit as a couple or family. A wonderful place for a BBQ, birthdays , gathering of friends, cooling off. The gardens are beautifully laid out and tended . Many different types of gardens, including a creative appealing children's garden. A tranquil space to read a book in the shade by a lake. Wonderful flowers, especially orchids, Many different areas to explore at leisure."
,,An absolute must for the plant lover,5.0,,What a beautiful place to visit.. Make sure you have plenty of time to see everything there is to see at these beautiful gardens. And bring an umbrella just in case ! There are so many gardens within the gardens and they are all spectacular . Then of course there is the orchid garden ( which is the only part of the gardens you have to pay to enter ) they are truly beautiful and as a lover of bromeliads there is a great collection within this garden as well
,,Relax,3.0,,Good for chill and relax stroll. But will not visit again. Nothing much to do. Once is enough. There is a lot of people on weekends.
,,Huge and Beautiful,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is just away from Orchard Road Shopping area. It's wide open spaces offer a chance to enjoy the sunshine and beauty of Singapore. Admission is free. Inside is the orchid garden and other attractions that do incur a charge. As its a garden, you might want to avoid rainy weather and there will be no air-con for those who suffer from the heat.

There are cafes and rain shelters, however, and plenty of places to stop and rest your weary feet."
,,An oasis of tranquility,4.0,,"Singapore differs from Hong Kong in that the government has always taken an interest in the welfare of its people. Thus, Singapore has a lush botanic garden as an oasis from the heat while Hong Kong has nothing similar. Take a wander around for an hour, it will calm your nerves."
,,Most beautiful botanic garden,5.0,,We stopped here during our bus tour and decided to have a little walk. Really good decision as the garden is beautiful. Every corner is made with love you can easily spend a day or more here.
,,Spectacular orchids,5.0,,Spent a long while wandering the immaculate gardens and particularly the orchid gardens. The chill house was a welcome relief from the humidity. Beautifully kept gardens.
,,Nice calm place in a busy city,5.0,,"Take umbrella (for sun and rain) and water and wear cool comfy clothing as it's quite hot even just walking around. There's a nice outdoor cafe, an interesting medicinal herb garden and plenty of places to sit and enjoy the surroundings. We spotted some unusual birds and even a large lizard/goanna. Make sure you know how far you want to walk as it is large and the MRT stations are a distance away once you get into the middle of the gardens."
,,Wonderful place for an early morning stroll.,5.0,,An oasis in the centre of the City. A bit hilly but worth the effort. Signs throughout the gardens tell the history of Singapore.
,,"Amazing views, even on a rainy day",5.0,,"There is no entry fee for the botanic gardens which can be explored in around 3 hours. Of course, if time allows you can stay there all day long and not be bored. The gardens are well-maintained and worth a visit. There are some eateries and public toilets inside the gardens. The orchid garden is a low-paid attraction (5 SG$ for an adult) with a display of numerous subspecies of orchids. This was my second visit to the gardens and surely not the last one."
,,Last Day of Holiday,5.0,,the gardens were well laid out with plenty of signs pointing out which direction you wished to take we saw a variety of wildlife lizards squirrels and many different birds plenty of public conveinence and places to eat well worth a visit if you need to kill a few hours
,,Extensive beautiful garden.,5.0,,This is a major garden and is maintained excellently. The national orchid garden is at its center. Admission to the main garden is free with a charge for the orchid garden.

,,Well designed place for a great walk and observation,5.0,,"It was an enjoyable experience to take a walk along the hilly area that contained waterfalls, lakes, shops, specific gardens (Orchid, ginger), restaurants and souvenir shops."
,,The most beautiful park in Singapore,5.0,,This is by far the most beautiful park in Singapore. Its extremely large. You could sit down by the lake and people watch for hours. There's an extremely cool restaurant within the park to eat at as well. I love this place.
,,Stunning gardens,4.0,,The gardens are beautiful and so well kept. It was a very peaceful place. We turned a corner and saw 4 different bougainvillea.
,,It was excellent! We hightly recommend this and have already done so! A must see in Singapore.,5.0,,We went as large group and as this place is so big it swallowed us up! It is very beautiful.The flowers weer super and well arranged and planted so it was easy to see the landscape .There were many seats to use when needed at beautiful spots.It is definitely worth a visit.
,,Beautiful orchids,4.0,,"The gardens are lovely and very well maintained and wished we had had more time here. The orchid garden is a must see for any keen gardener and for anyone who just admire or loves flowers. Ensure you wear comfortable and cool clothing as the humidity was very high, plus plenty of water."
,,Relax in the Gardens,4.0,,A good time to go to this place is during the afternoon or early dinner time so that it's not that hot and you can just simply enjoy the serene gardens.
,,Beautiful well organized a must see,5.0,,"Singapore's botanical gardens was on my list but didn't expected it as huge as it was. My main attraction was Orchid gardens.
There are different portions. The entry fee to main garden is free and to Orchid garden in Singaporian $5 only. I stayed at Orchard road and it's not far away from there and taxis are available at park as well.
The only thing I missed was change of clothing after park visit as there was 100% humidity and other people brought spare tshirts for change which I haven't in mind.
The Orchid garden and flowers arrangement was breathtaking. I haven't seen so many orchids at one huge place like this.
It was great experience and a must see."
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"I'm not really a botanical garden lover in general, but this one is truly amazing. We spent 4 hours there and we didn't get bored for one bit. Very beaufiful, peaceful and well taken care of. A must see if you're in Singapore."
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,"Take your walking shoes, umbrella and water bottle. Huge garden with much more than you can possibly see in one go. Plants and flower collections and also quiet areas for sitting, concerts and light dining. Excellent gift shops with wide range of price and quality."
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Entrance is free to this vast 'city park'. There are many different garden zones to explore including a walk through the rainforest and the orchid garden.
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens - Orchid Display.,5.0,,"We went to the Singapore Gardens Orchid display - it was very well done and we were pleased to pace around the substantial display - token entry fee but main Gardens free entry.
We were a little tired and bone weary to go over this very large botanic gardens. Would recommend that you go for a look - easily accessible from the hop on hop off bus. You could easily spend hours here. Good for picnic under a shady tree."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,A UNESCO World Heritage Site that lives up to the accreditation! Nothing more needs to be said! Make sure you visit the Orchid Garden and the Ginger Garden
,,Best day out and free too!,5.0,,We first visited as part of a tour but 40 minutes meant that we had only a tiny taster. So the following day we returned. A cheap taxi fare got us to this fabulous place again and this time we s pent more than 4 hours. The main botanic garden is completely free and since I am over 60 the entrance to the orchid garden cost just s$1 ( about 50p). Food and drink is good and reasonable. No wonder that this is a world heritage site and the best botanic garden in the world!
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Worth a visit. Lots of species of plants, a lot of them not indigenous in the region. Also a good place to relax if you're tired of walking around the city. The area with an indoor waterfall was quite a spectacle, that area shouldn't be missed."
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,We did all the gardens around Singapore & they are all brilliant. Everything is laid out well & it is a lovely walk. No charge here but if you want to do the orchid gardens there is a small fee. Certainly do this if you have spare time.
,,Great place to relax,5.0,,"First rate botanical gardens with free entry. The highlight for me was a superb children's park, from which we eventually had to drag our young son away at the end of the day. A bit tricky getting a cab to leave - easier if you have a taxi ap on your phone"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Free entrance to this fantastic park. Lovely to wander round and enjoy the plants, the lakes and the overall setting"
,,Wonderful !!!,5.0,,"The Botanical garden is definitely worth a visit. Different kinds of flower, attractive and vibrant flowers, picturesque view and structure. Don't miss this to anyone who visited Singapore."
,,One of the greatest botanic gardens in the world,5.0,,"This is justly famous. Unlike the Gardens By the Bay, which are most evidently artificially crafted by humans, the botanic gardens conceal their artificial conception, and appear more ""natural."" The orchid section is unbelievably beautiful. Snacks are reasonably priced. Access by public transport is good. The Evolution Garden is fascinating."
,,Amazing experience - a must do,5.0,,"Spend just over 6 hours and didn't do it all. Cold area, Ginger Garden and Orchids were absolutely brilliant. Paid respects at the PoW steps. A bit disappointed in the Bonsai and Sundial gardens but only as not what I was expecting but there were big open green spaces as well. While entry was free there is a small price for the Orchids ($6 for adults and $1 for seniors from memory) but overall, well worth the price. Take a bottle of water each. Hop on Hop off bus stops here. If travel by Singapore Airlines, take ticket or boarding pass for cheap fares."
,,Refreshing and Interesting,5.0,,"We took the MRT train to Botanic Gardens station which arrive right at the far end entrance (Bukit Timah gate) of the gardens. The first part is more arboretum, park lands and at first a bit disappointing but then as you progress it then becomes truly magnificent. There are many plant sections, water displays, it is clearly marked with sign posts, there are some hilly sections and like all botanic gardens involves a fair bit of walking and there are staff everywhere to assist. There are some areas that are well shaded for comfort. We exited at the main entrance (Tanglin Gate) with only a short walk to the bus stop (Train and Bus are included in the various tourist MRT transport passes).
If you just want a walk or simply enjoy gardens then this is one of the best in the world."
,,Great day to spend on a romantic walk,4.0,,"My fiancé and I walked through the gardens. Its a great way to spend a romantic day. We walked for hours and took some great photos. Did not spend a penny. I recommend bringing water with you. This was the cheapest day of all the days we spent in Singapore. Getting to the Botanic gardens was easy but where we got off the train, it was still a 15 minute walk to the entrance."
,,A photographic paradise worthy of a few hours visit......,5.0,,"Taken by a friend the gardens are quite expansive in nature with flower and ferns trees and more in abundance,the meandering pathways and shaded overhanging trees and vines afford a keen photographic experience not to be missed."
,,fascinating,5.0,,An extensive garden which is well maintained. Plenty of information and labels. Not disabled friendly with no wheelchair or internal transport available.
,,Must do on a Singapore trip,5.0,,Botanic garden is for me a must do for nature lovers. Best time is morning when not so busy. Pass by the orchid garden as well
,,Green city within city,4.0,,"Must visit if you have days in hand. Garden is devided in many parts like healing garden, orchid garden (it costs 5 sgd per adult) and gives a good backdrop for you holiday pictures. Live symphony show and its sound fill entire atmosphere with pleasant experience and rain enriched my time.
Loved it."
,,A lovely way to spend a few hours.,5.0,,"Even for a non-garden type like me, this place was incredible. The range of plants and the lushness of them was amazing. Good walking paths and plenty of direction signage made it easy to see most of the gardens."
,,Love it,5.0,,"Expansive grounds, beautifully landscaped, with attractions for people of all ages. Whether you're there to exercise in the morning, or for a time for solitude in a quiet corner, or to have fun with your children, or a romantic walk with your partner at night, the Botanic Gardens is a perfect fit."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"This is one of the best tropical botanical gardens in the world. I planned to go for 3 hrs but stayed for 6! The Orchid section is the star and is truly amazing.

Dare I say that, despite the modern marvel that is the Marina Bay Gardens, it could not match the beauty and splendor of the real thing... the Singapore Botanic Gardens."
,,Fantastic Gardens,5.0,,"Spent a couple of hours exploring these gardens . They were beautiful . Would certainly go back if I went to Singapore again ,just could not believe they were free to go in"
,,An oasis in the midde of the city.,5.0,,The Botanic Garden (which includes the Orchid Garden - also a must-see) is a tranquil oasis in the middel of the city. Includes every flower or plant you might consider and a large area of apprently virgin rain forest.
,,Lovely gardens to relax in,4.0,,"Walked form bottom gate to top, rained top half, purchased a poncho, well set out lots to see, slightly uphill from bottom to top but caught train home from top gate, perhaps a bit far for elderly person to walk"
,,Peaceful ambience,4.0,,Spent hours walking in Singapore Botanical Gardens was delightful. More quiet on weekdays visit. Free of charge except at National Orchid Garden $5 for adult. Refill drinking water and restaurants are available.
,,Really good if you're into your gardens. Just ok if you're not,3.0,,"Good
-Beautiful gardens with different type of plants
-Nice open scenery
-Nice half day activity

Bad
-I'm not into gardens and plants so I was slightly underwhelmed (not sure what I expected)
-Takes a little while to get there when you're use to everything else being so close."
,,A Must!,5.0,,"This is an amazing site to visit, free except for a $1 (less than a dollar U.S.) fee for the orchid center. It's accessible from the hop-on, hop-off buses or a short taxi ride."
,,"Great walks, lovely setting",5.0,,"A very large venue, including the National Orchid Garden. Plan a full day to see it all. There is a MRT stop at the gardens or there are taxi ranks at several exits."
,,Greenary. We love you,5.0,,A wonderfuk place for young children. Visit the jacobs garden and had a yummy lunch (spagetti) at the cafe.
,,Braut,5.0,,Lovely place to visit while in Singapore . We took the hop on hop off bus and it was part of that route .
,,"Beautiful, Awesome Gardens",5.0,,"Our family went to the Singapore Botanic Gardens for our morning walk during the Deepavali holiday and besides the beautiful fauna and floral, we were totally amazed by the beautiful transformation of the Gardens. I had fond memories of walking into the Gardens to see the monkeys when I was a child and remembered feeding the fishes at the Swan Lake. Today, there are no more monkeys but the Swan Lake is brimming with rich marine life - tortoises, schools of golden fishes, cat-fishes and two graceful swans. Excited children were gathering by the side of the Lake, feeding the fishes with fish food and bread. In the middle of the Swan Lake is a flight of Swans sculpture, so beautiful and apt for the Swan Lake. We walked towards the Symphony Lake, where a Shaw Foundation Symphony stage was constructed in the middle of a man-made lake surrounded by lotus flowers and leaves. This stage is where free concerts are carried out on weekends or public holidays. I laid out my picnic mat on the grass to rest and watched the various activities around me - families bonding together with picnics, people jogging or walking their dogs, children playing Frisbee and couples taking selfie photos. It was so relaxing. Our next stop is the octagonal Gazebo otherwise known as the Bandstand where bands used to perform at the Gazebo in the early days. It is a historical landmark and I was glad that it remains unchanged, just as I have remembered it to be when I was a young girl. There are also several beautiful sculptures by Sculptor Sydney Harpley that are worth-mentioning. I took beautiful pictures of the ""Girl-on-a-Bicycle"" and ""Girl-on-a-Swing"", both sculptures were presented to our Government in the 1980s. We also stopped by ""A Curtain of Roots"", an unusual species of long, reddish aerial roots which formed a dense lacy curtain. Very interesting! We were at the Sundial Garden when it started to drizzle and our walk was cut-short. We would have loved to venture further to see the other attractions such as the National Orchid Garden (admission fee applies), the Healing Garden and the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden but these will have to wait till another visit to the Gardens.

The Singapore Botanic Gardens is so deserving of its honour as a UNESCO World Heritage site this year. It is a beautiful Garden that we, Singaporeans, are so proud of."
,,Hertiage Site,4.0,,"This is truly a heritage site with lots of history; may it be various trees, sculptures and recently identified Anglo-Malayan plantation house (named Burkill Hall), the only surviving example of its kind in the region. Its huge and one can spend an entire day here. There are beautiful lakes, a rainforest and variety of Gardens; Healing Garden, Evolution Garden, Ginger Garden and the most popular Orchid Garden. Entry to Botanical Garden is free except for Orchid Garden. I got a chance to witness a live orchestra at the Symphony Lake in the evening which was one of the most beautiful experience. MRT is just outside the botanical garden entrance. But you need be prepared for a marathon walk if you want to roam throughout the garden. There are other gates as well to enter/exit, so if coming by own vehicle / taxi, you chose to park to the nearby entrance. Overall, would say a beautiful place to visit for people interested in botany or for some one who has some time during their visit to Singapore. Many of tourists would give this a miss due to lack of time and other major attractions to be covered."
,,Good place to bring the kids to,4.0,,"This place is huge and on a lovely day, it's a good place to bring the kids to just run about and play. However, on weekends there will be a lot of foreign maids having picnics there and they can be quite noisy."
,,Not be missed,5.0,,"Having lived abroad for a long time and my last visit dated back to my young children's days who are adults now. I accompanied a visiting friend for the first time in just as many years and what a pleasure it was! It is beautifully landscaped with wide pathways sometimes lined with palms, flowers and plants leading to the different themed gardens punctuated with open spaces to rest, to picnic, to play, to admire, to reflect and to listen to symphony orchestra. The orchids garden is the must of the musts with the explosion of unusual colours in abundance, uncommon hybrids, VIP-named orchids that your camera could easily run out of battery trying to capture all the amazing orchids in their splendour. The gardens is huge, arm yourselves with good walking shoes, hats and umbrellas for the sun and rains. Food and drinks are easily available in the gardens. Avoid weekends as it will crowded as most events are held then and residents come to enjoy their green space. Half a day is the minimum to cover the gardens by foot but a whole day is not unusual with break for lunch."
,,Lovely,4.0,,"Relaxing walk thought great gardens peaceful and beautiful. plenty of on site facilities, easy walk with good signage for the plants, directions andattractions."
,,Must visit place,4.0,,By all standards the Botanical gardens of the Singapore is the very best and remains that way through out. It is a good place to be in and the place astonishes one with the way it is managed. Beautiful place
,,"Well deserved honour 'World Geritage Site""!",5.0,,"It's very nostalgic for me as a returning Singaporean. The whole garden give me a peaceful mind and fond memories. I am proud that it was chosen as the 'World Heritage Site"" by UNSECO. A great place for family and friends! Moreover it's free. It is a must-go place of interest for locals and foreigners."
,,Loved these Gardens,5.0,,"What a treat to roam such beautiful grounds. So well kept, so many different plants. (Who knew ginger grew in so many different ways?) We would have loved to have spend another few hours here. Do allow at least a half day for this. The food at the entrance is pretty decent and not terribly overpriced. Or plan ahead and bring your own!"
,,Live music on Sundays,5.0,,"I recommend to check the event calendar before going to the botanical gardens as during my visit they had orchestra playing live music (really nice, btw).
Garden is huge with themed little gardens inside. If you want to visit some sort of a garden, this is the one you should choose.
Free of charge."
,,Free Entrance in this beautiful Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Our 1st stop off the hop on and hop off bus . We enjoyed a lovely breakfast at the Gardens before walking around . Lovely setting and the fact that its free is a bonus as its so beautiful I would have paid to enter. Well kept and very clean. It was a brilliant way to start the day!
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Definately one of the best botanic gardens that I have ever visited. Great collection of plants, excellent environment, very chilling, nice lake . The orchid collection was my favorite. Very well presented and a huge variery of orchids. Beautiful!! Must do for everybody including families, very relaxed atmosphere and really liked the stage that is there for concerts etc. Would definately go once a week to read a book or relax if I lived there."
,,Best botanical garden ever,5.0,,"Wherever I go throughout the world I make a point of visiting the local garden as growing plants is my passionate hobby. Needless to say, I have seen a lot of gardens, but none hold a candle to the Singapore botanical gardens. There is something for everyone, and is very popular with the locals, so it is also a great spot for people watching.
The orchid garden is amazing. If you ever tried to grow orchids (the lord knows I failed miserably) you will wonder how they do it here. Masses and masses of them line the miles of paths, one would think they are weeds!
I know everybody tells you to go to the flashy voiding by the sea, I don't know, me, I prefer tea and a good conversation with a grand dame to a glimpse of a bikini cladding babe. Go for the grand dame of gardens, take your time (recommend 4 hours) and feed your soul with a chat with Mother Nature"
,,Sanctuary within the city!,5.0,,"We went to the Botanic gardens and National Orchid centre (which is within the gardens) and were surprised to find such a peaceful, relaxing environment so close to Orchard Road. The area was immaculately kept and well worth a few hours to mooch around and enjoy the vegetation. The orchids were stunning and it was interesting to see them growing in a natural environment and to learn more about them. Entrance to the gardens was free and the Orchid centre was $5 Singapore."
,,A must do,5.0,,"This is something that I was going to forget about doing but I made the decision to go and have a look. I'm really glad I did. The gardens are extensive and really well laid out and beautiful. A little difficult to get to with public transport but well and truly worth the effort.

Something also worth mentioning was the various food outlets I found within the gardens. All very well priced and the option I tried was very good."
,,Great tranquil place to spend a day!,4.0,,"If you like walking in the lap of Nature itself, then this is THE place! We loved especially the Ginger garden & the Orchid garden."
,,Visit the orchid garden!,5.0,,If you're here pay the $5 entrance fee and see the orchids. They are truly spectacular and vast in the varieties!
,,Botanic Gardens a Must-See,5.0,,"I spent a good part of a day at these Gardens, which contains many speciality areas, not just the most famous National Orchid Garden. By the way, make sure you download the Singapore Botanic Gardens app, which contains GPS data. The place is so big and has so many paths, I needed the app to figure out where I was, even with a paper map! There are lakes, all kinds of gardens (Foliage, Fragrant, Ginger, Healing Garden, Herbs and Spices, Trellis, etc), and some real places to eat (I recommend Villa Halia). I took public transportation -- the MRT station is at the northwest corner and a good walk to the National Orchid Garden. The other main entrances are closer. The section near the MRT has some open areas -- so wear a hat or bring an umbrella for the sun."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Huge gardens, lots to see and every way you looked had an amazing view. Rainforest area, band playing, and it was free! Immaculately kept :-)"
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,Included in the Gardens are Orchid Gardens and Botanical Gardens.They are an easy walk (about 1/2 mi total ?) It is beautiful and worth a visit if you appreciate flowers and nature.
,,"Beautiful, massive and FREE",5.0,,One of the rare cheap/free attractions in Singapore. Massive to explore. Definitely go in the Orchid Garden. It's worth it.
,,Lovely picnic place,4.0,,A place where you can be for a day away from all the hustle of city life. A good place for families and big groups.
,,a nice walk in the park,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Garden is pleasant and free. There is, however, a charge for admission to the National Orchid Garden, which is a separate enclosure within the larger Botanic Garden.

The park is a large, landscaped property populated by native species. Paved walkways take you along a large pond and (fabricated) waterfalls. It is a nice space, worth an hour or two, for nature lovers, but the real attraction is probably the Orchid Garden within."
,,A haven in the city,5.0,,"A lovely mature botanic garden, a very large site where the city noise cannot be heard, offering beautiful plants, lovely views and shade. Plenty of places to eat and drink, but we used the most informal one, in the Visitor Centre courtyard. From the city centre ask a taxi for the Tanglin Gate; the MTR station is ill-placed at the far northern end away from the plant collections."
,,Fantastic gardens,5.0,,"We visited the gardens as part of a stop over in Singapore and stopped here off the city tourist bus. Lots to walk around at ur leisure and take in with various different routes, had a nice lunch here too. Lots to take pics or video of. Very well kept gardens."
,,Fantastic public resource,5.0,,"Rated by experts as ""best botanic garden in Asia""...not an expert but would agree. Unique and long history, easily accessible for residents and visitors. Amazing specimens and garden design/exhibits."
,,"Fantastic, great for all ages",5.0,,"I've visited Singapore on many occasions, and the Botanical gardens is one of my favorite places to visit. The plants are out of this world."
,,Simply beautiful at every turn,4.0,,"OK, you have to like walking in gardens and big public parks to put this on your tourist list, but it's worth the trip. The Botanic Gardens are huge and there are many entrances. If you're meeting someone, make sure you know which entrance to meet at. It can be very hot in the gardens, so always carry water and sunscreen.

The gardens are divided into many, many sections, all featuring different types of plants native to the area. My favourite is the aromatic garden, which also has a secret Bali, Indonesia restaurant hiding inside. It's a cool place to take a break and have a fresh, cold drink.

The Botanic Gardens cannot be done in one day. Check a map, decide what you would most like to see and then start walking. A lovely place for a day out."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This is a must see in Singapure! Very big, green, with different kind of plants, lakes...very well treated. It has toilets and places to eat."
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,This is a beautiful garden. The colours and the different types of orchids are growing here. A worthwhile place to visit if this is your thing. I am an orchid fan so I was in heaven.
,,Good break from the hustle and bustle of the city,4.0,,"This is a great place for a quiet walk to relax and enjoy the gardens. The park was not crowded and was free! It is a short walk from the Scotts/Orchard road shopping district hotels (Marriott or Hyatt). Many unique trees and plants...and a very good orchid garden. We had lunch in the cafe...it was good, but nothing special. Lots of trails to explore!"
,,Paradise in the City,5.0,,"Get out and breathe some fresh air, have a nice walk, be romatic, see amazing plants and flours: all perfect here! Loving it!"
,,Very nice lot of things to do,5.0,,"Free entry, Very good to spend complete one day. Children park is nice. Swing is there with different design. Orchid garden with entry ticket $5 is good. Inside is very high Ac so be careful with kids."
,,Thousands of botanical varieties spread over many acres,5.0,,The various Botanic Gardens within this complex each have a theme related to the plants within it. For the garden enthusiasts it is well worth a visit. The National Orchid Garden is here and separately reviewed.
,,Peaceful and Relaxing Gardens,4.0,,The gardens are very well maintained with the free map it is very easy to make your way around the park. If it is a hot day I suggest using an umbrella as you are not always in the shade. The birds that inhabit or use the park are many and varied. We are not bird enthusiasts but to her so many different bird calls as we walked around was very pleasant.
,,Always good to connect with nature here,5.0,,"Went for a casual walk in a weekday morning where it isn't so crowded and had a great time just exploring the compound. There are many mini-gardens, herb ones, prehistoric settings, lots to see. A great place to just wind down a little."
,,Simply amazing!,5.0,,"To keep this short and sweet, you simply have to visit here during any trip to Singapore, especially if like me you enjoy keeping orchids. There are so many varieties to look at. Set in beautifully landscaped grounds, this place is what I'd call a gardeners paradise."
,,Beautiful UNESCO World Heritage Site,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is simply a lovely place to be. One can spend a morning enjoying the greens and peacefulness of a well-kempt environment, where locals walk their dogs and families come for picnics, or spend an evening of sensory pleasure listening to a musical concert at play. There are so many gorgeous spots within the garden site that it is no wonder many couples can be seen having their wedding photos taken here. Picking a favorite spot is difficult but enjoying a cuppa at the cafe within is an easy complement to the overall experience."
,,"Absolutely ""Must do"" in Singapore",5.0,,"A wonderful blend of engineering, architecture and horticulture. The wall gardens are a real work of art with the composition of the different plants so well thought out. I expected a lot of walking and was concerned that my elderly brother would not cope, but on the contrary, there was a shuttle and lifts and it was easy to get around. The Forest in the Cloud is really worth every cent. The variety of plants is just awesome coming from every part of the world. Do take a jacket as it is quite cool inside the dome."
,,An Oasis of calm,5.0,,"The Mole is a creature of habit. I go to Singapore almost every month and stay at the excellent Jen Hotel mainly because it's excellent but also because it's only a few hundred metres from the Botanic Gardens. Every morning before work, and in the evening after a hard day you will find me shuffling round this lovely spot, taking the air, enjoying the calm and generally at peace. The gardens are well kept, quiet and safe to walk in. Whether you are a horticulturist, a botanist or just taking some exercise, this is a 'must go' place in Singapore. Spend an hour or a day there. Your soul will rejoice!"
,,Gazebo as it's best,3.0,,Nice park with lot's of trees. You can alight in Botanic MRT in circle line and walked southward and ride a bus going to Orchard for shopping afterwards or vice versa. Nothing much to see in here.
,,Fresh air,5.0,,"Nice view, nice place for shooting, picnic and relax. Suitable for people who like natural and exercise. Many plants and flower. But be careful, many mosquito. However, I am very enjoy in this green environment."
,,A FREE attraction,5.0,,"This may well be a taxi ride for most Singapore visitors, but well worth it. Various well-tended gardens, lake. The gardens are free entry, the Orchid Garden costs but is brilliant."
,,"Awesome place to wander, very peaceful.",5.0,,These gardens are really lovely. Obviously due to the tropical weather here everything is lush but they are also well maintained. A good thing to do if you're looking for some quiet time. They're huge too so leave yourself a couple of hours to roam leisurely.
,,Huge gardens,5.0,,Huge ares of very impressive gardens.Take water with you .Nice big cafe for eating.Interesting souvenir shops if it rains
,,Paradise on earth!,5.0,,Walking around the gardens you get the impression that paradise has come down. Perfect for jogging and pet walk!!
,,"Beautiful gardens, great landscaping, relaxing and visually lovely",5.0,,"If you want a break from shopping malls and skyscrapers go to this beautifully landscaped gardens with gizillion tropical trees, plants, orchids, etc. in a relaxing and lovely area."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The orchid garden is particular worth the walk but i suggest going first thing in the morning to avoid tge heat and crowds
,,Fantastic themed gardens,5.0,,"There are several themed gardens inside the botanic garden. Evolution garden and healing gardens shouldn't be missed, if you are planning a day out there"
,,"Well Done, Singapore!",5.0,,"For this non-gardener, off again to see more plants. What a surprize.....the greatest collection of orchids that I would imagine possible to see in one location. (correct me if I'm wrong) The profusion of colours was almost unbelievable. Singapore has excelled once more!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"A quiet place to walk about and enjoy the beautiful greenery, flowers and scenery. There is a charge for the orchid gardens - if you like them ! Quite beautiful"
,,Not so...interesting,2.0,,"Standard garden, explore some place not found interesting view, hot in the afternoon. You could try orchid garden but not free, will need you too pay."
,,Simply beautiful,4.0,,"I was lucky to be invited for a Sunday morning run around the gardens and managed to take in the views and many delights on offer. If you have a spare few hours and have over shopped then head down to the gardens and enjoy the 6K walk, it's a must and well worth it!"
,,A green lung for family,4.0,,Fantastic look of flora from early history of lovely island garden city of Singapore! Also a place for family to exercise amongst nature. One just cannot complete a walk or jog in one section of this marvellous garden. Not surprising that it has been named a world's heritage site. You'll never see Singapore in its natural glory if you don't visit Singapore's Botanical Gardens- a name retained for almost 200 years!
,,Wonderful,4.0,,Excelllent day out for families and couples. Thousands of plant species that keep engaged for hours..
,,Not just a tourist attraction,5.0,,"As a Singaporean, I frequent the Singapore Botanic Gardens as it is spacious and not crowded. There are many species of plants and flowers for viewing within this large garden which is near to the city. Great place to exercise in an environment which provides fresh air and shade in sunny Singapore :)"
,,Beautiful scenery,5.0,,"I have been here a few times and it's perfect if u just want a relaxing day looking at the beautiful scenery with great picture shots everywhere great for anyone families , couples or solos u can either get yourself there by train or free tourist bus or you can pay for a guide but it's much easier to do it yourself and cheaper.."
,,A Peaceful Green Oasis,5.0,,"These gardens were set out during the British Colonial times to propagate plants which could be cultivated for commercial use , such as rubber. Now the gardens are magnificent , free entry unless you go to the Orchid Garden which is definitely worth the entry fee. Plenty of places to stop and sit also a good restaurant and drinks area. Best visited during the week as the weekends can be busy ."
,,A relaxed outing,5.0,,Very well laid out with various speciality gardens. Map provided is easy to follow. Several entries to the Gardens depending on the direction one comes from. Plants are very well marked. Healing Garden was very interesting.
,,Gorgeous!,5.0,,This botanical garden is really beautiful - definitely hit up the National Orchid Garden inside for some stunning flowers!
,,A great respite from the hazy weather,5.0,,We visited the garden when the psi was 150. All the trees and flowers have shielded the choking air and hence we didn't feel as uncomfortable. The orchids in the Orchid Garden are simply beautiful. Do visit the coolhouse where it's air conditioned(we all need this under this weather) and you'll see dedicated staff nurturing these beautiful plants. You may also take the shuttle bus to Dempsey Hill at the Tanglin gate afterwards.
,,Beautiful orchids,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens well worth a visit. Like so much of Singapore, neat and tidy, well organised. The paths and walk ways are well signposted. The paths are smooth and generally step free. I think the Garden would be suitable for a visitor using a wheel chair.

The Orchid Garden was a highlight. I would recommend visiting it to see the wide variety of Orchids being grown there. I had no idea there were so many types."
,,Free gardens on the butterfly trail.,5.0,,"These gardens are free to enter however there is a small price to enter the orchid gardens. It is well worth looking at. There is also a ginger garden. The park is clean with meandering, easy to walk paths, lakes and well set out sections of plants. There is seating if required, some shaded. The gardens are part of a butterfly trail you can follow from Orchard Rd to the gardens. All tourists we met enjoyed these gardens the best."
,,Very Well Maintained,5.0,,This is probably the best botanical garden in the World. A none green fingered person would enjoy it here as well as your more expert botanist I would be happy to go here again
,,Absolutely top class. Would rank world class,5.0,,Words cannot describe this oasis. We spent a day here and I think you could spend 2 or 3 days and not it take it all in or do it justice. It is unparalled anywhere...nothing could outrank or outshine this World Heritaged listed garden. An absolute must to visit and please do yourselves a favour and allow all day to see it and soak it all in.
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"If you can cope with the high humidity in Singapore combined with walking then you will really enjoy the Botanic Gardens. They are an oasis of peace and calm in the midst of a frenetic city. Look out for the bigger than small lizards that wander around in the undergrowth. The gardens are free but make sure you visit the Orchid gardens for $5 as they are well worth it.
We ate lunch at Cafe Verde and had an excellent laksa for less than $10 - one of the best we had in Singapore. It was a pleasant surprise not to have to pay high tourist prices too.
They have a lovely gift shop with lots of orchid based gifts, which sadly we couldn't buy as Australian customs are so strict.
The park is at the top of Orchard Road and is one of the stops on the hop on hop off bus."
,,"for the love for flora, nature and peace",5.0,,"This is one of my to-go places when I feel like getting out of the house and away from the crowds. The Gardens is huge, so it's best to split the trip over 2 days of u want to cover the entire place. There are a few entrances but the ones most accessible via public transport are the Botanic Gardens station (yellow line), and Tanglin Gate (take to Orchard station on the red line, then hop on one of the public buses behind Ion; it's just a few stops away. Alight when you see gleneagles hospital).

The swan lake and visitor centre is nearer the main entrance at Tanglin Gate, while the huge medicinal plant section is nearer the Botanic Gardens station. If you're looking for a specific plant, you can even approach the smaller info counter near the drop off point at Tanglin Gate. The staff is very helpful (good to have the Latin scientific name of the plant correctly spelled though).

The yellow rain trees at the bandstand makes for one of the best sights there.

Food options: within the park there's only Food for Thought near the Tanglin Gate entrance. There are cafes opposite the road just next to the Botanic Gardens station entrance. You can also do a picnic in the park!

It's free for the public!"

,,Orchids Lover a must see,5.0,,"Did many stop overs in Singapore but never made it to the Botanical Garden. I regret this many times as soon I walked in too the Orchid Garden. Be warned, if you come with the Train it's about 30 min walk to the Orchids Garden. I had no idea how big this Botanical Garden is and did not ware my runners. Result blisters on both feet.

,,Better off visiting Gardens by the Bay,3.0,,"I appreciate the preservation of such a large park area in a city like Singapore. Indeed I gave a 5 star review for Gardens by the Bay. I visited Botanic Gardens first so my impression of it is not affected by my visit to GbtB. Botanic Gardens is a large, but relatively average park with naturally grown vegetation. It is free but also quite out of the way. If budget is not a concern, I'd suggest GbtB instead. But on a nice day, or if you happen to pass by, it may be fun to have a picnic or take a stroll at the Botanic Gardens."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,I have visited the Botanic Gardens since I was a kid. I had many school filed trips there and it was always my favourite place. It just amazes me that through the years this garden has literally grown. It is now a World Heritage site. It has the best collection of orchids in the world. A definite must see.
,,Better to stay at home,3.0,,"I read lot of fantastic review for this place so I decided to see if it's nice or not. Don't take it personal it's just a review.

There are lavish displays of orchids, special Oriental style garden vignettes highlighting different plant families. It's a tranquil leafy green space in which to unwind.

If you are a fan of ginger try their ginger drinks from the ginger gardens."
,,A green oasis with a wonderful orchid collection,4.0,,"It's a pretty place with thematic gardens and it is huge, be prepared for some walking.

,,Great garden,5.0,,The orchid garden cost an additional amount. I am a senior so it was only $1 sg but it was a highlight. The only negative is the heat and humidity combined with lots of walking.
,,"Free entry, probably one of the best gem in Singapore",5.0,,"The garden is spacious and large, you can spend a whole day or half day here easily. If you just like me, only have an hour or so, still can walk a bit in the garden (consult the visitor centre) and they will give you a map to follow a trial. There are different parts of vegetation, the rain forest, ginger garden, etc. There are also cafes inside the park so you can easily buy a drink or grab something to eat. Bus No. 7 or taxi from Orchard Road is easy."
,,Great open space with lizards!!!!,5.0,,"Walking around the Botanic Gardens was a great escape from the bustle of the City and very enjoyable despite not having a keen interest in plants. As with everywhere in Singapore it was quite hot and humid so its probably advisable to take refreshments, and the gardens are very accessible from the MRT, the station is right outside a park entrance. Finally, we loved looking a the lizards and terrapins in the lake!!"
,,A very nice place to go in the avo andearly night closes at midnight,5.0,,A great number of plants and nice place to go heaps of plants and info signs plus food and clean toilets
,,Of global interest,5.0,,"This fantastic acreage in the middle of the city is a must-visit place of interest. A veritable horticulturalist's dream! We spent 3 and three quarter hours walking round in the October heat and humidity. However, there are plenty of seats and drop in points en route to relieve fatigue. There is a fascinating prehistoric walk starting 300 million years ago and moving towards the present day. Petrified trees which have turned to stone start the walk and the interest never wavers. Even if, like me, you are not a flora enthusiast, there are awe-inspiring panoramic views and lakes to see. A wonderful day out and FOC unless you wish to visit the orchid garden (cost for me over 60 - S$1 = 50p) about S$5 otherwise (from memory)"

It was accessed by seemingly everyone from the expats doing their mum and baby exercises, local school groups, to the local oldies and their Tai Chi but was not crowded. I really enjoyed the sculptures as features in this large public garden space especially around the lake."
,,visting the gardens of Singapore,5.0,,"This is free, we spent the whole day here (including the orchid garden, 5 dollar charge) this space is vast and contains the Orchid garden.
We saw flower, trees and plants that we have never seen before. Ok were are ordinary joes but there is an area of untouched rain forest from when Singapore was covered in rainforest. there is a ginger garden with around 100 different species of ginger. we had a meal at the restaurant and visited the health garden, swan lake, it is an amazing attraction.

,,Peace and tranquillity.,5.0,,This is a wonderful park with lots of interest. The ponds/lakes are good for spotting mini-beasts and terrapins. There are wonderful displays of water lilies.
,,Away from the busy city centre,5.0,,"Best place to relax away from the busy city center but very accessible to tourist. MRT station is just beside the Bukit Timah gate. There's restaurants inside but look for the Food Canopy! Its like a mini hawker center, :D Best of all there's no entrance fee!!! You only need to pay 5.00 SGD for the orchid garden.

Every spot is picture perfect. I would really love to explore this garden more but due to time constraint, we were only able to explore half of the garden. :( If I didn't do a research before going to Singapore, I would've missed this place. Hope more tourist would explore and admire this place. This is totally worth a visit."
,,"Beautiful and Peaceful, a must to visit in Singapore",5.0,,"One of the best gardens in the world.

overall this place very beautiful and you can spend your whole day."
,,Average,3.0,,Nice to have some gardens in the city but a relatively pedestrian display of flora and slight lack of facilities lets it down. Too many workmen faffing around strapping up trees for no good reason!
,,Tropical Paradise!,5.0,,"As our time in Singapore was limited, we booked a half day tour in the afternoon. We toured through the Chinese and Indian quarters but the highlight was the Botanic Gardens. There is a surprise around every corner: a variety of flowers, including orchids, interesting little paths that wind past fountains, ferns, lush vegetation and mini-gazebos. There are many places to sit and rest and just soak in the beauty. A souvenir shop with quality goods is placed strategically at the entrance/exit! Well worth a visit but probably best on a sunny day."

,,Green oasis for locals and tourists,4.0,,"The access is easy, if you use MRT (metro). The yellow line has a stop - Botanic Gardens. It takes 30 - 40 minutes to come from the Marina Bay Sands area.
The entrance is free of charge.
The park area is quite huge.
Drinkable water fountains, WC, information with directions and etc.
Nice and calm place."
,,World class massive gardens,4.0,,"At the moment their open air café is closed which was very annoying but we walked a bit further to a very expensive restaurant. I really liked the old café the way it was and the staff did not seem to care or know where to send us. Very sad.

But the gardens are huge and well worth the trip by MRT."
,,A great morning out at a free attraction,5.0,,"Did you know that the Singapore Botanical Gardens is now a UNESCO Heritage Site? If you are a nature lover, a morning stroll amidst the lush foliage is a refreshing start to your day out. People often say that some of the best things in life are free. This is especially true for the gardens. Whether you wish to spend just an hour, or an entire morning to indulge in the greenery, the gardens are definitely a wonderful treat for the senses. It does get hot and humid from 11am onwards so try to come early in the morning for a jog or a stroll."
,,"Lovely walk, beautiful orchids",5.0,,"This is the perfect venue for an afternoon stroll. There are different walks, the Healing Garden, Evolutionary Garden, and so forth, but for me the most thrilling was National Orchid Pavilion. Lovely that there is a discount for seniors, and the flowers are beautifully maintained in their glory. I would not hesitate to visit again."
,,Great fun for couples and families,3.0,,"This is a delightful repast from the hustle and bustle of Singapore's urban life. It's definitely worth a trip, especially if you can stay for a while, stroll around, and just quiet the mind."

,,Amazing garden in the center of the city,5.0,,"I have heard of this attractions from news after they got the 1st world heritage site in SG at July 2015, so I decided to go few months later. I did not do much research on the transport to go this place, I did not catch up their heritage tour on saturday as i enter through Bukit Timah gate (which the tour is at another site of the garden, which require more than 1 hour walk!). I strongly suggest visitor to study their website first, and definitely MUST go the National Orchid garden trail which is alot of amazing and beautiful orchids inside. As my experience, enter through Bukit Timah gate will meet alot of jogging track around and certain trails/gardens that might suggest to visit after orchid garden, my suggestion is enter through Tanglin gate first (please refer their website!). I suggest anyone who plans to come here might need a pair of comfortable walking shoes and water. The whole park is relaxing and suitable for family outing, beautiful scenery also suitable for wedding photoshooting, jogging and etc. Flora in this garden, no matter alongside jogging track or specific trails around are amazing and lovely!"
,,Beautiful Day Out,5.0,,Another free and very beautiful attraction in Singapore. My friend and I were on a tight budget and were impressed to be able to access the garden free of charge. The gardens are very beautiful and educational. One could easily lose a day here.
,,Wow,5.0,,We were on the city sightseeing tour bus and decided to hop off and spend an hour here. That hour turned into 4 hours. What a fantastic place. Most of the garden is free with only a nominal charge for the orchid garden but this is a must for any visit. This garden is the best layed out garden I have ever visited. Sign posts are easy to follow. Photo spots are marked with a sigh and seats are available among the flowers for some great shots. Eating places also available within the gardens and of course a great gift shop. By far the best bit is the VIP orchid garden. It's very interesting to read who has been honoured with an orchid named after them.
,,great escape in the middle of the city,5.0,,Lovely place to go for a stroll of an evening after work and probably at other times too. And the shop(s) there is pretty good to nail all the souvenirs you may need to bring home for spouse and children.
,,Lovely place for a quiet stroll,5.0,,"Took the MRT to Singapore's Botanic Gardens on a Sunday morning. It was peaceful in the main, but families do camp out in the shade and have picnic's or in some cases have slightly louder private parties. It is an extensive free park with a lot of expansive grass and tree's but along the way there are smaller more specialised area's such as the Ginger garden, which provide's some shade from the heat. There are a few ponds with tropical fish and there is also an amphitheatre for outdoor events. The stage is surrounded by a lily pond so it is quite a setting. Perhaps a place to go after the hustle and bustle of Singapore get's too much. It is not a long walk from Orchard Street either, so mix some shopping with you peace and relaxation."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"What a great way to fill in half a day or more and it's free except for the orchid gardens which are an attraction in their own right.

Can become quite hot at times so dress accordingly. The Cool House was a welcome relief.

Quite a retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city."
,,Delightful,5.0,,"The gardens are beautifully designed, superbly maintained and a pleasure to visit. Well worth a visit."
,,"Beautiful array of plants, seating areas, and orchids galore",5.0,,"The gardens provide many different settings to sit, play, and enjoy the plants within. The Orchid Gardens are accessible by paid fee, but essential to include in your visit. There are convenient refreshment stands, essential if you've forgotten your water bottle or run out, or clearly need something cold to drink in this very hot country. The air is cleaner, and easier to breathe than areas of little vegetation in air pollution laden Singapore, due to no fault of its own. The gardens are varied, so plan on relaxing and pausing in some to fully appreciate the diversity and planning it required. Visit the history of the gardens museum to appreciate the plant studies conducted here, and their benefit to the commerce/employment of Singapore and neighboring countries."
,,Tranquillity in the City,5.0,,Located in central Singapore and just five minutes away from Orchard Road is a little piece of heaven. We escaped the smogg and spent a lovely morning wandering though the beautiful landscaped grounds. The garden is open from 5am to midnight and is free. There is a small fee to enter the Orchid garden.
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Excellent way to spend a day or half a day. Orchid Garden is especially fascinating. Wish we had had an opportunity to attend a concert.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We had been to Chinatown in the morning and decided (as we had a ticket for the hop-on/hop-off bus) to visit the Botanic Gardens for an hour or so. We ended spending about five hours there and wished we had spent the full day at this wonderful place. The different areas such as Evolving Gardens and Rainforest are beautiful and fascinating. We visited the museum but did not stay long and, when we cmd out there, on the lawn outside, was a 3-foot long monitor lizard! We also saw other lizards, beautifully coloured birds and, in the lakes, many terrapins/turtles. It was a sad moment seeing the brick steps made by prisoners of war but encouraging to see how they had engraved the bricks in defiance of their imprisonment and treatment. The restaurant (Casa Verde) was quite expensive and my wife wasn't happy that her salad was mainly a collection of leaves but my food was adequate. The Medicinal Gardens were fascinating but we didn't have time to visit the Orchid Gardens (I believe that this is the only part of the Gardens which is not free to enter). All in all a great day out but make sure that you apply insect repellant I ended up with 22 mosquito bites and my wife about 12 mosquito bites."
,,Relaxing and peaceful open space,5.0,,"The gardens are large and exceptionally well maintained. You will encounter lizards and birds in addition to the orchids, trees and plants. There are areas to picnic plus cafes and restaurants in the centre."
,,Wow!!!!,4.0,,"Nature Lover, please don't miss this place. It is a very big Garden. I suggest that you have a bicycle when you visit this place. You will get tired if you will walk around the place.

You can bring foods and have your picnic here. It's really amazing and it is free. How I wish we have this in our country, where we can relax after our very busy day"
,,The most impressive free activity in all of S'pore,5.0,,"In the many years I've lived in Singapore, I haven't even been to each corner of the park. A true beauty, the Botanic Gardens is the best attraction in Singapore. We love to picnic at the free concerts, feed turtles at the lakes, chase geese, scooter around, kick a ball in the fields....so much to do and see."
,,An escape from the city,4.0,,"Beautiful gardens and a perfect place to stretch our legs after a flight from the UK. We visited at the time of the smog in Singapore so probably didn't see the gardens in their full glory, although it did look quite atmospheric. The gardens are easy to get to, as the hop on, hop off sightseeing bus takes you right there. There's no charge to enter the gardens, only a charge for the National Orchid Garden which is within the gardens. There are several cafes and restaurant in the gardens, and one of the cafes is at the entrance where the bus drops you off, along with a gift shop. It's easy to find your way around the garden, and you can pick up a map from the information desk when you enter. Pleased that we went."
,,Beautiful historic gardens,5.0,,"If you are stuck choosing between this and the Gardens by the Bay, choose this! This historic place is beautiful, peaceful and mesmerizing. You would never know you are in the middle of a city of millions of people. A MUST SEE! :)"
,,Nice Morning Walk,4.0,,Nice place for morning jog or a stroll in the park. The place is quiet and is filled with many kinds of foliage and flowers. There is also a pond inside the garden and some gazebos. Really nice place to visit!
,,Great spot to get away from urban sprawl,4.0,,"Walk around the garden under shady trees. Have a family picnic. It is a great place to get away from the urban environment. You wouldn't know that you are in a city. Unlike Garden on the Bay, the Botanic Garden feels more natural and you are surrounded by mature trees, plants and flowers. Take the MRT as the station is located just outside the Garden. Highly recommended and it is free. You will need at least 3 hours to walk around. So wear comfortable clothes and shoes."
,,Great garden,5.0,,"Beautiful and peaceful nature view. Will come again to explore different parts of it. Big garden, huge tree and lakes. A good get away from the busy city."
,,A must see while in Singapore,5.0,,"The gardens are free to the public, but there is a small charge to see the orchid garden. There was a nice house detailing the gardens history near opening. Plus the temporary but very nice Shirley Sherwood exhibition in a newly constructed exhibition house was superb. The orchid garden is a ""don't miss"". It is fascinating look at orchids and the Lady McNiece garden within it superb. The Cool House is a must and you'll want to be in there on a hot and sticky day. There is children's garden as well but you had to have a child to go in - from afar it looked fun. Look for small reptiles as well as flowers. There are dining facilities as well as kiosks to buy food and drink. It is for couples, friends, families and as a solo traveler it was a nice day out."
,,Loved the sculptures.,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens have easy travel access, and we were amazed how many locals were enjoying family gatherings and picnics here. We were glad we allowed plenty of time to explore the gardens, as there were art galleries and sculptures to enjoy along the way. The gardens were an invaluable resource in the early development of Singapore, and are of great historic value also. A place to be visited many times overs."
,,A good place to visit in Singapore,4.0,,Even locals visit Singapore Botanic Gardens often. It tells you how popular it is. You can walk in from one entrance and come out from the other to efficiently manage your whole visit. Be prepared for hot sun and rainy weather if you go with young children and elderly.
,,Nice and Chilled,5.0,,"Great change of scene from the city shopping, and plenty of shade from the sun! Good place to break up a day in the Singapore Sun!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,These gardens are free to the public. As well as plants we saw huge lizards on land and in water. These are the best gardens I've been to so far in the world. There are places inside to dine or buy drinks or gifts. Views are lovely. Hop off here from the hop on hop off bus and you won't be disappointed.
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Lovely place to walk around with lots of areas to explore. There's also places to drink and eat as well as immaculate bathroom facilities; well worth a visit.
,,Walk in the Gardens,5.0,,The botanical are beautiful with well laid out paved walks. The flora is beautiful with many well placed information plaques that are very interesting - free admission
,,A Family Place,4.0,,"If you love family outings and wanna chill out, this could be a place of choice. Touching the MRT, this place offers convenient transport. Be aware of some of the anti social activities that could be ongoing on a given day."
,,Great outing,5.0,,Its a lovely long walk across the garden. Its a treat to eyes no doubt. I loved the landscape and colorful plantation. Just bear in mind that it can be a long walk in a humid climate so better to dress accordingly.
,,Chillax with a picnic,5.0,,"We often go to have a picnic and to listen to the bands that occasionally play there, we love to meet up with friends and have a little chat when there are no bands playing and its a great place to let dogs and kids run wild."
,,Botanical Gardens,5.0,,This is definitely one of the nicest parks settings I have been in a very long time. Lover the layout of the park and the availability to see so many different flowers.
,,Interesting preservation of nature and time,4.0,,It's an experience if u have never visited botanical garden in any city. They have lot of different gardens which is interesting to take a stroll around. Overall beautiful and refreshing. It is one of the stops for hop on hop off yellow line.
,,"Paradise for a nature lover, particularly in good weather",5.0,,"I have been there many times with family and friends. Its always been a good trip as there is a lot to see, learn and explore. The garden is not only vast and beautiful it also offers a serene environment right in the middle of the city. Very convenient access, restaurants are nice but I never ate from there.
Variety of flora and fauna can be seen there, a good place to visit if you are interested in botany."
,,The Kids Ask to Go!,5.0,,"As far as free activities in Singapore, this place is close to the top. Our kids love going there. They can run, explore, play on the playgrounds, even play in the small water park for kids. When the kids ask to go there, you know it is a winner."
,,Most beautiful place,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG) was just a short bus ride from Orchard Rd, I took advantage of the “hop on hop off bus service” Tip for those who travel using Singapore airlines keep your boarding pass you will save $19.00 per person on this service. You can also get to the gardens by the SMRT getting off at Botanic Gardens station using the circle line with the new downtown connection opening in late 2015.
This is one of the best botanical gardens I have been to. I am a great fan of Orchids and SBG has the best selections and display of these beauties I have seen anywhere. It cost a few bob to have a look but well worth it. There are also number of themed gardens like the ginger garden, the healing garden, the foliage garden, the fragrant garden and again my favourite the orchid garden.
When visiting the gardens allow plenty of time 3 – 4 hours to investigate all the little hidden nook and cranies so to speak, stroll by the lake or take a picnic lunch. The entire garden is very serene and totally removed from the hustle and bustle in the city. With broadwalk paths, come prepared with comfortable walking shoes and you will enjoy the lush green surroundings a lot more.
If taking children remember, it is a huge space and easy to loose sight of the little ones so be carful. With plenty to see come prepared there are and attractions and also cafes inside the gardens.
You really need to plan your visit as not all the flowers will be in bloom and you could be disappointed. The garden is maintained to a high standard and with hundreds of different types of plants and many huge trees, some more than a hundred years old.
This is a most beautiful place to walk around, the symphony lakes give off a tranquil feel complete with white swans, garden sculptures etc, through to the children's garden, the bougainvillea garden, If you like nature this is a must visit location."
,,Take a walk,5.0,,"Free entrance. If you get time, it is worth to spend a few hours taking a walk here. I really like it."
,,"Very nice place, but also very humid",4.0,,"This place is the most humid point in Singapore. WAlking from the gate to the gardens entrance only 5 minute walk, but felt like forever, due to lack of shade."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,We attended with 2 adults and 2 kids (aged 4 & 10). We as adults loved it. The kids enjoyed but at that age they just run around like crazy and dont really let the adults enjoy much at all. So if we (the adults) were there alone we would have enjoyed the surroundings and walks a lot more but with kids only enjoyed it on a superficial level.
,,lovely...,5.0,,"Lovely walk. A nice tour on this espectacular gardens. Super clean and manicured. A bit off road from the main part of town, but worth the detour if you into greens..."
,,Gardens,3.0,,Great place to walk about and take in the different areas of the garden. The pond and children area is a great place for the family to relax
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"A must visit when in Singapore, not as touristy as the Zoo and a lovely place to wander around. Squirrels are cute"
,,Morning walk,5.0,,Amongst the place to visit in Singapore. It's a pleasant surprise in the middle of the city. Will recommend a visit for all Travellers Travelling to Singapore
,,Should be the highlight of your holiday!,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens are superb! they have really worked over the years to plan and plant, groom and entice, exotic blooms and shrubs, and you can see Tropical flowers that are stunning in colour. There are the ginger gardens, the orchid families, the open grass lands for family pinics, and if you want tranquility there are the Gazebos in which you can sit for a breather and watch the swans gracefully gliding on the beautiful lake. Take you camera with you-it will be worth it!"
,,Excellent garden,4.0,,We enjoyed the variety in these manicured gardens. You might even see a giant monitor lizard wandering or a squirrel rustling in the trees. The orchid section costs but is worth the price and the gardens are otherwise free. You can buy a cold drink from a vending machine for reasonable money. There are good places for coffee or food but can't tell you prices cause we didn't go. The park is big so you want to be fit or perhaps only visit the orchids if you don't have hours or the legs for a long walk. Found it a bit hard to follow the exit signs and no mrt (rail) convenient to the orchid end of the park. There is a bus stop at that end which we used and if you have an mrt card it's cheap. Worthwhile to visit.
,,Beautiful Gardens not far out of the city,4.0,,We travelled by MRT to the closest station which provides you with the opportunity to walk through the gardens and enjoy the greenery on the way to seeing the National Orchid Garden. We arrived early so that it would not be too hot but there is plenty of shade on the walking tracks. The complementary map provided is easy to follow and it is well signposted throughout making it easy to find your way. You will need to set aside quite a few hours to visit especially if you are going to the NOG which is spectacular. We walked out to the other side of the gardens and easily found the bus we needed to get back to our hotel near Orchard Road. The many themed gardens are well presented and maintained and overall it is a pleasant few hours walking amongst the tropical greenery.
,,Green gem in the middle of the city,5.0,,We spent half a day in the gardens which are a peaceful haven in the bustle of the city. Very easy to get to as there is a MRT station right outside. Lots of variety and shady spots to walk and stop. The Orchid garden is stunning and a must see at only 5 Singapore dollars entrance charge
,,One of the best botanical gardens I've been to.,4.0,,This is one of the best botanical gardens I've been to. Its a huge space plenty to see and attractions and cafes inside.
,,Away from the hustle and bustle,4.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a very well maintained and huge set of gardens. It contains hundreds of different types of plants and many huge trees, probably more than a hundred years old. The entire garden is very serene and totally removed from the hustle and bustle in the city. There are broad paths for walking, and you should come prepared to spend at least 3 hours to enjoy the lush green surroundings. There are a number of themed gardens like the ginger garden, the healing garden, the foliage garden, the fragrant garden and the orchid garden. All except the orchid garden are free. We were a little disappointed not to see many flowers in bloom in the main garden. Perhaps there are not too many flowering plants at all. The orchid garden had a display of more than a thousand species and hybrids of orchids. An ideal place for a leisurely stroll and a picnic. I would definitely love to visit again ....."
,,Tranquility abounds,5.0,,"This was a beautiful place to walk around the lakes, complete with white swans, through the children's garden, the bougainvillea garden, the symphony lake and many places to eat and get cold water on a hot day. Very impressive and easy to access from my hotel, a short walk or a quick bus trip."
,,Beautiful walk if you can overlook the humidity,4.0,,Lovely peaceful surrounds. Can be quite hot and humid so an overcast day is best. Food available in certain areas only.
,,Tropical plants carefully displayed in an understandable and natural setting,5.0,,This is outdoors and tropical. You're just about on the equator. Your imagination will put you with Stillwell in Burma and in Shangri-la a few steps later. Leave plenty of time to savor the experience and don't miss the orchids.
,,"Excellent, perfect for a long walk",5.0,,"The garden is so huge, it feels like you are the only one for miles. I was there for a good 5-6 hours and walked around the entire area. The garden is well planned, the trees were so huge! It is divided into different sections like the Orchid garden, the Rainforest, Medicinal gardens, etc. It was raining the entire time I was there, and I had to walk around with a trash bag (lent by a kindly gardener) fashioned into a raincoat. I think this garden needs an entire day visit, its worth it. The entrance to the botanic garden itself is free, but there is an entrance fee for the Orchid garden."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Visited botanic gardens after orchid gardens they are beautiful.There is so much greenery everywhere.We also had a 3 ft lizard go across our path while walking around fantastic,well worth a visit .Some people say its to hot but its hot everywhere in Singapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens are probably the best Botanic Gardens in the World. The amazing an maticulous array of different gardens is something that even the non-green thumbs will enjoy. It is worth putting a couple of hours aside to just wonder through and it offers such a contrast experience to what is the normal hustle and bustle of Singapore. Paying the extra to access the Orchid Centre is absolutely worth it and a highlight of the Gardens.
,,One of the best we have seen,5.0,,"While we have seen many botanical gardens, this is a top one, old trees grown so fast in the proper environment, lot of work and effort to make every plant and tree look at it's best, pond full of big fish and small turtles, the orchid garden within the premises, good public transportation, you could come here more than once if you have the time, cannot see all in a day"
,,Excellent gardens!,5.0,,"I loved the Botanic Gardens. Away from the main area with the Orchid Garden and shops, there are few people. My favorite place was The Dell, a wonderful, dark glade. Within the park are squirrels and turtles a plenty. I also saw a big monitor lizard sunning himself. This is a must for those who love plants."
,,Go for a jog !,5.0,,A really great place to visit (Botanic Garden and Orchid Garden). Plenty of beatiful greenery in the hearth of the city. My people do their morning or evening exercise here.
,,intermediate stop on the way back home,5.0,,We have visitied many Botanic Gardens in many countries and are positively suprised about the attractions at the Garden in Singapore. Especially interesting we found the way through the Developement of the earth and the one about the medical appli- cations of plants.
,,Botanical gardens,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the gardens and it was free, very tranquil and lots of places to sit. Nice little café for a coffee."
,,Nice morning,4.0,,We visited the botanical gardens more as a morning walk than anything else but stayed a lot longer. What a pretty tropical oasis in the middle of bustling Singapore. We also ate at the restaurant and had to get right Chicken rice which was actually quite good. The only issue which really isn't garden-based is that it does get quite hot quite soon in the middle of the day. Definitely worth the morning for sure.
,,"Relaxing on a week, orchid garden a must see",4.0,,It is amasing how different the feel can be there as compared to the rest of the city - like 1000 of kms away. great to walk or run. I visited the orchid garden which I found very impressive. A popular spot on weekends.
,,Must watch for environment lovers.,4.0,,Nicely maintained and quit from citi traffic. You could see people jogging and doing Yoga. Also one or other cultural activity in symphony.
,,Beautiful place to spend an hour or a day.,5.0,,"This is a beautiful attraction located not far from Embassy Row and the actual homes of many ambassadors as well as notorious billionaires.
The attraction requires a great deal of ambulation so prepare yourself. In hot weather you will break a sweat almost at once. The beautiful orchids and other plant life will make your effort worthwhile."
,,Perfectly manicured,5.0,,Well worth a visit - I didn't have enough time to see the entire gardens but will definitely going back to see the rest on a return visit. Well signposted and lots of areas to explore. You could easily spend a full day there.
,,Beautiful gardens...and they're free!,5.0,,I took an early morning walk around the gardens. Very well tended. The collection of mature trees is impressive. Gets crowded as the weekend mornings wear on.
,,Lovely stroll,4.0,,"Excellent, the gardens kept me thrilled and the camera snapping. Perfect for a long stroll, as my weather was good, not sure what it would be like if it rains. Shall return another time"
,,Serene Gardens,4.0,,I'd recommend a trip to the Botanic Gardens as a nice relaxing activity to get over the jet lag when arriving in Singapore or to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. I paid the gardens a visit on my first full day. The gardens a free to enter and contain a beautiful array of flora and fauna and are well maintained. Lots of great spots to chill out with a good book or just watch the world go by.
,,relaxing time,5.0,,"we visited this place during a flight transit to australia, for a break during the morning. fantasstic orchyds. Recommended for families and flower lovers"
,,Not for tourists,2.0,,"Its a huge garden , good for evening walk, but not a tourist attraction i would say. Reaching here is very easy, as there is an MRT station with the name of the garden and has exit right outside the entrance of the garden."
,,Breathtaking!!,5.0,,Only place in singapore which allows free access to the public but its worth every effort you take to go there! Beautiful is not the word. Must watch.
,,"A wonderful day for the family, for free!",5.0,,"As the title says, it is up to one day to visit all the Botanical Garden's has to offer (you will still miss many things); my fiancee and I were there for a half day and will return to see some of what we missed.

Do not be confused with the new gardens at Marina Bay area, these are the historical gardens, 156 years old and pure calm in one of the World's busiest cities.

Everything in the Botanical Garden is free, except the Orchid Garden and that is a staggering price of Sing$5 per adult :-)

It is one of the best 'parks' in the world, there are many things to see and you will miss a lot more than you will see.

The wildlife you see is pure Singapore, the odd squirrel as well as many minor (mynah) birds and other Singapore fauna.

There are many places to eat around the area, some are far more 'posh' than others, but you can find a place to refresh yourself, whatever you would like, however; most of the eating places appear to be in the northern part of the Gardens.

We stayed in the Orchard Parade Hotel at the top of Orchard Road and walked it in 15 minutes, it is very central, but can easily be reached by a taxi or bus.

Go once? Yes
Go twice? Yes
Go often? Yes, Yes, Yes"
,,Very big park,4.0,,"When I went there I didn't expect it to be so big. It's a nice park, where you can almost forget to be in the city.
There are also a lot of events like music, bootcamps, etc.

A nice place to go when you want to escape from the crazy busy life in the city."
,,"For garden and green lovers, it is a Paradise",4.0,,"you can spend the whole day there, it stays open till late by night. admission is free. fresh air, quite atmosphere, and huge space are things to expect... Have a good day.."
,,Serene,5.0,,Well kept despite the heavy weekend footfall. Walk very slowly and you'll be rewarded with unusual peeks into the native bird species. Needless to say the flora is simply fantastic.
,,Lots of walking,4.0,,"This is an excellent botanical garden for those who love them. It was tough on my husband since we did about 3 km walking in the tropical heat but I thoroughly enjoyed it. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it is evidently the place for family picnics and for foreign domestics to gather on their time off. It was charming. As a gardener, I found many fascinating plants that I cannot grow in the Northern hemisphere. Don't miss the National Orchid garden."
,,Lovely gardens and free,4.0,,"The gardens are mature and very well kept. Do visit the orchid garden while you are there. It is a big area and you will have trouble covering the whole gardens, especially if hot."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"Great gardens, always something new going on, especially around festival times. Tai Chi in the early mornings and music on the weekends (check schedules). Lots of quiet areas available for some respite. Recommend Halia restaurant for a romantic meal and Casa Verde for casual dining with the family."
,,Gardens for all.,5.0,,Beautiful gardens of many types. One can spend numerous days walking the paths and not see everything. We'll maintained and immaculate. Highly recommended.
,,Ok but not my favourite place to visit in Singapore,3.0,,"We were a little disappointed with our visit as the plants and grass looked like they could have used a drink of water as leaves were curling up and didn't look very lush. We got lost as we found the signage a bit confusing. Overall, I think the Botanic gardens we have seen in Australia are more beautiful and maintained better."
,,UNESCO ...award 2015 befitting SG50 Celebration,4.0,,"Had 2 hours last Sunday morning...the insightful and informative ginger garden is certainly a worthwhile trip.
The great variety of the rhizome family...well explained...colorful and shapes of the leaves fascinated me , man made waterfall and sculptures enhanced the overall landscape.....For nature lover...spend more time to explore the orchid gardens...join the guided trail."
,,A walk in the park,5.0,,Lots of changes n definitely better. Nice place for a great walk along the greenery. There's also restaurant within the garden. Easily accessible by public transport.
,,Lovely place to walk around,4.0,,Lovely place to walk around and to enjoy nature. The weather was lovely on the day we were there but could be tiny bit humid. You can spend a whole day there
,,A garden in the city,3.0,,I walked through this garden and spend some time here. It is a nice place but nothing special. You can spend some time here but don't need to do it
,,A must visit for you garden lovers,5.0,,"Beautifully groomed and manicured garden with well paved paths. An insight into Singapore's well cared greenery not just in here, but also representative of the overall landscape in Singapore.

All trees here have been planted for a reason... if you like natural sprawling vegetation, you may not enjoy, but if you like order, this might be your cuppa!

Either way, a beautiful garden for a stroll... best of all it opens till midnight!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The gardens are well worth a visit. They are easy to get to on the subway and are beautifully maintained. It was really hot when we went in August so bring lots of water and sun cream as not much around! Definitely bring a picnic, we regretted not having one as so many lovely spots to sit and eat."
,,National Orchid Garden Just Beautiful,5.0,,An absolutely beautiful and serene gardens. My favorite garden of course was the orchid garden. Magnificent!! There is a small fee to enter this garden - the rest of the gardens are free.
,,Real nature,5.0,,"This is a real nature comparing with garden by the bay if you would ask me to pick one. Big wide walking trail, get ready for long hour walk and photo taking. Bring some food with you and water. A lot of orchid species, flowers, fruit plants you will see. Beautiful sceneries, we saw a few couples taking wedding photos in the park. Surroundings are well taken care and maintained. If you forgot to bring food, there are two restaurants in there and a convenient shop. The restaurant price range is $14-$25, the convenient shop sandwiches are more expensive than usual. Just bring your own water and food if you can."
,,Fantastic day out if the weather is good! Watch the heat though,4.0,,Vast garden which you can spend a whole day exploring. The garden contains many attractions and to explore them all would take a whole day or two and involve a lot of walking! The humity in Singapore can be draining. Gardens highly recommended
,,Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Be entertained with concerts at the park or just enjoy the greenery at this new Unesco World Heritage site- The Botanic Gardens; a 183-acre botanical gardens with sculptures, a swan lake & significant collection of tropical trees.

How to get there
Take the Yellow/ Circle MRT line to Botanic Gardens Station.
Follow the signage that says, “Botanic Gardens”.

This is one of the TOP Things to do in Singapore for FREE! (Except for the Orchid or other gardens which has S$5 entrance fee)."
,,Stunning and peaceful,4.0,,"A real oasis in the city. What a relaxing and calming experience, lovely to stroll around with one's own thoughts. Definitely worth a few hours there for something different in Singapore."
,,another beautiful garden,4.0,,well set out areas for the kids to play and do things. visit the orchid house as well its worth it. singapore does its gardens well.
,,mesmerizing,2.0,,"we enjoyed our visit to Botanic gardens at Singapore. lush green , soothing to eyes and very pleasant to walk through to garden. Traveler to Singapore must plan a visit to garden."
,,Tranquil but busy family place,5.0,,"It is great to see groups of local people with their picnics playing in this area.It is a large space that you need to allow a few hours to walk around. From the water feature with swans, to the Bonsai display and the lilly ponds. Food and drink is available from shops and the drink machines scattered around the gardens are a great idea for a cheap drink."
,,Should have gone during the day,3.0,,We went in the evening and found it a little uncomfortable as a lot of couples were there on 4/10/15 and it appeared to be a meeting place for local couples/friends to hang out. We tried to find the Orchid Garden and came to a fork with two paths and as no signage at that particular point we weren't sure which path to take so decided to turn around and give it a miss.
,,A beautiful garden well planned.,5.0,,"With free travel on national day celebrations there was no excuse not to go to the free concert at the gardens. The bus travel was easy and the walk from the bus stop was pleasant.
The Garden was very beautiful. Nicely planned and plenty to see. I've been several times since at it never gets old."
,,Beautiful! Bring water though,5.0,,"The gardens were beautiful! It was hot and water wasn't available, so bring water bottles. But it was so clean and huge, we didn't hardly see a fraction of it because it's so big. But it was quiet and we got some gorgeous photos."
,,"Orchids, orchids, orchids!!!",5.0,,"Without a doubt the finest display of Orchids I have ever laid eyes on, 90% outdoors. Not expensive, and super-dooper photo opportunity"
,,Beautifully maintained,4.0,,"Well worth a visit, and one can spend a very pleasant hour, or several wandering around. Trees and plants have helpful signs and descriptions, as do the many Victorian and other buildings and structures. It is only a short walk from many hotels, and Orchard Road."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"I walked in the garden for few hours. The National Orchid Garden is the main attraction (the only one with a fee I guess) but the rest of the huge garden is as beautiful. You can walk, relax on a bench, just enjoy. When I was there it was during weektime so less crowded, I had the feeling of having parts of the garden just for myself."
,,Marvellous,5.0,,This is a definite must. The gardens are extremely fascinating and a great wonder. Staff are so helpful and the various species are so incredibly well displayed. It's a sight to be seen.
,,Nice Garden from Tanglin Road end but not from circle line end,3.0,,Great gardens to visit with family and friends. Great for walking briskly or strolling through. Great for picnic but don't go via mrt side at Tanglin Road...as it's always crowdeñ
,,Garden paradise,4.0,,"74 hectares of flora, you will definitely appreciate the beauty of nature. Gardens are clean, well maintained & nicely designed. A lot of big & small paths to choose from. Be prepared to walk at your leisure, bring a hat & a bottle of water. No entrance fee except for the orchid garden. One of the best gardens that I have seen."
,,one of the finest gardens in all of Asia,5.0,,"A garden oasis away from the bustle of Singapore's busy centers. Plan on a couple of hours at least to take in a quiet stroll through scenic, mostly shaded pathways. Find locals doing Tai Chi and yoga in the morning hours, weekends have free evening concerts. A must do is the National Orchid Garden -- allow an hour or two alone for this amazing collection of orchids."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Probably the best botanical garden in the world. I was totally amazed. A good place for family, friends, or couples"
,,Tropical Garden Paradise,5.0,,"I am an avid gardener and especially love palms and orchids so this place was heaven. Easy to get to on subway, take the train to Botanic Gardens, and the station is right at the entrance gate. Free admission except for Orchid House which was $5. I was less impressed with orchid garden because most were blooming vanda, dendrobium, and oncidium orchids, all mostly the same in very well displayed but obviously staged settings. This was also the most crowded area. The rest of the gardens is very peaceful and well marked, I mostly enjoyed the Palm Valley, Rain Forest, and Healing Garden. Plan on spending 2 hours for a quick but adequate stroll. Places to buy food and gifts scattered throughout the grounds and restrooms. Well marked in English not just directional but also the exhibits. Bring sunglasses, handkerchief, and comfortable walking shoes."
,,A great place within city limits,5.0,,"With high rise buildings all over SIN, this is just the place to be within the city limits offering a full spread of landscape, duck pond & an exclusive Orchid Garden.. One can also go for long walks or jog in the park without any hindarance of vehicle movements."
,,Clean botaical garden,5.0,,"Amazng botanical garden in small country, the climate was good, frest, clean and frindly people, this is the best botanical garden i have been in world. For sure i recommended to visit this garden especially for family :)"
,,Beautiful Garden... height of tranquility,5.0,,"Get away from the noise and busy activities in our daily lives. Take a stroll, enjoy the fresh air, and if you love plants, there are so many varieties. One of the most beautiful parks in the world. (Just pay a small fee and go to the National Orchid Garden, you'd love it)."
,,A triumph of manicured rainforest!,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a must. We went during the hottest part of the day (12-4pm!) and still managed to walk around about 10k of walkways and paths. There are monitor lizards strolling peacefully about under the cover of rainforest fauna. Birds dart about in the canopy and the lake is a lovely area to sit and chill. There is a kids are with a play park ... where you are only allowed in if you have your child with you, so very safe. There are good places to eat from high end restaurants to hawkers centres - where the food is tasty, clean and cheap! We will be back!"
,,GOB SMACKING,5.0,,We have been to some beautiful gardens around the world but this tops the lot. Not only are the gardens beautiful but the history behind them is very interesting. A must see is the orchid garden area and truthfully I could have spent all day there see looking at the enormous display and easy walking throughout the entire gardens.
,,Really Nice Colourful Place,5.0,,"I visited here with my husband. It is a really pleasant place to walk around. The day we walked around was very warm and humid, walk slowly and dress accordingly. As well as seeing plants and flowers (pay the extra money to go around the Orchid Gardens), we saw and photographed squirrels and numerous lizards, including some large ones swimming. The fish are also fascinating to watch and quite a size."
,,"Amazing, truly beautiful.",5.0,,"The Botanical Garden's are breath taking and beautiful and really do show what Singapore has to offer. It's easy and inexpensive to get to using the metro and is a great day time activity. I spent a few hours here exploring on my own and taking lots of photos while my partner was busy working. I really enjoyed my visit and would highly recommend it.

Orchid garden:

This part of the garden has a $5 entry fee, but it is definitely worth it. There are so many gorgeous flowers and different parts of the garden to explore. There are even 'selfie' spots pointed out so you can make sure to get a nice photo!

Tips for tourists:

There are a few nit-picky negatives that I can pick out but most of these can be avoided. First of all it can get VERY VERY HOT, make sure you look after yourself by wearing sun protection, sun glasses, hats and fans etc! Secondly refreshments are more expensive in the gardens, this is a tourist attraction... if you don'y want to pay a premium price for a sandwich I would recommend bring snacks. And definitely bring a water bottle! As I said before it gets hot! There are plenty of water fountains spotted around the park so you can stay hydrated, this is important if you are going to be wandering around for any length of time!

My finial and only (semi) serious negative point is that the signs can be a little confusing as there are many paths, you're not likely to get lost but it can be confusing if you're trying to find a particular place or get to a metro station. I accidentally stumble upon the cactus and bonsai sections, and I wasn't the only one who couldn't make sense of how to find the ginger garden. If you're not careful you might find yourself walking in circles!"
,,Good for a walk,3.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a UNESCO heritage site, established more than a century and a half ago. It is spread over a huge area, and comprises a number of gardens. We only had time to walk around the Swan Lake which can be reached after walking through the Ginger garden. There isn’t much to see in the Ginger garden. The swan lake (more like a pond) is said to house numerous species of aquatic plants and fishes. It is also home to a pair of swans from whom the lake derives its name. The water in the lake is rather muddy."
,,Fresh air in the Singapore,4.0,,I went there last year. It is near by the MRT and recommend to visit is in the morning. Feeling fresh in the middle of traffic and building around Singapore.
,,Only for the nature geeks,3.0,,This is only for those nature geeks who get excited on all the green. Otherwise it is just a boring stroll through the gardens. Give it a miss. Situated far from the major attractions.
,,Hands down best gardens I've visited,5.0,,"I've been in some gardens while traveling, but not a single one comes close to the (very tropical) Botanic Gardens in Singapore. The variety is crazy large, everything is very clean and well-organized. The whole thing is free (!) and the fee to the Orchid Garden is only 5 SGD. You can walk around for hours without getting bored, plus you get to experience some history too."
,,A garden within a garden,5.0,,"Caught a cab to the gardens, 2 entry points and very well signed. It is huge but you can choose sections to do. Swan lake was amazing and the really old trees there have a lot of history which is all explained. One tree is the last of its kind in the world. The park is world heritage listed and rightfully so. Melbourne gardens are not a patch on Singapore. A great morning out. The haze was not so noticeable here with so many beautiful trees plants and flowers."
,,A surprisingly quiet area,5.0,,A beautiful and tranquil location in the heart of a bustling Singapore. Well worth a visit even if to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday routines in Singapore.
,,Morning walk,5.0,,Great UNESCO heritage site. Admission free. Flora and fauna galore. There are also many fruit trees (including the local favourite durian) to be found!
,,Beautiful & Worth Visiting,4.0,,"Such a beautiful location, there is so much to see at the gardens and so many beautiful glowers. Make sure you take your own picnic, as food at the gardens is expensive. Also take plenty of insect spray, as I got bitten very badly!"
,,Magic beyond the Imagination,5.0,,"You step into a wonderland of trees, plants, varietals, and every kind of botanical known to man. How Singapore did this is amazing, particularly the high-elevated walkways. We would recommend this attraction to anyone, any age, at any price .... One of the best attractions in Singapore, short of F1!!!! It is space-age botanic!!!"
,,Oasis in the city.,4.0,,When we visited this (week day in september) the few amount of visitors there really surprised me. This is a beautiful and big free garden everyone should visit. The Ballas Childrens' garden was far from the main entrance and the orchid exhibition so make sure to bring enough water and snacks along. Food near the children's garden is nog worth it so bring along your own. Children's garden is a bit run down and needs some renovations but my kids enjoyed the tree house (careful of the ants in the sand and the bottom of the slides)
,,Lovely oasis in busy Singapore,4.0,,The gardens are very large and have many different sections ranging from rainforests to bonsai and cacti. You really don't feel like you are in a large city and the cool greenery is a nice change from the heat.
,,nice place to spend a couple of hours,4.0,,spent an hour and a half walking round these gardens and rain forrest walks well worth if you enjoy this sort of thing also it is free to go in also orchid garden is in same place but 1 dollar to go in
,,Singapore's little heaven,5.0,,"A vast diversified park in the middle of the city. If you want to spend some time away from the city and be in it at the same time, this is the destination you should go to. You will enjoy the walk/jog around the garden. Meanwhile, you should also visit Flower and Orchid gardens."
,,Great place to relax and enjoy a walk,5.0,,"Brilliant, loved the gardens, especially the orchids they are so amazing. Saw turtles, big fish and monitor lizards. Thy gardens are well layed out, easy to navigate The concerts are also excellent"
,,Orchids galore!,5.0,,"It was a very worthwhile 3- hour excursion. What I like was the over-all cleanliness of the gardens. and the best of all are the orchids and other flowers gloriously basking in the sun. Definitely a good walking shoes, hat & of course, camera! Will visit again. Well done, Singapore to have this garden, a feat for the eyes!"
,,beautiful gardens,5.0,,You could easily spend a whole day wandering through these magnificent gardens. The Orchid house is also a spectacular sight.
,,Lovely,5.0,,"A great place to visit and it is FREE.
Despite the heat and humidity we spent 4 hours looking around slowly admiring the surrounds. The sign posts give you easy directions to follow. Singapore is truly the garden state. The Botanical Gardens are easy to get to by train (MTR), the best way to travel around Singapore very cheap, clean and efficient. I would highly recommend a visit to these gardens."
,,A great way to spend a day,5.0,,Beautiful gardens that take up a massive space in Singapore. The green space is very impressive and very well kept. It's very easy to get to from the MRT. Best part about it is it's free!

,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,"A huge garden and a stunningly beautiful walk through the lush vegetation. They specialize in orchids and they have many. All in a delightfully natural tropical setting. Plan to spend several hours, take your time and enjoy the beauty of this meticulously maintained garden. We have been in several throughout the world and this one is close to the top of the list. Busy place so plan to arrive early."
,,So much to see,5.0,,"We caught the hop on/hop off bus and proceeded through the entrance where helpful people provided maps and an excellent cafe and gift shop were located. It was an easy walk to a lake where outdoor orchestral performances are sometimes performed. Along the way we could see that the plants thrived in the humidity of Singapore, healthy specimens of many species abounding. The orchid garden must be visited with many terrestial varieties but even more attractive varieties growing in trees along with bromeliads and ferns and epiphytes. As usual the people of Singapore were most friendly and helpful and this made the visit even better."
,,Recommended.,5.0,,"Well laid out grounds, with many rare and uncommon trees and smaller plants. A restful and interesting place to visit. Easily accessible by bus."
,,World Heritage Site for a reason,5.0,,Lovely garden with lots to see from the Ginger and Orchard gardens through to the Symphony stage in the lake. Good food too. The Halia is excellent and Casa Verde is good for brunch or lunch.

,,Spend a whole day exploring,4.0,,We were enchanted by the Botanic Gardens. Arriving by bus we were delighted by the choice from the very first moment. The orchid's were probably our favourite - there is a charge for this section - but on a hot day there are the odd air conditioned areas. There are marvellous landscapes to capture throughout the Gardens along with the many tree and plant species and the occasional docile lizard. We spent most of the day at the Gardens and still didn't see it all. Its on our list to visit again.
,,Orchid collection,5.0,,Stunning gardens and the orchid collection is a must see. Easily accessible on the hop on hop off bus. We were fortunate to see one of the small dragons/lizards searching through the leaf litter for insects
,,Beautiful Garden,4.0,,"I loved this place for its tranquility, cleanliness, and good maintenance. Do visit this place if you are in Singapore."
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,"A very tranquil place to visit, away from the busy Orchard Road. Just one drawback for two elderly visitors you have to be aware of lots of youngsters on their scooters."
,,Simple WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!,4.0,,The Well maintained Gardens will make you think how awesome can be the gardens. The colorful flowers with different species of plants.
,,The best attraction in city!,5.0,,We love Botanics Garden! It was our first time in Singapore and our first destinations was there. It's a beautiful and peaceful place. The Orchid Garden is unmissable
,,Little Oasis of peace,5.0,,"Easy to get to via the MRT system. Free to access and the gardens are right next door to the MRT. Loads to do and see. Different gardens to look at - e.g Rain forest, foliage garden etc. Orchid Garden has a charge but it was $5 SGD at the time of visit (about £2.50).

Excellent facilities with toilets, gift shops and drink fountains. I spend a couple of hours there after a few hectic days before at the Grand Prix and it was nice to tally chill out."
,,The Gardens are Lovely,5.0,,"Its a very special garden. The Orchids alone make it worth the trip. Its hot here, wear a hat and stay hydrated. They have cooling stations that are helpful."
,,Not as awesome,3.0,,"It's a nice garden but nothing I would recommend if someone is on a tight schedule. Also very very hot, definitely not as awesome as the gardens by the bay."
,,Like any other park [except the swan lake],3.0,,"If you want to get away from the concrete jungle that is Singapore, Botancial gardens is good for a walk. Definitely not a tourist attraction (reviewed Orchid garden which is a paid attraction separately). Do visit the swan lake for the fishes, turtles, and swans."
,,Marvelous place,5.0,,"This garden is a historical icon of singapore. Located in the heart of the city once i entered i felt isolated and in a beautiful garden. From rain forest to national orchard garden every plant os beatifully shown and preserved. Great place for hicking, dog walking and runing. A dream for every botanic scientist, photographer. And excellent for school trips. A must see in singapore."
,,A tranquile place in this busy city,5.0,,"I always have a walk there when I stay in SIN for the weekend. It's fun watching birds, flowers and in particular the Singaporeans having picnic on the lawn. A must see us the Orchid garden"
,,Outstanding Garden!!,5.0,,"Outstanding get away from the busy city.Lots of sections to visit and walk around. Convenient to SMRT, station just adjacent to an entrance. Suggest visiting in the morning before it is too warm, or on a cloudy day. Free admission, great experience."
,,A walk through time!,5.0,,"The gardens are divided into different areas, the two best ones are the Evolution garden, showing how the earth has changed over millions of years and the Rainforest, which provides some cool respite from the Singapore heat. You can lose yourself in there for ages. The gardens were so lovely we went two days running."
,,A calming beautiful landscape hidden in the midst of city,5.0,,"My partner and I visited the gardens during our short stay in Singapore. Our hop on hop off bus stopped at the gardens and we got off to have a look around, we found ourselves admiring the natural beauty of the surrounds. Every part of the gardens was carefully manicured and care for. We paid a small fee and visited inside the Orchard gardens too, this was lovely."
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,A great place to visit with an amazing array of all things botanical . Very easy access via the train. The one problem was finding the food and drink. Visitor centre CLOSED.
,,Almost paradise,5.0,,"Spend your afternoon in this wonderful environment of colours, fragrances, nature. The SMRT will leave you at the main gate. Check the programme for any concerts before you go. We were lucky to attend a guest duet presenting music for piano and flute at the Shaw stage. This is actually a floating stage with a waterlilly 'roof' and a pond with real, huge waterlillies! You can lay on the green grass and listen to the music while a friendly but massive lizard will climb on the trees behind you. Take anti-mosquito cream and water with you. It can be quite hot, but don't miss the small themed gardens inside the botanical gardens: especially healing garden presenting all herbs we use in medicine or the evolution garden - showing you the history of plants."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Wonderful time...everyone should go to the Garden. The cost is spot on and the walk is healthy. I will go again upon my return to this beautiful country.
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens. A Must Visit,5.0,,"I expected to view a wonderland of tropical botanicals and I was suitably impressed by the variety. However, there is so much more that one needs at least a few hours to appreciate its real variety. Gardens from all over the world displayed in their own Eco-systems are both so attractive as well as educational for the school children who visit. Olive trees hundreds of years old transplanted from the Mediterranean, a tulip garden from Holland, an Australian flora display, the list goes on. These gardens have impressed us so much that we intend to visit every time we are in Singapore."
,,Well Deserved award winning location,5.0,,Excellent site to learn more about Singapore's history through nature and its boons. An array of orchids from different colours greeted me as I approached the orchid trek . Really cool as there were a few nature treks in this urban jungle we call Singapore and also a chance of spotting great wildlife. We spotted a monitor lizard and a few local birds which were fascinating ! Excellent location for a picinic with the fam and totally deserves its UNESCO HERITAGE STATUS !!
,,Only been to the kiddies part,5.0,,"Took 2 kids in the kiddies part of he botanic gardens. The 4 year old enjoyed it throughout, made some friends and ran down the big slides a few times. I took the 1 year old down the slide, not so impressed ... Bad mummy moment. Found out lots of mums/ nannies take the kids there for playground first then fountain. Sadly we weren't prepared for that and my son was too shy to go in with his underpants only, so we went home shortly after and took a shower. It was a fantastic afternoon nevertheless :-)"
,,"Green, Green and More Green",4.0,,"You better like flowers, and trees and vegetation in general, I love them but if you do not enjoy them it might be boring (my boyfriend's words)."
,,Unexpected size in such a small city,4.0,,Very large garden area with a lake. Put your walking shoes on and allow most of a day if you want to see all of it. Expect soem small hills and long pathways. Free admission to the main park but extra to the Orchard display
,,Unesco heritage site,5.0,,"This gardeb was recently accredited as UNESCO heritage site.. the orchid garden is also good.. the souvenirs you buy from the shop at the exit is also reasonable.. e.g. the prices for ""orchid flowers inside acrylic"" here seems to be cheaper than anywhere else, like 20 to 25% less than even in duty free shops at airport."
,,Fresh air,4.0,,"last month,I visit botanic garden with my family.There has many plants and make people who went there feel healthy and relax. In botanic garden you can enjoy walking/jogging and take photo."
,,Perfect positive externality and it is FREE,4.0,,"If you wish to spend time in Singapore meaningfully, but not spend any money, this is the place to be!

A large part of the botanic gardens looks like a park, where you can just take a stroll or jog around while you take in the fresh air and scent of all the Flora around you. The gardens where all the different types of flowers are also very interesting. If you love flowers, this is a treat to the eye. The names of the flowers are clearly labelled, both in its common and botanic names.

Botanic garden was also named a UNESCO heritage site. This is a big title, in southeast Asia especially, as it recognises the historical importance and the role of places which have contributed to shaping these countries. But I would say, go for the flowers and with the intention of being closer with nature, rather for UNESCO title. It is a great Park, the title doesn't make it any greater than it already is.

Family friendly, elderly friendly.
I don't know what else there is to say, except that since it is so accessible by MRT (It is right outside botanic gardens mrt) there are so many reasons to visit the place! And I can't stress this enough-it's free, so there's no reason to complain that you cannot get around singapore or spend time here without spending money.

There is an eatery or two within the compound.

Cheers!"
,,One of the Best Place in Singapore,5.0,,We love this place! It's getting crowded though bcoz now their UNESCO certified. One of the best spot to enjoy holiday with family.
,,Nature's Gem in a Bustling City Scape!,5.0,,"This was a great escape to nature in a big city. Reminded me of the park in the center of Hong Kong or Central Park in New York City, but much smaller. I enjoyed the holisitic/medicinal garden as well as the timeline walk through different periods of history."
,,Best Botanical Gardens I Have Ever Seen!,5.0,,"I visit botanical gardens in almost every city I go to that has them, and I can honestly say this is the best I've seen. First of all, it's HUGE. It's also maintained really well and all of the plants look very green and healthy. It's also a lot of fun - there's some plants you may never see again in your life. There are places to sit and relax and many walking trails, so I would definitely suggest this to anyone considering. (Went Summer 2012)."
,,"nice, big, refreshing",4.0,,"tempatnya bagus, tanamannya pun beragam, restaurant n cafenya pun OK. good place to hang out or dating or even with family or sport"

,,Art and nature walk,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens, UNESCO heritage site is more than 150 years old famed for its heritage trees, well manicured lawns, orchids, herbs and botany research centre.

,,WALKING THRU GARDEN IN THE CITY,4.0,,"Its like a home garden , of a bigger scale , tropical plants. Being in the tropics, walking around the the gardens on humid days will be taxing, so it will be worth bringing extra shirts with plenty of water or liquid to replenish lost body fluids thru your perspiration. Of course a good camera or your celpone will be good to preserved or document of you have seen. Best time will be Nov -Jan, the weather or temperature is more cooler. We went there in Aug 2013."
,,Morning jog,5.0,,"The place is awesomely beautiful. Once you are inside, it feels like you are in a huge forest. Try going there during 7 or 8 am, you can still breathe in the very fresh watery air, see the morning fog, and hear all the insect sounds. Very recommended to those nature lover."
,,Great day,5.0,,"A colleague and I visited when we had some down time between business meetings.

We had a long walk on a hot hazy day but throughly enjoyed it - in particular we found the ginger section interesting and the orchids very beautiful. We were lucky enough to see some native lizards too - one as big as a two year old child!

The only downside was the cool section (temperate?) - there needs to be crowd control so everyone gets to see - we being reserved anglos couldn't compete with other visitors who needed to take photos of each and every plant to the detriment of anyone else who want to just look too.

Pleased to see a train station now connects the gardens - but discovered after we'd caught the taxi in!

Well worth the visit."

It will cost $5 to get in but we spent a couple of hours there. You can even get a wheelchair if you need one. There are orchids of every colour (we even saw a black one) and type. There is a slight incline but easily handled by older people. Well worth the visit."
,,Over Hyped,3.0,,"I have seen better gardens, Over all it was just ok, I do agree they are well maintained, but there is not much to see, I dint find anything Extra ordinary or the hype around it.

It's big enough that you can go inside and actually forget you are in the city. The gardens are great to walk around or just sit in and soak up all the nature around you.

,,For flower lovers,4.0,,"The Singapore botanic gardens have a nice array of tropical flowers that make it worth visiting, even if it is a little way out of the way when you are staying in Singapore city (reminder Singapore is more than Singapore city). You can get more or less there on the MTR."

In the centre are a couple of restaurants / shops where you can by drinks and eat. Albeit slightly overpriced..but then that does go in tandem with Singapore. Orchid gardens in the middle also well worth the S$5 entrance fee. Take comfortable shoes...sun screen or parasol if sunny. It gets hot ! Comfy shoes.

,,Pity it was raining,4.0,,We took a stroll around the beautiful botanic gardens but unfortunately it was raining on and off so we were not able to enjoy its beauty to the fullest. We did wonder around several areas and saw loads of beautiful trees and flowers. We did not visit the orchid garden as it had an extra cost and we were on a time restraint. It is a wonderful place to take children with bicycles and roller skates or just to go for a run. I am sure it would have been even better if the sun was shining...maybe next time!
,,Such a great place to visit,5.0,,The Singapore Botanical gardens are a great place to visit. All the exotic plant life is great to see. Just the place for a nice relaxing visit without the hustle bustle of some of Singapore's other attractions
,,Stunning garden,5.0,,INCREDIBLE immense garden.Wear comfy shoes because there ton's of walking. There are some restaurants on the pricey side. You MUST make the paid visit to the Orchid Garden which can't be missed.
,,Singapore's nature highlight,5.0,,"The greenery, landscapes and nature, all in one. This place is massive that you need to spend half of your day here! If you've bring along your camera or picnic kit, this could be a great spot to spend your leisure day over here.

There are remarkable spots that the garden had set up, make sure to just roam around freely, enjoy every path taken, venture into every paths in the garden, this is just ultra relaxing. I hope I could come here every day.

Walked the rainforest path (near to the UNESCO Heritage site Board and souvenir centre) and don't miss out the heritage tree!"
,,Truly unique experience,5.0,,"Large and beautiful garden, that is used by locals and tourists alike. For me a must see if you spend 3-4 days in Singapore. It's an impressive achievement of urban planning! It's a perfect place to jog. Come in the morning when it's less hot. The garden is quite large, so take enough liquids with you."
,,Beautiful hours spent.,5.0,,"This place is MASSIVE! I think one could easily spend a good 3-4 hours walking around the estate filled with flowers, plants and orchids. I don't think that's even enough if its spent looking at each of the collection carefully. Beautifully arranged, VERY neat, VERY quite, and it feels like its pretty far away from the city. The place feels unpolluted too; fresh air all around. We chose to walk all the way from the main road (as we: me and my wife, liked to walk) and it was a pretty long one, but definitely worth it. One more thing to add, I don't think you will be done seeing this place in a day's time. You would need more of that. Definitely a place to visit and spend time 'with nature'."
,,Very Enjoyable Visit,5.0,,"Huge gardens, well signposted. I specifically went to visit the Orchid Garden, but had a good hour's walk before I got there. Very relaxing. Need to go again to see more. If you go to visit the Healing Garden, check times & days, not always open."
,,Ideal Picnic Spot,5.0,,I would say this is ideal place where you could laze around and spend considerable amount of time. Very nicely maintained . You can bring your food and you could have relaxing time with family and friends.
,,Main attraction for nature lovers and peace seekers.,5.0,,Rather far from the center but worth to visit. There is a lot to see (and therefore to walk) so a choice at the entrance is advisable. Do not miss the orchid garden (where separate entrance fee applies).
,,great place on ahot day,5.0,,great gardens easy to get to on the Hop on hop off bus. take your camera for great photos. give yourself the whole day to see it as it is a large area
,,Sightseeing,5.0,,The whole Botanic Gardens visit was stunning. Just wish we had had more time to spend there.....slightly spoiled by the obligatory gift shop
,,One of the world's best,5.0,,"A must see in Singapore.. the orchids and braciliads are simply magnificent. A great display of south east asian flora and forest niches. Scientific name labelling is terrific as well. Great cafe in the ginger garden area that has good ginger-based items on the menu. If you are into orchids, this is a must see before you die."
,,Great natural park with orchids A must see,5.0,,Fantastic place to see beautiful orchids in a natural environment A must see whilst in Singapore Also try the guybano/ sour sop shake just outside at the hawker stalls
,,Oasis of calm and it's FREE,5.0,,this is a wonderful garden not only full of beauty also amazing birds and fish. How lovely to find such calm in a very built up city. This was a highlight for us and the gift shop is very tasteful.
,,Great place to visit.,5.0,,"I have visited a lot of botanic gardens around the world and I found this place to be one of the most interesting. We could only spend a few hours but, if you took a picnic, you could easily spend a whole day and still not have seen it all. And best of all, it's free!"
,,AWESOME GARDEN WALK,4.0,,"This place is really beautiful and well maintained . And good for picnic, rest, walk around. This is free for public."
,,Excellent Place for Morning Walk,5.0,,"Relaxing place to take a walk and jog,and rest. It is well organiezed and maintanaced. it opens at aound 6 in the morning, so lots of SIngaporeans come to enjoy the morning air there.I'm interested in plants and flowers and also enjoyed seeing them."
,,"Beautiful! Well kept, amazing planting, & an oasis of green!",5.0,,"Allow a whole day! An amazing garden, or actually lots of gardens within a garden! The different areas are unique, all are beautifully by happy staff who obviously take pride in what they do.
Be aware that we have a good sense of directions & read maps easily - & we found the signs & maps quite confusing - with arrows sending you towards hedges & similar things. That said - who cares - just wander around the beautiful surroundings & relax away from the hectic city.
I recommend visiting during the week, & be warned that at least 2 of the restaurants on the map are closed, or not what you expect - & a whole area of green on the map is actually the University!
If you can, be there at dusk - the animals & cute little bats come out to the musical accompaniment of the bullfrogs, & the gardens take on a whole different smell & feel. They open until midnight so"
,,Very Peacfull,5.0,,"The Botanic Garden was a nice relaxing activity with great scenery. It’s free so you can spend as much or as little time as you want. The gift shop sells orchid plants in a small vile making it easy to take home, which make them great souvenirs for anyone who loves house plants/gardens. Our favorite part was the Bonsai garden and the Orchid garden. There is a fee to enter the Orchid Garden but it is worth it. We went midday and it was very hot, early morning or evening would probably be more enjoyable."
,,heavenly gardens,5.0,,"this recent visit to singapore and the botannical gardens was the 4th time my wife and I have been there and every time there is something different to see and admire. The gardens are stunning, new displays, new plants, it's just magic."
,,Fabulous walk through the gardens with so much to see!,5.0,,"What a fabulous gardens! Great place to stroll through. We used it to get from where we were staying to the train station. Huge array of many, many different flowers, trees, shrubs - even huge snails, that the children loved to see! We could have spent hours here. Such a big choice it was very difficult to decide what to look at! There is also a great restaurant at the entrance and also a very convenient stop for the city tour!"
,,Fun Cheap To Do in SG,5.0,,"this place is very well maintained. It's a good place for a walk, a picnic, or just reading books. and it's FREE!!"
,,Ideal to get away from the hustle nd bustle of the city,5.0,,Nice peaceful place. Ideal to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a couple of hours.
,,Worth the time.,5.0,,Thisis botanical history. Beautifully maintained and extremely interesting - and I am not usually a garden sort of person.
,,Great place for a break from the city.,4.0,,It was so nice to take a walk in the park and see a lot of different flowers and trees. And we saw a big lizard :-).
,,A Good peaceful day out,5.0,,"A haven, close to the city. Fascinating variety of flora and fauna. Easy to get to via the hop on, hop off."
,,An oasis of peace and greenery within bustling Singapore!,5.0,,"With the Singapore Botanic Gardens recently accorded UNESCO Heritage Site status, we decided to visit the Gardens on a recent public holiday.

Even as a born and bred Singaporean, I have to say I enjoyed the visit. The gardens were well maintained without coming across as overly maintained, if you know what I mean. The grounds are immense and with a bunch of young kids in tow, we only managed to cover the section within the vicinity of Swan Lake. Thereafter, we had a picnic of sorts in the open grass field while the kids ran around and played in the field. It made for a lovely and leisurely 3-4 hours in the Gardens.

Visitor Information provided a detailed map of the botanic gardens and there's lots more to see and do within the sprawling premises. Make time for a visit, you won't be disappointed!"
,,Refreshing,5.0,,The place was so green that you actually felt oxygen recharging you! Very artistic and environment friendly. One of the most beautiful souvenir shops ever visited but very expensive.
,,More than just a garden!,5.0,,"This was my second time visiting SBG. While I am not particularly a big fan of herbs and flora, the grassy environment and green atmosphere are very conductive to chilling and relaxing. Picnic with friends/family is fantastic.

There are two things in SBG that makes itself extraordinary from any botanic garden. First, there will be concerts (though it is not regular, gotta check the schedule in advance). It is great to sit at the slope and listen to bands playing music at the stage by the lakeside. Second, go try out some of the food and beverage that is made of ingredients harvested from the botanic garden itself!!! I tried a ginger beverage and it is so awesome. It is very amazing to see how the Singapore authority can transform a garden into something that sustainable and entertaining!"
,,A stunning park,5.0,,"Being cooped up in an office all day, it's a treat to escape to the botanical gardens in the morning for a run. You can get some serious mileage in while taking in the breathtaking array of foliage.

You can definitely get lost in this huge park what with the winding paths and trees it's hard to realise exactly where you are.

The park is even a place where one can go and just sit and relax.

I will always choose a hotel near to the park when I'm travelling just so I can get out and about in the morning for a lovely scenic run."
,,ITS FREE,5.0,,"My fiancée and I loved the gardens and it was a lovely to absorb many hours of the day and it's free.

We would recommend to anyone who is going to Singapore to visit the gardens.

A top catch the MTR you walk out of the station and the gardens entry is right by the exit.

Wayne / Julie"
,,A must,5.0,,"Such a beautiful park and gardens to see and enjoy the Orchards and flowers , walk around the well placed paths and to admire the gardens in its tranquil setting with so many things to see, beautiful variety of Orchards and unusual flowers to admire,"
,,Awesome Botanic Garden,5.0,,"This is a fabulous botanic garden; I would say the finest in the world. It is always nice to visit this garden. And, you must watch this one if nature interests you."
,,Good place to chill out.,4.0,,"We took the Hop on Hop off bus to get here from the city, which was worth the ride. The gardens are full of various trees and native plants. The pond is interesting, as was the Rain forest. We even saw a couple of Monitor Lizards, basking in the sunshine."
,,ITS FREE,5.0,,"My fiancée and I loved the gardens and it was a lovely to absorb many hours of the day and it's free.

,,Excellent (free!) Garden - now a World Heritage Site!,5.0,,"I live within a few blocks of this place and actually took my first stroll through it trying to get home from a lunch date in Dempsey Hill. It's gorgeous! And it's free! We were members of the Chicago Botanical Gardens, and this is right up there on that level. It's not as big as CBG, so it doesn't have as many differently themed areas, but it's still plenty big and unlike its more temperate sibling, it's FREE! I couldn't believe that! The paths are broad, gently graded and mostly shady and there are so many lovely things to look at.

There are like 3-4 different places you can enter the Gardens, and an MRT stop at one corner (which is soon to be a hub for the yellow Circle line and blue Downtown lines). The blue line stations are scheduled to open before the end of CY 2015, which will make connecting with the CBD a breeze... UNESCO recently voted the Gardens a World Heritage Site - so that's another approving nod. What's not to love?

I wouldn't call it 'stroller-friendly' but there aren't that many stairs and there is usually an alternative route for those places that are a challenge. There is a nice gift shop and 1 or 2 restaurants. The nicest restaurant - Blue Bali - is only open for dinner :( So I haven't tried it yet. You can also exit the Gardens at the MRT gate to find other refreshment options a few steps away at Cluny Court. My one piece of advice is to bring plenty of water. There are places to buy more, but make sure to at least start out with some."
,,Best garden in the world,5.0,,"The botanic gardens are just fantastic. The best in the world, so much colour and variety .i would love to go bavk again"

They are so cute and lovely.
,,One of the best Botanic Gardens in the world,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens with the family is one of the best botanic gardens in the world. The location is easily accessible by metro, and the garden itself is nothing short of amazing. Beautifully maintained landscapes and flowers from different parts of the world.

,,Singapore's UNESCO World Heritage - Botanic Garden,4.0,,"It's a very huge garden and I often take walk there. One can never remember all the names of the trees & plants & flowers there. I see both locals & tourists there enjoying their walk or run. There are times people have their picnic there too. If you are not from this part of the region, then you can almost see all kinds of tropical plants at just ONE stop! Bring a hat & a bottle of water with you when you visit the garden... it can be rather humid... (but cooler in the evening) There are Ginger Garden, Orchid Garden too... don't miss these! There is also a restaurant cafe near the entrance of the garden with FREE WiFI.."
,,"Beautiful, relaxing-great for a walk.",5.0,,"The gardens are beautiful, almost impeccably clean and well maintained. Its a pleasure to walk around. The Orchid garden is certainly worth a visit. Its a photographers delight.."
,,A nice calm walk in nature,4.0,,"The botanical gardens are free of charge and are located just next to one of the MRT stations. The gardens are huuuuge. You can easily loose 2-3 hours by just walking and taking it all in.

Every now and then there is a bench or a place to sit down, enjoy nature and relax.
The plants are divided into sections and the informational leaflet will guide you trough what you are seeing."
,,perfect place for the green thumb,5.0,,"it's a nice park and sometimes there are performances done in the garden so it's a good place to sit down, relax, listen and watch these performances.
There is also a flower garden which you have to pay for but I would say worth it because it's reminder of how beautiful nature is"

,,A sure thing.,5.0,,"Went there for a walk over the weekend and there was a concert on the lawn with lots of people sitting there with their picnic. It was really fun to be there.

Breakfast, tea, fine dining also available at any time of the day. Great for exercise, therapeutic moments or with family & friends for picnic!"
,,beautiful place to get away from it all,4.0,,These gardens are great. Its hard to believe that you are in the city when inside as its so quite and peaceful.
,,Greenery,3.0,,"If you have like half a day to spare, no harm coming over here for a walk. Listed under Unesco heritage not long ago, quite an achievement for a small island like Singapore."
,,"Great place for a stroll , picnic and an afternoon of fun",5.0,,"Great place to visit. The gardens are huge and have various themes as you walk around. By far the best part to visit if you have children is Jacob ballas garden, with water play, sand area, water fall, a tree house and much more to explore, you could easily spend the afternoon here."
,,A very very large garden!,4.0,,"Yesterday I went here and found out how huge the garden is! I walked for an hour and more, still cannot see all of the entire garden. I enjoyed seeing the Bonsai, cactus, and Ginger garden (though I didn't recognize the gingers).

There was a small wedding ceremony in the middle of the garden. Under the white gazebo, it looks simple yet beautiful.

Some area needs to buy ticket, so I just went through the free area which was quite huge too! There was swan lake with only two swans. Then also there were swings. But too bad, some irresponsible people hurt the cactus by sculpturing their names on it."
,,Nice gardens,3.0,,"If you have spare time then go for a walk through these gardens,but choose a day that isn't hot - take water with you"

,,Must visit Gardens when in Singapore,5.0,,"A little red dot in South Easr Asia, but this is one of the great gardens of the world.Great floras, especially the Orchids.
After a busy afternoon shopping in Orchard road, a short walk to the Garden to enjoy a cool evening here.
If you are an early bird, a walk or jog in the morning, before heading to Tiong Bahru market for breakfast"
,,Beautiful and Peaceful,5.0,,We spent a wonderful afternoon visiting the Gardens. It is clean and well maintained and we saw some beautiful flora (and a few birds!). It was hot when we went but there were some areas that offered some respite from the trees. A highlight was the orchid garden where varieties were named after dignitaries.
,,Lovely garden but plain and too hot,2.0,,"Botanic Gardens are a large area of lovely greens. The area needs a few hours to go through. Gardens are full of small roads you can walk on. But the distances are long and the air is so humid and hot (at least for a person coming from northern Europe)...
Easy enough to visit with a stroller.
Be sure to bring a cold bottle of water with you and shades, preferably also an umbrella. You can find shade her and there by the threes but still you will sweat a lot if you want to see the whole gardens.
There are a few small ponds you can look at and some birds and even some statues to see but nothing special. Locals use this garden as a picnic place but to my taste (and my 1 year 2 months old kids taste) it was too much. In the restaurants also no air conditioning. But we saw a monkey (wuhuu said the kid!) and enjoyed a nice snack. Restrooms were ok.
For me the highlight was the orchid gardens. Wonderful and I highly recommend it. Amazingly beautiful flowers in so many colours. Interestingly there were many orchids named after celebrities."
,,Perfect Place to rest,5.0,,Most beautiful and enormously huge botanic garden. You can see plants from all over the world but it takes over four hours to see it all. Take time and enjoy.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Awesome place and nice environment and able to learnt lots of knowledge . Great place to relax and calm your mind
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This park is on the yellow route of hippo and duck hop off/on tours. Well worth a visit. Free to get in main park and small charge for orchid garden.
,,Great free attraction,4.0,,"We love gardens and we really enjoyed our garden tour. Cheap $2 tour through the garden in a little buggy car. Pretty low key but real fun. Open air buggy no doors.

Take a jacket incase it is cool as it does rain randomly. Good walking shoes as the buggy is battery operated and we were in one that broke down had to walk a bit to next buggy.

Would definitely do again"
,,"Beautiful, calm escape from the city",5.0,,"the botanic gardens are big and beautiful. The orchid exhibition, with orchids named after visiting foreign dignatoried, is definitely a highlight. A nice way to spend a relaxed afternoon!"
,,"Stunning, and worth a visit",5.0,,"What a wonderful place to visit, we got the bus from the orchard road area, bus 121 which took around 5 minutes, we walked all the way around the gardens and exited by the MRT.
We spent the whole day there and took advantage of the eateries and the shaded parts. The gardens are delightful and you do forget that you are in the middle of a city.
It is free to enter and there are maps located all over the park.
The gardens are well maintained, but do take some extra insect repellent with you, there are many different types of gardens and a lovely to go around."
,,"Nice gardens, peaceful",4.0,,Visited many times. Great for a walk and a nice cream on a Sunday afternoon. Okay to walk dogs on a lead and good for jogging
,,Oasis of calm,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens, just at the northern edge of the shopping area of Orchard Road, is an oasis of calm and tranquility in the busy city life of Singapore. Grounds you can spend hours walking around and feel you could be a whole world away from the urban bustle. Lots of different landscapes add to the interest including an evolution trail and a area of tropical rain forest. Devote at least half a day and take refreshments as food stops are sparse (or stock up from the machines at the entrance). Entrance is free but so impressive I would have paid to get in."
,,Not so great,2.0,,"While the gardens are huge and well maintained, I personally found them really boring. If you are someone who enjoys looking at plants this might be good for you. Paying to see the Orchid Garden was a complete waste"
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,Great for picnic with friends.Walk around the garden and take photo around the flowers and trees.The National orchid garden section is beautiful and the other gardens interesting. No wonder the Botanic gardens are a Unesco Heritage site.Its really peaceful and can enjoy music performance in weekends.
,,Choose cool time of the day for visit,3.0,,Overall the gardens are lovely but there is a lot of ground to cover here...MRT is only at one end of the gardens so either it is a very long walk to do the circuit back to the MRT or work out which bus is for you at the opposite end of the gardens. The orchid garden is in the middle of the gardens from the MRT. Even with the garden map and signs it is still difficult in some parts to work out directions as they point in a too general a direction or the hand map is a little 'comical' rather than precise.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The botanic garden is a nice place to relax. Well, you can see small lake and walking path, in fact there is birds and swan. Believe me , it's a huge garden. A great place to relax after doing much shopping. There are a few cafes at the garden itself. Spend at least 2-3 hours at the garden."
,,One of the most beautiful in Asia.,5.0,,"A nice surprise in the middle of the the town. Beautiful, Well maintained and full of space for all ages and proposals."

,,Jungle in the heart of Action,5.0,,"Lovely walk through the gardens. They have an amazing collection of plants and like everything Singaporean, even the plants are a bit too well manicured. But easy to spend half a day plus. Its a UN Heritage park too. Good curation and collection"
,,Great Place To Relax,5.0,,"I went there to relax and have a feel of the fresh air after being cooped up in my house for a long while. It was enjoyable, the toilets were clean, the fields were very good to run in considering the fact that it is out in the open and that the ground is soft and comfortable. It is a must go for me and you should go too."
,,"""A haven garden""",5.0,,"A very relaxing place for people who are stressed, but be sure to go here with friends. A great place for bonding moments and can also aa place for stress relieving activities, jogging and more! :)"
,,Stunning orchids,5.0,,Its free to wander round the park but the $5 entrance fee to see the special orchid garden was well worth it !! There is a little cafe that sells sandwiches so one doesn't have to pay the big bucks at the restaurants.
,,Respite from city heat,5.0,,"Glorious respite in the middle of the city -- lots of paths to walk, plants, trees, flora and fauna to see. If you're lucky, you'll see monitor lizards sunning themselves near the swan pond, you'll see black and white swans, turtles, birds, and bugs. The Botanic Gardens is free except for the Orchid Gardens ($5) which are well worth the fee. Earlier this year the Botanic Gardens was recognized as a UNESCO site. Much deserved recognition."
,,Morning walk place,5.0,,"Nice and well maintained garden. Reach there through MRT for a refreshing morning walk. I would not prefer afternoons, as it is hot and humid. the park is also open in the night, i didn't try that."
,,Lovely day out,5.0,,"Really classy. We came here, primarily to visit the orchid gardens, but actually really enjoyed visiting the rest of the gardens. Highlight was definitely the bonsai garden. It was stunning. Some of the trees are magnificent too. We also visited the rainforest. I recommend putting on mosquito repellent as we got bitten quite a bit on the legs. C'est la vie!

Make sure you visit the wonderful orchid garden. Worth the small money, definitely."
,,family friendly palce,5.0,,"good for photo taking, nice walk and massive plant collection and flowers. family friendly and for couples too."
,,"Enchanted, magical place",5.0,,"Such a beautiful, enchanting place to visit. The gardens are magical, and if you like orchids, the special orchid display is out of this world!!!

,,My personal Number ONE in Singapore!,4.0,,"One evening not knowing what to do and still exhausted from the flight, we decided to have a look at the botanical gardens.
So we tooked the tram, get out and were in middle of the gardens. First pro for this sight. You don't have to take long ways. Just take the tram, get off and you are there.

Unfortunately we were a bit late. Had just around 40 minutes after it was totally dark.
But even at night time we enjoyed this peaceful place.

What a paradise in middle of busy Singapore!
And such a fresh air to breath within all the smog outside this area.

Unfortunately the Orchid House already was closed.
Seemed very interesting and nice to see.

Take some hours, come here, and relax at the greens.
Or do some yoga or a lunch.
Just walk through and see all the different trees and planst from all over the world.

A wonderful place for everyone and everything to do."

,,Gardens in the Garden,5.0,,"I really enjoy the gardens and the beauty that it has to offer considering the green scenery and the relaxing environment. Singapore Botanic Gardens is a must-see attraction when visiting Singapore. There are a lot of gardens located inside this attraction. I can remember the Ginger Garden and the Orchid Garden among these. Entering in the Singapore Botanic Gardens cost no fee. However, if you opt to enter in specific garden, it will cost you not much. The fee we paid in entering Orchid Garden is just SG5 per head. Be ready however for roaming around Botanic Gardens and do not wear heels as it will take you more than one kilometer walk to see the garden. Furthermore, what I admired also is the discipline of the locals and the government of Singapore because they were able to maintain the cleanliness, freshness and the beautiful ambiance of the place considering its location."
,,A partial visist,3.0,,I only wondered round for a little bit having mere British skin I found it a bit hot and the heat at midday was unbearable without shade. Having said that the bits I did see were very well maintained and looked after.

,,Allow plenty of time for your visit,5.0,,The Botanical Gardens are a highlight of any visit to Singapore and should not be missed. They are huge and have many different areas of interest. The Botanical Gardens does not charge an entrance fee but there is a nominal fee to enter the orchid garden and it is well worth paying! There are nice places to eat and drink or you could take your own picnic. There is a big lake with lots of monitor lizards sunning themselves on the banks. There is a fossil garden which is very interesting. There are lots of helpful descriptive signs within the gardens and lots of different areas of interest. You could easily spend a full day in the park.
,,Lush and well-maintained botanical gardens,5.0,,"Tired of shopping and high rises?? Refresh your senses with an enjoyable stroll through the botanical gardens. It's a relatively cheap taxi ride from the major hotels and shopping district, and so worth it to escape the city bustle. The main gardens are free, but there is a small admission for the Orchid Garden ($5 or $1 for seniors). Do not miss the orchids .....truly impressive, even when it is not peak flowering season. (In fact, probably best to avoid the tourist hordes at peak season.)"
,,A magnificent day out,5.0,,Recently visited the Singapore Botanic Gardens and was treated to a splendid day outdoors. The orchids that are currently on display are superb! The tranquil walk through the gardens is refreshing to your soul. Truly worth a visit.
,,nature,4.0,,"wonderful place for nature lover, i just recommend them to add toilets and washrooms. in general the place is good for jogging and relaxing"
,,Beautiful large garden,4.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed my quiet stroll around this free garden. There was plenty to see, from bamboo to the healing garden that contained information on the potential herbal remedies I found it a stimulating and educational experience. I particularly liked the jungle section in the middle, very unexpected."
,,Always something new to see,5.0,,A lovely park to wander in or find a cool place to sit in the shade of one of the magnificent trees. I never tire of visiting and seem to see something different every time I go with the changing flowers and different paths to explore. Especially like the Orchid garden and Swan lake.
,,Worth a visit but overall park can be improved!,3.0,,"Botanical gardens was ok but my gripe was the large no of mosquitos which I was bitten very badly all over my whole body and face, the far distance fr the mrt to the orchard garden and main entrance! I had to walk abt 45 mins under the hot sun to the national orchard garden! Botanical gardens shd seriously consider building shelters as it gets very hot especially in the afternoon! Oh ya and the souvenier shop there sells really overpriced and poor quality stuff!"
,,So much beautiful greenery!,5.0,,"Botanic gardens is huge and beautiful. It's a great place to go jogging, walking the dog, or simply reading a book on one of the sheltered benches. It's recently been awarded the status of an UNESCO heritage site, a well-deserved status for the Singapore Botanic Gardens."
,,a scenic journey,4.0,,parking was not always available as weekends are packed with people & toilets are quite far way if you are in a hurry but the garden is well maintained & beautifully manicured
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"I wish it had more flowers, but, Singapore having a tropical climate, there was a lot of lush green trees around. some flowers, you can also find a section with Bonsai trees and one with different types of cacti. It's a beautiful and very well maintained place."
,,Lovely place for a picnic,4.0,,"Came here with my colleagues for a picnic, so much greens and colors surrounding the area, we chose a spot near the car park and the train station. It is a pet friendly area so i suggest do bring your dogs/cats out for a walk.

Cold storage just opposite the train station, it is inside a white building so do stock up on tidbits and drinks before heading in."
,,Best places for picnic and enjoy the green atmosphere in Singapore,5.0,,"Great places to enjoy the beautiful garden and green atmosphere in the huge area. Very recommended place to go with family and set your picnic lunch. My favorite was the Orchids Garden which shows so many colorful and beautiful orchids, even some rare species is grown in this garden."
,,beautyful park,4.0,,"These garden are soooo big! Great for jogging, for bringing kids and to enjoy the park under the shadow of many giant trees."
,,Great Venue To Keep Fit and healthy!,4.0,,"In a busy and fast paced city like Singapore, full of buildings, shopping centres etc, it is a pleasure to enjoy the delights of the Botanical Garden where plants, flowers, lakes etc provide a haven for tranquility and calmness. I had the opportunity to do Yoga, walking and running in the Botanical Gardens. Great place for people to keep fit and be involved in healthy pursuits.
The convenience of the MRT station at the entrance of the Gardens provide is a plus and offer easy access for all users."
,,Beautiful Botanic Garden,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic garden is beautiful and with so many different elements. Perfect if you just wants to walk around and enjoy the many flowers, trees and different species."
,,Nice,4.0,,Nice place for a visit. There are some very unique things to view...worth a visit here if you are in Singapore.
,,Large garden,3.0,,Its so large area and you must prepare yourself. There is very long way and so many plant . And have museum too in there.dont forget to bring your drink and use comfortable shoes.
,,Love the nature,5.0,,"Since we have 1 day left on our holiday, hubby let me do the things i want to. The last place i want to see is Botanic garden and it's very close to the hotel where we stayed. Got surprise when we reach there. This place was beautiful though very tired of long walk but worth it."
,,huge!,5.0,,"Its huge and every corner worth seeing, esp the Orchid garden. the 2 lakes, the mydriad of different trees, the monitor lizards, the lilies in the pond with the huge leaves. We go to this place at least twice each month and never tire of it"
,,Nice botanic garden,3.0,,"First time there. It was a very big botanic garden. Nice environment for playing, walking around, jogging, and refreshing out from the hustle bustle.
Too bad, in this very big garden, the map is not very clear and we lost in the middle of the garden.
Overall it was a very nice experience."
,,Good walking tour,4.0,,"The gardens are nice, very nice in fact. The area is kept up very nicely and there is plenty if information so you can do a self guided tour of the garden. It is big so be prepared to walk but the paths are all nice and easy ti traverse."
,,Beautiful place at night,5.0,,"This place is great for jogging especially if you are just starting out although I find fort canning park is much more challenging. In terms of facilities, I really enjoyed the orchard gardens and evolution gardens although I find it a little cheap that you have to pay to get into the orchard gardens. The canopy trek is interesting to look at various tropical trees and vegetation especially if you are coming from Europe. Events can be crowded to the point where it becomes no longer enjoyable. The location is nice as it is located next to Orchard Road, a busy shopping district with plenty of places to eat. An interesting fact is you can actually visit the tree on the $5 dollar note here.

Generally I find this place a little touristy and places like Labrador nature reserve for the ocean, Bukit Timah nature reserve for the rainforest and East Coast Park offer the same thrill without the tourists. Also consider going to Gardens by the Bay at Marina Bay but keep in mind this will cost you about $20.

What I think is really underrated is exploring this area at night. I don't want to encourage anything but one of my fondest memories of this place was Christmas Eve at 1am when they turned off the lights and I could see the canopy reflect against the stars. One of the few times I could see so many stars in Singapore."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful garden with places to sit and eat as well. The orchid garden is for free when you are a student. Loved all the beautiful plants and flowers!
,,A momentary escape from the rest of the world.,5.0,,"I love Singapore and the Gardens are a delight. I remember when there monkeys here. Oh yes, I am positively ancient! In recent years I have returned quite frequently, given the distance from London, and I try to fit in some hours here to escape the hustle and bustle. Weekdays are usually excellent. Sunday is not such a good day. There are too many people about then.

My last visit I shared with a Singaporean who previously thought the gardens were boring. I reckon I managed to pass on the delights of the ginger zone and the Orchid Garden (free for the lucky blighter, being local) as well as one of my favourite sculptures.

Unlike Kew Gardens, one is not under a flight path, which enhances the calmness I get from the gardens."
,,Great place to visit and walk,5.0,,"Went with the Husband to the Singapore Botanical Gardens twice in the last month after the gardens was awarded the UNESCO World Heritage site. It is surprising, considering that we live in Singapore and we do not go there at all.

It is a very beautiful place and a photographers paradise. Shaded gardens, manicured lawns, beautiful flowers and lovingly protected old / heritage trees. We did the tourist thing and went around looking for the oldest orchid in Singapore, the Tiger Orchid, the Vanda Miss Joaquim (Singapore’s national flower) patch near the Bandstand, the famous Tembusu tree on the $5 note and a host of other heritage trees.

For peranakans who love ayam buah keluak, somewhere tucked away in the Gardens are a couple of “keluak” or kepayang trees. If you are lucky, you may see a couple of buah keluaks on the ground. This is the ONLY place I know in Singapore that has those trees.

As it was SG50 celebrations, entry into the National Orchid Garden was also free for Singaporeans and Residents. There is a fee for tourists and after the SG50 celebrations but its well worth the visit. There was also a bazaar and an orchid exhibition. This is a good place to go if you are a tourist and you stay around the Orchard / Tanglin area and if you like to run / jog. For those of us who like museums, there are 2 small museums inside the gardens that are permanently free for those of you who’d like to learn the history of the gardens and see the drawings of the plants."
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,"Fantastic gardens, loved the Swan Lake! Great variety of plants to admire, also a nice opportunity to savour Crabbies Ginger Beer at the Halia resto."
,,Green lungs of Singapore -To be savoured leisurely!!,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens which houses the National Orchid Garden has been rated as a top 5 attraction/things to do on TA. And rightfully so. It is my second favourite garden so far after Royal Botanic Garden - Peradeniya of Kandy in Sri Lanka.

Connectivity: I stayed at Robertson Quay and found the connectivity fairly simple to the Garden. I took off solo one morning on a direct MRT bus (I went at 11 am..wish I could have gone early..it opens at 5 AM). Refer how to reach the gardens -[https://www.sbg.org.sg/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=17&Itemid=13] I went through Tanglin Core gate.

Duration: One can easily spend 2-3 hours or more since the garden is vast and very well maintained. As you enter through tanglin core - in about 300m you will find the Swan lake. Its a beautiful lake with a swan structure in the middle of the lake (sadly those were the only swans i could see that day but there are swans, i have seen in other traveller pics). Lots of colourful goldfish and catfish in the lake. You can feed them too ; a hit with small kids. There are many flowering trees along the lake side with squirrels jumping here and there. Lawns are huge and very well maintained. There are some bronze structures depicting some interesting people, playful kids etc. There are some centuries old trees from various parts of the world. Grab a comfortable pair of sneakers to explore this place and feel one with nature.

Admission Fees: Zero

Highlights: Spotted two clouded monitor lizards playing hide and seek near the Gazebo. Made my day!

Recommendation: Go for a relaxed stroll and you'll definitely come back with a smile.
Tip: Go early morning to avoid harsh sun during noon. I was lucky since it was cloudy day.."
,,Not a Flower Love but this place is Great!!,5.0,,"I'm not a plant and flower lover but this was really exceptional! It's highlighted in all the guides as a MUST SEE and now I know why. You MUST go here as a couple, families, even solo with a camera!"
,,Avatar,5.0,,It was like i was transported to Avatar! It was awesome and grand! easily took 500 photos in one go!
,,Peaceful & Beautiful,5.0,,"Had a lovely stroll through the Botanic Gardens, it just seems to be removed and peaceful from the the hustle of the city center. Very tranquil and a nice place to have a break for lunch or coffee etc."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Singapore is hot hot hot and humid. We had a lovely day at the Gardens. Beautiful Orchids and they take a lot of pride in their beautiful gardens
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,Beautiful. Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes. Lots to see. Lake is picturesque ... Even saw a few turtles.
,,Love the Nature,5.0,,Its the place where everyone can relax.Great for picnic with friends.Walk around the garden and take photo around the flowers and trees.Its really peaceful and can enjoy music performance in weekends.
,,"A must see, even just for the orchids",5.0,,my wife and I have visited Singapore many times but never visited the Botanic Gardens. It is amazing especially considering how close it is to the Orchard road area.The National orchid garden section is beautiful and the other gardens interesting. No wonder the Botanic gardens are a Unesco Heritage site
,,Go into the Rainforest area. Also dont forget to look around you for some hidden treasures.,5.0,,Again fabulous gardens do both ends it is well worth it. Total length I believe is 1.2 km. Nice gift shop reasonable prices. Would definitely give myself plenty of time do not rush.
,,Beautiful Singapore Gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens. Spent almost the whole day walking around, but then I do love gardens anyway! Quite warm walking around. Make sure you visit the Prisoner of war brick steps. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore the prisoners made bricks and imprinted arrows on them to show they were detained by the authorities. The Orchard garden was just stunning"
,,A shelter from Singapore's scorching sun,4.0,,"We didn't explore much here, but the gardens provide a really good shelter from the Singapore's scorching sun."
,,Big garden and for a good walk and picnic,3.0,,"The garden is really huge, perfect for a good walk and have a picnic here! I would say there is not much particular worth to see, but it is really nice to be surrounded by A LOT OF green."
,,A must see attraction- beautifully maintained.,4.0,,Beautiful but a little busy on the weekend- understandably! Very well kept and plenty to see and do. Enjoyed the experience and is in stark contrast to the hussle and bustle of the centre of town.
,,One of the highlights of my visit.,5.0,,Spent a few hours and well worth the effort. The orchid garden was spectacular. ....but the whole garden is wonderful with something for everyone.
,,A beautiful day out,5.0,,"This is a beautiful day out in Singapore if your tired of shopping and seeing the other sites. A wonderful place to come and relax, reflect and take in the beauty of tropical foliage and parkland."
,,Beautiful Botanical Gardens,5.0,,One of the hidden gems in the hustle and bustle of Singapore. So beautiful and peaceful. It is truly a nature lovers delight to visit Botanical Gardens. There are special plants where you can smell their perfume too. Beautiful fountains add to the nature so perfectly. A photographers delight - this place is.
,,Best gardens ever,4.0,,A lovely way to spend a day in Singapore. Lots to see - even if you are not 'into' plants!! Must wear comfortable walking shoes. Very tranquil and lots to see
,,Stopped by for a quiet moment!,4.0,,"After a full day of shopping and up and down running from place to place, we could not have chosen a better place to rest and watch our toddler having fun at the kids gate entrance! Lovely hour, highly recommended"
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"I first visited these gardens 30 years ago and have been several times since and they have never failed to meet my expectations. Such a lovely place to stroll through and enjoy the plants, trees, and lakes. We got the MRT there, walked through to the Orchid Gardens and then through Tanglin Gate eventually reaching Orchard Road for some retail therapy."
,,great place to visit,5.0,,"this place is huuuge... once you enter the garden, its like entering a completely different world after seeing the hustle and bustle of the city roads.
We entered from Holland road, at first we wanted to visit the children playground at Botanic Garden, then we found out that that place is at the other end of the garden, since it was our last day here, we do not have that much time to walk to the other end and only ended up at a quarter way of the garden.

we can see a lot of tropical plants, enjoyed walking here"
,,"Beautiful, organised gardens; mobility access needs improving.",4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are beautiful and well categorised. Plants were well preserved and some carried good descriptions.

Most descriptions were mainly in English. Only a few carried Chinese and Hindi descriptions. One small sign carried Braille in the Healing Garden. I hope that one day the texts accompanying the plants could be improved to incorporate multi-languages, to benefit non English speakers.

Passing of Knowledge sculpture: I particularly liked the Passing of Knowledge sculpture, by Victor Tan Wee Tar, presented by the Singapore Rotarians. The sculpture showed the rotarians' spirit of passing on knowledge to the next generations.

Camphor Tree: I also learnt about the descendent of a Camphor tree, which survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945.

It is wonderful to be able to link history and culture with the connections of plants.

Signs: The Gardens seemed to carry far too many warning / negative signs. Through the warnings, I felt that the gardens discouraged people with physical disabilities (such as those wheelchair-bound). I feel that the gardens should be more inclusive, to make it more accessible for people with different needs. For example, mobility scooters could be employed to enable those who are physically challenged. The gardens should be enjoyed by more people."
,,What a BEAUTIFUL garden!!!,5.0,,"We enjoyed walking all over this lovely attraction, with a truly well- kept garden with ts really helpful signs directing tourists
Worthy of mention is the very special presentation of ORCHIDS and BROMELIADS
Very impressive indeed...
Some suggestion is perhaps have tea kiosks located at more strategic corners that weary visitors can stop to replenish their energy in the heat of tropical weather
We were surprised to find that nice FOODWORKS was located in the basement of one corner of the Garden! Conversely the Toilets were at the top of this secluded building. We hope in our coming visit in the near future, the above suggestion can be taken into account, thank you!"
,,Cool down,5.0,,"Must visit, tranquil area in a busy landscape, beautifully planned, good facilities. Advise travellers to use hop on hop off bus. Got two days for $40 each."
,,A British Park in Singapore,4.0,,"It was like being back in London with the sprawling parks, this one is huge built in the later 19th century when the British ran Singapore, very together and so peaceful"
,,Amazing ...,5.0,,"My husband and I visited the gardens in August the weekend of Singapore's 50th Anniversary. It rained for a bit at the beginning of the day, but that's normal for Singapore. So always take an umbrella wherever you go. The gardens are gorgeous. Always free entry, and the weekend we visited, the orchid display was free as well. It's just a fun and beautiful place to stroll and enjoy as much or as little as you like. Wear your walking shoes and take a bottle of water. You will need it. Also there is a lovely gift shop, with a large selection and relatively good prices. I would say it's probably one of the best things to see and do in Singapore!"
,,just lovely and completely free of charge!,5.0,,"You can easily access the gardens by means of the city tourist bus, which stops by the entrance. we called in just for a couple of hours and it is an oasis of peace and nature within a busy city. just lovely"
,,Get in touch with nature- for sure!!,5.0,,"Such a well maintained and peaceful and beautiful place located near to downtown.

I wouldn't say I am a big garden guy but even I was really impressed at the easy to follow signs, the helpful staff, and the pristine surroundings and intriguing options available of things to see and do."
,,Best botanical gardens we have ever seen!,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens simply blew our minds! Best botanical gardens we have ever seen! A must visit for any lovers of nature, flora & fauna!"
,,Heritage tour average but could easily be made better.,3.0,,"Participated in the Heritage tour held once a month on a Saturday morning. We were looking forward to this but it was tainted by the tour guide who was quite intense about how great Singapore was. We accept that this is the 50th year and that great things have been achieved but we really wanted to hear more about the heritage and not have each heritage comment then punctuated by yet another comment about the many other achievements of Singapore.

This is a very interesting tour but I am many others I suspect just started to switch off. Stick to the heritage characteristics please."
,,Very clinical and uninspiring,1.0,,"We managed to cover about 40% of the gardens (nearest the MRT station) before we couldn't cope any more. They are totally uninspired and lacking character.

We found them boring, lacking colour and very sterile. Yes, they were manicured to perfection, but I don't need to see large lawned areas with uninspired plantings and characterless gazebos.

The Evolution Garden is a classic example of concrete trees. Really? Concrete trees? Concrete rocks, I think, too. How very sad.

I usually like taking photos of lakes in botanic gardens as they usually offer wonderful reflections. The lake we saw here was also disappointing, and not worth even one photo.

How did it get UNESCO World Heritage status? I believe Singapore submits its ""Tentative List"". Frankly these gardens may be the best Singapore has to offer, but they really need someone who is inspired to totally revamp them.

We did not get to the (paid entrance) orchid gardens, but they are the subject of another listing here on Trip Advisor, so not relevant to this Singapore Botanic Gardens listing."
,,Wonderful gardens,5.0,,"Singapore botanic gardens are an amazing experience and a bargain as free entry to the main garden area. Just pay extra for the orchid display. Lots to see, so allow several hours. There were cafes for drinks and meals, and everywhere was clean and tidy. Easy to find your way around."
,,A peaceful place for a walk or to enjoy the plants and other wildlife,5.0,,"Lovely gardens with plenty of places to walk, great variety of plants and a peaceful haven near the city centre. I was keen to see what wildlife was on offer but had to visit on a Sunday when it was quite busy and so wildlife watching was not quite as good as it might have been had there been less people. Nonetheless there were plenty of birds including kingfishers and some interesting reptiles including clouded monitor lizards. I missed the opportunity to see a rare owl (Buffy's Fish Owl). If you fo - look for photographers with large lenses on their cameras and ask what they are looking at - you might be surprised to see something unusual.

A really good place to visit."
,,Very peaceful,5.0,,Excellent gardens and the orchid garden was amazing. Need at least half a day probably if you are going to cover the whole of the gardens or if you have less time it is well sign posted and you can see your priority areas.
,,Nice free garden,5.0,,This is a very nice place with lots of plant varieties. It is quite big so wear comfortable clothing and shoes as it will get very hot and humid
,,"Beautiful garden, a must do for tourists, great for regulars",5.0,,"Whether you are a one time visitor to Singapore or a local, the Botanic Gardens is a must do. Just lovely. Expansive garden with many theme gardens inside - orchid garden, ginger garden, healing garden, evolution garden, children's garden, rainforest walk, etc

Come early in the morning to see the locals exercising, doing yoga or Thai chi on the dew soaked grass near the lakes, or on a Sunday to soak up the atmosphere of all of Singapore's diversity walking the dog, having family picnics or old couples wandering through.

Check out the website and catch one of the free open air concerts where people lay out the blanket and relax as the music drifts over the grassy hillside at dusk.

Lovely cafes and restaurants dotted around - Halia near the ginger garden, and casa Verde near the visitor centre are our favourites but note that Casa Verde is closed at the moment for renovation, open again later in the year.

Love it dearly, one of the best things about Singapore."
,,Nice garden with mosquitoes,4.0,,"It is a nice garden and the most remarkable memories were the bites of mosquitoes we got! Otherwise, the orchids were nice and the whole garden was fantastic.
We used mosquito repellents but that did not work out in here. (In other South East Asian countries we never got bitten.)"
,,Great Place to visit if you don't have much time in Singapore,4.0,,We had planned a quick stopover in Singapore and enjoyed strolling through the gardens before the flight to Taiwan. The Gardens were just down the road from our Hotel. Worth a visit if you have the time.
,,Plant Paradise,5.0,,"This is one of my highly recommended places for my overseas friends to visit when they are in Singapore. It is a quiet oasis with lovely large shady old trees where one can sit and contemplate life. It has everything, open spaces, ancient trees, stunning flowers, cute tortoises, white swans, hungry fish etc. For those who love orchids, a must is the Orchid Garden. Orchids of every colour and shape, plus those which honor our special guests and important people. Also, try to catch the monthly weekend concerts. But make sure you go early to get a good seat"
,,Just amazing,4.0,,"I love visiting the Singapore Botanic gardens. It offers a tranquil area in the bustle of Singapore. It is neatly kept (what else to expect in Singapore) and offers stunning views.

But the real pearl is the Orchid garden (for entrance one must pay a small fee. Admittance to the Botanic Garden itself is free). The Orchid garden offers a very broad range of orchids, with colours which are amazing.

The Gardens are somewhat outside the center of Singapore, but can be reached by metro or by foot (for the courageous among us - it is ca 30 min walk from Orchard Road)"
,,Probably not worth a long journey,3.0,,We travelled 45 minutes on the MRT to visit here and to be honest it wasn't really worth it. Although it was nice with different areas to visit etc it was like being in Roundhay Park in Leeds! Gardens by the Bay a much better choice.
,,"Sooooo hot, but lovely!",4.0,,"It's fair to say you need plenty of water for walking around here! That being so, it was still an enjoyable walk, seeing nature and animals. I would suggest according this in the peak heat, and allowing a few hours at least here."
,,"Calm, peace and quiet.",5.0,,"A photographer's paradise. Whether you love flora, kids playing around with their footballs, ducks and birds, joggers, insects, butterflies.. this place has it all. The butterfly garden and the healing garden are must-see places. I walked through this garden everyday for 4 months during my time at the Law Campus at NUS."
,,A leisurely day in a busy city...,5.0,,"Whilst visiting Singapore for the first time, and using the hop-on bus service, we got off at the Botanical Gardens just to have a quick look. What a pleasant surprise! Beautifully maintained gardens, clean, spacious walk-ways, an intriguing orchid collection all made us spend 4 hours at this delightful site. We ended up having high-tea and an overall extremely peaceful and pleasant visit. A must-see for all nature lovers."
,,A lovely place to relax away from the crowds.,4.0,,I had a lovely time walking around the gardens. The variety of plants is amazing and it is nice to get away from the crowds in Singapore and this is somewhere that you can be alone. The orchid garden is worth the cover charge.
,,A park full of nature and people,4.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is a park where the highlight here for me is the orchids. There are so much and it's beautiful!
But it is very big so you might not get to see the whole place if you go during the afternoon. You have to walk a lot."
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"The gardens are very beautiful and well maintained. The variety of trees and flowers is impressive and you can even see black swans and turtles on one of the lakes and ..it's free!
It is also a nice place to observe the locals. It seems to be that these gardens are a favorite jogging and picnic area.
If you're planning to visit the orchid gardens inside (there is a fee for the orchid gardens for the non residents) , take into account that these gardens are huge. From the SMRT station to the Orchid Garden it took us more than 25 minute of brisk walking."
,,Beautiful Botanical Garden,5.0,,It is very interesting botanical garden. You can see a lot of flowers and trees that are not common. Highly recommended
,,Nice Garden,5.0,,"The Botinacial garden is a very huge park filled with varity of plants and flowers. Frequently there are many performances, Concert and shows that happen in the Garden. Another must see in Singapore!"
,,A great adventure and learning.,4.0,,It was indeed a great experience to see the wonderful collections of cacti and other trees as well as flowers. It was also a memorable one visiting this place with my loved ones.
,,An oasis in the city,5.0,,Beautiful park with lots of themed gardens/exhibitions and recreational areas in it. Not too crowded either and just very pretty. They seem to put great effort into it and most plants also had descriptions so for people who are interested in botanical it's very nice
,,Good botonical gareden,4.0,,"Huge sprawling garden well maintained with very large range of plants, When we went rains started the climate become very good,"
,,botanical gardens are magical,5.0,,Best botanical gardens I have ever seen best of all they are free.The orchid garden is not to be missed for only $5-. Get here early to beat the crowds
,,MUST visit place during singapore visit.,4.0,,"Easy to go there by MRT. Great place for garden lovers. Beautiful & lush green everywhere. Nice stopovers & can take halts in between. Details like maps , sign boards all over places so you can't miss. the best part I liked is Orchid garden. so so many orchids , varieties, color's , wow... A must visit place. Ginger garden is also you can see."
,,"Pace yourself, it's free",4.0,,"This is a must do for any visit to Singapore, accessible by MRT, bus or taxi, just go and enjoy. If your here for a few days pace yourself and visit over several times, if you try and do it all at once you may be able to see everything but will miss many things."
,,Gardens of eden in Singapore,4.0,,"lush greenery in the middle of a bustling metropolis! lots of local, asian flaura and fauna. the orchid garden is a must. very well kept and now a heritage sight!"
,,The Epitome of Tranquility,5.0,,"Take a trip from the hustle and bustle of Singapore City and visit the Botanic Gardens. The MRT station is right outside the main gate. There's no admission charge. The gardens are beautifully laid out. There are areas for children, water features, splash pad. A delightful cafe where we had a beautiful lunch, reasonably priced. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Best Orchid Garden,4.0,,"If you are an Orchid lover, this is the best place to visit. There is a big selection of orchid on display. The rest of the garden was okay, was disappointed to note there was no herb garden, only ginger plants. You can get there by train or bus, if you travelling from overseas please use your passport/drivers licence to get the seniors rate"
,,Lovely escape from the AC,4.0,,"A good excursion from the freezing AC, if you like walking & greenery. Lots of cafes & some interesting old buildings. The Gardens are quite nice though."
,,Incredible Orchids!,5.0,,Magnificent gardens! Beautiful flowers. Incredible orchids!Could have spent all day going round the grounds. Really worthwhile.
,,Orchard garden,4.0,,"The Orchard garden is well worth seeing, and the other parts of the garden are very good. We got there by the hop on bus."
,,Be close to nature,5.0,,A serene place to be in touch with the nature. Surrounding is lush of greeneries and at times will be able to catch live band performances. Great for all ages.
,,Stunning,5.0,,You feel like you are in a dream when you see the stunning array of greenery and colour. A great place to spend a few hours just walking around admiring it all.
,,nice,5.0,,"A very nice place for everyone who loves plants, trees and flowers. The park is big and therefore good for a nice stroll in addition. Dont miss the orchid garden!"

,,Haven of peace,5.0,,"It is hands down one of my favorite places in Singapore. A peaceful place in the middle of the city, with probably the oldest living things you can find in Singapore! It's worth taking a stroll and a break while you are visiting this city."
,,Stunning & free,5.0,,"The Botanic gardens are well worth visiting and they're free. If you want to go into the orchid garden (and you should) there is a small charge. We spent all day just wandering around....go to all the gardens, you are bound to learn something new."
,,Beautiful Gardens!,4.0,,"The gardens themselves are probably some of the most beautiful areas in Singapore and definitely worth a (free!) visit. If you're wanting to see natural scenery however, this is not the place for you."
,,A garden very different from those in the UK,4.0,,"It was hot and humid when we visited here (not unlike all the other days in Singapore). We caught the bus out and stocked up on drinks before venturing out.
I steered us to the healing garden which is laid out as body parts with each area stocked with plants to cure malfunctions in that part. I suggested the reproductive area but with three daughters it seemed problems with the head was a more appropriate place to visit.
We saw a huge lizard. Actually we saw two but an Asian guy took it upon himself to chase the second away. I guess he must have had a bad experience with them previously. Perhaps they are inedible.
We also went to the ginger garden which boasted several hundred varieties. I thought it would be interesting but actually didn't see anything I recognised as the ginger I chop for dinner."
,,A refreshing and enjoyable walk,4.0,,The garden is filled with various plants and they are well-labelled . There are like different type of gardens and each garden has different kind of plants . One problem is that the entrance can be quite far
,,NOT TO BE MISSED,5.0,,"We had a wonderful time at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. We always make sure we come every time we visit Singapore. Very well layout and designed. Make sure you wear shorts and light clothing's, drink plenty of water. The tropics humidity can get to you. A great day out for couples or families!"
,,Our favorite hangout in Singapore,5.0,,"Has never lost its charm and unlike ever changing Singapore, this place stays the same. We visited 3 times in two weeks and will keep going back."
,,"The Botanic Gardens Singapore, a must-see for all garden lovers",5.0,,"A superb experience, but that's how they do things in Singapore. An orchid house that is kept cool! (it's a bit warm over there) for mountain orchids, superb...saw a baobab tree, a kapok tree, a rubber tree, things I never ever thought to see...very neat, tidy, well laid out. Singapore does it very well..."

,,"A must see for everyone, not just the garden enthusiasts",5.0,,Spent an entire day here. The humidity was nearly killing me and my husband was convinced I would give up. But it was too lovely to stop. I had a hand fan and lots of water so I was able to enjoy it. There was a lot of walking so take that into consideration when making plans. The orchid garden was obviously a big draw but there was no much more than that. I wish I had looked up the restaurant locations and hours before we got there. Signage was generally very good.
,,Refreshing atmosphere,5.0,,Educational for the youngsters. Lots of floral and fauna. Clean fresh air even during the afternoon period.
,,Great place...,4.0,,"Great place to experiences and see the all those green... Could be hot to walk around in the afternoon so be careful, drink plenty of water and apply sunscreen..."
,,Garden lover or not - simply stunning,5.0,,"Visited today. Hot and sticky but very worthwhile. It is not possible to be anything other than inspired by the range of plants, flowers and trees. The orchid garden is spectacular and we particularly enjoyed the evolution garden (highly educational and original). The park is incredibly well kept and surprisingly uncrowded. It is difficult to imagine visiting Singapore without seeing this jewel."
,,Free admission,5.0,,"In this cosmopolitan city, free attractions are free. Pure bonus that its now a heritage site with plenty of history and education on tropical flora. My nephews love the little playground and fish pond. The sculpture are beautifully crafted. & the swan-lake is not to be missed. Have fun"
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"Excellent garden - more natural and gentle than Garden By Bay. Has lots to see. If you like Kew in London, this would be for you: and it's mostly free!"
,,garden in the garden city,4.0,,singapore is world renowed as garden city. there is no serprised that the garden is one of a must tourist attraction in singapore. hopefully i will be there again.
,,Where There Is Perfect Green,5.0,,"I have been here several times, and one of my favourites as its nicely laid out with so many flora and fauna found here. Great for those working in Singapore to have weekly walk around...meet friends....stroll or just jog....."
,,Must do botanic gardens,5.0,,Very interesting and definitely worthwhile. Good exercise but wear comfortable clothing. Very hot and humid. Do early or later in day
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,Lovely and cool on a very hot day. Food at the restaurant - a good variety and served by pleasant staff
,,Beautiful escape from my work day in Singapore,5.0,,I had a few hours between appointments and caught the hop on hop off bus to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. So glad I did as this is a beautiful park and worth the UNESCO designation. A little extra charge for the orchid garden was worth the price. It was a hot day but I enjoyed walking in such a beautiful park. I felt safe and it was easy to access.
,,Nice for nature walk,4.0,,"Good to spend 2-3 hours for nature walk. The garden, the roads or the walking paths were well maintained and clean (not like a nature park). It is worth to visit the Orchid Garden (SG$5 - just treat it as the entrance fee for the whole gardens). Remember look for the Tembusu tree which is printed on the SG$5 bill. Also look for a very tall tree (forget the name) which is only one tree truck without branches and the leaves grown only on the very top - only total 17 left in Singapore."
,,Well worth the short and inexpensive taxi ride. Ginger plants and Orchids are unbelievable,5.0,,"Great way to spend 2-4 hours (easy). This free venue hosts an incredible ginger (not what you think) and orchid garden. Check on line for Saturday tours ($5.00) for best option to see interesting plants, history and facts. Also keeps you from getting lost."
,,A Garden Lover's Paradise,5.0,,"I probably can't say anything beyond what everybody else has said about this place, and considering that there are over 7000 reviews here on Tripadvisor, I'm probably going to get completely lost amongst all of the other comments that people have made. In fact I note that it is the number four must see place in Singapore, and to be honest with you I am not at all surprised. If you love gardens then you will absolutely love this place. It is no wonder that I consider Singapore to the the city of gardens, which to me is absolutely mind boggling considering that it is one of the most densely populated city states in the world. Nor am I surprised that this place has made it onto the UN Heritage List, despite the fact that it is a very modern creation. These gardens are amazing, and all I can say is that you could spend more than a day just taking in the absolute beauty that this place has to offer."
,,Paradise on Earth,5.0,,"Wow this place is out of this World.We spent 4hrs here yesterday afternoon,me and my teenage Son.The Gardens are free apart from the Orchid Garden which is $5 an adult.Beautiful orchids in a beautiful setting. You just can't believe that there is such a beautiful place hidden away in a bustling city.We didn't cover half of it so I would love to go back.Their are lakes with terrapins and fish swimming away.We saw 2 Kingfishers swooping down and plucking fish out of the water.
It is just amazing ,you have all got to go and visit.
It truly is, Paradise on Earth."
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"Lovely garden with several different areas where you can enjoy a book, picnic, sports or simply relax."
,,Peaceful and Calming,5.0,,"I will usually go to botanical gardens with my family because, it is such a calming and peaceful environment. I go for walks, runs, and I even practice yoga there. Botanical Gardens is such a great place. You can just go there and sit with the nature and it feels amazing. If you are visiting Singapore, it is worth a visit. It was also recently named a world heritage site. You can eat there and the coffee is great. Sometimes they have symphonies playing which is a great time to visit and picnic with your family."
,,"Swings, lizards & Ginger",5.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed walking through the different sections of the Botanical Gardens. The frangipani section, I imagine, would be absolutely spectacular when in bloom. Have to save that for next time. I would visit the gardens again and finish off my exploration. 3 hours was simply not enough when including the National Orchid section also."
,,So.many.orchids,5.0,,"Beautifully laid out, full of exotic tropical plants. The orchids are a highlight, but also the palms."
,,You can meet Amithabh Bacchan (Orchid) in this garden.,4.0,,This is very nice garden.. But main part I like is ORCHID garden. I have visited this part so many time. I love all different type of Orchid placed there. Even Orchid placed in Cool house.
,,UNESCO site!,5.0,,"As the newly title UNESCO site and Singapore's only one so far, it is a must visit. It's free! Unless you drive, then you have to pay for parking, which is still reasonable. Great place to enjoy a bit of nature in a built up city."
,,Not for nothing a UNESCO heritage site!,5.0,,"Wander around and relax, or jog. Book an online exercise or yoga session with one of the fitness clubs offering outdoor classes and have some fresh juice or soymilk on the way out! A wonderful escape in the heart of a very hectic city!"
,,"Wonderfully Serene, Colourful and Diverse",5.0,,"We took the MRT to the Gardens and that was, as usual, the cheapest and most easy and efficient wayto get there. Plan to spend the day as there are so many parts to see and even ample places to sit and picnic on the lawns. The orchid garden, spice and ginger gardens are a 'must see'. Such a very peaceful place with the amazing array of tropical plants and flowers are a delight, even if you have no interest in gardening. Take your time to just stop and look, as you'll ne able to find little hidden gems and surprises amoungst the plants. Could happily go back again and again. Certainly an oasis and a huge credit to those who splanned and stated the gardens. Highly recommended!"

,,Singapore icon,5.0,,We consider these gardens to be one of the best Botanic Gardens we've been lucky to see anywhere! If you can catch a concert in the arena here it's an amazing g experience. See them rain or shine they are always at their best & we can't resist a visit with each return to Singapore.
,,Parkland,5.0,,Beautifully kept gardens and park. Free to enter except for a small charge if you want to see the orchids.
,,"Beautiful and Peaceful. Educational and Invigorating, too.",5.0,,"I have always wanted to visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens. I finally made the effort to pay this place a visit over the Singapore Golden Jubilee weekend. And I am so glad I did. The Botanic Gardens is so well put together. The overall mood is peaceful and relaxing. It is a huge place but it is easy to navigate your way around the grounds. The sign posting is excellent. There is a lot to divert your attention and keep you entertained; from the little pieces of information which help to describe every tree or sculpture. You will learn a lot about the trees, flora and fauna of Singapore from your visit.

Highly recommended for visitors and those living in Singapore."
,,Great for walks and nature,5.0,,"A beautiful place -- well maintained and easy to navigate. Lots of people usually early in the day--walking, exercising, etc. The orchid garden is fantastic."
,,Tropical flower paradise,4.0,,"Being from a dry California, looking at the flowers there was inspiring. The humidity and temperature of Singapore allows varieties of flowers that we can only see in greenhouses. So if you love tropical flowers, this is a great place to visit. I especially liked the display of flower varieties that were dedicated to famous people. Very awesome varieties that were developed specially for them."
,,Amazing walk,5.0,,"Impressive as the rest of Singapore...Plants look happy and well kept, I recommend the visit also to those who are not into gardening..."
,,Excellent walk,5.0,,"I really enjoyed these gardens. They are excellent for walking, running, or just hanging out. They've really done a remarkable job keeping that place like it is. Would return."
,,Free and a good place to spend a couple of hours,3.0,,Visited here on 13 August in the morning. Was expecting it to be a bit cooler than other areas but it wasn't. Caught the train there from orchard rd. get off at botanical garden station and it is right there. The gardens are well laid out however had a bit of an issue with lack of signage. There are a couple of lakes there and a rainforest area. There are toilets inside and a vending machine provides cheap cool drinks. Would recommend to others.
,,Nice but overcrouded,4.0,,"The gardens are really nice, but it was very overcrowded, maybe due to free entrance for Singaporeans during SG50 celebrations...."
,,An oasis for R&R away from the hectic city life!,5.0,,"The newly crowned Unesco Heritage Site is a vast expanse of greenery filled with every tropical tree, shrub, plant and vegetation carefully preserved for posterity for generations to come. It is a tranquil and verdant ground to unwind and to reflect the glories that nature has provided. There are vast spaces for recreation and every amenity for R&R is available. It is easily accessible by public transport and the MRT and is at the fringe of the hustle and bustle of the shopping belt. You will never tire of the gardens and worth a visit every weekend as admission is free! I can see that teens, children and even family dogs all enjoy the wide open spaces. You will not regret visiting the gardens again and again!"
,,A restful place amid Singapore's bustle.,4.0,,I love visiting gardens and this is one of the best I have seen. Set aside at least an hour and meander the grounds.
,,Green City,5.0,,A nice walk on the shadows of Singapore trees in the afternoon is one of the best things to do in the city. You can also have drinks and dinner in the garden
,,Great free gardens,5.0,,"A brilliant place to wander round. Best to visit in the morning when the heat is less intense. We paid to visit the orchid gardens, which was well worth it."
,,Singapore,5.0,,"Whatever said and done it is an inner drive of an individual and his team that has made this country great tThe unique feel of the air the beauty the order of the system The pioneer generation of this nation can tell the history of changes of this nation from bukit ho swee the national theatre the over night changes. Of the city of the skyline
Of the greenery etc everything is a beauty Every country goes throu her own vicious cycle depending on her nation's political system .Singapore is unique no country can duplicate this island nation ."

,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,Fantastic gardens with stunning views in an even more wonderful city. Definitely worth a look and will be well remembered!
,,A showcase of tropical flora and fauna,5.0,,"Walking into Botanic Gardens offers almost a sense of immediate tranquility with it's lush greenery . Lakes, shady trees, tropical flowers , footpaths , rest stops and information about the significance of the flora and fauna makes this an enriching and relaxing visit .
Lots of good photo opportunities with beautiful mature trees , pretty flowers and wide fields and lakes .
Just make sure its not too hot a day when you visit !
Of course, it's newly crowned status as Songapore's first and only Unesco site makes this a must visit ."
,,Amazing orchid gardens very worth a visit!,5.0,,Orchid gardens are absolute must if you are a flower lover. I made over 1000 photos of orchids. They are unbelievable and so beautiful. I felt it was a special treat.
,,Evening Walk with observance,5.0,,"As you walk and impressed with plants and insects. Open your eyes and observe the hornet hunting for a spider which is bigger than him along the plants. The reason is to sting the spider and carry it to an undeground laire to bury it with the hornets eggs in it.
Just amazing how it catches thd huge spider and how it escape the spider jaws."
,,Good exercise,4.0,,It was part of our outdoor activities for the stay at Marina Bay Sands. It was nice to be able to get out of the Hotel to see other places as well. I enjoyed it.
,,Luxurious Vegetation,5.0,,"Wonderful park , full of an amazing variety of plants , trees and flowers, It takes a whole day to walk around and get lost in the extraordinary vegetation, for nature flower lovers."
,,An oasis in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,I loved the Singapore Botanic Gardens. There were numerous sections featuring different types of flowers. One section featured orchids and looked amazing. Overall the gardens had the most exquisite flowers and looked fabulous. There was a very nice gift shop with some nice books which I bought and there were restaurants catering to different wallets. Transport back and forth was convenient with buses and taxis easily available. This is one of the few economical things to do in Singapore.
,,Great day out!,5.0,,My first excursion in Singapore. Busy and full of tourists but still a lot of places where I was totally alone. Beautiful!
,,A Garden In The Garden City,5.0,,"The first time I was at the gardens was when I was yet able to walk. It was beautiful then (from the pictures mum took) and it is even more beautiful now. A perfect place for family fun - picnic, frisbee, or just lie on the grass to take in the fresh air. My family loves the concerts held there every now and then. The schedule of the performances are at the official website, www.sbg.org.sg.
Easily reached by bus, MRT and car. Many eateries, and the many entrance/exits lead to other eaterieif the restaurants or cafe in the gardens is not to your liking."
,,Pleasant gardens,5.0,,A great place to refresh yourself after travelling around Singapore. Easy to access via public transport but travel there quickly by train to maximise your time there especially if you are only in Sjngapore for a short time.
,,Nice outdoor area,3.0,,Living in Singapore somethings you just crave an outdoor open space. Singapore is consciously green!
,,A world heritage site it is.,5.0,,when you go ensure you have time to take in the gardens - it is quite a walk but a great learning experience in the middle of Singapore. Enjoy the time out with the sights and sounds of nature.
,,Breathtaking & well laid out,5.0,,My kids aged 6&10 loved this beautiful garden and were in awe of the supergrove tree structure. We went on the audio tour priced SGD 5 for adults and SGD 3 for kids. Its a 20min trip around all the major areas of the gardens and worth it to see everything. Unless you have a buggy the gardens are too huge for kids to keep walking everywhere. McDonalds on site was a surprise but welcome one. The Skywalk was closed due to inclement weather and that was a blow as we were all excited to do it. We could not wait for it to re-open so will have to do it another visit. Definately better to go nearer sunset as the supergrove trees come to light and are spectacular. Another thing we have to remember when we go back! Fit this into your busy schedule - you will love it!
,,Peaceful and very clean!,3.0,,"We made the trip over to the botanic gardens because my mum is a huge plant lover. It is a very big area to walk through, very relaxing and serene space. I got hungry during our stroll through the gardens, so i would suggest to eat before coming here."
,,"Green, fresh, big, nicely designed....",5.0,,"We are a French family currently living in Singapore.
Green, fresh, big, nicely designed, very clean, well maintained, with labels under trees and plants. We can run, walk, picnic on the lawn. There is also the Orchid Garden which i commented in another post. We love it."
,,"Unesco World Heritage site, very much well deserved",5.0,,"No other Botanic Garden in the world matches the Singapore Botanic Gardens. I come here regularly, latest to listen to the symphony orchestra playing from the stage at Swan Lake. What a mesmerizing experience and so felt thousand of other picnickers that evening.

But overall, just walking around these gigantic gardens and to visit the different theme parks (scented plants, healing and medical plants, the historical and evolution trail just to mention three) is a memorable and relaxing experience in itself, far away from the city's hectic and noisy life. You will notice how the gardeners meticiously prune, trim and keep clean this oasis in Singapore every day 24/7 and with pride!

The gardens host several eateries and recreational spots. Best to come during the early morning hours on a jog, walk or just to watch the great number of people doing their morning exercise, be it Kung-fu, dancing, aerobics or stretching.

Don't miss!"
,,Orchid Garden is awesome!,5.0,,An extremely pleasant and shady walk through the Orchid Garden with fantastic varieties of orchids. Especially like the VIP orchids and cool garden!
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,The botanical garden it a must see in Singapore it's free but the orchids place is not free but it's worth paying because the orchids are pretty and different variety
,,Lovely place to visit,5.0,,I am unable to walk and use a wheelchair. I caught the cable car to the top of the gardens and had lunch at the Restaraunt located there. I then took the afternoon looking at the very beautiful gardens and was able to see 95% of all that was there. I would thoroughly recommend this place to any person in a wheelchair. When you get to the bottom of the gardens you are in the CBD and just a short ride to anywhere in the city by bus.
,,Stunning Gardens,5.0,,"Utterly beautiful, one of the most stunning gardens that I have ever been to. The orchids were fantastic and the gardens completely immaculate as you would expect in Singapore."
,,Free and fun,5.0,,"100% recommend this, especially if you have children. They can run about for hours, there is a great climbing structure and loads to interact with and the best part is it is mostly free. Singapore is an expensive city so this makes a refreshing change!"
,,A tranquil escape,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens are a welcome respite from the busy city of Singapore. There are a number of areas which are all very well signposted. The Evolution Garden which traces the development of plants was very well done. I didn't stop at the cafe but it looked nice, with a good breakfast and lunch menu. I didn't go into the Orchid Garden...this was definitely the most popular attraction, with a stream of tour bus groups, but if orchids are your thing it is probably worth braving the crowds.
It takes about 2 hours to have a good look around, and if you go early morning you can have areas to yourself."
,,Wonderful walks,5.0,,"Even in the rain this was a must see and rightly one of the most popular places to visit in Singapore. All the different gardens and paths to them are excellently sign posted with the distances clearly marked so that you know your walk commitment. There is also an MRT stop right outside one of the entrances, and bus and Taxie pick up at other entrances all signed.

The Orchid garden was amazing, even my son who hates gardens and flowers and was very hot enjoyed it."
,,Garden Experience,4.0,,Very beautiful and well laid out garden. Visited in the summer and found it best to go during the morning and have a coffee at the restaurant inside. Worth a visit.
,,Good afternoon out,4.0,,Beautiful Gardens with lovely pathways to explore. Even though it can get busy you can still feel peaceful and not actually see many of the people there.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"If you like this sort of thing, you'll love these gardens. Beautiful and worth the cost to see all the amazing plants and flowers. Great day."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"the Orchid garden is here also - so that in itself is reason to go, but the parks, the gorgeous trees, the lakes, it is simply beautiful."
,,Nive place to enjoy nature and relax,5.0,,"The garden is huge, we just spent two hours and we did not see even half of the whole area. There are places with maps and trails so you can go around in different ways. the Orchid garden inside the Botanic garden is really special. Only U$5 dollars entrance fee for adults, children are free. So many beautiful orchids and spots, all very nicely cared for. It is a perfect place to relax in the city."
,,Happy Birthday SG50!,4.0,,"Thank you Singapore for opening your amazing garden to everyone these past couple of days. It is nice to be in a place where everyone was so happy, with kids running around and concert music playing in the background."
,,Incredible and sustainable,5.0,,Wow this is spectacular gardens that is both sustainable and visually appealing. the garden has many exotic and native plants and good information about the different plants. I really enjoyed it both visually and environmentally and wish i had gardens like this back home.
,,Gardens to Relax in,5.0,,"The gardens provide a relaxing walk and show the variety of vegetation which is visible throughout Singapore. You can take it at your own pace, with refreshments or dining available and plenty of shade. The rain forest and orchid garden are beautiful features."
,,Amazing Botanical gardens!,5.0,,"Was absolutely stunning, so much to see and explore, beautiful flora everywhere, signposted well, awesome children's garden centre, was the highlight of our 24 hours in Singapore!"
,,A Delight,5.0,,Well laid out. Good paths. Good signage. Places to drink and eat. Lovely well maintained gardens. So much to see.
,,"If you love flowers, don't miss this",5.0,,"Beautiful gardens; well worth the time. Everything is free except the Orchid area. Wear walking shoes--there is much to explore. There are coffee and food stores which are convenient (and fairly good) if your kids are hungry, but better food elsewhere."
,,"A good, but not great garden",4.0,,"It is a huge place with very serene environment. A good place to visit if you have ample time during your time in Singapore. If not, don't bother to go. The UNESCO title doesn't mean it's any much different than other gardens."
,,A Place Where My Son can Run and Jump,4.0,,"I always love any botanical garden. This Singapore botanical garden also impressed me. In such a small country, it still has a huge land where my son can run here and there with a big pond in front him
We saw some people brought picnic umbrella there, giving us an idea to also bring some picnic stuff"
,,absolutely fantastic,5.0,,"We only had time for the orchid section, SPECTACULAR orchids, and so well maintained, and clean and tidy gardens. We spent half a day there but could have spent longer."
,,Green Space Galore,5.0,,"One of the cheapest and most expansive green spaces in Singapore. There are constantly guided walks, shows, movies, performances most of them completely free. For anyone who lives in Singapore it is a place to visit and enjoy often. For visitors, it is a place to get away from the hustle of downtown and see the beauty of the tropics."
,,Amazing,5.0,,If you like nature you should go there anyway! It is in my personal top 5 in Singapore. it is very nice just to walk there for hours!
,,Lovely gardens and good place to eat,5.0,,Loved the gardens and the places to eat. You could be a million miles away from a town and it is fantastic.
,,Huge garden where you can relax,5.0,,"I have spent more tha half a day in it and I do not think I have seen it all. Besides the many plants from all over Asia there are ponds and lakes in it. I could also seen swans. Many people were picnicking and there was a stage for exhibitions from were music was flowing. There were also some small tents were you could buy typical food. Many plants had a description about their origin and when they were brought in the gardens. I have also visited the healing garden , where there were an huge collection of medicinal herbs divided by the part of the body they affect, and the rainforest that enjoined a lot because of the atmosphere."
,,Nice place to visit!,4.0,,"For every one who love plants, flowers, trees this is the place. you can enjoy with your family having nice walk around the garden. I love this place!"
,,Oldest and best,5.0,,"A green lung in a busy city…still the gracious Grand Dame of gardens, with an established history of first class research and development, who to my mind will never be eclipsed by her flashy sister By the Bay"
,,A Haven of Tranquility,5.0,,Easily accessed via the MRT to the Botanical Garden stop. It's free to enter with a delightful garden cafe by the clock tower which is inexpensive.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I can't get enough of this place. Its tranquility and beauty is breathtaking. Definitely a place to visit on your day off.
,,Beautiful and free!,5.0,,"A real nice day out and it's free! The gardens were stunning! Watch out for lizards, turtles, owls and fish to! Easy to get to and lots of variety - if you have kids you can't go wrong! Bring a water proof jacket it went from sun to pouring rain in 5 minutes!"
,,Worth a journey,5.0,,"For people and families of all ages a simply beautiful and exotic collection of trees, plants and flowers. Not to be missed and now a World Heritage site."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Amazing garden! A lot of greenery, good for photoshoots, good for kids, and even has free concerts! Love to go there, but can be very hot, so get there prepared!"
,,Worth it even if you're not a nature lover,4.0,,Beautiful gardens to wander through with a wide variety of immaculately kept gardens. We only had an hour to spend but we could easily have spent another hour or more.
,,Amazingly beautiful,5.0,,It took 2 visits to walk around the garden which so ample.just make a plan where to go and have plenty of water. Make sure you see every corner if you're a nature lover.
,,Nice break from the City,4.0,,"Nice break from the hustle and bustle. Although initially touristy, there is enough walks where you can find solitude within the gardens. Very humid and Mother Nature cut our trip short due to biblical thunderstorms, can't complain though as we had free entry for SG50! Nice day out."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit, the botanic garden is full of incredibly plants. I especially love the ginger walk and the orchid gardens. The bonsai garden feels like a place stepped out of time. Restaurants housed in the gardens are rather lovely too. And if you like a little run or some bootcamp with your weekends, there's a host of good places to get your sweat on too."
,,Interesting and for free :),5.0,,Since sightseeing can be quite expensive in Singapore botanic gardens are a beautiful and free thing. There are many plants which you usually see in greenhouses. :) It is a nice way to spend some hours during the daytime heat when the trees make it more bearable to stand the heat.
,,The oxygen store,5.0,,"Whatever your reason for visiting Singapore, take an hour and visit the gardens.Something magic about that place. You'll find something you love. Visit the mens (or ladies) rooms with their windows on the jungle."
,,Must do!!,5.0,,"Beautiful, charming, clean and free!! Easy to stop from the hop on hop off bus and well worth the visit"
,,Peaceful place in busy city,4.0,,"Such a peace and beautiful garden in the middle of busy city. Enjoyed the different areas of the garden, especially the orchid area. It's a must visit place"
,,The best botanical garden in the world!,5.0,,"Every city I visit I always try to visit botanic gardens and this one is on the first place! (The second place I would to the botanic garden in Wellington, New Zealand)
This garden is magical, and especially the Orchids area. Please make sure you visit this place and not only artificial Sentosa island."
,,"A place of peace, tranquility and beauty!",5.0,,"If you happen to be visiting Singapore and you feel the need to escape the ""hustle and bustle"" of the business or shopping areas of the city, then the Botanic Gardens are one place that you could head for. We have always found it to be a place of peace, tranquility and beauty.
During a recent 36 hour stopover in Singapore, we tried to fit as much as possible into our schedule. However, eventually part way through the day, the pace of our activities and the heat and humidity of the day began to catch up with us. It was time to take a break and where better to head to for a breather but the Botanic Gardens.
There are numerous places within the gardens where you can find a bench in a shady spot, take the weight off your feet and enjoy the beautiful vistas. That is exactly what we did.
As has been the norm during our previous visits to the gardens, there were not a great number of people about and this added to the relaxing atmosphere in the gardens. We also particularly enjoyed the cooling effects of a number of water features.
If you a botanical enthusiast, a keen gardener, enjoy beautiful scenery or just need some time out from the crowds of people found in many other parts of Singapore, then the Botanic Gardens is the place to escape to."
,,Must see!,5.0,,"It is very easy to find, as the entrance is immediately next to an MRT station, which I think was called Botanic Gardens. There are plenty of places to buy food & drink, although it's not cheap. We just brought a bottle and refilled it at the drinking fountains located near each toilet. The Gardens themselves are stunning, and we spent about 4-5 hours walking around the place (including the Orchid Garden, which we got into at student prices despite not having our cards on us). It would be a perfect place to bring a picnic, and has plenty of shaded areas for sunny days. I'd very happily go back here if I ever return to Singapore."
,,orchid world,5.0,,"Watch the dazzling orchids. The tropical blossoms are colorful, flamboyant, and eye-catching. They are the national flowers of Singapore."
,,Wonderful green oasis,5.0,,"We spent a wonderful few hours ambling around these gardens. We loved the different areas especially the orchid area.

We particularly liked the rain forest section. This was partly due to it being less busy and provided some welcome shade. But mainly because we saw two owls perched high in a tree. We did not expect to see owls in Singapore. Sorry we didn't have binoculars so we were unable to identify what species they were."
,,Rare Treat,5.0,,"When we landed in Singapore the first thing that got my attention was the orchids all around - it was breathtaking! But then these were put to shame by the beauty and variety of flowers and orchids at the Botanic Gardens. We spent hours there and although it was very hot and humid and it was a great experience.

Allow enough time for your visit and make sure to take enough water when it is hot - you don't want to hurry"
,,A piece of peacefull in the middle of the city,4.0,,"I was in Singapore and three years ago and was one of the places that surprised me, because of the variety of plants that can be found in the same place. The best time to visit is at sunset for the colors and the space in which one is located and is a perfect place to be quiet or reading a book.
Another thing that characterizes is the explanation about plants, I think it is for all audiences, both scientists who are passionate about the flora, and families with children.
The entrance is free. At the end there are polls to anyone who wants to make a donation.
From the business point of view it is very good place to create a private event.
One entrance is located in Napier Road, directly opposite the US Embassy and the British Council on the corner of Glen Eagle Hospital.
Honestly it is one of the places that we should put on our agenda to visit, whether we are in business and if we are family."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,catch the hop on hop off bus From Suntec shopping centre to the gardens. Plenty to see and easy to get around. The orchid garden a must.
,,Sight for sore eyes...,5.0,,"Accidently reviewed gardens as a whole under National Orchid Gardens review site. Suffice to say, beautiful, serene and a treat for the senses. Coming from a non-gardener who barely glances at them usually this place has captivated me twice over the past few years... and yes, I would go next time I'm in town yet again!"
,,A green break from the city,4.0,,"Definitely a place for everyone: hardworking workers escape from concrete jungle around, families gather for a picnic, friends or couples for a simple dating or an athletic person wants to do jogging everyday. Really love the fact that everything here is natural and made in Singapore, not imported from somewhere else."
,,Gorgeous!,4.0,,I am debating between a 4 and 5 star rating. The gardens are really nice and it's nice to walk around / picnic (except that it seems to be particularly muggy in there). I envy people who live around in that area as it seems to be such a beautiful place to take a break from the daily / city life. But I find it a slightly daunting place to go to as a visitor. It's huge and I haven't figured out the perfect area in the gardens for us yet!
,,Very Cooling !! ITS WORTH A VISIT !!,4.0,,"Its Really Nice With A Lot Of Sites To See And With the Event Of SG 50 There Is A Lot Of Really Cool Souvenirs At The Gift Shop End Of The Trip With The ""CoolHouse"" Which Is A ""House"" With AC That Houses The Nice's Plants And Flowers In General The Garden Is Really Pretty Like Legit Its Also Really Cooling Which Is Weird Cause Of How Hot Singapore Is"
,,a good place to take a walk,5.0,,"I love the greens and plants and flowers :) back in my country, Indonesia, there is really no botanic garden so yeah I truly enjoyed this."
,,Wonderful respite in the city,5.0,,"The Gardens are an awesome break from a busy city. They are well manicured and the areas are clearly marked. The mix of trees, flowers, nice pathways, shops, little cafes, and lakes have a calming influence on visitors.!"
,,Certainly worth a visit,5.0,,"This area is so large you can spend days walking round the various sections, we enjoyed the gardens so much we will certainly make a point to come back again"
,,very pleasant,5.0,,I guess this is Singapore's answer to Central Park. very different to the city. open green spaces in the heart of the city
,,Lovely evening visit,5.0,,"Although we have been to the Botanic gardens before, we decided to go in the evening and it lived up to our expectations. As dusk fell, the lanterns were lit and the gardens were transformed into a magical place. We saw catfish, turtles and swans in the lake. Many families were enjoying the gardens, playing games and eating together. There are so many lovely plants and flowers to see. If you are in Singapore, you must make a visit here part of your trip."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"You must do this early in the morning as the days are very hot and humid, however do not miss out on doing this"
,,Team building at botanic garden,5.0,,"Botanic garden is the iconic place for team building, exercise and relaxation. The orchid garden is fabulous and value for spending time to explore and take photos. This place is deserved to be UNESCO World Heritage Site."
,,Great city garden,4.0,,"The garden is very nice, free of charge, with a children garden very popular for toddlers. It is easy to spend half a day there. But bring plenty of water and prepare for sun protection."
,,Green green grass..loads of it,4.0,,"This is now an international heritage site.. no kidding! So, you get plants and history all rolled into one location. And like most places in Singapore, food as well. Great place to check out in the early morning with the family. Nice place for jogs too. Check out online for free concerts and such."
,,Nice for a stroll around,3.0,,Was nice strolling around but not as good at Gardens by the Bay which is new & quirky.. Is just like strolling around a nice large Park if not for the National Orchid Garden which has an admission fee however were stunning... Enjoyed the Evolution Garden with the replica's of giant clubmosses..
,,Lovely garden,5.0,,"Botanic Gardens is a huge garden with different plants, trees and blooms. It's free to visit here so I would highly recommend this to everyone."
,,Wonderful oasis of nature in the city! UNESCO heritage site,5.0,,"I spent an entire afternoon here and still feel like I only scratched the surface of what the garden had to offer. Free of charge! In addition to the National Orchid Garden (for which there is a small fee), there are other specialized areas, such as the evolution garden (totally unexpectedly cool), fragrance garden, a temporary exhibit of botanical art, and a wonderful variety of bamboo, ginger, hanging flowers, heritage trees, etc., etc. I happened to wander upon a concert by the Symphony Orchestra with an outdoor audience in excess of 10,000. What a treat! Definitely a place to go back to again and again -- and if you're a runner, what an incredible place! So many trails to explore."
,,Our newly minted UNESCO World Heritage site,4.0,,"I am a local and I will try to visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG) every week to exercise. I will walk from the Tanglin gate visitor centre, past Swan Lake, National Orchid Garden, Symphony Lake, Nassim gate visitor centre to the Botanic Garden MRT station area and back. It takes me less than an hour and I cover about 5 km. A great way to exercise!
For foreign visitors, I would advise to start from the Tanglin or Nassim gate area and stroll to the National Orchid Garden as I feel that that is the highlight of the SBG. If you arrive via the MRT, it would be a long walk to the National Orchid Garden. As the area near the MRT is a newer area of the SBG, there are fewer big tall shady trees. Singapore’s tropical heat may be overwhelming for those from temperate countries. Go early so that the temperature is cooler."
,,Well-appointed garden,4.0,,"One of the most beautiful and well-appinted botanical garden. A variety of plants, herbs and trees are there. You can also see Orchid Garden and Rain Forest here."
,,Pleasant walk,3.0,,Pleasant as botanical gardens go. Saw squirrels and large monitor lizards in the gardens the orchid tour is worthwhile especially as seniors card accepted.
,,Great for morning runs,5.0,,"Very welcoming to runners of all kinds in Singapore aside from its natural UNESCO beauty. I'd say that you can cover around 6km running along side the inside edge of the garden.

Stop every once in a while to observe for birds and all the lush surroundings."
,,GREAT PLACE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS,4.0,,"When ever we visit Singapore we always make a point to spend time at this great attraction. Once again , we are not at all disappointed. There is no cost to visit this venue, which is large in size and well maintained. Being a Sunday...More"
,,Worth the trip out to the gardens,5.0,,"Wow!! We really enjoyed our day in the gardens. So much to see, from the famous orchids to original rain forest areas. Staff were very helpfull advising us on the best use of our time. They organised a taxi for us and even loaned me...More"
,,A Gardeners paradise in a concrete jungle,4.0,,What a beautiful place! The gardens cover quite a large area so allow yourself plenty of time to enjoy this wonderful FREE feature - although it may cost you S$5 to visit the Orchid Centre - that will take 2 hours to get around alone...More
,,Oh the orchids,5.0,,"Wonderful, amazing orchid garden. Worth the admission charge. I have never seen such lush plantings. A great walk,however I would caution anyone planning a visit to go early in the morning,due to the heat!"
,,Fantastic place to visit,5.0,,Set aside 3+ hours for this. Would be on my must do list. I only had a couple hours to visit but when I go back to Singapore I will visit again and spend more time. The two fleet does are fantastic
,,Singapore not only Shopping and Eating,5.0,,Definitely worth visiting. Had breakfast here and spent a very pleasant morning on a stopover in Singapore. Refreshing change from what is otherwise mostly a shopping and eating experience
,,A nice oasis,4.0,,"It is always nice to go to the Botanic Gardens. It is a pleasant oasis near the center of the city. The Orchid section is quite nice, though you need to pay an entry fee."
,,excellent garden for repeat visit by a local tourist,5.0,,I am very thankful that Botanical Garden is in Singapore and near to where I live so that I can enjoy visiting it anytime and visit different parts on different visits. I go there often for my walk and it is a joy to be...More
,,Enjoy the plants and people watching,5.0,,"The gardens have spaces and plants for all ages and interests. The orchid garden deserves a special visit and there are wonderful food outlets, open spaces, and quiet paths in the gardens."
,,chill out with plants,5.0,,During a hot day this is a perfect place to hide from heat. So many different plants to see. Relaxing!
,,Fantastic gardens and free too!!!,5.0,,Truly worthy of their recent appointment as a world heritage site. Had a very pleasant morning wandering around the gardens and being awed at the standard of garden maintenance there. There must be a whole army of gardeners hidden in there somewhere!!
,,Serene and Scenic! A must do in Singapore,5.0,,I loved our walk through this garden! It felt like we had been transported to the countryside from the hustle and bustle of the city.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"peaceful , clean and beautiful environment, bird humming along the road, is a good place for nature walk"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"We didn't have as long as we would have liked here. To be honest it should be a full day trip, and bring comfortable walking shoes. Gardens are stunning, and there are lots of quiet little corners for reflection"
,,Just like common parks,3.0,,"It just felt like common park, just very neat, clean, and the garden design is nice. (This is my subjective review and maybe I didn't see best part of it because I didn't have much time to explore)."
,,"Magnificent gardens, not to be missed.",5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are just magnificent. We visit them every time we go to Singapore and they don't disappoint. If you love gardens then you will appreciate the time and effort into maintaining such magnificent gardens. The orchid nursery is a must see. It is within the Botanic Gardens. The concierge at our hotel suggested we take a taxi there, which we did for a small cost. We were advised the train stops a little way away and in the heat it is better to be fresh after getting out of the taxi. There are places where you can eat and drink. Allow at least a half a day if you don't mind the heat."
,,Great place for a leisurely stroll... away from the shopping malls,5.0,,"As a Singaporean, I am proud of the Botanic Gardens. It is a great and cool place to slow down and enjoy the beautiful flowers and trees. Do visit the National Orchid Garden too! I never realised the vast variety of orchids till I visited."
,,A must see for lovers of gardens or open spaces,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens are free entry but one or two areas are chargeable such as the Orchid Garden which is worth the visit (and cost) in it's own right. The Botanical Gardens are a must see for all lovers of gardens or open spaces. Looks to have had considerable investment. Evening or night time stroll to the fragrant garden is worth while. Good enough for two trips which is what we did. I would come back here if I return to Singapore. The gardens are in divided into a number of themes including a rain forest. Something for everyone, On our two trips we saw some wildlife but you need to look for it. This included a sizable Monitor Lizard of at least 1 metre length (see image 3). For the more nervous of you, all the wildlife will avoid you like the plague and even my large lizard made its escape once disturbed. If you find one, please don't touch it as they have large claws."
,,Wow!,5.0,,What a fantastic set of gardens; what a variety of species. And a terrific café in the centre. This is well worth a walk through; especially the rain forest.
,,A must visit.,5.0,,Take a stroll through the gardens in the cool of the evening. Don't miss the Orchid Garden. Take your camera. Relax by the swan lake. Unforgetable!
,,A weekly visit,5.0,,"Every week I'll walk one or two days in the Botanic Gardens and I never tire of the beauty and tranquillity so close to the city. Moreover, it is spotlessly maintained, has excellent signage, and never appears overcrowded. Remember that it can get very hot and in places there are some steep climbs so loose fitting clothes are a must as is a sun hat!"
,,A World Heritage Site!,5.0,,"This just made it to the World Heritage Site listing and I say it is about time! It is a beautiful garden fashioned after Kew Gardens I would think but with a tropical theme. The garden it self has free entry but if you want to go see the Orchids (which one must!) there is a minimal entrance fee to be paid. I love this garden. It is historical and has surprising corners which one must discover for oneself. And of course, if you want to have a cuppa after all that walking in the heat there are plenty of places for that too."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,3.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gargens is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is long shape area and there is many small area such as healing garden, foliage garden, revolution garden, ginger garden, orchid garden (have fee) . You can go there by MRT to Botanic garden station. I like trees but sun is strong and no have any golf car to drive around so i am very tired. If you have time you would slow walk and read information about the trees and have a picnic basket or have a lunch in a tourist center. You also should have a big hat."
,,Pretty Good but definitely not a must see - Go to Gardens by the Bay instead.,4.0,,"I have lived in Singapore for ten years and went for the first time to Botanic Gardens last weekend. Honestly a bit underwhelmed. The place is really well managed but at the end of the day it is a park / garden. The next day I headed off for the first time again to Gardens by the Bay. If you are not a botany graduate, or a deep lover of gardens, I would suggest the latter over the former. Gardens by the Bay introduces a touch of oomph to a garden. I dare say there is nothing like that anywhere else I know of. Take your pick and enjoy!"
,,must must must go,5.0,,"dont ever miss if ur in singapore but must visit conservatively atleast 2 days to cover the entire sections, dont miss the evening orchestra, v were lucky one to experience the show."
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,"Beautiful place, there are many theme gardens you can choose from. Their orchid garden is the best part, you pay 5.00 SGD but it's absolutely worth it!"
,,Must visit for locals and tourists,5.0,,"An incredibly beautiful gardens in Singapore - probably the best in Asia, in my opinion. I have been coming to the Botanic Gardens for over 30 years and I keep coming back. The location is right near the centre of town - very convenient. There are plenty of top-class restaurants there. And there are even free performances held there at the auditorium sometimes. A magical place."
,,Forget about what you have seen before,5.0,,"I am not a person interested in botanics but this place was a unique experience. This is a very big place and some spots are really impressive. There is an area showing the evolution of trees. An area with poisonous plants. And a garden with plants used to cure diseases, organised according to parts of body!
Check from the website the days with free entry. When we went, the entrance was free. Just paid for the orchid garden."
,,"Nice, but you are not missing anything.",4.0,,"Clean, well kept, some interesting features. But you are not missing out if you don't make your way here. Recommend: visit early morning, or dusk time as it is less hot and you can enjoy the nice breeze Singapore sometimes gets :)"
,,Orchid garden a must see.,5.0,,Stunning arrangement of plants and flora. Spent a couple of hours in the orchid house and gardens alone.
,,Wonderful range of orchids and beautiful grounds,5.0,,These Botanical Gardens cover a large area but the best part to visit was the Orchid section which is also quite large and included an amazing variety of different species of orchids and the new hybrids which have been named after celebrities was also interesting.
,,"The ""Kew"" or Orchids",4.0,,"I spent a good 3 hours walking through the Singapore Botanic Gardens - the hi-light for me was the National Orchid Garden. This is probably the most comprehensive and outstandingly kept open-air and enclosed orchid garden in the world. Dendrobiums, vandas, Cattleyas, Phalaenopsis, paphiopedilums...you name them. A must for orchid lovers."
,,Flowers a bloom!,5.0,,"Certified World heritage site by UNESCO! All kinds of flowers and orchids you can ever see, touch and smell! Simply awesome! One garden you would like to have in your own backyard. Love them all! They are so serene and tranquil like the sea they soothe your soul. You can forget about everything and be contented and happy just gazing at them! Amazing!"
,,peaceful walking,5.0,,The botanic gardens are a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city without having to go further out to the nature reserves. If you like plants and animals there is a lot to look at here. If you don't really care about the plants there is plenty of people watching to be had.
,,"Lovely Gardens, Relaxing Walk",5.0,,"Even though it was hot in Singapore, the walk through the park was pleasant and absolutely gorgeous! It is a relaxing walk though this amazing garden. There is a butterfly sanctuary and it is is awesome to see."
,,Lovely place for locals and travellers alike,5.0,,"I am a local and I live 5 minutes walk from the botanical gardens. As such, I have visited it more than 100 times since I was a little girl and yet I never get tired of the place. Each time I go for an evening jog or stroll there, i discover something new. I love the peaceful setting and variety of plants and I feel relaxed every time I am there. It is nice to see families having picnics and playing frisbee on the bukit timah side (close to where I live) on the weekends. As it is a place I have known since I was young, it is special in my heart and we took our wedding photos there. It is a lovely place for locals and travellers alike. It is better to go in the morning and evenings when it is less hot though."
,,Very Nice,4.0,,I was surprised at the design of the garden. Very nice to go and relax. There is an unbelievable amount of foliage and plants that you will only see in Singapore. A little pricey to get into but definitely worth it.
,,Marvelous,5.0,,"This is a beautiful place to visit, just be careful with the heat/sun. In July it is almost intolerable."
,,Wonderful orchids,4.0,,This is a delightful area for families to visit. The orchid gardens are beautiful and well looked after. The gift shop has a wide range of gifts to bring home as a taste of Singapore. There is a large performance stage where concerts are held and a beautiful lake area where you can picnic
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,"We visited on a hot day, there were lots of places to stop and have drinks / food. The subway stops at the gardens, entrance is free, the orchid garden is worth a visit."
,,Nice place for a walk,3.0,,"It is a wide open space, great for those who wants to walk around in a sunny weekend. A lot of trees, big green area - all that without any cost, but haven't seen nothing that has caught my attention. Do it if you have free time and don't want to spend money. Easy to get there with MRT."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a must-see attraction for any tourist visiting Singapore. We spent a couple of hours there on our last day and really enjoyed the gardens, despite the heat and humidity of July. It's easy to get to from any central-Singapore hotel and doesn't cost anything either!"
,,Beauty of nature,5.0,,the orchid garden was ultimate and one of the best place i had ever visited.I really enjoyed the beauty of nature
,,lovely,4.0,,"Singapore has lovely gardens due to lots of rain, this is no exception, go for a walk from Orchard Rd, no cost and worth a look."

,,Beautiful well kept gardens.,5.0,,Easy to get to MRT station takes u to the gates. Beautiful well kept gardens. We loved the Orchid Garden. What an amazing collection of orchids. Everywhere you looked there was just beautiful flowers. The paths easy to walk around. Also nice Lil' gazebos to sit in n just relax in the gardens.
,,Very nice place,5.0,,I think this is a clean place among the best in the world. I've been to many places that cater nature but not one. Worth the money and you won't be disappointed.
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,Very well laid out. Some nice walks between different areas and seating for when you wanted to rest or admire the views .One or 2 annoying monkeys around but all in all well worth the visit and it's free
,,Sao,5.0,,Very lovely place and. A lot of interesting things to look at and a plus there a lot of cool thing to rake pic
,,"Top Singapore Attraction, best activity to cope with your long-haul flight and reset afte jet lag",5.0,,"Botanic gardens have a full UNESCO Orchid collection. Ensure plenty of time to visit there during daylight then head to the Orchid collection. This is something beyond word description. All types, colors, lush greenery and all the petal textures beautifully organized. I think this was the most impressive botanic garden ever visited. Refresh yourself with apple and aloe vera juice. Dress lightly and carry an extra battery to take photos"
,,Lush Sanctuary with Stunning Plants,4.0,,"Just a hop, skip and a jump from bustling Orchard Road, the Singapore Botanic Gardens are a lush sanctuary filled with hundreds of exotic plants from around the world. Earlier this month (July 2015), the gardens were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. If you have young children in tow, don't miss the Children's Garden. My personal favorites were the Rain Forest and the Fragrant Garden."
,,Calm within the city,5.0,,"We enjoyed a morning here wandering around, orchids, rainforest boardwalk, people watching, lake, wildlife. It's a lovely calm place to explore. The shop was full of nice things. Good toilet facilities and water fountains to refill your bottle. Taxi rank outside and the buses come into the car park too."
,,Great day in the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful botanic gardens and at the time there was a special free orchid display on show and they were absolutely breath taking as were the rest of the gardens. Well worth a visit if you are into botany and beautiful orchids.
,,Green oasis in mid of city,4.0,,"Visited botanical garden after its announced as UN heritage site, and was pleasantly surprised to see really nice garden with small lakes, with white and and black swans, wild chicken, lot of finishes and tortoise a d wide selection of plants and trees

Nice to visit place, which I have discovered recently"
,,Botanical gardens,4.0,,"Perfect way to get away from the crowds great for a picnic . Find a shady spot and just enjoy the peace and quiet . Definitely hot during the day but worth it . Make sure you have good walking shoes and always carry money on you Atms not always readily available - worth a visit

t"
,,Garden display,4.0,,"Very nice gardens and air conditioned, which was a bonus! Some beautiful plants, especially cactus tha one does not normally see. Worth a visit."
,,Well laid out gardens,4.0,,"The gardens are a World Herritage site and the tradition of Victorian botanical gardens is evident.

,,Green gem,5.0,,"MUST in Singapore
So well kept, clean, signposted, all trees tagged, manageable walking distance, pushchair friendly all along.
Long opening & free
The orchid house is special - well worth the gate fee - never seen anything like it.
Eyes opened - mind freshened
Nice restaurant too!!"
,,Fantastic day out with lots to do,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore for a few days or have recently moved here it's most definitely worth visiting the Botanic Gardens.

This is perfect for a family day out or can be romantic as a couple while you wander through the beautiful park and possibly pop into the national orchid garden (paid entry for this bit but so worth it).

The Botanic Gardens can be great for a stroll, some personal time with a book or mediation, or even for a picnic in the shade.

A few handy hints to consider:
-- it can get very hot - especially in the middle of the day - so take a hat and water
-- there are cafés and kiosks dotted around the park but they may not take bank cards or large notes so ensure you have some 10 dollar bills with you
-- keep an eye out at STS (Singapore tickets) for events that may be happening in sections of this giant park.

Definitely put on your walking shoes and make time for a visit!"
,,"If I had more time, and more resources to deal with heat..",5.0,,"I entered via the Singapore Botanic Gardens metro stop (SMRT). I love that train, it is so easy to get around! Right across from the station there are cool cafés and restaurants. Be warned though, getting from this stop to the orchid garden is a good 15 minutes walk. (or was it 10? It felt like 30 minutes!). In warm weather this can be energy zapping -- precious energy that is needed for taking photos of orchids! There was a taxi-stop outside the station, but when I approached the sole taxi there he waved me away, he was already waiting for someone. With no taxi in site, it was time to walk through the gardens. If you want to see the garden with less sun, you may want to go closer to evening time, as it is quite safe and there are families and couples everywhere. As a woman alone, I left at night fall and was feeling a bit nervous (my own sense of safety after dark!) I wish I had time to explore the rain forest section of the garden. This garden is huge. I would recommend if you have the time to go with a friend, family or lover, pick up a lunch, slather on the sunscreen and find many places to relax and enjoy the surrounding nature. There are lots of wide open areas to lay a ball game and for kids to run around too. This provided the lush equatorial vegetation that I had expected to see more of during my stay in Singapore. If you are tired of shopping and malls and would like to feel something a bit more natural, this is it. Bonus: One day after my visit, the gardens became an UNESCO World Heritage site! Singapore's first! Now I can say "" I was there before it was a World Heritage site.""
One last note --- near the orchid garden there were shops, cafés and gardens, but when I came out of the orchid garden (maybe 7pm?) they were all closed. Just when I was in dire need of a cold drink! Also, no golden orchid pendant for me..."
,,Amazing Orchids,4.0,,What a delightful place to visit. The Orchid Park is simply wonderful and well worth the $5 entrance charge. The rest of the Botanic Gardens are free to visit and privide some peace and quiet in this bustling city.
,,"Amazing gardens, and not just the orchids",5.0,,"This is, for me, the highlight of Singapore. Spend a half day here, at least. I took the bus to the Tanglin entrance of the gardens (which are free to enter). We walked through the gardens, enjoying the many varieties of trees, plants, and flowers. The swan lake is lovely. Naturally, we went to the National Orchid Garden, which is astounding in its own right. (Nominal entry fee there.) Then we walked up to the north end of the garden and used the Bukit TImah exit and took the Botanic Garden MRT to head back downtown."
,,fun free and friendly,3.0,,We had the two day hop on hop off bus ticket so used this to take a short break from the city- food was limited but loos were great
,,Wonderful Tropical Gardens,5.0,,"A wonderful garden, which they claim has more visitors than Kew. It certainly wasn't crowded when I went there. One of the highlights of my trip to Singapore and a must for any visitor there."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,a great way to spend an afternoon in beautiful surroundings and at a more than fair price point. Should be in top 10 of Singapore travellers to do lists.
,,Peaceful place to walk about,5.0,,"its a fresh place with a great surrounding flower every where giving out a wonderful smell to be about, and the best place for couples to enjoy there private life"
,,A must see in Singapore.,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens were a highlight in my trip to Singapore. Lots of signs everywhere to guide visitors to the gates and gardens. The Swan Lake was wonderful. It was humid and it did rain, so make sure to carry a bottle of water and an umbrella when visiting."
,,Magnificent park and gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful and peaceful environment. Calm tranquillity everywhere. The Orchid Garden, within the Botanic Gardens, is a must and worth the small entrance fee. Easily accessible with the Hop on/Hop off bus service (yellow line). Highly recommended."
,,Lush greenery so near the city,4.0,,"A favourite escape, the Botanic Gardens is easily accessible from Orchard Road on a number of buses at Orchard Boulevard, just 5 minutes brings you to the nearest gate opposite the British Council. However you nearly always need to catch a taxi back if you have walked to further parts within the Gardens.
The lake with the swans, both live and a statue of one, calms one's nerves immediately while the great variety of tropical trees and plants is always worth investigating especially with the accompanying detailed write-ups. The place is great for a short walk, hike or just lazing on the benches even if you don't want to pay for the Orchid Gardens.
The cafe serving pizzas, sandwiches and salads provides fresh and tasty fare, best shared as portions are large, a tad pricey but not as upmarket as Halia.
The park staff is helpful with directions though maps and brochures are amply provided. Have a nice day here!"
,,What! This is a World Heritage Site?,1.0,,"How did this ordinary neighbourhood park got listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO is beyond me. It used to be a nice little forest with many monkeys roaming around. But our recent visit was disappointing. It has been artificially ""beautify"" into a modern ""robotic"" garden. Despite the ""hard"" work there are still too much greenery and little color. The park 's atmosphere is still not clean as it is surrounded by roads with heavy traffic. Any park with autumn trees and cherry blossom will beat this hot and humid place by a million miles. A 5 minute walk will made you sweat like mad and yet you would struggle to find shelter, drinks, food and toilet when you need one urgently. Not to mention plenty of hungry mosquitoes lurking at various corner waiting to pounce on you. To add insult to injury all the man-made lakes are so small and dirty that those swans/ducks brought in to brighten the place refuse to stay or survive there for long. Come only if you want a good sweat or are bore to death in Singapore."
,,superb SG destination,4.0,,You have to allocate not less than half day to visit this place. Prepare yourself for long walks. No entrance fees.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"I live nearby, but am always impressed by the immaculate gardens that always seem to in full bloom--both in business and in plants. A must-go for anyone who is in Singapore!!"
,,A lovely calm place close to the city,5.0,,I used the 'Hop on hop off' bus to get here and spent an hour or so wandering around. I only saw a small part as it was rather hot for hiking. The orchid garden was gorgeous. The cafe is a pleasant spot to have a snack or a full meal.
,,Amazing trees!,4.0,,In this small city it is very nice nice to see beautiful gardens as this one. Moreover the fusion with futuristic tress gives the botanical gardens a unique atmosphere.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Whenever in Singapore I must always pay the Botanical Gardens a visit. I usually schedule my visit for a Sunday morning because I love the atmosphere with people walking their dogs and families picnicking.

I ask the taxi driver to drop me off at the Nissam Gate and then I take my time exploring the various pathways until I find myself at the Orchid Garden which I love.

After looking at the orchids I walk towards the Tanglin Gate where I get a taxi to the malls in Orchard Road. I usually have lunch in the food court of one of the malls.

Remember to always wear sunscreen, mosquito repellent, wear a hat and carry water. Also, it goes without saying that comfortable shoes are a must."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Spent a few hours strolling these beautiful and vast gardens. lots of areas of interest to keep you occupied for a nice afternoon.
,,Impressive gardens,5.0,,"This is a big garden, take half a day at least so you don't have to break into anything faster than a saunter, since the humidity is about 230%. Tip - start at the Ochard side so you can get straight on the MRT at the end, bring plenty of water."
,,Superb,5.0,,"Well sign-posted, well maintained, well planned, well patronised it was a great place to go and see Singaporeans relaxing and enjoying the day out. We walked across large parts of the Gardens and learnt things along the way. Well worth checking out if you're a keen gardener or not."
,,For nature lovers!,5.0,,"Take the Circle line MRT to the Garden. There's a small store next to the station, you can buy some snacks :)

The garden is huge! Reserve 3-4 hours. Check out the Evolution Garden, there you can touch (I repeat, touch) petrified wood!

In addition to plants you also get to see wildlife, like squirrels and monitor lizards. Check out the rainforest walk, hang out with 200-yr old tree!"
,,An oasis amongst the hustle and bustle,4.0,,"Stepping into the botanic gardens is like stepping into a different world! Singapore is so built-up and busy, it's a really refreshing change to get away from the noise and stroll around in the peace and quiet. If you go early enough (around 7.00am) you will see locals practicing tai-chi or walking meditation. It's a really relaxing way to spend a couple of hours (and is free!).

Optional things to do once inside:

1. You can pay to visit the National Orchid Garden which is definitely worthwhile as it's extremely colourful with water features, meandering pathways and arbours of flowers.

2. There's a restaurant called Halia near the ginger garden which incorporates ginger into some of the items on the menu - ginger mocktails, desserts etc. It also sells chilli crab spaghetti which is apparently a local delicacy. Prices are mid-range and the food and service are probably 8 out of 10 but the atmosphere on the alfresco garden terrace overlooking the ginger gardens is heavenly! Just to be able to take an hour or two to sit down in the tropical surroundings is a real treat."
,,Nature at its best,4.0,,Amazing ecological balance A forest with in the city with well maintained gardens This is a should visit place in Singapore You can spend a day to cover the entire stretch
,,Large Park with All Kinds of Hidden Gems,5.0,,This is a large park with all kinds of hidden gems as you walk through and just find more and more parts to it. There's a forest portion and bonsai portion and a history of time thing that is kind of cool. I've been in the park over 5 times and seem to notice something new each time. There are free concerts and I went to one which was enjoyable. There are also free tours based upon the schedules posted on the website.
,,A must see attrection of Singapore if you are nature lover,4.0,,"This is the best part of singapore for nature lovers. It open very early 5.00AM & closing time is 12 night. Its entrance is free but if you want to visit Orchid garden there is a ticket of SGD.5/- which you must see as you can see almost each & every type of Orchid here. It is a very big garden so you must need at least minimum 3 hours.

,,so much to do,5.0,,"So it is a gardens so in some ways, nothing special - but there is just so much to do. 

1. From the front entrance it will lead to a koi pond. A little further is a much bigger lake with beautiful swans, ducks and fishes. One can feed the fish if you bring bread. 

2. At the bottom of this area, there is a restaurant called Food For Thought. Right there, there is a small playground suitable for small children. 

3. From the middle entrance, there is the cafe and small water featurs. The visitors centre and shop are also here. It is nice to have a meal here with the pleasures of the graden. 

Walk a little further and there is the symphony stage where sometimes they have concerts etc. 

4. Orchid Garden - which is pretty big and very good. it will require an entrance fee though.  

5. Jacob Ballas Garden - which is for small children 

6. From the back, near the MRT, one can go to another part. Again it has a lake and loads of people come here for pinics with young children etc. 

There are loads of food options if you didn't bring your picnic basket - from Halia, Corner House, Casa Verde, Food for thought and a small food court suitable to go after your morning run. 

The only complaint is that there are too many people in Botanic Gardens so you will never feel alone "
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Overall the Singapore Botanical Gardens is a great place to visit. It is free as long as you don't want to go to the Orchid Garden (which is awesome).

I recommend going early. You will beat the afternoon heat and avoid large tour groups. As a bonus, we watched several large groups doing Tai Chi."
,,Unique,4.0,,"Something so unique that you can only find in Singapore , the idea of its solar use plus beauty makes it unique and must see . Generally Singapore is a county that from west to east is only 45 minutes , so if you're staying there for at least 3 days , for sure you'll automatically be pushed to see there"
,,UNESCO heritage site worth its status,4.0,,"Think Central Park, but smaller. Free entry. Good place for jogging (and boy, do a lot of joggers run here) but could do better with some more drinkable water fountains. Good botany collection and if you have a student ID with you, the orchid garden is only S$1 (regular is S$5). Open at a wee hour and closes pretty late, so it'll do if you're up to spending the whole day outside. Last, it has the symphony lake!"
,,Botanic Gardens' Restaurant,5.0,,The restaurant in the Botanic Gardens is really good value with delicious and interesting food. It is a great place to relax after walking through the gardens and is next to the beautiful orchid garden.
,,Very well maintained,4.0,,Huge garden. One can spend good 6 hours. Very well maintained. One get completely immesed in nature. Start early and spend good time here...
,,Excellent place to visit but go at night when the lights are on,5.0,,If disabled the lifts can take. Long time. The view are stunning and on a Sunday families go for a day out and very friendly
,,The Children's Garden Is Great!,5.0,,"This being our first trip to the gardens, our primary focus was to see the Children's Garden, of which was lots of fun!

With easy access using Public Transport (Botanic Gardens stop in our case), there was an entrance just metres away from the MRT.

We took a picnic lunch and spend the best part of an afternoon making our way to and within the Children's Garden. There is a maze, a basic water play area (so pack swimwear and a towel for the kiddies), various educational plant attractions, a treehouse even!
Within the Children's Garden is toilets and a water fountain so you can top-up your water bottles.

We will be back to explore more of the broader gardens, you need to allow a whole day or a few visits to see everything I feel."
,,Walk and explore away an afternoon,5.0,,"Whilst these gardens are large and pleasant to walk through, there's a couple of specific gardens within that have great stories and information (ie; evolution garden). A great place to walk around and explore."
,,Take a train there limited parking lots,4.0,,Do expect more people there now as it has just been listed as a Unesco site. Parking is expensive and limited there so it's better to take a train there. There are a few restaurants there when you can just relax and have a cup of coffee. Take your time to walk and relax here.
,,Botanic Gardens,4.0,,The gardens are lovely nice to have a picnic. we enjoyed strolling around.This is where the Orchid Gardens are found.
,,This is a beautiful location both day and night.,5.0,,Loved everything. The gardens are spectacular with the temes changing every month. Daytime was great but the night time laser show was the best.
,,Just Keep Walking... and Wondering!,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens. What a lovely place to walk and wonder! Admission is free (there's a small admission fee for the National Orchid Garden though), and one could easily spend a whole day exploring everything that the garden has to offer.

Spread across three core areas, we found the Rainforest, the Swan Lake, the Botany Centre and the Healing Garden particularly interesting. The entire area is impeccably maintained, with helpful signages and interesting information about the exhibits. No wonder this is a UNESCO World Heritage site!

We visited for only a few hours, but wished we could've stayed much longer. And the next time, we probably will... cosidering that the Gardens are open from 5 in the morning until midnight!

The only caveat - if it's hot and sunny, make sure to wear comfortable summer clothes, carry drinking water, and pack an umbrella ... cause there's lots and lots (and lots more) of walking involved. :)"
,,Singapore fantastic Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Amazing gardens, where everything is done to make you feel cool. Plants and trees all around create a fantastic peaceful situation. You can walk for hours and be at ease. Sometimes a musical group or band or dancers welcomes you around the corner. Great place"
,,Out of This World Orchids,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are absolutely stunning especially the orchid garden, so many different species it's a joy to behold! Entrance is free and the orchid garden costs 1 dollar for older people. It's very large and is advisable to wear a hat or carry a sun umbrella."
,,Love the Botanical Gardens,5.0,,It is hot walking around the gardens so take water with you. It is a great sport for relaxing under a tree on one of the many benches or seeing brides being photographed
,,Great display of Singapore's gardens and Orchids.,5.0,,"A lovely place to visit and would have been better if we could spend more time there. Majority of the Garden is free to enter and wander around, with only the National Orchid centre charging a fee for entry."
,,Green,3.0,,I love it.... Botanic Garden... Nice Orchid Garden... Many kinds of orchids which you can see...orchid in the tropical country.... And there is cool room which shows orchids in the mountains where has cool temperature....But the Swan Lake is not very special... I saw only 2 swan...
,,A UNESCO World Heritage Site,5.0,,We are so glad that this garden is being listed as a world heritage site. This is where we grew up playing hide and seek and feeding the swans when we were young. This is also where we take long morning or evening walks during the holidays. This is a MUST VISIT site for all visitors to Singapore.
,,My first time will have a second time!,5.0,,"Went for a walk, alone so I took that opportunity to take photos of every part of the garden. Just be aware that baby iguanas and squirrels are around - don't mess with them, they're harmless."
,,One of the most decent garden,4.0,,Garden is very neat and clean also there is lot of varieties of tree which are actually well maintained.good for new couples going for first time
,,Great for a walk,4.0,,"Great place to have a walk around during the day or in the evening. I remember the time I visited it was still free, not sure if it's still free now.

If you're interested in these kinds of places definitely visit the Gardens by the Bay as well! Big garden behind the Marina Bay Complex with Avatar shaped trees, pretty amazing stuff."
,,Beautiful and well maintained,5.0,,"Huge park with all kinds of different sections, including one that takes you from the beginning of plant life on earth until now. There is a huge section just for orchids, and a greenhouse that has a variety of carnivorous plants!"
,,Peaceful & pretty...but hot,4.0,,"We visited this garden on a hot afternoon in June 2015. As we entered, we were surprised to find very little crowds and a quiet, peaceful environment, something very uncommon of a major attraction in Singapore. Though it was the perfect environment for quiet exploration, the hot afternoon sun meant shade and air-
conditioning was more desired than anything else. The gardens are very massive: the notable National Orchid Garden, which in itself may take an hour or two to explore, is only a small area in the Gardens. Other areas of the Gardens we visited included a fruit & nut garden (which was dismal compared the rest of the place), multiple lakes, and a rainforest area. There were still many other parts of the park we did not visit: it was simply way too hot to manage seeing everything.

One thing I noticed as we passed through the rainforest area was the lack of information on the many unique plant specimens throughout the park. Most trees would be labeled with nothing more than its Latin and common name, without any information signs that would explain important traits or the history of the species. (More on this later.)

The National Orchid Garden, arguably the main draw of the Botanic Gardens, has a small entry fee (S$5), but is definitely worth it. A wide variety of orchids can be seen, including a miniature yellow variety, unusually shaped orchids, and new orchid varieties created in honor of celebrities and dignitaries. For a garden that seems to emphasize botanic research through orchid breeding programs and research projects (parts of the Gardens were closed off for ""research purposes""), there was lack of scientific information regarding the orchids especially (for example: What unique adaptations has it made to survive in the wild? Is it endangered? What is its native range? etc.). For someone that likes to look at details, it hard to appreciate the National Orchid Garden as any more than just a pretty-looking landscaped area. As a side note: other than a kids' play area in a corner of the park, the park's design and general ""vibe"" probably wouldn't make it a very interesting place for young children.

Many would think that the placing of an MRT station called ""Botanic Gardens"" makes it easier to access by public transit. However, the ""Botanic Gardens"" MRT station is actually at a side entrance of the park, not the main entrance. It is at least a 1km walk to reach the National Orchid Garden and the main visitor center. Do prepare accordingly if you wish to travel in midday, as air-conditioned areas are scarce in this outdoor park. Overall, it is a very pretty garden with little crowds (a real gem in bustling Singapore), but may not satisfy the need for detailed information about the specimens on display. Go early if you can to avoid midday heat, and budget the whole day for the Gardens if you want to see everything."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"The botanic gardens are worth a trip. They provide a soothing break from the city. They are huge, so allow a few hours to explore them or plan to go more than once. I only saw part of them but found the orchid garden gorgeous."
,,"Beautiful, well landscaped gardens",5.0,,This was my second visit to the Gardens. The entire park is beautifully landscaped and a great selection of flowers throughout. Add it to you list of things to see in Singapore.
,,Exciting for tourists from Central Europe,5.0,,Whenever somebody from our country is travelling to Singapore I will recommend him or her Singapore Botanic Garden together with National Orchid Garden as the point number 1 to visit and see. I was there three time and sure to go there again.
,,Love Love Love..,5.0,,I adore this place..it is truly magical. Great for a power walk or just a stroll around. Also do a fantastic brunch on Sunday!
,,Excelent place for late evening,5.0,,"It has reworded ""world heritage site"" status last week. one of the oldest botanical gardens in asia. Little crowded in the daylight hours, but early mornings and late evenings are less crowded and very pleasing location for leisurely stroll."
,,Beautiful place to visit,4.0,,It is rather grand. There are many attractions but I rather just walk around. Not all the paths are shaded so bring something to protect you against the sun. It is not near an MRT but accessible by bus.
,,You could spend hours here.,4.0,,"I visited the gardens with my 10 year old daughter whose tolerance for walking through gardens and dealing with heat is not great. I did manage to get 2 hours out of her, but think I could have spent the whole day here on my own as I saw only a fraction of the magnificent gardens.
Well worth the effort, but make sure you have walking shoes, plenty of water and maybe plan a lunch break at one of the restaurants or cafes if you plan to spend more than a couple of hours."
,,Just beautiful,4.0,,Make sure you visit these gardens. The orchid show is spectacular. It's an easy walk around and the restaurant has the best food
,,Visit at night,5.0,,"What a beautiful place at night. I didn't see it during the day, but it was magical at night. Lots of lights, there's also a show they do here. Best place to be is on the floor, lay down and look up. Free entrance."
,,Global Nature Adventure within Two hours!,5.0,,"Definitely worth the visit. It is smartly build up and walk you through in different ecosystems, a must see for families with kids!"
,,Nice but...,3.0,,"Nice garden but could find nothing special from other gardens I've visited, be prepared for plenty of walking (up and down) in 35 degree heat, take plenty of water, look out for the lizards in the bushes (added attraction) take a good camera with macro, some beautiful little flowers here and there"
,,stunning,5.0,,wonderful day and actually so impressed Easy to find and wished we had more time to enjoy this amazing atmosphere
,,Best in the world & truly deserves UNESCO award,5.0,,"Brought my family to relax, rejunevate, enjoy & build family bonding here. Have visited many botanic gardens but this is the best & truly deserves the UNESCO award. Congrats to the management & all who grew this place to such an awesome haven. Been to gardens in NYC, Minneapolis, LA, Las Vegas, San Diego, Orlando, Titusville, Perth, Bunbury, Albany, Pemberton, Brisbane, Tamborine Mountain, Gold Coast, Currumbin, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Ballarat, Castlemaine, Philip Island, Frankston, Dandenong, Werribee, Colac, Bendigo, Shepparton, Auckland, Whengerei, Kati-Kati, Tauranga, Rotorua, Christchurch, Dunedin, Te Anau, Queenstown, Cromwell, KL, Penang, Manila, Bagio, Bangkok, Tokyo, Sapporo, Taipei, Taichung, Hualien, Nantou, Kaoshiong, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shenzhen, Rome, Naples, Florence, Pisa, Assisi, Perugia, Milan, etc yet Singapore Botanic Gardens stood out the best."
,,Beautiful Oasis,4.0,,"Only the heat in Singapore keeps me from giving it 5 stars, but the Botanic Gardens is so beautiful that a trip there will surely lighten your mood!"
,,Wonderful Color parade,4.0,,Allow yourself enough time to consume the beauty and colors of these wonderful gardens and especially the Evolution Garden detailing the stories of yester year to today.
,,An oasis but go early,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are beautiful and quiet. There are several different areas with different plant groups, such as rainforest, healing, evolution and Orchid garden. We were there at lunchtime and it wasn't crowded but it was starting to get quite warm after an hour of walking. There are plenty of cafes to purchase a drink or sit in the cool and refresh. The gardens are free entry but the Orchid Garden is $5 entry for tourists. Best tip is to have an early breakfast and start the day with a tranquil walk. You'll love it."
,,Green & colourful,5.0,,"Definitely a great place to stroll if you enjoy greens. There are ponds and lots of trees, well shaded. There is a orchid nursery. Occasionally, there will be live music performance. She has definitely earned the name of being a UNESCO site."
,,Singapore UNESCO world heritage sites,4.0,,"A Singapore UNESCO world heritage sites, a nice place to spend your weekend exploring or having a picnic in the garden."
,,Orchids abound,5.0,,What a wonderful garden . Full of history and the most beautiful orchids you will ever see. It is truly an oasis in a bustling city!
,,biking,5.0,,it always reminds me this BOTANIC garden in singapore.cool and fresh air ..very accommodating people and friendly
,,Singapore - Paradise on Earth,5.0,,"WOW! An outstanding city/state/country to visit.

Fascinating place to visit. Moderate climate. Nearby amusement parks, museums, interesting places to visit. I could have enjoyed spending at least a few weeks."
,,Good way to spend a morning in Singapore,4.0,,"If you have some time in Singapore, I certainly recommend wandering through the Botanic Gardens. If you are interested in plants, it's a must, but even if you aren't, there are a lot of great things to see and things to learn. Singapore is hot, so I'd recommend going early in the day. Also plan on spending a minimum of an hour or an hour and a half. There is also plenty of trails, so plan on doing a bit of walking."
,,Had a lovely day,5.0,,"I loved walking in primary forest and loved the orchid garden very well worth the cost.
You can escape the noise and bustle of the city and have a peaceful day - just take water and wear comfortable shoes because there is lots of walking
Recomended"
,,Great free escape from the city,5.0,,"There is not a lot of greenery around Singapore, so this is lovey free tranquil getaway. While there is not a lot of flowering plants in July this is a 'not to be missed' venue especially for families. Great for a picnic. Surprisingly the humidity is higher along the 'jungle' paths, so the cool house is a good reprieve."
,,A Singaporean treasure - beautiful and well worth a visit,4.0,,"Beautiful gardens, well worth a stroll through. A credit to Singapore. The kids found it a bit boring but it was an extra warm day."
,,The most beautiful garden of Singapore to cherish,5.0,,"This landmark of Singapore Is the most beautiful garden I have seen . The sheer scale , the landscaping, the vision of the planners are seen to be believe . Do not miss this experience . Best time is morning - gets hot as the day passes . The awesome old trees and the maintenance will leave wishing to Cosmo back . Not for the ones who gave constraint for time .go there with good pair of walking shoes ."
,,wrong time to go because less flowers that usual,3.0,,"Visited the Botanic Gardens last week in June and having visited last year, knew what an amazing place it could be and was disappointed. It seemed as if most of the flower displays were ""inbetween"" their establishments. In the Mist garden there were scores of labels but no actual flowers... and this labelling and ""empty displays"" were seen through out the orchid display.
The cost of admissions is minimal, and it was still lovely (if you have not seen it in its glory) but sadly ,,, it was truly lacking when we visited, I felt quite disappointed for my guest who was looking forward to a wonderful visit to the gardens but it in turn was just a hot walk with little wow factor."
,,Humid in the afternoon,3.0,,You should visit this site in the morning when the sun hasn't yet been so up and cause so much humidity. It was hard to walk around to reach point inside the Gardens.
,,good day wondering in a tropical garden in the midst of metropolis,4.0,,"a good day wondering around the park some really nice manicured garden displays and waterfalls good little cafe at the entrance the orchard garden has a small fee, around five bucks it is worth the money if your a lover of orchards every variety you can think of"
,,Walk with Nature,5.0,,"In the heart of the bustling City, Botanic Garden comes as a Refreshing switch.
Well conceptualised, very well maintained and Providing all Tourist facilities, it is spread over an Extensive stretch - a calm and peaceful zone for Naturalist.

,,Lovely calm in a busy city and free,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a wondrous sight. The gardens are a sight to behold in all their beauty and so spacious. Signage is excellent and a very pleasing experience just wandering from section to section. However, as there is not much cover take a sunhat and umbrella in case of sudden showers."
,,Singapore knows beauty,5.0,,Singapore is such a clean city and their gardens compliment that even more. A beautiful place to explore.
,,Green Paradise :),5.0,,"If you love plants, parks and gardens (any kind of natural beauty), then this is the place for you.

Best part? They have a beautiful event venue available for hire :)"
,,So pretty and lush!,5.0,,"This was one of the best botanic gardens I've been to.. it was so lush and green everywhere, I loved it! They also have two restaurants throughout your walk so you can stop and get some food or something to drink on the way. Best of all, its free admission! I highly recommend to everyone to check it out!"
,,A bit of calm in the chaos of Singapore,5.0,,The hustle and bustle of the streets can be overwhelming and this was a very welcome break to relax and slow down a bit.
,,Singapore's first World heritage site!!!!,5.0,,"You can call her a close relative of the famous Kew Gardens, and any ardent fan of flora and fauna will immediately fall in love with Singapores's Botanic Gardens so close to the heart of town and a quiet oasis to soothe your soul.
Congratulations Singapore on your recent award from UNESCO!!
Make time to visit if you can and relax on a mat and picnic basket in the Palm Valley garden after you've taken a leisurely stroll through the garden.Gingers are my weakness, so I have a huge fondness for their ginger garden, don't miss that or the famous Orchids section too. oo the cafe at the main entrance offers some nice bites too."
,,World renowned,5.0,,"A wonderful way to spend a day,even for us blokes.The ammount of detail that has been put into these gardens has to be seen to believed.From the glorious orchids to the highest man made waterfall ,every where you went was another breathtaking scene."
,,A pleasant walkabout,4.0,,"As with any gardens, there is a bit of walking. We enjoyed seeing both the gardens and the people. The plants are, as is to be expected, mainly tropical."
,,A Great Treat for Eco-Tourists and Botanic Garden Enthusiasts!,5.0,,"If this isn’t the best Botanical Gardens in the world, it must come very close to being it. We got here easily as it was a stop on the Hop on Hop Off Bus and the bulk of the gardens is free of cost to enter. Only the National Orchid Gardens inside has a nominal entrance fee of $5 SGD. The Botanical Gardens has an excellent array of flora and fauna for visitors to see. The gardens are immaculately clean and lots of staff is on hand to trimming, watering and maintaining throughout the day. We spent around four hours here, so you get an idea of how good of an experience it was. If you get hungry there are restaurants and cafes as well as welI as a convenience store. I will allow the numerous pictures I’ve attached to this review do the talking. Now it’s up to you to go visit this amazing attraction!"
,,World class Unesco Heritage Site.,5.0,,"One of the greatest Botanical Gardens in the world. Much loved and used by Singaporeans and visitors alike.
The flora and fauna is amazing and every turn produces a wonderful surprise. The gardens are huge and set to get bigger.
Well done Singapore in maintaining and augmenting this World treasure.
Simply a joy."
,,Amazing Garden,4.0,,"We enjoy visiting botanical gardens wherever we travel, to get a feel of the local flora and to just relax amongst nature, sometimes right in the heart of a metropolis. This garden is no exception, beautifully serene with many spots to sit and contemplate the wonder of nature. If you are in Singapore, highly recommend you allow yourself several hours to wander through this well established garden."
,,Zen in the City,5.0,,"A huge garden within the city, a place to enjoy nature even in a busy area. A must see place to be with the city."
,,A great place to spend a day in Singapore,5.0,,"A lovely huge garden, with a wide range of ecological niches on display, many well laid out paths, pleasant and reasonably priced cafes. I spent the whole day there and found it most enjoyable."
,,One of the best attractions,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. Really enjoyed my time there. It's quite big there... walking from one end to another in a brisk pace is around 30 minutes. So plan ahead. Great place for walks, exercising, and fam/frds picnic as well!"
,,"Why yes, I do feel like prancing about and breaking into a musical number.",5.0,,"Living in Singapore, you know that life moves at breakneck speed and yet, one of our best kept secrets (technically no longer with UNESCO's recent declaration) is this sizeable patch of green situated in one of the prime areas of real estate. If, like me you grew up running amok in the gardens followed by an anxious parent whilst the civilised orchestra played for free in the background on many a Sunday then the botanical gardens will always hold sentimental value.

However for the tourist who is visiting Singapore, I would say this. Experience this place. Forget the shopping malls and that high altitude swimming pool that tends to have alot of buff people, this place is more than just a botanist's wet dream. Stroll through the leafy canopies, marvel at the variety of plants you cannot pronounce, imagine yourself having musical numbers with the birds and squirrels in an emerald oasis. Companions are optional to enjoy this place, it is its own living being.

If you don't mind crowds, Sunday is the day to pop by. Almost every Sunday the Botanical Gardens will host some form of free (yes FREE!) concert be it western/chinese orchestra, ballet or opera in the late afternoon. As the sky turns dusky and humidity hits that sweet spot find yourself surrounded by locals and visitors alike, serenaded gently by strands of music under shadow of swaying trees. A glass of champagne and picnic basket highly recommended.

For those of us who are of alabaster skin, remember that sunblock or enormous hat unless you'd like to come out well done and crispy."
,,great spot,5.0,,most beautiful botanical garden i've ever seen although there wasn't a lot in flower. i spent 4 hours just wondering around and relax.
,,a lovely oasis,5.0,,On the route of the hop on hop off bus. Do get off here its brilliant. Everything just seems to grow so well in the climate.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,One of the beautiful gardens I have ever visited. Especially - the fragrance garden smelled really awesome in the evening. Rainforest Walk was amazing.
,,Great place to spend the day with family,5.0,,"With variety of plants and animals, Botanic Garden is worth staying with your friends and family to have a good picnic."
,,Best Singapore Attraction,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens is one of the most under appreciated attractions of Singapore. It's Singapore answers to Central Park, or Kew Gardens. There is something for everyone, kids, teens, grownups. It's also a good educational garden for children looking for a natural paradise right in the middle of Singapore.

The gardens are best enjoyed in a full day picnic or family outing. For those in the rush, just the Orchid Gardens is joy."
,,Just average park,2.0,,"There is nothing special of tourist interest there, just average park. U can cross it in 15 mins. There are places to eat as anywhere in SG"
,,Beautiful Nature,5.0,,"A great place for family and friends to spend the weekend. Find a spot in the grass field and start your picnic, listen to birds chirping! Walk down the path and find unique plants and trees planted in this huge garden."
,,Go before dawn,5.0,,"It's a time which takes you back to the early days of S'pore. The looming trees and the wafts of fragrance from foliage, lonely footpaths, quiet water features all add to a tropical paradise right in the city."
,,The most beautiful gardens I've visited so far,4.0,,"Our family 5 of us visited Botanic Gardens last day we were in Singapore. I was so pleased we didn't miss it thanks to my friend Sunshine's recommendation. We visited many gardens, including the one in big island in Hawaii, but none of them as beautiful and huge as the one in Singapore. Singapore does live up to the reputation for ""Gardens' Country"". The gardens are free to visit, but you have to pay to visit Orchids Gardens, please do, you would regret not going inside of Orchids Gardens. Each of us my parents, my husband, my niece and I enjoyed our time, and enjoyed all variety of plants. LOVED there! Thank you Sunshine!"
,,Wonderful place to escape the city,5.0,,"The gardens are very beautiful, and much larger than I expected. I recommend giving yourself plenty of time to explore and perhaps go during the early evening so you can catch the lights show as you leave - it's definitely worth watching!"
,,An oasis in the middle of concrete jungle,4.0,,"If you are in singapore and getting a bit bored with the concrete jungle around the main shopping and business districts, drop by the botanical gardens.

It's been around since I was a kid and that was a longggggg time ago. It houses a huge variety of plants and orchids and flowers. Good for people with green aspirations to see what plants the tropics have to offer in a nice and secure environment.

Recently awarded as a unesco world heritage site which is a great achievement for the garden."
,,Walk in the park on steriods.,5.0,,Every turn presented a vista where you had to take a picture. Even on a rainy day the place was beautiful.
,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,"The smell and beauty of every color and type of orchid is growing in this wonderful place. The fresh spray of water is a nice respite from the hot and humid Singaporean afternoon. The gift shop has wonderful orchid earrings, special collector coins, silk scarves, books, etc."
,,Magnificient,5.0,,"Once you enter this place, you forget that you are in the center of one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the world. Such a welcome relief from everything concrete and steel! So well laid out and has some great places to hang out, eat and burn some calories after!"
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"This is an ideal place to come and relax in the beautiful surroundings, allowing you to escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore. There are extensive walks and plenty of trees, shrubs and flowers to admire. It is a popular venue, especially at weekends, but there is plenty of room to escape the crowds."
,,UNESCO World Heritage and Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"You can fully enjoy the walking trip in the garden and explore the fruit tree, nature, birds and various flowers. You do need to bring water while you explore the whole garden and you will not have enough time to see them all in one day. It is the experience you need to do while in Singapore."
,,A must see,5.0,,One of the most magnificent gardens of the world. Was awarded the Unesco World Heritage label between 2 of our visits. Hosts one of the worlds largest orchid collections.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A truly lovely place to wander around for a few hours enjoying the peace and tranquility not far from the hustle and bustle of downtown. From local families enjoying some R & R, to the orchid garden, to the 4 foot long monitor lizards wandering out of the bushes, the whole gardens are a delight. Highly recommended."
,,Amazing amount of plants,4.0,,"Beautiful place, incredible scenery, carefully keeped, lots of different plants, very nice to visit."
,,Singapore Botanic Gardens,3.0,,"Visit Botanic Gardens Singapore, seeing all differant plants, trees, from around the world,
very good set up and displays from around the world, also the excellant waterfall setup display was very well done, mist and cloud display was very well done just like the real thing, good afternoon visit, lots of people also visiting at the same time.
The light inthe evening very well done."
,,Stunning flora and fauna,4.0,,"So much too see, so allow plenty of time. Well worth paying to get into orchid garden, but much to see in rest of garden too. Fantastic ginger collection and great insect life."
,,Large and organized,4.0,,"The botanical gardens are quite large, and very carefully laid out. Nothing really looks wild, which is a shame, but it is a very nice park"
,,Give it time!!,5.0,,Do not plan to rush through the garden. Half day is min. The stage (in the middle of the pond) keeps having some shows every now and then so do find out if there is any on the day you are visiting. Its nice to sit on the grass n listen to relaxed music or performance in open.
,,Great displays.,5.0,,"Fascinating displays , a huge array of planting . The orchid exhibition is one of the best I've seen . Beats Kew Gdns in that respect hands down ."
,,Nice day trip location,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are really worth seeing, if you can muster long walks in the humid climate. It is a nice place to explore or simply chill out, or take the family on a weekend there. Lots to see and explore - especially for the little ones."
,,"Big Gardens, mazing place",4.0,,Fabulous place to visit with many different garden places to visit. Allow all day. Lots of food outlets at reasonable costs. Go well prepared with drinks as it can get quite warm. We got there on mass transit train that took us to the door. Highly recommended to families too.
,,Beautiful place to walk and breathe the fresh air and njoy the tranquility,5.0,,"Cool and shady atmosphere and much to look around if you like nature. Perhaps they can conduct more nature related courses for the public. Can educate the characteristics of trees, plants and how to nurture them"
,,Beautiful and Unique Experience,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, then you should 100% come check out the gardens. They are beautiful and wont take much time out of your day. The Gardens by the Bay are also another option if you are going to only choose one garden to visit. The Botanic gardens may be less touristy than the GArdens by the Bay"
,,Very nice park,5.0,,"This park serves all your expectations about the park should be. Overlay of soft grass like the widest green carpet, clean and tranquil atmosphere, and of course very nice view.
Visit this park to spend quality time with your family, hang out with friends, take a snapshot, or even solo to find inspiration."
,,So big!,4.0,,"The gardens were a perfect place to wander on a hot day. They were so massive however I didn't know where to begin. They have a wide vairety of plant life, my favourite area was the walk through rainforest, it completely takes you away from the fact that you are in a big city. I saw a huge lizzard and a squirrel (exciting as we don't have those in New Zealand!)."
,,A Family Day in the Botanical Garden,4.0,,One of the most well-maintained botanical gardens. Scenic. The ponds and swans are just beautiful add ons to the historical garden. Suitable for families with young kids. I've a 5-year old boy and he enjoyed himself skating on his skate scooter. Open space gives him the freedom to roam. You get to learn more about nature as a family too!
,,Quick Visit on a coach highlights tour,4.0,,"Well worth a visit. You can get there on the hop on hop off bus. Aim to go there again on next visit, but be warned it's hot around the middle of the day!"
,,most beutifull places...,5.0,,I really love this places..everything's looks perfect..very clean..and this is the best places to take selfie..

,,Lovely place for kids to spend quality time and explore a new world!,4.0,,"Placed iam in a city of gardens,like Lalbagh ,cubbon park,I had a great time in exploring this garden and wondered how a place can influence the young minds when they visit these greenery places.if it can induce pleasure of different scale to senior citizen like me,it would certainly provide great feelings for young minds,I strongly believe.visit to this garden is highly recommended for family visitor"
,,You Must Visit.,5.0,,"We didn't get time to explore as much of these gardens as we would have liked, but what we did see was amazing. Lots of places to eat and an amazing range of plants. The Orchids are beautiful and the toilets have gardens in the washroom!! Take plenty of water with you because it is very hot."
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,Loved this place - beautiful flower display - magnificent waterfall and structures around gardens. A lovely way to spend an afternoon.
,,Well worthy of its new UNESCO World Heritage status,5.0,,"We took the MRT to its closest point to the Gardens then boarded a bus which took us to within a short walking distance, which was both cheap and easy but alternatively, you could get a taxi from the city or grab one outside the MRT stop as there were plenty waiting.

The Gardens are free to enter with the exception of the National Orchid Collection (reviewed separately) which has an entrance fee but which is not excessive by any means and is very well worth it.

The Gardens are beautifully maintained, with wonderful planting arrangements showing the plants off to their best advantage, each one carefully labelled with its botanical information, and routes through it are clearly marked out. It is a very tranquil place, despite the sound of city traffic in the distance, and there are plenty of shady spots to hide from the sun and wide-open, grassy spaces where children can run around. It is obviously a very popular place for outings for these reasons. Must-sees are The National Orchid Collection, The Ginger Garden and Swan Lake but there are many pretty vistas around you.

Practically, there are cafes, restaurants, kiosks from which to purchase food, drinks and ice-creams etc, a gift shop for souvenirs and plenty of toilet facilities.

You could easily spend a lovely day here or just pop in for a respite from the heat and for a bit of calm. Hard to believe that around 15 minutes walk via the Tanglin Gate is Orchard Road!"
,,a piece of paradise,5.0,,"Beautiful well-maintained gardens. A must visit if you need a place to relax and just entertain your senses with a lot of pretty stuff. This place is also great for prenup pictorial, photowalk, picnic, travel-&-learn for the kids and young-at-heart."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Incredibly, beautiful place to be. Very clean, well looked after garden, a must see in the wonderful country"
,,Beautiful orchid garden,5.0,,"Wonderful botanic garden, very well maintained. The must is the orchid garden. I have never seen so many beautiful orchids at one place."
,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Needless to say, having been away from my birth country for many years, makes me appreciate our lovely botanical garden even more. I miss the beautiful orchids, the lovely butterflies and insects visiting them, the array of colors and delicate petals with wonderful fragrance surrounding you. They have since added many guided tours for all visitors and they will have another section called 'The Learning Forest' which will be completed by 2016. We're hoping to be back for a long holiday by then. I do miss the beautiful setting where they have many cafes/restaurants to dine in the garden itself. There's a lovely cafe in the spices garden near the 'zinger' plants. I can imagine smelling the fragrance whilst dining there. The entry is free of charge (except for the Orchid Garden) where you can take long walks or jog along the numerous trails. It's truly intoxicating indeed!"
,,A must!,5.0,,"Stunning scenery, with an incredible array of flora and fauna. So relaxing for a stroll, especially given that it's in the middle of such a hectic city. No wonder it's been accorded UNESCO World Heritage status."
,,I couldn't believe just how gorgeous these gardens are,5.0,,"There are so many aspects to this garden to explore. Take your time. Skip the shops and go. From the museum with the history of the gardens, to the rain-forest walk and the lovely lake with ducks and turtles, and green lawns. The most spectacular part of the gardens was the Orchid Garden with a huge range of the exquisite, delicate flowers."
,,A frist in Singapiore,5.0,,"Is a good place of visit for natural lover. The Botanic Gardens as won the UNESCO in the last few days, as many Singaporean as put alot of effort in it, so if you are in singapore give it a try and spand some time with family"
,,Impressive,5.0,,"An excellent garden. Lots of different areas and as we went on a Sunday lots of families enjoying the space. it allows pets and there is also a lot of birds, lizards and squirrels. Great rainforest walk. Didn't see all of the garden as its huge and it was seriously hot."
,,Wonderful spot to wander around,5.0,,Well maintained gardens with lots of interesting things to see. Well worth a visit. But wear walking shoes - the gardens are expansive!
,,UNESCO site for a reason. Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,I had a day off from work and thought I'd have a walk up to the newly appointed UNESCO Wold heritage site and I was not disappointed. Some of the most beautiful gardens I've seen. What a beautiful place in the heart of the city. Well worth a visit to spend a few hours leisurely walking the park. Stunning
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The gardens are very beautiful especially the orchard gardens. We visited here in June and it was very humid and uncomfortable walking around but none the less it was well worth the discomfort. Take plenty of cold water with you. You can easily spend the day hete.
,,Truly amazing. Possibly the nicest national garden in the tropics,5.0,,"I recommend a good pair of walking shoes, and wet weather gear if you come during the monsoon. Else its best to come between the dry season and the wet season...."
,,Long stopover? Transit through the Botanical Gardens!,5.0,,"I had a 9.00am breakfast appointment at the Cafe Verde and the taxi guy dropped off at the wrong gate. Having just got off an international flight and presuming I will be late I swallowed my curses! But then walked through the gardens and the tall trees, the smell of dry leaves that were moistened by the overnight rain, the smell of wet soil really brought back all the energy. Watching all the folks exercising, tai-chiing, walking and running made the morning all the more lively.
Loved every minute of the hour that I spent there."
,,UNESCO’s World Heritage Site,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens is the first and only tropical botanic garden on the UNESCO’s World Heritage List!
It is also the only botanic garden in the world that opens from 5am to 12 midnight every single day of the year, and does not charge an admission fee, except for the National Orchid Garden.
Bring your kids to Jacob Ballas Gardens & watch the sun set into the greenery.
An oasis for urban souls."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"The orchid garden in Singapore impressed us by its beauty and richness. In such a climate!!!! I am in love with Singapore, its perfect order, its cleanliness. This garden is an important place to be visited."
,,Singapore’s First UNESCO World Heritage Site.,5.0,,"On 11th August 2014, I posted a rather detailed review of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, and I mentioned then that the Gardens were being considered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. See: http://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r221009962-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html
This review is an update to say that today, 4th July 2015, Singapore has been awarded this status! The 3rd Botanic Gardens to be listed in the world after Kew Gardens, (England) and Padua Gardens,(Italy).
I was at the gardens after a downpour this morning, and despite of the inclement weather, there were scores of local visitors and tourists! The Gardens are currently at it’s best condition I have ever seen and I do go there pretty often to take photographs of the flowers. Noticeably, there are many more plants and trees that have been labelled. More flowers too. The pathways are immaculately clean and well kept, the sweepers very visible at their job. Sign boards are clearly posted up, and although it’s a hive of activity in certain sections, there are still many areas where one can enjoy quiet time, be undisturbed and bath in the tranquility of the lush manicured greenery and the tropical jungle just 15 minutes walk from the top end of Orchard Road.
Opened from 5 am till 12 midnight, there has been over 4 million visitors a year, the most visited gardens in the world. Since 2013, it’s been Asia’s top park online travel site in TripAdvisor. The Gardens continue to be a regional centre for plant science, research and conservation in S.E Asia. with it’s 40,000 rare books and journals library and a herbarium collection of 750,000 plant specimens. Visitors will be interested in the National Orchid Garden, with it’s 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids showcasing the largest orchid display in the world. Themed gardens include: Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden; Healing Garden; Fragrant Plants Garden; Foliage Garden; Ginger garden; Evolution Garden, Herb & Spices Garden; and many more.
As Singapore’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, it’s definitely a must see destination if you’re in Singapore. The Gardens are wheel chair friendly. No smoking is allowed, and with more than half a dozen food and beverage outlets you won’t go hungry! Besides many places to sit, there are four strategically positioned toilets. No WiFi.
If you do visit the Gardens, here’s some tips for a comfortable visit: Get the Free Visitors Map from counters at the entrances; wear proper light attire to keep cool; watch your hydration and take a bottle of drinking water with you; an umbrella, hats, and proper walking shoes; your camera with batteries that are charged; and if you want to do it all in one go, you’ll need four to five hours, although it’s best to do the Gardens in stages."
,,Time away from busyness,5.0,,"We didn't get around the whole place, but beautiful and a great walk again from all the shops and people."
,,Garden wonderland,5.0,,"We did the gardens late afternoon, early evening. They have a section on plants from Australia which we found interesting as we recognised everyone of them. The waterfall was fantastic and as you wound higher on the walkway, the views became really lovely. Once it got dark and the lights came on, it was a picturesque wonderland, great for all ages."
,,Beautiful gardens!,4.0,,Beautiful and well thought out gardens. If you're into beautiful gardens you definitely don't want to miss this.
,,"Wow !, the Beauty & Serenity ..... Singapore Botanic G. Worth a look !",4.0,,"I was quite taken aback by yhe sheer beauty and serenity, laze a weeeeee while, rrrrrrr Take yer Ease, and pinder the Universe ...... The Flowers and Shrubs, Trees, are terrific, this Garden is very ell cared - weel presented / laid out, explore at your leisue with that special someone ! ( and Kids too, offffff all ages )"
,,Pure beauty,5.0,,We have visited the gardens after dark when the light and musical show in giant trees has started. It was magnificent. Like from another world. The entry is free (the only paid is entrance to giant greenhouses) and is totally worth it to visit the place.
,,Botanic gardens,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful gardens, with lots of plants flowers and shrubs, certainly not to be missed, this is a great day out for all ages, there's plenty to see."
,,Best park in Singapore,5.0,,"Expanse of lush green in the middle of the city. Despite of the equatorial heat, this is a perfect place for strolling around, picnic, and have a serenity in this busy place."
,,"Recommended destination for any visitor interested in gardens, history and culture",5.0,,"This is an extensive and historic Botanic Gardens and a recommended destination for any visitor interested in gardens, history and culture. Interpretation and collections are first class."
,,Interesting Place,5.0,,"Its a good place for nature lovers and students, you will find out excellent flowers and tress species in this park."
,,Garden of Eden.,5.0,,"While I was walking with my date we came upon a wedding couple taking pictures, they asked us to take a few with their camera and they looked good from every angle. There is no bad areas to take pictures from in this place. Not being a very good photographer I did not snap any photos but if I had I would have spent the whole of the day in swan lake.

Plan on a few hours here and to bring a camera, this place is just too beautiful to tell, go and see for yourself.

Towards the end of my stay it started to rain, this is a Singapore style rain so everything got wet fast. One of the staff members picked us up in a cart and drove us to our parking spot.

They were very friendly and most helpful."
,,Great place to walking around on weekends,4.0,,This place is huge. I and my hubby spent 4.5 hrs to walk around and enjoyed a scenery. A lot of shade made its not too hot. We got a good exercise and lungs cleaning in this place :)
,,Even more beautiful than when I first visited,5.0,,"Like Singapore itself, the Botanic Gardens are just stunning. Always blooming & everything green & lush & putting on its best face just for you, so don't miss a relaxing visit to this truly beautiful spot."
,,Well worth the effort.,5.0,,"This was our second visit to Singapore and we both wanted to go back to the Botanic Gardens. This time we walked the perimeter and followed the map. What a good idea, why didn't we think of that the first time? The perimeter walk takes you past some of the swankier 'burbs of the city state, and the houses are impressive. Inside the gardens are various themed sections. We walked the lot. Well worth the effort."
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"We enjoyed this place despite not being huge plant lovers or expert botanists ourselves. It had a less artificial feel to it than the gardens by the bay. It was less strikingly impressive than the gardens by the bay but that came with the added bonus of having less selfie stick-waving tourists to battle with. It is a very pretty and serene location with a lot of interesting history and you could easily lose a half day in there - we had a really enjoyable afternoon wandering around and making the most of the chilled out atmosphere.

We were disappointed we ate before we arrived as while we were there, the restaurant was selling picnic lunches to take around the park, which would have made the day even better!"
,,Great place to find peace and serenity,4.0,,Great place for a easy getaway from city life.There is also a great dining area hidden within the garden.The service and food is good value for money.
,,Very big place,5.0,,"This is a place that you need to give some hours to visit. It is a very large place, beautiful and is very hot. I have been there in evening time and it was a nice place to visit."

,,Serene place,5.0,,A very pleasant and cool place to be and enjoy all the different species of fauna from around the world also a cool place to just sit and enjoy the greenery
,,Beautiful place to relax,5.0,,"I enjoyed these botanic gardens.
They are perfectly maintained, clear signage and beautiful. I loved the art work among the plants.
There are a lot of runners who use the botanical gardens and lots of family's too.
The gift shop is also very nice, but a lot of the items have real flowers and so on, so I couldn't get those to send back home to nz (bio security) .
But I enjoyed my time, and don't have a bad thing to say."
,,Lush,4.0,,These Botanic Gardens are beautiful. The orchids are amazingly colourful and exquisite! The lawns are so lovely and green and a great place for a picnic.
,,A stroll through the Botanic Gardens Sunday 21st June 2015,5.0,,"It is always nice to walk through the botanic gardens. This particular Sunday a very sunny and hot day was even better. There was a swing band doing their sound checks for a concert later that day. We listened to their rehearsal and sound check for about an hour, excellent. We even came back to the actual concert at 6.00 pm and joined hundreds of others listening to their very polished act."
,,Amazing place to visit,5.0,,"I am not really into gardens and butterflies, but after seeing everything this place has to offer I was in sheer amazement the entire time. It rained for three days straight so we ended up going here and so glad we did."
,,This is a restful oasis worth visiting,5.0,,This was just lovely if you like greenery. After a couple of busy days in Singapore this was a great respite. The hop bus goes there and it is worth taking a couple of hours to enjoy.
,,A pleasant way to spend an afternoon,5.0,,"Lovely to wander round at your leisure, can be very hot so lots off sunscreen even if cloudy. Could do with a few cooling down spots! And of course it's free!"
,,Just beautiful !,5.0,,"All I can say about this garden is ""beautiful & mesmerizing"". This garden has such a wide variety of flora and fauna that you can stop watching. You will find a lot of people here jogging, exercising, doing yoga, enjoying a picnic with nature. This garden is huge so be prepared to walk a lot. Do wear good walking shoes and comfortable clothing, take a cap. You can easily spend more than half a day here. Carry water bottles and umbrella for sure, you never know when it starts raining in Singapore! The garden is very well kept. Highly recommended for couples with kids."
,,The original garden in the Garden City,4.0,,The Halia near the ginger garden has a nice al fresco dining area. The food and service is quite lovely. The staff are really nice.
,,Calling all nature lovers!,5.0,,"For all nature lovers out there. Singapore Botanical Gardens is a treasure trove with many species of plants and flowers......The garden withstood WWII.....It is a place where many have fond memories of.....first kisses, wedding photos, childhood.....the sprawling grounds are great for kids & adults alike to run around, kick some balls or have a nice picnic. There are times when orchestra would perform at park too.....within the botanical gardens is where the orchid garden is located. There one would get to see many rare species and specially cultivate species of orchid named after dignitaries. An attraction worth visiting!"
,,enjoy the children garden,3.0,,Jacob Ballas children garden is a must visit for family with young children. kids have so much fun playing here
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,Much nicer than the Gardens by the Bay and much more relaxed atmosphere. Great place for picnics. Dont see the reasoning to pay to go into the orchid gardens but i guess they have to make you pay somewhere as the gardens are free to walk through.
,,Scootering fun!,5.0,,"Highly recommend heading there with kids on scooters in the early evening from 5.30pm, weather permitting.

At about dusk, the animals 'change shift' and start foraging. Spot chickens around the fruit trees section.

Other birds can be seen around the ponds especially at this time and it's not just the usual swans, mynahs, pigeons and sparrows.

Do note that it is humid throughout the year so denim and long sleeves/pants are a terrible idea. Do in Rome as... Shorts, tank tops and sandals will suffice. Anti-Mosquito patches are available at Watsons and 7-11 stores.

Entrance is free.

Nearest MRT station: Botanic Gardens CC19"

1. It has a vast collection of plants and flowers and the you can clearly see how the developers painstakingly took care of them.
2. The plants are arranged in a systematic manner (medicinal plants are located in one section, they have an evolution garden, the orchids are all in one location, they even have a ginger garden) making it easy for visitors to learn about plants.
3. They have informative exhibits
4. It is a nice place for picnics and jogging

6. Their collection of carnivorous plants is better than the other garden attraction I have been to
7. Restaurants are located inside
8. It is right next to the MRT
9. Entrance is free (Except for the 5 SGD fee for the National Orchid Garden)

In conclusion, this is a place where everyone can go and it won't be boring since there are so many things to see. it took me 6 visits to see most of it."
,,City Oasis,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are very large and have many different sections. Each section has quite a different feel to the others. There is a special garden just for kids, which they love as there is a water feature to play in too. It is nice and calm, although can get very busy especially on Sundays. As it is very large, you should expect a lot of walking and therefore take bottles of water, umbrellas etc. There are some food outlets in the gardens, but they are not dispersed, so better to bring your own snacks."
,,Divine Orchids,5.0,,Absolutely stunning Garden. The orchids must be seen to be believed. You can spend a whole day here and not see everything.
,,Orchid House was cool,4.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed our walk through the Botanic gardens. On a hot day, the water cooled Orchid House was wonderful"

,,Unbelievably clean and organized for a park,5.0,,"Went there in mid-day which was definitely a bad decision. There are quite a few water machines along the way but not much shelters (apart from the trees). Very clean and pleasant walk apart from the heat. Nice place for walking or jogging. And the place is free!

The Garden is accessible via MRT on one of the exits. Unless you are walking back all the way to the MRT station, other options are bus or walking back to Orchard Road."

The climate is such that a leisurely strolling pace is the way to go & I'd love to return to have a really good look -- a couple of days
,,excellent place to go for a walk,4.0,,"The botanical gardens are quite large, and difficult to walk in one go. A lot of local residents come here for their daily walk. As everything around, it is spick and span. A huge collection of all kinds of plants, well laid out on both sides of the multiple walks all over. It is open from 5 am to midnight, and well lit. It is best to visit in early morning or late evenings, so as to avoid the hot and humid part of the day."
,,A Slice of Paradise,5.0,,"There is a wealth of tropical plants to look at and study. There are benches to rest if one gets tired. There are endless yards for children to play in and many little roads to run for the athletic adults. There are dining spaces for when you get hungry. There are even movies and concerts on some weekend evenings.

I love this place! It allows me to connect with nature and appreciate our humanity.

A trip to the Gardens is a must when visiting Singapore."
,,Amazed is d word,5.0,,"Im delighted to visit this place. Its huge n its worth it. The healing garden, evolution garden, bamboo and spices. Orchids etc. There r several lakes.

Its reasonable. Did some shopping at d Orchid garden memento shop."
,,A good walk in the park,4.0,,"Truly deserving to be one of UNESCO's heritage sites. Here you can find a ginger garden, an orchid garden, and a swan lake. A good place to read a nice book, photo walk, and even to have your pre-nuptial photos taken. Periodically, they hold jazz concerts at the symphony lake."
,,A Welcome Break from the Bustle of Singapore,4.0,,"It is a fantastic oasis of natural vegetation, divided into themed sections. It is quite a large site and you can wander at will. I really enjoyed my time there and it is free! It is worth spending time in the Orchid Garden area, although there is a small admission charge for that, but well worth it! Check out my blog for a users view of Singapore: geographypsycho.blogspot.com"
,,Our favourite place,4.0,,We love this place - brought our little dog to run around - people are generally accepting to pets and kids running around - it is a park right. And the kids love to look out for the swans. There is a restaurant to you can try - the BTGH (Bukit timah Guildhouse).
,,Cool spot in hot city,4.0,,Free concerts held often in the park we saw an excellent one with Chinese symphony orchestra. Lots of shaded walks and the orchid house was a highlight cost $6. Catch a taxi there they are quite cheap.
,,Lovely place,5.0,,Nice botanical gardens with lots of rare plants/flowers. Nice visit as part of my tour. I would have enjoyed spending more time as I could easily be there for hours.
,,Fab,5.0,,"Wonderful. Very much a highlight of my trip.it is big so decide what you would like to see. Note, the sun can be strong."
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Fantastic must do in Singapore. These gardens are amazinglly beautiful and the architecture of the buildings and their workings is something to see. Close to the centre of the city, easily accessed. You need at least a half day."
,,"Free, beautiful and amazing!!!!",5.0,,"The gardens outside are free to walk around, the orchid garden is in the botanical gardens and cost extra (worth it in my opinion and I'm not a big plant person).

I would recommend doing these gardens as early as you can get there (they open at 5am) since it is a lot cooler in the morning. We took a taxi and had no problems (no traffic and very little crowds is a bonus too).

I think 3-5 hours will give you adequate time in the park depending how much you are into botany and how fast you walk. We were there for 4 hours and were happy with our experience.

I highly recommend visiting here.

Happy travels!"
,,Love it!,5.0,,"I have been to Botanical Garden Singapore for countless time. But this is the first time I leave some comment.
The first trip was with my close friends. It was amazing experience and a happy Sunday morning. The garden is well maintained and it's full of different flora varieties. People walk their dogs, play with their young children, work out by running, tourists take pictures and we do my favourite - picnic!
It's the best place to do all those activities in Singapore.

There are three entrances with car parks where you can park your car:
1. Evans road (pop Nassim road, from Bukit Timah)
Nearest to the Symphony Orchestra performance stage and some eateries.

2. Cluny Park road (from Botanic Gardens mrt)
Near to quieter area and also flat ground which is suitable for picnic

3. Cluny road (from Napier road)
Near to restaurants eg. Food for Thought.

Even though I have visited for many times but still, there are still a lot more awaiting me to explore this big and beautiful Botanic Gardens!"
,,beautiful gardens,5.0,,"from the moment we arrived i knew this garden would be impressive
from the beautiful manicure landscaped gardens and paths to the art works and sculptures throughout the gardens.
theres a few cafes at various location around the gardens to take a break singapore can get very humid
theres a large lake and a few ponds full of fish and even turtles plus theres a bandstand where concerts are held
a must see when in singapore"
,,A giant breathing space amidst Singapore,4.0,,"The botanical garden is huge given the size of Singapore and has myriad collections. Parts of the garden are divided by vegetation themes such as climbers, medicinal plants, tropical plants, etc. The entire area is super quick to navigate thanks to the well placed direction boards. I went on a warm and muggy day and felt that the garden might have felt very different on a nice, breezy evening. The section on aromatic plants was slightly disappointing as they didn't appear very well maintained. Certain sections of the garden such as the National Orchid Park are excellent. Others are worth a one-time visit especially for visitors from tropical regions who may be familiar with most vegetations. The eatery near the park administration office is beautifully landscaped. However, it is very expensive. Wont be a bad idea to carry drinks and snacks with you. Overall, the botanical gardens was a calm, soothing experience."
,,beautiful,5.0,,the orchid garden is a must see and the lily pond i have never seen anything like it. Only had a short stop over so it was a great place to end our holiday from thailand
,,Huge,4.0,,"I loved the sheer size of the Botanic Gardens, I didn't love getting lost! The signage is a bit confusing, in that there's not quite enough of it. Even a map doesn't prepare you for dead ends. The whole place is well kept & gorgeous."

,,One of the best gardens we have seen,5.0,,"This is a wonderful garden and well worth the visit. We would have liked to have spent more time exploring the wonderful variety of plants on display.

The gardens are kept in perfect condition and are well looked after.

This garden is a good if not better than the Butchart Gardens on Vancouver Island. A must see in Singapore."
,,Nice,5.0,,"TripAdvisor states there are no metro stations nearby. That's incorrect - the Tanglin Gate entrance is a short walk from the Dhoby Ghaut metro station. I chose to walk from Marina Bay via Orchard Rd. It's a 4 mile or so walk - longish, but doable as long as you keep to the shady side of the street. I got to see Singapore university along the way, pass by Orchard Rd. shops, etc.

The park itself is quite nice, esp. the gardens. I spent a few hours walking around. Be sure to visit the Orchid Garden."
,,Enjoy Nature Close to The Heart of the city!,5.0,,"This is a huge nature park that you can enjoy.

It's located just minutes away from central Orchard Road. Also accessible from Bukit Timah Road, you can see beautiful landscaped garden, orchid gardens, lakes and more.

Good to visit in the mornings or evenings when the weather is cooler.

This garden is also up for UNESCO World Heritage site, so it's worthy of a visit.

Recommended!"
,,Spectacular orchid garden,5.0,,"This is one of the highlights of a trip to Singapore and one I always take my guests to visit. The beautifully designed and tended gardens are stuffed full of exotic orchids in great stands of colour; there is also a welcome cool house where you can take a rest and be bathed with showers of misty spray, and shaded areas to admire the more garish varieties. Every time I visit the planting is different so it's always a treat."
,,Best Morning & Evening Exercise Walk Park In Spore,5.0,,"In Spore, the best u can do for your health, well being & detox is to ritually take the effort to walk in the beautiful greenery of Botanic Gardens.

Just Do It & U will Live Better in Living Longer !!!"
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"A must see when you are a nature lover but also when you wanna find a peaceful oasis in the crowded and busy city. A place where you can walk for hours, see many varities of flowers, plants, trees, orchids.. Its a place where you can come to rest and enjoy the beauty of nature. A must when you visit Singapore."
,,The Best I Have Seen,5.0,,We were not sure what to expect but within a short time you could see why people rate it so highly. The orchid collection is amazing and does make you think why we have such a small selection of colours on sale in the UK compared to what you see here. Definitely worth a second visit when we go through Singapore again.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens in Singapore are just amazing. They are free to go in, except for the Orchid House, and are open from early in the morning to late at night. They are massive, so you either need to spend a day or make more than one visit. There is a Ginger Garden, an Eco Garden and an Evolution Garden, all well labelled and with so many different plants. There is a lovely lake, shaded walkways and so much more. I thoroughly recommend these gardens."
,,"""Stunning Gardens""",5.0,,"we took a city tour and we stop there for half hour, but was enough to see the beauty of the garden the orchids so many..

The place is very well provided for with food, toilets and other basic facilities"
,,A wonderful oasis in the city.,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, you must come here!
We walked around for about three hours. It is lovely, and an easy walk also for people with healthproblems, as there are places to sit down and enjoy the view. There is also a restaurant near the Ginger garden, and a cool house in the Orchid garden. Bring water, it gets hot!"
,,Amazing variety of orchids!,5.0,,I wandered around the orchid gardens and found some amazing colours and varieties of the hybrid orchids on display. This will definitely be a place to return often. Arrive early as it gets very hot and stay hydrated.
,,beautiful tropical garden,5.0,,beautiful tropical garden for an afternoon stroll. nice for dog walking too. close to center and one of the biggest hospital in Singapore.
,,Exotic Gardens with real nice lunch,5.0,,"If you really enjoy nature and want to make a change from the shopping area's and malls in Singapore. The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a beautiful place to go. There are many hiking trails and the garden is impeccably maintained. You can take a subway here or a taxi. Parking is very limited. We went on a very hot day and when we got to the gift shop area there is a very nice place to have lunch, made fresh from local Singapore favorites. A great place to go for lunch and be able to walk off the meal in natural beauty. E"
,,Wow,5.0,,Words could never do this place justice. Google it and see the photos. In real life it is sooooo amazing. It puts all other botanical gardens to shame
,,Green oasis,4.0,,"Amazing to find a place like this on a small island of 6 million people! Immaculately maintained and meticulously planned.

Saw some interesting lizards & birds and enjoyed the circuit through the Orchid houses. Was amazed at how little insect life there appeared to be given the array of flowers on display - few butterflies.

Great place for a walk to relax and escape the hustle of the concrete canyons and malls!"
,,Beautiful SQ Botanic Gardens!,5.0,,"Worth a visit for any nature lover. Centrally located, we look the MRT (Botanic Gardens) and then took a taxi to Orchard road. Recommend the Halia Restaurant in the Gardens, its the same chain at Raffles Hotel."

,,A lovely spot to relax or meet a friend for lunch.,4.0,,"A lovely spot to relax or meet a friend for lunch. The gardens are beautiful, although not spectacular. It is not a must-see destination, in my opinion, but a nice break from the city that is relatively close-in to the city center and can be reached in less than 30 minutes."
,,Lovely day out.,5.0,,A nice day out and a lovely walk and an ideal way to start the holiday. Well maintained gardens and plants. Could do with some more seating though.
,,Beautiful plant diversity,5.0,,the orchids and the plants to attract butterflies were awesome.an excellent cheap way to spend time in singapore
,,So beautiful!,5.0,,"This is such a beautiful botanical garden. Great way to also see the locals going about in their usual exercise routine and family time having a picnic etc. Make sure to bring your fully charged camera as you will be snapping away.

Tips and comments: Even through there are so many trees and greenery, it's still very much hot and humid, so dress and pack lightly, wear a sun hat and sun lotion. Bring extra bottles of water or you can alternatively purchase at the available on site shops. There is also a lovely gift or souvenir shop too, so make sure to stop buy on your way out."

We preferred the Botanic Gardens to the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve by far."

For families, it is a Nice place to jog and have a picnic on the green lawn. Once in a while, there's free music concert. There is also a garden within botanic garden (Jacob ballas) for kids. A great place for kids to explore the nature.
For flower lovers, the orchid garden is one of the best with many varieties of orchid species. The lakes are peaceful. Take a walk around them.
You can easily spend 1-2 hours walking inside. Due to the weather in Singapore, do bring your hat/sunblock/umbrella.

There is also a great restaurant near the visitor centre, with all day brunch (but very crowded over the weekend).

I am impressed with the amount of work to preserve the plants and the garden.I hope the Botanic gardens can qualify for the unesco site title. It has a rich history as well."
,,Best attraction in the whole of Singapore IMO,5.0,,Absolutely world class. Every tropical plant you could possibly dream of seeing can be found here (okay I might be exaggerating). But it's a beautiful place. Always make it a point to come here at least once whenever I'm home in Singapore

Some areas are better than others. More could be done to spruce up the bonsai section which had some great specimens. We must have spent four hours in the gardens. Totally recommend them.
,,Beautifully constructed gardens,4.0,,"It was a dull, wet day when we visited the gardens but this was our third trip in 5 years. Each time there is a new development and it's not easy to see all the gardens due to possible heat and humidity. The Orchid Garden is always worth a visit to see the best display of orchids we have seen. There is a entry fee to this area. There are a number of cafés on site but we did not try them.
The Gardens are easily accessible using the excellent MRT system on the CE2 line and has a dedicated stop."

,,Somewhere you can visit for a whole day,5.0,,"We visited the Botanical Garden in the morning of a fairly hot day and arrived by Singapore's MRT (Botanical Garden station). Singapore is best known as a garden city and its botanical garden did not disappoint. There were so many aspects of gardening, flowers, tress, herbs, fragrant plants etc that you can study along the way.

The garden has excellent signposting and it was extremely well maintained. We loved the evolution garden whilst the Mrs. was fond of the herbal garden. Beware of Mosquitos so ladies, please wear long trousers.

Great place to take children to visit and entrance is free. There was a lovely lake in the garden. Locals do go there to take their wedding photos. Even the guard at the main gate was friendly enough to help us to take photographs at the gate for us."
,,Most beautiful gardens,5.0,,Singapore's Botanic Gardens is an excellent landscaped and a comprehensive collection of various species of tropical plants. The walk in the Botanic Garden leads to Singapore's prestigious National University of Singapore. It presents a serene and calm environment and a delight to walk in it.
,,A good place to take some time out in Singapore,4.0,,"We enjoyed several hours wandering around the gardens enjoying the various areas and utilising the large shady trees to keep out of the heat. We found the evolution garden very interesting and thought it would be great for children to explore. We found the Children's Garden, and whilst we would have liked to explore this, there is no access to those not accompanying children - a good safety feature.
There was an area where the roots of the Banyan trees hung down over a canopy - a lovely feature.
After visiting the Orchid Garden, which is magnificent, we had lunch at Halia restaurant which was nearby - food was very nice.
It would be good to attend one of the evening concerts in these lovely gardens."
,,Great day out.,5.0,,"We took the open top bus and saw a great deal of Singapore before arriving at The Gardens.
These Gardens are probably the finest we have ever seen with the mix of tropical rainforest, water features and acres of green space. Everything is so clearly marked that even novice ""gardeners"" will learn so much.
Go and enjoy!"
,,Felt Heaven on Earth....,5.0,,"Beautiful place, felt like heaven. So many varieties of Orchids, God this was the best place I have seen on Earth. Loved every bit of it and People if you are reading this, I am sure you will not regret visiting the Garden, its so beautiful."
,,Sensational Singapore,4.0,,Very pretty and relaxing..easy to walk around and just appreciate the cool and the quiet. We took the bus very inexpensive and accessible.
,,Immaculate gardens,5.0,,"To a non-gardener these gardens are less spectacular than Singapore's other famous gardens down by the bay. However, they are immaculately presented and in any other city would be the top garden attraction. When we visited there were relatively few flowers to see until we reached the orchid garden, which more than compensated with thousands of blooms. This is a very relaxing place to visit and a nice contrast to the rest of the busy city."
,,Another outing,5.0,,"It was a very hot day, but well worth the walk around. And for the $5 charge, the orchid section is a must for any gardener."
,,Peace,5.0,,A beautiful way to start the day with a walk in the gardens. We arrived at 8am and saw the orchid display at 8:30am when it opened. So beautiful. A good option to go early as it was very hot and sunny when we left the gardens at 9:30am
,,"Massive, beautiful and a good walk!",4.0,,Great place to get away from the city life. Its good exercise as the park is massive and does take a bit of walking to experience the place. Vast range of natural beauty. And most of the gardens are free to visit.
,,Nice day trip,4.0,,"Nice if you have time to spare; nice scenic place for a relaxing walk. Contains the Orchid Gardens.

Tip: Will you be bringing children (or an excitable girlfriend :) ... ? In that case, take the Holland Road entrance and bring a loaf of bread. Walk past the ""Do not feed the animals"" signage (like those before you.) Follow the signs to Swan Lake (but, don't feed the swans.) When you get to swan lake, walk along the bank. Fish and turtles will start following you waiting to be fed (and so, apparently, they've seen this hundreds of times before.) Feed them. They'll take it from your hand. Careful ... some of the fish are big :P

If you lean over the water, you can hand-feed a turtle (otherwise, they can't compete with the quicker fish.)"
,,SINGAP[ORE BOTANICAL GARDENS,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical gardens are one of the best in the world. The extensive variety of Plants, Flowers and trees requires almost a full day to do proper justice. Definitely a place worth visiting"
,,Beautiful way to spend the day.,5.0,,This is a beautiful way to relax and spend a leisurely day. These gardens are extremely well kept with much to see and places to relax. It's within the city and easy to get to. With the temperatures in Singapore relatively steady year round it's provides a perfect place for just about all kinds of flowers. The gardens are maintained very well which makes for an enjoyable visit.
,,Excellent Place,5.0,,A great place for a stroll on a sunny or rainy day. Almost everything is free and you can easily spend a good half day walking around the gardens. Try to get away fromthe main attractions to find som peace and quiet.
,,It's all about the orchids.,5.0,,"Go directly to the orchid garden, which is amazing. Sculptures of a swan, where there should be an actual swan, or sculpture of playing children, where children shouldn't be playing, seemed odd and in poor taste."
,,Great Garden! Beautiful flowers!,5.0,,"Just been there, it was amazing! Very well maintain garden! Good tracks for jogging! Friendly staff! Went to the Orchid garden! Wow more than words can say, amazing orchids! Hybrid Orchids! Never seen before! We spent hours there! Highly recommended of you are Orchid lover! Must visit! Thank you"
,,Best Orchid display in the world,5.0,,"We recently visited the Botanic Gardens of Singapore . Fantastic! In order to see the best part you pay €3,50 to see the incredible orchids . The entrance to the Gardens themselves is free . Walking up the little hill we also had a meeting with a huge lizard . When I say huge , it was pretty big!"
,,Explore the park,5.0,,Singapore botanic gardens is very huge! It takes about half day to explore. The view is very beautiful and there are lots of different type of plants.
,,PERFECT PLACE TO ENJOY NATURE,4.0,,"It was a perfect place to enjoy nature after 5 days in the city, It was well maintained and clean as the entire Singapore...amazing fact it was free, except for the Orchard garden (10 S$ each, and they did not accept credit cards, which I thought it was unbelievable).
Make sure to have at least 2/3 hours to walk around and enjoy all the gardens, turtles, swans and more that this beautiful botanic garden can offer."
,,Beautiful natural gardens,5.0,,The gardens are amazing. Well manicured - an oasis in the city. Definitely take the time to see the Orchid Garden ($5 entry) - this was the highlight for me with all the beautiful flowers & archways covered with orchids.
,,As stunning as you would expect...and more,5.0,,"The gardens are as beautiful as you would expect but it is many other things which add to making me want to recommend this experience.

It is easy to move about the gardens, the access is as good as it can be, with smooth paths and although there are some slope, it felt to me that there was a commitment to enabling everyone to enjoy the gardens. There is strong signposting and the staff are keen to help and advise you as you meander about.

I also liked that they offered places where it was noted it would be a good place to take photographs;"" photo spots"". The gardens within the gardens; such as the Ginger Garden, are really lovely and provided extra interest.

This is a truly wonderful place."
,,Great place,4.0,,This place was amazing ! My husband and I spent a wonderful day there - there was so much to see and it was just beyond beautiful
,,Loved this place,5.0,,We spent a few hours here. It was one of the 1st stops on the HOHO bus tour. Loved it. So beautiful. My highlight was feeding the Terrapins. There was so many of them in the lake.
,,Great place to get exercise in a beautiful locations.,4.0,,Its a pretty big botanic garden and houses the orchid garden which is gorgeous. Its worth a visit if you've got some free time and enjoy walking and gardens.
,,Peaceful,5.0,,Great walk around the gardens and some very nice areas to rest. Granddaughter loved the children's areas and had great fun in the water areas. Good family outing that you can take your time wandering around.
,,Dream Garden,5.0,,"The beautiful garden of Singapore is worth a visit. The garden is serene and an ocean of greenery in the midst of a bustling city. We approached from the Orchard MRT and took bus 77 to Tangling Gate. The bus stops at the opposite side of the road. After you get down you see a signal ahead. walk upto the signal and cross the road. We walked down from Tanglin Gate to the National Orchid Garden. On the way you can see the Ginger garden and Swan Lake. Swan lake has a little gazebo where you can pause and sit awhile. There is a statue of a flight of swans in the lake and an island with Palm trees. After passing a marsh garden and Heliconia walk we came to the Orchid Gardens. The Orchid Gardens are full of stunning Orchids in different colours. There are also hybrid orchids. The cool house has epiphytic orchids and the orchidarium grows orchids as they grow in nature. There is a VIP Garden with orchids named after visiting dignitaries. Some gorgeous blooms of white orchids were named after the Princess Diana. In the centre of the park there was a amphitheatre and a visitor center. The nicest part was no one plucked flowers , made noise or littered. What a paradise . This is not commercialised like Gardens by the Bay. Don't miss it."
,,Nature in a lovely location,5.0,,It is a great place to visit with family. The orchid collection is impressive. It is recommended to visit in the morning or late afternoon when it is less hot.
,,"A tremendous attraction, so close to the city.",5.0,,"A must for anyone visiting Singapore. This is a botanical garden par excellence, with many attractions within the building. Both avid gardener and novice will find this well worth the entrance fee. Just go, you will not be disappointed."
,,Nice Place to Visit,5.0,,"For people who really like nature have to visit Botanic Garden.
We can see so many different type of beautiful plants and flowers all around the garden.
It has restaurant as well inside the garden.

This place is best for picnic, relaxing with family. Children would love to play and run around in this garden as this garden is really huge.

Easy to get here, there's MRT underground inside the garden.

People who leave a bad review about this garden is strange people.
Botanical Garden is lovely beautiful place to visit. Amazing garden.
Best place to relaxs.
But of course this place is not for people who come for shopping or drinking.
Is just nature, and is amazing Singapore can have this beautiful garden inside small country."
,,Nice garden with plenty of paved trails,4.0,,"Formerly the best botanical garden that has recently been upstaged by the Marina Bay Gardens. Still, it is a nice walk but the gardens lack the number of plants you can see at MB. It is a good place for an early morning run and the local swans are fun to watch."
,,"Fabulous, could have stayed all day",5.0,,"Allow plenty of time for your visit, these gardens are totally stunning. Take a picnic and spend the whole day there, our time was limited as we were on an organised trip, they had to drag me away!"
,,Spend a day with your picnic basket,4.0,,Visit from 4pm till late evening great for everyone. Its not just about plants and flowers although it just great its breathtaking . Walk n jog if you like and some event to entertain too like music n etc..away from the city noise Check it out!
,,Peace in the middle of the city,5.0,,There was a concert at the sound stage which was an added bonus. Orchid garden an amazing flood of colour. A must for garden lovers.
,,free and relaxing,5.0,,"we had a afternoon picnic to beat the heat. and it was just lovely for it. It was easy to get to, and if you come from the north there is a MRT sation right there. There are a lot of plants, grassy lawns and shady pathways to slowly make your way through. But if you want to see the orchid garden you must pay for it. I am sure it is lovely but we were on trip of the free things to do"
,,Definately worth a visit,5.0,,"A must visit when in Singapore lots of walking its massive and quite lovely, Take your time there are lots of interesting bits of history and well documented"
,,Must do,5.0,,This is a must when in Singapore. You get to see lots of tropical trees and flowers. The gardens are really big and you should avoid when it is too hot and you are not used to the heat. The gardens are free. Orchid gardens inside have a 5 dollar entrance fee and are totally worth it.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,What an amazing place to walk around. We loved this place. So pretty and we were there in December so they had some amazing Christmas decorations around!
,,A wonderful visit,5.0,,These gardens are absolutely amazing Even though it was over 12 months ago we have very happy memories of our visit here The lushness of the gardens are incredible Well worth a visit
,,Beautifully designed,4.0,,It's such a beautiful place away from the hustle and bustle from the crowd. A great place to walk in the shade and see beautiful trees and plants. If you are lucky you get to see tiny squirrels darting in out of the foliage.
,,Great for a walk,5.0,,"The gardens are beautiful and great for either a stroll around or, for the more ambitious, a run or jog. There are lots of different gardens within and it's easy to spot wildlife whilst you're there."
,,No entry fee and still too of the notch!,5.0,,"Absolutely great for a nice walk and talk with your old friends, a picnic or even your jogging runs. Nice places to rest and enjoy mother nature in this equatorial climate. Beautiful plants, flowers and even monitor lizards longer than 1m can be spotted if you are lucky enough. Having seen many parks during the last years in Asia, I believed this to be just another one. Wrong, much better than expected and extremely well maintained. Thumbs up, highly recommended once you are in Singapore and have a few hours spare."
,,My dream garden,5.0,,"This is an amazing garden,, it is filled with all types of plants and tree's I could have spent days just wandering around it,,there were little spots for photo opportunity, it is easy to get there, via bus or taxi. Taxi's are cheap to utilize,,,take plenty of batteries for your camera and make sure the card is empty as you will fill it up very quickly without even thinking,,"
,,Garden of dreams,5.0,,"One of my favourite places on earth! Seriously, this place exudes calmness. The botanic gardens is located centrally and is very well connected through the bus, train and taxis. The entry to the garden is free. AS you start walking you will notice markings on trees about the species and if the tree is old then the age. The garden has many parts, there is a healing garden, a ginger garden, orchid garden very well marked so you can read about the species present there. A trail that leads to a small lake full of little tortoises. Don't miss the orchid garden for which you will have to pay a fees of 5 SGD for kids its 1sgd.
As you walk along you reach an amphitheatre area, where , if you're lucky you can catch some concerts, its a surreal experience. The amphitheatre stage is surrounded by a moat full of giant lilies. There are two restaurants n the gardens Halia, and casa verde. A souvenir shop to satiate the tourist inside you:)
Enjoy, go take a walk....."
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"Quiet, not so crowded so that u can have good time relaxing there. But it could be much better with proper maintenance. In Singapore it is quite difficult to find this sort of quiet place."
,,Place to Visit While in Singapore,4.0,,"I went here in the morning for a morning walk and was impressed with the place. Good place to spend time early in the morning specially in the summers as it gets warmer later during the day. Really well maintained and ideated place, a lot of efforts have been put in to ensure the gardens are well maintained. It covers complete history of the area and the same is captured very well by the authorities. A forest in the middle of the city with all kinds of flowers, plants, trees, etc.
I wasn't able to visit the Orchid Garden as had to get back to work though will definitely make time during my next visit.
One can go each morning as well for morning walks even on working days and places are very close by in Singapore."
,,Fantastic place!,5.0,,"We love SBG so much we always go there on the weekend for morning walks. The place is huge, lots of walking tracks with something for everyone. The boardwalk/rainforest trail is also good. They have nice pools and lawn areas throughout so it's nice for families with kids. Best part is they have toilets at regular intervals and also some eating places for those who need it. Overall, an excellent place."
,,A must-visit,5.0,,"A good place to spend your morning as it gets really hot later in the day. Beautiful tropical gardens that includes The National Orchid Garden. Count on spending 3 - 4 hours here. Stay hydrated, walk leisurely and take in the flora around you. Food and drinks are available inside and there's a small entrance fee.
The Garden has applied for designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site."
,,A treat for the senses.,5.0,,"This was an excellent way to spend a few hours. The diversity of flora, and the way they keep it up is worth the visit. We had a cabbie drive us on a tour of Singapore and these gardens were part of it. The price was very good and the driver certainly knew his way around."
,,Very beautiful and clean,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is very beautiful and there are many kinds of flowers. elegant enviroment, fresh air. It is the leisure good place to have fun."
,,"Always great to visit, and close to good local food",5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens has a variety of mini-attractions that I've always found inviting. There are swans in a lake, a tropical rainforest section, a stage for open-air musical performances, cacti and more. In a space-constrained country like this, it is great to have an extensive area of highly attractive green space that feels tranquil and unhurried.

Nestled in the Botanic Gardens is the National Orchid Garden, which requires a fee for entry. However, it is a charming garden which I highly recommend.

Be warned that if you enter the gardens from the Napier Road-Cluny Road junction, it'll take quite a bit of time and effort (and water consumption?) to get to the Botanic Gardens MRT station at the Cluny Park Road-Bukit Timah Road junction, and vice versa, of course. Across Bukit Timah Road is a rather famous food centre for fairly priced local food (Adam Road Food Centre), though. You don't have to work that hard if you don't want to, but you may want to incorporate the food centre into your itinerary, either as fuel or reward for your legwork."
,,A Must-Visit Place,5.0,,"For anyone visiting Singapore, this place is a must visit. It is a spectacular reserve of an extensive variety of plants and orchids and even has good attractions here and there. There are even food vendors there to make you comfortable. I suggest that going there during evening (around 3:45) and staying there for two hours would make you feel relaxed and calm. At last, you can even buy beautiful and fabulous souvenirs and cards."
,,A perfect place.,5.0,,This has to be the best botanic garden I have ever seen. We went in to the orchid garden and as we are seniors it cost $1. The whole complex is clean well set out and most of all lots of seats and cool areas. Just loved it.
,,Giant !,5.0,,Great place for nature lovers! Its an absolute nature lovers paradise. Best time to visit would be early morning or late noon. Good photography spot with different landscapes that the garden has to offer.
,,an oasis and feast for the eyes,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is one of my most favourite place in the world for the sheer scale of amazing greenery, the landscape and its relaxing nature and beauty. I recommend everyone pays a visit once in a while - it opens every single day of the year from 5 am to midnight."
,,Tropical walk. Suitable for all fitness levels,4.0,,"This is an easy ""walk in the park"" literally but do dress in light and airy attire and appropriate shoes for walking; Sneakers will do.

Singapore botanical gardens is an oasis from the concrete jungle of malls and office building which dominate Singapore's landscape. My family and I love to take occasional walks there in the mornings to soak in the greenery and fresh air.

Walking the grounds is not taxing at all and after which you're able to have a bite or sip at the cafés near the entrance of the gardens.

I would avoid starting my walks from 12pm as it is very hot and humid. Best times imo are early mornings or just before closing."
,,Superb Setting and Experience,5.0,,"Wonderful, vivid experience, that is not to be missed. If you want to see a tropical botanical garden, this us the one for you!"
,,Must see,5.0,,"When friends come to town this is always on our list of attractions to show. It is free and incredible. If above the age of 60 you can visit the Orchid section for $1. You could spend hours here. It is easy to get to by train and has several entrances. Don't miss it if you love plants, trees, flowers, orchids, etc from all over."
,,Leisure or daily exercise routine,5.0,,"It is located at 5 mins drive from Orchard Road, or 1-2 km from Hotel in Orchard area. Very pleasantly design with lush of green and a few cluster of garden. Ginger garden and Orchid garden are among it. Good for a stroll, fresh air, relaxing yourself while blend yourself into the nature. One of my top favorite spot in Singapore. Admission is free. Bring along a basket of food and wine to sit down on the green green class under the tree, you would not even know that you are in the city state Singapore.

Great place to spend an evening."
,,So relaxing,5.0,,"We went on what must have been the most humid day of our stay!

Just to walk through these beautiful and well tended garden is wonderful, so peaceful.

It is quite a walk though and we felt that there could have been a few more benches to relax on at closer intervals, how the elderly manage I do not know.

The aray of flowers and trees are magnificent."
,,Beautiful retreat from the heat!,5.0,,What a beautiful sanctuary from the heat of the city! Loved this place.... So peaceful and well-maintained. We got caught in a huge rain storm but it was still fun and we enjoyed every minute (whilst hiding under a climbing frame!)
,,SuperTrees Rocks!,5.0,,"We went there at night, literally just before we went to the airport and go home. It was our last gig in SG. We didn't get to see all the beautiful plants, and we're just there to just enjoy the lights and sounds of the Super Trees, and I can say this is the best way to end our 9-day stay in Singapore. It's a bit hot, wind barely flowing in the place, but it's definitely a great experience.."
,,Fabulous Orchid Gardens,4.0,,"Hands down, the best part of this place is the Orchid Garden. It has the most beautiful, fabulous plants imaginable.
The rest of the gardens are really nice too, but there are probably better gardens to be seen elsewhere.
The heat can be quite intense, so go prepared."
,,Extremely hot but lovely,4.0,,"Great ambient with lots of vegetation. We travelled to Botanic Garden by MRT from Promenade station. It took us 30 something minutes point to point. The garden located just right outside Botanic Garden station. We arrived at around 1pm which proved to be extremely sunny and hot. The Orchard Garden admission fee is $5 for adult and $1 for senior citizen with age over 60.

Lovely place filled with lots of tourists and locals doing picnic on grass and by the lakes. Lovely."
,,Loved the orchid gardens,5.0,,"Grat park and variety of things to see. Loved the orchids, music was ongoing in the park. Rea.lly nice place to visit"
,,Tropical rainforest within a concrete jungle,5.0,,"Singapore Botanical Garden is a tropical forest with all its diversity within a modern city. This is an wonderful place to spend at least half a day and enjoy in presence of nature. Conveniently located within the city, it is also part of several conducted tours."
,,An Escape from the Urban Jungle,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is by far my favorite place to visit in Singapore , especially if you love trees and plants . Upon entering the gardens you are magically embraced by a magical world of greens . From giants of the rain forests to the exquisite beauty of the orchids in the National Orchid Gardens there is something to entrance every visitor.Not to be missed is the Healing Gardens if you are a believer in God's Pharmacy . The Ginger Garden is another interesting site in the gardens. In short exploring the gardens will leave you totally in love with nature. Expect to leave the gardens reluctantly ."
,,Fantastic Gardens,5.0,,Really beautiful to walk around. Easy to navigate and beautiful flowers all round. Easy to navigate and an oasis of peace in a busy city. Well worth a visit.
,,Peaceful way to spend a day,5.0,,Was a really nice place to spend an afternoon - very peaceful to stroll around the well kept gardens. Everything was immaculately kept.
,,Unesco standard,5.0,,Brillant plants are take very muxh care. Unfortuately to many girl are doing picnic and too many gaming time inthe park too loud they should enjoy the plants seeing and appreciate the cleaniiness around them
,,NATURE'S HARMONY,5.0,,"Revel in nature's splendour.

Plants, ponds, flowers, nurseries.... help you take in the outdoors.

Musical performances on certain days, swans cruising the pond, sculptures in the playground of your mind.... these beckons.

A true taste of tropical nature. A stunning reflection of colonial heritage and contribution. Worth a visit or two.... if the humid open in Singapore could be embraced."
,,Beautiful tranquil gardens,5.0,,"Loved that i was able to just get out and enjoy nature. Weekends it is a little crowded, so i would try to avoid that if possible."
,,worth a visit,5.0,,"pleasure to walk round most enjoyable, gardens very well set out, beautiful array of flowers saw some lovely birds flying about,"
,,Restful and beautiful but still in the city,5.0,,"Such a nice and expansive natural area. Its full of those famous Orchids that Singapore is known for. Well maintained with wide and easy walkways. We found this as a stop on the hop on hop off bus and elected to spend some hours here knowing we could comfortably get back to the hotel on another bus (every 20 min or so). The Gardens has a nice cheap restaurant and plenty of shade to escape the heat and humidity. Hard to believ that something like this is mere minutes away from the hustle and bustle that is Singapore. And like everything else in Singapore it is safe, well lit and well maintained....and its free. Its a must do."
,,Best so far!,4.0,,"I've been to a few botanical gardens around the world, and this is obviously one of the best. So many different parts to it and very well cared for. I noticed some people going there just to run, and it must be so special to live nearby and have this as ""your garden"" rather than just a tourist attraction. Really good time if you go when it's less hot."
,,a place of beauty,4.0,,"A must see if you are visiting Singapore. The orchid garden is stunning. Be prepared to walk a lot as there is so much to see. Make sure you bring an umbrella (for the sun or the rain) and lots of water… Check the programme of activities, you might be lucky and could attend an opera or a concert late in the afternoon.Easy access by the MRT."
,,Great gardens!,5.0,,"Great gardens with lots of interesting information for both plant buffs and history buffs. Great place to explore the natural habitat of Singapore, including a chunk of native rainforest. Admission is free (National Orchid Garden is a separate entrance fee)."

,,excellent garden,5.0,,"though i have visited this place earlier..i still enjoyed going again...what a park..! must for park and nature lovers, .u will get blown away...the way they have maintained the park"
,,Good,4.0,,"OK, I have nothing against gardens. I love gardens! But add in the blazing, humid Singapore heat and thousands of mosquitoes attracted to every inch of your body, it's no fun way to enjoy a garden is it?
It's a beautiful park. There's even an air-conditioned (thank god!) History type building that tell you how the botanical garden came about. But I was more pleased and thankful for the air-con than anything else.

One down side - it need more shaded and sheltered areas around the place. I thought I was gonna die from a heatstroke."
,,A beautiful and peaceful retreat,5.0,,"This is a beautiful retreat away from the bustle of the city. There are lush lawns and foliage, lovely flowers, a lake and many other things to see. There are also restaurants, cafes and other good facilities. It would have been nice to spend more time here"
,,Stunning gardens,5.0,,A visit to the botanic gardens is well worth it. Entry is free and there are numerous themed gardens to visit. You can byo or purchase picnic baskets there.
,,A sea of green in a concrete jungle,4.0,,"I have to say I have visited many Botanical gardens in many places but this is 1 of the best. It's probably enhanced that it's a city that is dominated by skyscrapers and massive building projects.

There is easy access to it on the metro line. The gardens themselves are quite big but divided into different sections so it's not all samey. This includes the orchid gardens which is $5 to see. Everything else is free. When I was there on a big stage in middle of park someone was playing the best of Chopin on a piano. How many botanical gardens do that! It's a cool place to walk around for a few hours

So if you want to escape to somewhere more relaxing without splashing out. Choose here."
,,Tropical Rainforest feeling at its best,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Garden features so many different Plants and areas, you will be able to spend a whole day there and not get bored.

Try the Rain Forrest Walk and the Swan Lake with its Lizards and Monkeys.

Its a nature experience for the whole family. And the best is, its for free!"
,,Nice garden !,4.0,,"Great natural place for relaxing. Best if you want a day for kid's camping, reading, painting or just quiet time."

,,Delightful haven away from the shopping,5.0,,I love the gardens in Singapore. They are a retreat from the hustle and bustle and are completely free. Go along and learn to breathe again slowly. Enjoy watching locals doing everything from hard core workouts to Zumba with a Singaporean flair. The National Orchid Garden is part of the gardens. A gorgeous place to relax and unwind.
,,><,3.0,,"the location is not so far,, we took bus to get there,, its a suitable to take family and go picnic in here,, the orchard garden is beautiful.."
,,Amazing and very originall,4.0,,"Something really rare. Unique and beautiful place with full of plants from different parts of the world. Baobabs made the biggest impression on me. Be careful - wear warm clothes, as it is really freezing in contrast with the Singapore climate."
,,Still the best spot in Singore,5.0,,I have been here many times across the last 30+ years and it remains my favourite place to visit in Singapore. Don't miss the short rainforest walk as head across from the MTR to the fantastic Orchid gardens.

,,gardens,5.0,,The gardens are beautiful and very quite and clean and so many exotic plants to see there is an orchid garden which are very lovely
,,Peaceful haven,5.0,,"This is a peaceful haven in the middle of the city. Even over the weekend when it seems overrun with dogs, picnickers and families, it is possible to find a quiet spot. The gardens are large and there is a lot to cover if you like to soak in the details of the local flora and fauna. A cloudy day is ideal. There are a range of places to eat at. It is a good idea to visit the website and plan out your walk so you know where you are heading."
,,Well-nurtured garden,4.0,,I love this botanical garden! Its so big and carefully managed. We only visited the orchid garden and it was wonderful experience. You need to walk a bit to reach the orchid garden but it paid off once you saw those lovely flowers.
,,Wow Orchids!,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are gorgeous! There are areas which reminded me of Buttes Charmont, Paris, Boboli Gardens, Florence,

Easy to get to/from via either MRT or bus. It's a MUST!"

Surprising amount of wildlife around - Singapore squirrels (plenty in the rainforest section), huge lizards digging in the leaf litter for grubs, large grasshoppers, turtles, fish, swans, songbirds, butterflies..... Just make sure you take time to stand still to look and listen.
Amazing perfumes from the different flowers throughout the gardens.
Frangipani garden delightful with the swinging seats.

When you come out of the station, just before you go through the gates if you look across the little side road you'll see a couple of cafes. We stopped at one for a quick breakfast and found a supermarket tucked in behind it if you need to get water etc. We walked the length of the gardens. The Orchid Garden is worth the $5 entry fee). When we came out on the main road at the other end (Holland Road) we walked along to the left 100 mets or so and caught a bus down Orchard Road."

,,Singapore's Green Lung!,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful parts in Singapore is the pride and joy of Singaporeans -
Singapore Botanic Gardens. Now in the final stages of being included in the prestigious UNESCO World Heritage sites, this garden is one of its kind. Besides a number of old trees and great landscaping, you will find some unusual, historical trees too. One of them was brought down from South America and helped uplift the Malaysian economy - the Rubber tree! It was first planted here and when found to grow successfully, taking well to the environment and soil, Rubber plantations boomed all over the Malaysian peninsula. You will also be able to see another plant, the Sago palm, from which sago ( a sort of substitute for rice) is made.
The most important section is the Orchid section. Here you'll find not only a large variety of orchids in multi-hues, but you'll also be able to mingle with 'celebrities'! Orchids named after dignitaries who visit the country, such as Princess Diana, can be seen here.
Do not miss the Eco Garden which is part of the Education core nor the ponds and lake. Look up the garden's website and see whats on each Sunday...you are bound to find something of interest. One such programme is a musical concert on a stage erected over the lake. This stage is surrounded by undulating land and you can spread a towel or a newspaper on the grass and enjoy the show. The list of fun things at the Garden can go on....discover them yourself and have fun!"

You could spend half a day here walking around, taking photos of the birds and squirrels and statues/art etc, sitting down overlooking a garden or lake etc etc. Lots to see! My favourite part was being able to walk behind the waterfall. Opens from 5am to midnight, check online before your visit as they often have different events/things happening there.
There are some shops to browse in and also eateries.
Take an umbrella with you for sun protection or random storms that pass over."

,,An oasis close to the city,5.0,,"After a $6.50 taxi ride from Orchard Road, we entered the park at the Tanglin gate. With no set plan, we meandered along the paths admiring the tropical plants and massive trees and palms, most of which are identified by labels so small one must step off the path and go right up to the tree to read. There is plenty of shade from the heat of the day and some pretty lakes complete with white swans. The park is much loved by the locals, who use the paths and open areas for exercise. Right in the middle of the park is the orchid garden where we were pleased to find our seniors card was accepted, reducing the price of admission to $3 each. The orchid garden is wonderful beyond words. This is a lovely area, well worth a visit. Visitors should set aside a morning or afternoon to fully appreciate these beautiful gardens."

During my visit, it rained and we had not come prepared with the gears, thus had to wait under the shed for more than 30 minutes. However, after that the walk in the moist garden was even better.
I am happy that I visited Botanical Gardens."
,,Must see Garden,5.0,,Natural and man made trees are growing togatehr Excellent for family evening Must visit in Singapore
,,Must Watch,5.0,,It's must watch for every one... lots of plantations and its great to see the beauty of gardens.. lives up to the mark and excellent to go once.
,,Good place for a jog,5.0,,Good place for a jog in the early morning hours when the air is crisp and fresh. Not very far from the hotel district of Orchard Road
,,A sunday afternoon at the park,4.0,,Sitting by the lake and watching the swans and the turtles is soooo zen. One can sit by the lake and just do people watching who are having picnics with their families and friends. You wouldnt notice how time flies.
,,Go to the Orchid Garden.,4.0,,Before the day heats up come here early in the morning and experience the beautiful plants and statues that are dotted around and about. Make sure you get into the Orchid Garden. This will cost you but its a nominal fee and so worth it. The orchids are stunning. Either take the MRT or a bus. Easy to get to and worth the journet.
,,Great orchid exhibit,4.0,,"The basic entry is free, but there is a fee to visit the orchid exhibit. It's a great place to some rare orchids and a chance for some great photographs."
,,Good outing for the family,4.0,,The gardens are large and good for a family outing with picnic on the lawns. Kids can play. Jacaob Ballas childrens is a must for kids.
,,Put at the top of your list in Singapore.,5.0,,"These were fantastic! Plan to spend at least half a day as there is much to see. They sell food onsite, but it might even be a good idea to picnic if you can manage it (get something from a nearby hawker center)."
,,Peaceful retreat,4.0,,You can get lost in the peace and tranquility of these gardens. Great way to spend a couple of hours out of the singapore heat. Wandering and viewing spectacular plants and orchids.
,,"Go for the Garden, Stay for the Food",3.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are certainly beautiful, and you could spend days looking at each and every immaculate area. My personal favorites were the medicinal garden and, of course, the National Orchid Garden.

Better than the gardens, though, were the options for food. Outside the main entrance is a hawker center selling amazing pork and rice dishes. Inside, near the ginger garden, are a few restaurants specializing in higher end faire. Either way, you'll be treated to a lovely day with lovely food."
,,A must when in the area,5.0,,"These botanicals gardens offer something for everyone. The Orchids are exquisite , and such a variety of colours . The gardens are well sign posted - there are paths with clear directions indicating where to see each type of flower and fauna. Easy to walk around , superb views from locations again it is well sign posted for best photo shoots etc.As with any attraction try and arrive early to avoid the queues for entrance but the area is so large you don't really get crowds all gathering in the same areas. The hop on and hop off bus will take you there .. There are places to buy drinks etc but a useful bottle of water comes in handy at times. Have a great day out ."
,,Bigger than you've expected!,3.0,,"Yup, It's bigger than you've expected! You may access the Botanic Gardens by using Circle Line. Please bring a lot of water (and foods if you wanna have picnic over there) and wear appropriate shoes. Nice & relaxing! Even burger taste so good at the butterfly park entrance."
,,Budget plenty of time,4.0,,The botanic gardens are beautiful for any nature lover but be advised it covers a very large area and at least 3 hours should be dedicated to viewing. Also be mindful of the temperature as we were there on a very hot day and it got to be tiresome.
,,Singapore Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"Very beautiful. The flowers and the overall design made it easy to navigate. When we were there they had a traveling Disney show which was pretty neat. The weather was warm, but the place well kept and the grounds amazing."
,,Beautiful - immaculate presentation,5.0,,"We spent hours wondering around, sitting, relaxing and enjoying the sites, sounds and smells of the Botanical Gardens. We live in Darwin so our climate is very similar to Singapore. The plants and growing conditional, rainfall, monsoon etc all relevant to both locations. Singapore Botanical Gardens kill Darwin's gardens. Ours are not a patch on Singapore. We do not seem to have the vision or design on show in Singapore. My favorite - the Orchid and Ginger gardens. The use of water features adds a cooling, calm feel to the area, the path ways and natural rain forest as the back drop would have you think you are in the middle of nowhere instead of the middle of busy Singapore. If you like nature, plants, gardens or just want to chill out in a beautiful location make sure you visit the gardens."
,,amazing and tranquil,5.0,,"nice wide garden paths, just about every different kind of plant you can think of in the garden, beautiful views everywhere you look"
,,Peaceful,5.0,,Tranquil nice and relaxing. Easily reached by 'hop on/off' bus but go in the morning as you may find that you would like more time there.
,,Flora Flora everywhere !,4.0,,Spent a short time here as part of a bus tour of the city. Dont think I have ever taken so many photographs in such a short period of time. I can see why there are dedicated photo opportunity spots dotted around teh place ! The plant life is stunning and there is so much to see even the highlights could only be covered in a day. The Orchid garden is amazing. The liitle Gift shop is also worth a visit and not a total rip off which is fairly unusual. Just regret not having more time to spend there. The truly amazing thing is we didn't see a single gardener in the time we were there and given the horrendous amount of work it must take to keep the place looking so good that is a minor miracle. Inspirational and relaxing.
,,Too hot to enjoy,3.0,,It was so hot that it was difficult to walk around and enjoy the garden. The gift shop was very dissapointing and the restaurant was way to expensive
,,Amazing gardens,5.0,,"I'm generally not a garden person, but this was worth an afternoon while in Singapore. Flowers and plants from all over the world - who knew that Singapore first introduced Hawaii to the orchid plant!"
,,Great If you want a getaway from the city,4.0,,"This gardens are beautiful, with a huge variety of plants, the climate of Singapore make it perfect to have a lot of exotic plants.
Is relaxing and something different, If you want a getaway from the city, I will definitely come here but If you come for a couple of days, I wouldn't recommend it."
,,Peace and Quiet,4.0,,"Loved layout of the place, never felt like I was travelling to far and was a delight to take in flora."
,,"Free of charge, wear comfortable shoes and allow enough time to enjoy the magnificent Gardens!",5.0,,"Visited the Botanic Gardens twice during our visit to Singapore. The first time was with the hop-on-hop-off bus, unfortunately we did not have sufficient time to visit the Orchid Garden and returned a second time. Entrance to the botanical gardens are free of charge. The Orchid garden has an entry fee of S$5.00 per person with seniors S$1.00 per person. The gardens are magnificent, beautifully maintained with clear signs and distances to each section.

There are two (2) shops – one at the entrance and one at the Orchid garden. The shop at the entrance is larger with a large selection of items (books, tea, mugs, jewellery etc). Postcards is S$1, mugs with Botanic Gardens emblem S$8.90 and magnets around S$5. The restaurant at the entrance has a large menu with different options – we enjoyed fresh apple juice S$5, soda S$2.50 and pizza on the expensive side but very tasty (S$25).

We used a taxi with our second visit – S$15 per way from Katong area (Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy). The gardens are large, wear comfortable shoes and allow enough time to enjoy the gardens in full!"
,,A Shangri-La amidst a bustling city..,5.0,,"A sense of peace & tranquility surround this beautiful big garden.

Amidst the busyness & rush in this vibrant city, one can actually take an amazing break here without going out of the way. This garden is about 15-20 minutes walk to nearby Orchard Road.

Relax and enjoy nature in an unpolluted & tranquil environment.

Many come here for their daily exercises, take their dogs for a walk or couples & families just spending beautiful time together.

Over the years, we have enjoyed this beautiful garden in many ways. And continues to do so.

As weather here is hot & humid, and there is alot of walking in this big garden - wear cooling casual clothings like T shirts & Bermudas.
Put on a cap or hat & wear a sunglass.

If you love unspoilt & beautiful nature , come to this Shangri-La."
,,Very peaceful,2.0,,In my opinion this place is so peaceful and I really don't like it. The garden is so big. Ok for nature lovers. Not must go place for me. After all everybody has his/her own opinion.
,,Walk in the Park,5.0,,"This is a truly magical place. Beautifully maintained with such a variety of landscapes and plant life - from bonsai trees to sections of rain-forest, a fernery and a ginger garden.

It is wheel chair friendly and has many places to sit and enjoy the view including a number of places serving refreshments.

Do not miss this when visiting Singapore. You'd be daft not to visit regularly if you are a local......."
,,The Orchid Garden is a must for $5,5.0,,"Just beautiful gardens and close to the shopping on Orchard Road. The Orchid Garden was absolutely gorgeous, and even our ""non gardening"" friend loved it. The grounds are huge so make sure you spend at least half a day there."
,,Nice garden to get away from it all.,4.0,,Easy to get to by MRT. Large garden with several themed areas. Saw wonderful orchid displays. We were there right after the Lunar New Year and saw some creative festive displays. The place is kept clean and very natural. Wear comfy shoes!
,,Misty Garden,4.0,,"We went with the tour bus and then had to walk a lot to reach to the Orchid garden. Once we were inside, I think we forgot that we are in the world with pollution. Well maintained and labeled. Enjoy every bite of the time we were there."
,,Great Gardens and Tons to See,4.0,,"This was a great way to spend a few hours. Singapore exists at such a nice climate that the Botanic Gardens are perfect - part exotic and par traditional. There were a bunch of wedding photos being taken, which just demonstrates its natural beauty.

I only gave it 4 stars because of how awesome the Orchid Garden is in comparison. I would definitely try to do both!"
,,Get away from the hustle and bustle,4.0,,"One can only do so much sightseeing and visit so many tourist traps before the mind and body just need a place to unwind. The botanical gardens is a great place to do this with relaxing walks among various vegetation, open grassy areas, and a magnificent orchid garden. Best to go early morning or in the evening to avoid the heat and humidity."
,,An absolute delight.,5.0,,"A completely free attraction, and well worth a visit. We go to Singapore fairly frequently, and enjoy the accessibility of the Botanic Gardens. Plenty to explore, and a delight around every corner. A tranquil haven in the centre of a city - completely peaceful."
,,A tranquil haven in a busy city,4.0,,"This is a really lovely spot. Easy to get to on the efficient underground system with the gates right next door to the station. It's all beautiful but do try and walk through the rain forest. In there we saw astonishing trees and shrubs and beautiful birds (including the most beautiful humming birds), chipmunks and an enormous lizard"
,,Something completely different,5.0,,"If you want to be somewhere completely different. Relaxing your mind , feeling peaceful then this is the right place."
,,Happy Runner,4.0,,"A beautiful place to run or walk and enjoy the plethora of plant species cultivated here. There are a few hills to keep you on your toes and lots of winding paths through the park to keep you mentally acute. Exercise during the day in Singapore can melt anyone, but the park offers many shaded running paths, toilet and water fountains can be found near the Orchid Garden in the middle of the park. It is also away from the street noise and vehicle exhaust making it ever more pleasant for us. Enjoy!"
,,A Lovely Way to Spend the Afternoon,5.0,,"We spent three hours walking the grounds and were taken with the many varieties of unusual plants and flowers that were displayed in various settings. We enjoyed the many photo stops that were provided all over the grounds. The Orchid Garden was a highlight, with its spectacular displays of orchid varieties to numerous to count. It was certainly an orchid lovers dream! We were burning pixels left and right taking beautiful photos!

We highly recommend a visit to these amazing gardens!"
,,Quiet spot in the middle of a busy city,4.0,,Free admission though charges apply in certain sections. On bus route. Interesting & well looked after. Plenty of seats.
,,what a place to visit,5.0,,"possibly the best thing in Singapore and u can easily spend a day here. there is so much to see here and its a great treat for the eyes. so wonderfully planned and more so right in the heart of city ,,, nest to orchard road. a must visit and fascinating for all age groups"
,,Haven in the city!,5.0,,"We visited twice we enjoyed walking around so much. What beautifully maintained and cared for gardens in the middle of the city. We felt very safe at night walking around too! The trees and gardens are quite spectacular with ponds with lots of pond life including carp and turtles!
We'd definitely recommend a visit if you're in Singapore."
,,"Great place for a ""walk in the park""in commercialised Singapore.",5.0,,"This place should be on anyones list that gets tired of the shopping malls and fakes of Singapore's commercial district. This place is truly a great escape, don't miss it."
,,half a day at least.,4.0,,For anyone who loves plants trees and nature its a must. A little on the Eden project style in the U.K. but much bigger.
,,Fantastic Garden,5.0,,"This park is free and vast. You can spend a long time walking i here and enjoying nature. Great for kids and photographers, too."
,,Such a beautiful place,5.0,,"We walked through the Botanical Garden for a couple of hours and it is very well laid out with adequate seating and plenty of beautiful trees, shrubs and flowers."
,,Takeaway,4.0,,"Danish for a morning tea snack whilst walking in the orchid garden. Excellent: warm, fresh, flavorsome. Prompt service"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"The Gardens are stunning! My favorite was the Orchid Garden with so many amazing types of this flower. General admission is free, but the entrance to the Orchid Garden is $5- worth paying. Make sure you have suntan cream and umbrella with you at all the time!"
,,stunning,5.0,,"absolutely beautiful attraction. the trees and flowers are just amazing. do not miss out out on seeing the dome, highly recommended. the restaurants are reasonably prized and the food is very good. there are plenty of seats around the area to rest. please stay until its dark and watch the trees come to ""life"", beautiful colours and music. really enchanting. make time to enjoy."
,,very nice flowers,4.0,,we were on our excursion to visit the gardens but it was far to little time we spend there. You must take time to see the gardens
,,Great walk through beautiful gardens,5.0,,We travelled on the MRT to get to the gardens.The walk to the Orchid Garden is just over a mile from the entrance at the MRT stop Botanic Gardens.The birds and colours are fantastic here.A coffee or lunch stop is worthwhile just outside the Orchid Garden.Take a bottle of water on your walk although there are a few places to purchase drinks.The Botanic Gardens are not busy but if you plan to pay to see the Orchid Garden it is best before 10.30 before the bus tours
,,the place to go for flower lovers,4.0,,"We went there for acclimatization on the first day in Singapore. Lovely to walk in the middle of lush green trees, plants and beautiful orchids. They even have an exhibition which shows the the top orchid breeding's. As tradition they breed new and unique orchids in order to dedicate them to prominent visitors. Its funny to see the German Chancellor orchid just to give you an example out of many :)"
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"I jumped off the SIA HOHO tour to make a detour to the gardens and was glad for the hour or so I spent here. I headed straight for the orchid garden, and even though there was a small fee for admission it was all worth it. Beautiful!"
,,"Well worth a visit, but don't trust the map!",4.0,,"We spent a lovely afternoon here Using the MRT to get there was really easy but don't believe the maps 100% when you get there - use common sense too. The finger signposts are roughly right direction wise but when you have followed three and they all have the same distance written on, you know there's a problem! The paths are designed to weave in and out of the vegetation so it's really easy to get a little lot. But unless you are in a hurry, it doesn't matter! You will get to where you intended eventually! We ate at the food court which was ok. A series of small franchises under one roof but not brilliant.

We'd go to the gardens again ++ loads to see, but probably eat ejsewhere."
,,Great for a peaceful walk,5.0,,"If you like flowers and beautiful plants, you will love it. Spent quite a few hours just walking around - well worth the visit."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"The botanic gardens are far larger than I expected, so wear sunsccreanm comfortable shoes and take a bottle of water. The garden appears nothing special when you 1st arrive, but as you delve deeper in, explore the rainforest and then the orchid gardens, it truly is wonderful"
,,Peaceful and a great place to exercise,5.0,,"Great place to exercise and have some fresh air. It's amazing that this densely populated island still had open green space. If you are lucky, you might be able to see a monitor lizard and other animals."
,,A nice chillout spot,3.0,,"The botanic gardens are divided into 5 sections (if im not mistaken). You may enter every section without a fee except for the Orchid Park (admission fee of $5). There's a huge park upon entry from Tanglin Gate where you may chill around, do some light outdoor activities and even have picnic there (bring your own mat). There's also the swan lake where you can see swan (of course) and tortoise and koi fishes. You may bring some bread ti feed the tortoise and fishes. As you walk further down, there's the Orchid Park (for those orchid lover). There's also a green house in the park. I didn't manage to go around the whole garden as it's big It took us slightly more than 2 hours to cover the park, swan lake, orchid park and the green house. Overall i think it's a pleasant experience there. There's also a cafe there if you're feeling tired and hungry."
,,Lovely to stroll through the gardens & have meals too,4.0,,"Sundays are crowded and if you want peace and quiet, don't go on Sundays. I like that there 3 restaurants, 2 mid and 1 expensive restaurant. Orchid Garden is my favourite. There's also bonzai and cactus areas."
,,Fragrant Stroll,5.0,,This garden is beautifully laid out and has gorgeous flowers and paths. It is situated on a huge pice of land right in the city. Wonderful place to visit.
,,Lovely gardens..pleasant to visit..great cafe!,5.0,,"Very beautiful botanics in Singapore. Lots to see and very pleasant surroundings here. Really good cafe too, with very nice food!"
,,I think this is the best of the best,5.0,,I think this is the best gardens in Singapore. Things hear that we don't see at home. The gift shop is quite cheap to take something home if you like your memories
,,"Great place for walking, enjoyment and relation",5.0,,What I like was these great gardens keep me walking and it bring up my exploring instinct to looking around and enjoying the essence of nature. The thing was in contrast being artificial I never feel it doesn't have the soul of nature.
,,What a gem!,5.0,,Spend a good part of the day exploring all the gardens had to offer. Also found some nice restaurants with realistic prices. Loved the sculptures scattered throughout the gardens
,,Don't miss these gardens,5.0,,These are beautiful and relaxing gardens which together with the orchids and butterflies make for a good half day visit. Don't miss it.
,,Open all hours,4.0,,"Open really early in the morning - ideal for a morning jog, run or in may case...walk!!! An oasis in a busy city."
,,Great place for a free visit,5.0,,Lovely gardens to walk around - well worth taking the time to visit. So glad we took the time to go.
,,"Pleasant, not extraordinary",4.0,,"A good few hours spent walking through this greenspace. Busy with walkers, runners and their dogs.Basically what one would expect at a Botanic garden though special mention should be made of the Orchid zone and hence the 4 star rating from me."
,,One of the most beautiful places in Singapore!,5.0,,"I visited the Singapore Botanic Gardens during my second visit to Singapore and I wished I had discovered this fantastic place earlier. In my opinion, this is one of the most beautiful places in Singapore. It is peaceful, quiet and you don't have to pay an entrance fee (except for the Orchid Garden which is a must to visit!). Singapore Botanic Gardens is a perfect escape from the buzz of the modern city, there are not too many people as well. The perfect place to just wander around and admire nature's beauty. I highly recommend Halia, the restaurant inside the Orchid Garden. Although the prices are a bit higher, the food is absolutely amazing!"
,,A great cheap activity,5.0,,Loved the orchid area and watching the squirrels play in the trees. Saw water dragons too. A lovely change from the city and crowds.
,,Gardens as you imagine,5.0,,Lovely quiet place in the city. Gardens are gorgeous. Try and come in the morning when it is cooler. You could visit every day for a year and not see it all
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,We spent a couple of hours here and really enjoyed it. The flowers are lovely and there are some spectacular displays. I especially enjoyed the cloud garden and the tropical gardens. The orchids are fantastic.
,,Lovely!,5.0,,Lovely day out. I think it would be especially great for families as its a beautiful and also educational place. Something that Singapore needs as its so built up so perfect to get away from the hussle and bustle of this great place.
,,Lovely Spot for a Morning Walk,5.0,,"Walked through the Botanic Gardens as we were on our way to the National Orchid Garden. Just beautiful, very cool and lush. Plenty of open space where people were doing various exercises or running, whilst others like us just took in the scenery."
,,Amazing Botanical Gardens,5.0,,This is the third time I have visited the Singappre Botanical Gardens and each time I have loved the experience. The National Orchid Garden is spectacular . You need at least 3 hours to see the gardens properly.
,,Beautiful manicured garden,5.0,,I used to run there at night when I lived in Singapore. At night beware of mosquitoes so bring your repellant. A variety of incredible plants and trees. You are in the garden of Eden and yet in the middle of the city. They have a couple of great restaurants as well inside.
,,Lovely and peaceful place to be,5.0,,Plenty of space to wander with the orchid garden a little walk from the main pathways. Halia restaurant a highlight.
,,Heaven on Earth,5.0,,"In the glamour and glitz (and expense) of Singapore, the Gardens are a fantastic way to unwind and connect with the rich abundance of tropical plant life. There is nothing bad to say here.. the park is kept in immaculate condition, the design allows for multiple uses and the fact that it lies on the MRT line makes this a winner! We liked it so much that we decided to live next to it when we relocate there :)"
,,Lovely change of pace,4.0,,"Good tea room during a shower! Very peaceful midweek. The Orchid Garden is fabulous. Pretty lake, then we had to run for it (downpour! thunder! lightening! very exciting)"
,,Very beautiful and peaceful.,4.0,,"Came here during the morning and it was well worth it, stunning gardens which you can get lost in for ages. Lovely lakes and waterfalls and any different types of flowers and plants for you to admire. I could have spent all day wandering around but there was so much others stuff to see in our short time in Singapore. Best of all it was free."
,,Just Magnificent,5.0,,"There is just so much to do and so many things to see, take a day to see this great Botanical Gardens. Most special are the most monstrous indoor features, amazing"
,,Good Park,3.0,,Good one but still need to equip various flowers and statues/monuments. Overall it's a nice place to stroll and having a picnic.
,,Don't Miss,5.0,,We only scratched the surface here but it is really beautiful. Took the bus from Orchard Road and a taxi back. Both quite cheap.
,,Green & Gorgeous,5.0,,"Took 4 children, on 4 scooters and started at the Holland Park entrance and ended at the Children's Garden. Green, gorgeous and took a thousand photos. Highly recommend. Great way to spend 3 hours on a Saturday."
,,Gardens Revisited,4.0,,"It is many years since visiting the Gardens, and the variety of plants and displays now seem only to have got bigger, better, and more prolific. Not for everyone, but those with a botanical 'bent' would enjoy the visit. An extensive range of souvenir goods available through shop, and an excellent restaurant available. Naturally it will undoubtedly be hot during any visit, so hat, sunscreen and water are a must."
,,Plan to spend the whole day here,5.0,,"I will review the Orchid garden separately, though say that is an amazing amazing place. The Ginger garden was lovely, the Swan lake beautiful, the swampy area beautiful, the trees beautiful and well described. Perhaps this was one wonderful thing is that everything is so well named and cleaned. Very very special. The park is free, there is a small small charge for the Orchid garden. Worth every minute."
,,Very big but nice for a walk,4.0,,Great views and I loved seeing the orchid section Also it's a huge place so make sure you are energized and ready to walk and sweat But all in all we had fun and would go again
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,Large free gardens so allow plenty of time and it is very hot so take water. Have to pay for the domes and tree walk separately
,,Beauty in Nature - The Hand of God and Man,5.0,,"We stopped at the botanic gardens on a hot and humid day, which seems normal every time we have visited Singapore. You can get there by bus, cab, MRT train, or the hop-on hop-off bus service. There are a series of gardens you can visit: national orchid, children's, themed, healing, fragrant, foliage, ginger, and evolution. Some have different visiting hours so check the program schedule."
,,Orchids only,4.0,,"Part of a half day tour was a 40 minute stop at the National Orchid Garden of the Singapore Botanic Garden. That was only enough time to rush round quickly looking at as much as possible. I think that to do justice to the Orchids then a whole day could be spent there, never mind the rest of the Botanic Gardens. The orchids on display were wonderful, I only wish we could have spent a lot longer admiring them. To have done justice in the time we were allowed on the tour would have meant just visiting one of the exhibits. A return on our next visit to Singapore will be a must."
,,Must See,5.0,,"This Botanic Garden is just wonderful. It's very well maintained and the flora is just superb.
The flower garden was sooo excellent. The design and the number of flowers was amazing.
We spent a few hours with my wife and it was towards evening so we waited for the lighting bonanza, the towers and lights and synchronised music was really good.
I have never seen so many orchids and tulips ever before and if you like them then this is the place you should be visiting for sure."
,,beautiful and amazing,5.0,,"We went to visit Botanic Gardens in April, was very nice weather, lot to see lot's of different plants too see. I love orchids and I wanted to see Orchids of all different kinds enjoyed a lot most beautiful ever seen, took lot's of pictures very colorful. unfortunate we had to explore another part of city so we didn't stayed there for too long. I can spend whole day there just enjoying the nature of all colors and greens, very clean and well done, can jog, picnic with friends or just relax. love it."
,,Picturesque. !!!,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic garden is a very well maintained place of natural beauty. The tropical forests, orchid garden, the lakes are a treat to watch and enjoy. I could get the glimpse of butterflies and birds too.For This place -'A thing of beauty is joy forever.'"
,,immense flora,4.0,,"Spent a few hours here. Close to the city,, free and a very nice place to spend a few hours. Full of joggers,walkers and wanderers alike. Very peaceful and even romantic ."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Its actually a very big sized garden, nature loves must visit. National Orchid Garden is also situated inside it."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We walked through the gardens in the morning so it wasn't quite so hot. It was absolutely beautiful and well worth a visit. We then stopped off at the visitor centre for a (very) late breakfast! The pastries and coffee is very good and a welcome break from the heat for a while!
,,A Real Garden Adventure,5.0,,"A really nice place to take a stroll when the weather is good especially just after a heavy rain when the air is fresh and crisp. Many great photo areas like the Swan Lake, Lawn E, Bandstand, Pioneer-of-war bricks steps, Orchid Garden, mini waterfall and ginger garden. Take the leisure western park trail from the Tanglin gate to the National Orchid Centre, quite a nice trail. Enjoy the old and majestic trees including the famous tree on the SGD5 note. In the late evening, bring your mosquito repellent and the mozzies can be quite irritating."
,,great outdoor garden park,5.0,,"I love such places, so I'm probably biased. there is tons to see, expansive beautiful gardens, and of course it's tropical with old growth development, and lots of small gardens and features. the only downsides are that it's a bit off the main areas (not too far--it's Singapore), and not everyone would be into walking around such places."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Great park with plenty of interesting features. Easy access to the MRT. The Orchid gardens are in the centre of the park and a fee is payable but it is very reasonable.
,,serene & beautiful...,4.0,,"This is a must visit when in Singapore. It is a tranquil place away from the hustle & bustle of the city. Be it to jog or stroll or just to have a relaxing picnic with friends. Take in the fresh air & be mesmerized by the beautiful flora.

There is ample parking & the best part free of charge. Highly recommended for all. A true gem in Singapore!"
,,Beats the Eden Project,5.0,,"Like everyething else that the Singaporeans set their minds to their latest offering is really first class. The two ""Domes"" are very much the highlight, with the ""Supertrees"" best seen at night when the lights are really spectacular. excellent value for money."
,,A Beautiful Green Space,5.0,,"Tropical plants & magnificent banyan trees , walking through a small tract of rain forest all made this a relaxing walk for a few hours , I used the RMT station Botanic gardens on the circle line to get here."
,,Really Nice Garden To Explore,5.0,,"I revisited the S’pore Botanic Gardens (SBG) after several years, it’s a homely feeling for me. Best to start in the early morning to avoid the hot sun later. I started from Tanglin Gate (Napier Road), access from Orchard Boulevard (Bus: 7,75,77,105,106,123,174; 5 mins walk to Tanglin Gate). You can connect to the above buses via Orchard or Dhoby Ghaut MRT stations.
An optional visit is the National Orchid Garden within the SBG; 8.30am-7pm daily. You can see the varieties of orchids in bloom and also the VIP orchids named after the foreign dignitaries who visited S’pore.
I exit by the Bukit Timah Gate where the Botanic Garden MRT station is. (If you choose to enter by this gate, nearby bus stop served by buses 48, 66, 67,151,153,154,156,170,171, 186.) This exit is just next to the cafes/restaurants at Cluny Court outside the gardens."
,,Singapore's Central Park,5.0,,"Considering the limited land in Singapore, the Botanic Gardens is an excellent urban escape for a bit of nature and greenery. With its many sections and occasional weekend concerts, its a perfect sanctuary in the city."
,,Must visit place,5.0,,First Air conditioned gardened I have seen...U can find all types of flora..They are colorful and beautiful...don't miss waterfall...this is the best place to take photos...
,,Great place for exercise and leisurely walks,4.0,,"This is one of the few places opened at 7am for anyone to jog, stroll, walk your dog or simply exercise in the morning. The lush green here makes it a great place for the family to de-stress.
There were amble parking space and there is no entrance fee to. As we came during the March school Holidays, the Orchid garden's fee was also waived. My family enjoyed taking a leisurely walk in the Orchard Garden. Will definitely go again."
,,One of the many Gardens not to be missed in Singapore,4.0,,"A hugh garden just right outside the famous shopping belt aka Orchard Rd. Enjoy beautiful scenic with fresh air, peaceful morning or evening walk ....thousands of spieces of flowers and trees....most importantly, it is easily access and free of charge to enter (except Orchids Garden)"
,,A Pleasant Place to Relax,3.0,,"Visiting the Botanic Gardens was one of the first things I did after my arrival in Singapore. It was a great place to relax and unwind from work mode and travel fatigue. Plan to spend 2 to 3 hours, depending on how much you want to see and try to go early to avoid heat and crowds (popular school field trip for kids and other tourists). The MRT stop (Botanic Gardens) is at the park entrance and it is largely free, except for entrance to the Orchid Garden. However, my favorite and most peaceful parts were free. I enjoyed the quietness of the rain forest. This is more of a park-like atmosphere compared with other botanic gardens I have visited. However, it is quite enjoyable."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,We stayed in the Hotel Jen near the gardens which were a short walk away. Very beautiful and especially the orchid garden which is truly a wonder of the world. It is free to enter the and walk the whole garden with a small charge for the orchid garden. It was a quiet day in Late January 2015 and the threatened rain did not appear. A superb contrast to the frenetic hub of the shopping centres. Not to be missed.
,,"Great for relaxing, great with kids.",5.0,,Absolutely beautifully maintained. It's almost a luxury to be surrounded by so much greenery in Singapore. Lovely spots to chill with a book or a picnic basket. Lots of ice-cream vendors around. Beautiful flowers. Well worth a visit.
,,Great value for money,5.0,,"A must see, why well yes it is free but it is also very interesting with many specimen trees etc. Lots of different themed gardens and a beautiful Orchid garden ( small fee )"
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"What a large beautifil park. Full of exotic trees plants. Lovely restaurant there had brunch. You need to take water and a sun hat, oh and dont forget your sunglasses"
,,"Tranquil , beautiful gardens so much to explore!",5.0,,"I never tire of taking guests to the Botanic Gardens, apart from the famous Orchid Gardens, which is the only area with a small entrance fee, there is so much to see and do here! Feed the fish at the Sympony Stage or do the Rainforest Walk or simply stroll around and enjoy the huge variety of flours and fauna in these beautiful well maintained gardens. There is also a great Restuarant Halia at the ginger gardens that does excellent food , however not cheap but a real treat ! On occasions free concerts are held at the Symphony Stage area either on a Sat or Sun, these are free and you can bring a picnic and the whole family and just sit relax and enjoy the music ! A must visit while in Singapore!"
,,Great for a morning run.,5.0,,"I visited the Botanic Gardens during my stay in Singapore, looking for a place to go for a run. The grounds were very nice, and although the path around the perimeter took a few laps to get very far, it was a great environment in which to run. A few of the main paths were crowded with tour groups, who seemed to have difficulty understanding the concept of not taking up the entire path and leaving room for other visitors to walk/run, but apart from that, it was very enjoyable. Even found a water monitor crossing a path near the Symphony Stage!"
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,Every corner of the botanic gardens is crammed with beauty. We loved exploring and enjoyed a stroll round the lake (especially seeing the turtles) Well worth a visit if on holiday
,,Truly beautiful and widespread greenery,5.0,,"Greenery all around - the best part though is that it's not that far from the city center.
The place is huge, and if you want to cover it all , you need some time - 2+ hours at least!
Bring some water, wear comfy shoes, and hope for good weather since most of its outdoor :)

Note though the exits are a bit far off, so you would have to walk a bit whenever you plan to exit out."
,,Green place,5.0,,"Visiting to enjoy live music performance and natural fresh air, amazing plantation and nice place overall"
,,Excellent place to walk and relax.,5.0,,"Excellent place to walk and relax. Orchid garden is amazing. Trees and plants are amazing. What we've disliked is that it's quite hard to get their but the public transport, the easiest and fastest way is the taxi."
,,Excellent for a morning walk,5.0,,"The botanic gardens are perfect to spend the morning having a leisurely walk around. Free to enter and with plenty to see, it is the ideal cheap morning out. Combine it with the very reasonably priced orchid garden and you won't be disappointed."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,The place is simply beautiful and it probably offers a lot more than you know. This place is definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore for a casual trip.
,,'Superb gardens',5.0,,"Very beautiful garden with so much to explore. Different types of animals and birds make the place so interesting. Other than adults, even kids loved it.."
,,Absolutely superb,5.0,,"The whole place is great and probably has more than you can imagine. You can walk around it in a few hours stopping where you fancy, albeit that can be very hot and sweaty. You can take a golf buggy tour around to save you this. Quite a walk from MTR station so be warned. Buses, including hop/off do go to carpark which is closer."
,,beautiful retreat,5.0,,"The size of the botanic gardens is enormous. The themed gardens are very interesting, like the foliage or the ginger gardens. We were impressed with the landscaping and enjoyed seeing a variety of animals, birds, black and white swans, a lizard and a big Malayan Water Monitor. There is so much to discover when one takes a closer look. The absolute minimum for a visit is 2 hours."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,These gardens need several visits. Entry to the overall gardens is free and you pay a small amount to go into each individual garden. Seniors get a special rate including overseas visitors. I can't walk very far but managed to see part of the gardens and the orchid garden. I would have loved to be able to rent a mobility scooter to get me around more of the gardens.
,,"Stunning orchids, a huge lizard, and butterflies.",5.0,,"We went early in the morning and were enchanted with this beautiful garden. Many locals adore it and go regularly for calm, beauty and Tai Chi."
,,Beautiful ginger and orchids,5.0,,"The gardens are beautifully laid out and very green. The orchids are worth seeing for the mass of flowers in so many different colours, shapes and sizes. The ginger collection is also facinating and there is no charge. We found it interesting that signage explains leaf litter is good for keeping root systems cool. We assumed it was a response to criticism from Singaporeans that the leaves looked untidy. The ginger and orchid gardens were certainly the highlights. Entry to the Gardens is free and our only cost was entry to the orchid gardens. Well worth a visit as it's a lovely place to escape the hustle and bustle and enjoy the beautiful 'rooms' which have ben created here. The Gardens are easy to get to on the MRT."
,,Nature&Flowers,5.0,,"Must see attraction if you love nature and flowers! You have to have time to go there, so you don't need to rush. Place is very peaceful :) my host family said that best time to go there is evening, I still went there at the hottest time between 1pm-4pm. It was still very nice (I love sun&hot weather), but just remember put suncream ;) if you go there at evening remember take some mosquito cream with you.

There is also places where you can just relax and take sun.
I also went to the Orchid Garden, it is only part what is not free. From adult it is $5 and from senior citizens&students it is $1 * I am not sure can you get student price if you don't have Singaporean student card, but you can try ;)

There is also restaurants and souvenir shops, but for sure yoi can eat somewhere else if you want cheaper food ;D"
,,Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"Must admit was a bit apprehensive about going there, but well worth the time and $5 entrance fee. Beautiful gardens with a exceptional variety of plants, especially orchids."
,,Beautiful and tranquil,5.0,,We purposely went to these gardens to visit the National Orchid Garden and we weren't disappointed. Many gorgeous specifies on show. The whole garden is beautifully kept. We particularly liked the lizards out searching for worms who were unbelievably friendly and even let us stroke them. A lovely afternoon. Although we paid to enter the orchid garden entry to the botanical gardens is free.
,,Excellent gardens,4.0,,"Lovely setting and does not cost anything to get in certainly worth a visit if on a tight budget, it is also one of the stops for the city sightseeing bus tour so you can hop on and off there when you like."
,,ORCHIDEA AND BIRDS,5.0,,"Great weather in Singapore makes me decide to walk from Hotel to Botanical garden. A great day, I recommend specially for European who are keen to see a luxury tropical well kept garden with many species. The Garden is very large and you need a complete afternoon and even take tea time extra.
Many info signs gives name of the plants and orgin... a great bravo to Singapore city to keep this treasure."
,,Great... even in the rain.,4.0,,"Me and my partner loved waking through the botanical gardens, even though it started raining! However, we both felt the orchid garden was a little overrated. Preferred other parts of the gardens overall, such as the terrapins in the lake, the sculptures dotted around the park and also spotting creatures jumping though plants and trees whilst we weaved through a quiet, secluded little area we found hidden down by the lake. Also good for bird spotters."
,,Wonderful space - oasis of calm,5.0,,"Took friends and their kids here. Amazing gardens in the city, relaxing vistas, cooling breezes. Options to dine or have coffee. Not at all busy for a meedweek afternoon. Orchid garden is definite must...well worth the S$5 entry. Visually stunning. Best to avoid during thunderstorms"
,,must see gardens,5.0,,These gardens are one of the worlds best especially the orchid section they are beautifully kept with dozens of employes pruning and cleaning If in singapore please dont miss this attraction
,,A very beautiful Garden,4.0,,"This is a must to visit in Singapore, on entering the gardens you are greeted by beautiful orchids an arched walk covered in small yellow orchids ,it is best to visit in the morning as by lunch time it is very hot ,there is a very nice restaurant in the middle which has a good selectinn of food .and a couple of gift shops that sell interesting items,"
,,Take it easy.,5.0,,"Avoid the heat and humidity - the Botanic Gardens open at 5:00am (still dark) but nevertheless, far easier to walk around early morning. Splendid gardens - a real treat in a very gree city. Free concerts in the evenings - check the web site."
,,The best botanic garden I've ever seen,5.0,,"Rainforest, Cactus, Banzai, Orchid, lake, waterfall, spices... whatever you would like to see... they have it there ;) Superb location! We've fall in love with it"
,,Just beautiful,4.0,,Lovely gardens very well cared for. Free entry and can pick up a map at the visitor centre on your way in. We went on a very hot and humid day (with a 7 year old) so didn't stay too long. Worth a look if you have time.
,,The Best City Garden,4.0,,You have to prepare your health because this garden are big. Bring your own jug and you can fil it with drinkable tap water. The National Orchid Garden is a must to see if you in SBG.
,,Morning Walk,5.0,,"We headed to the Botanic Gardens first thing in the morning and ended up having breakfast here. Such a great location, I have never seen botanic gardens with such diversity including all the different areas. We were disappointing the healing garden was closed on Tuesdays only but there are plenty of other areas to explore in the gardens to make up for it! I would highly recommend anyone to take a walk through the gardens, you would likely need an entire day set aside to see the whole place but a few hours will cover good ground!"
,,Tranquilty,4.0,,"We visited this attraction with friends that live in Singapore and were amazed at the vast range of flora, tree, shrub and plants which were in close proximity to the well surfaced footpaths and walkways.
The signage made it relatively easy to find you way around and paths were also signed for disability routing.
The walk around the lake to see catfish, terrapins and numerous variety of fish swimming freely was a joy to watch.
This was obviously an attraction enjoyed by young and old, who were able to take a welcome and peaceful break from city life."
,,Morning Scebe,5.0,,"Highly recommended to visit here. Especially in the morning. If you are lucky, you may find the shy crawly."
,,We thought we wouldn't make it in the heat!,5.0,,"But after a certain amount of time we acclimatised. we came on a Sunday afternoon so the park was full of people enjoying their day off. A few brave joggers but mostly friends and family groups. Not over crowded though, definately enough space for everyone. You can catch the SIA hop on hop off bus from here but we ended up coming in on the metro and just strolling through the gardens. We spent some time in the shaded pagoda by the lake where you can feed the turtles with supplied food from a vending machine before heading in to the orchid garden. There are lots of places to eat if you want a bit of a snack. Take a picture of one of the maps with your phone and then wander to your hearts content. We thought we'd spend an hour but ended up spending 4"
,,it's a large garden with interesting details in every corner,4.0,,"it's a large garden with interesting details in every corner and when you're tired, you can just sat down and enjoy the greenery."
,,It is truely amazing and a great day out whoever you are!,5.0,,"Some 4 years ago we saw the start of this planned gardens and open spaces. Today we visited this fine example of what this city is all about - is people. The Gardens are a fantastic place to walk about and having a relaxing day with friends or family. Ha ha I know I'm getting old when I start enjoying a visit to the Flower garden pavilion but it was well worthwhile, the tulip display and the nursery rhymes display was beautiful. This fabulous open space is worth the effort just travel by MRT to Bayfront and enjoy"
,,Great way to spend a day in Singapore,5.0,,"We thought we might spend an hour or two here but were really surprised by how much there is to see, you would need a few days to see everything but it is well worth a visit. The Orchid Garden is amazing, so many different varieties, there is a small charge for this garden but worth it. It is really easy to get to, we did it as part of the ""hop on/hop off"" bus, there are cafes and restaurants there."
,,Fantastic,1.0,,"This garden is free to entry . we saw a lizard swim in the pond , squirrels up trees and so many lovely humming birds .we spend 4 hour and only saw a small part of it ."
,,A superb and unxpected find,5.0,,"The gardens are very large and free to enter.

There are beautiful walks and stunning tropical trees and plants.

There is a small charge for the Orchid garden but it is a must see.

It makes great change from all the hurly burly of Singapore.

There are lots of different birds and a large lizard walked across our path."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"My partner loved it, she is more of gardener than I but I still enjoyed it. Cloud Forrest was closed but I enjoyed the tree walk thingy. Walk up the stairs, 128 steps!"
,,Wonderful place to unwind!,5.0,,"Visited this place twice, first time is with my colleagues and we enjoyed it. I love the place so I brought my husband here on my second visit.

This place is where you want to spend a day not thinking about anything but just to relax.This garden offers lots of plants and they even put a message on every plant so you knew what it is. You can gain lots of knowledge as well, as whenever you walk passed,every plant has it's own purpose.

Relax and learn! This is how I describe this place! They have a great garden, wonderful trees and small lakes. This place is a must visit while in Singapore.

Hubby love this place, and his very happy that I brought him here.Its good for everyone. Lot of family and kids here as it's very huge garden to run around and play.

For me it is great for couple who just want to hold hands while walking and enjoying the scenery of beautiful plants and flowers.

It has a restaurant inside as well so whenever you feel hungry you can just grab a bite anytime."
,,Stunnning,4.0,,"This is a must see in Singapore. Peaceful, beautiful and worth a lovely walk around. The best bit is the Orchid Garden...truly lovely."
,,Lush gardens with many different themes including the orchid gardens,5.0,,"Only 50 yards from the bus stop these gardens are worth the visit. Very lush & cool on a hot day with themed gardens which are quite different to botanic gardens in either Australia or UK. The standout is the orchid garden (small fee) with bank upon bank of beautiful, colourful orchids of all sizes & shapes"
,,Hidden gem in Singapore,4.0,,The botanical gardens in Singapore are a huge space with beautiful greenery and gardens and places to explore including several lakes. Amazing to see this in such a modern city.
,,A nice walk,5.0,,"On the hill, near the cemetery, this is a nice walk to do. Better to do it when is not too hot. Wonderful trees and garden."
,,Nice. Gardens for walking around,3.0,,"The gardens are nice, the healing garden was really cool. Lots of plants and it tells you what illnesses they can help. It was hot the day we went that we didn't get to see much as we were just trying to find shade all the time. So great fil that they have fresh drinking water available!"
,,A top attraction in Singapore,5.0,,You can get to the botanic gardens on the circular hop on and off bus tour as they are a little way out of the city. Well worth the journey though. Very extensive with lots of different plant types and also the orchid garden to visit. Cafes and children's play areas also provided.
,,Lovely Gardens,5.0,,It was easy to get there with the SQ Hop-on-hop-off bus. Beautiful trees and plants. A nice change from the noisy and busy Orchard Road.
,,"Yes, Please!",5.0,,"As with many things in Singapore, these Botanic Gardens are very well kept up. The landscape was beautiful and well worth the stroll. Although you may consider this option if you are into the FREE places to visit, as I am, I would suggest you to pack a lunch and bring a few S$ just in case you get hungry or want to go into one of the exclusive exhibitions. In terms of a review, what most people are saying I agree with. This visit can very well take an entire day, which for a book love and photo enthusiast is a perfect escape from the hovering building of the city. If you desire, take the SMRT as it drops you off right at the entrance, only for a few dollars. Bring a friend, have a date, do something without your phones and computers. Consider visiting on a day where the park has a musical event or concert as the amphitheater was very beautiful, but empty when I visited. Bring comfortable shoes and enjoy!"
,,A must do when in Singapore and it's free,5.0,,Amazing garden in the middle of Singapore - You can spend an entire day as there is so much to see - Maintenance is top notch - Very relaxing - Be careful in case of storm though
,,A hidden gem in the city,5.0,,"we went for a walk and came across these beautiful gardens in the middle of the city.
It was free to go in and was huge, you need a good few house to see all round.
The swan lake and orchid gardens (which ha a small fee)are beautiful but the gardens are huge with lots of different trails.
well worth a visit, I preferred it to the gardens by the bay trip."
,,Impressive green space in city...,4.0,,"Large green areas, lovely plants, well maintained. Free to visit, so if you are looking for a spot to escape the city, this is it."
,,An abundence of colour,5.0,,"Try to find time to visit, you will be rewarded by sights, and smells that are amazing, the abundance of varieties never seen before a wonderful afternoon"
,,A beautiful oasis,5.0,,"Botanic Gardens MRT is right next to the Gardens but you then have to walk quite a long way through the park until you get to the more interesting parts. For this reason you might want to consider the MRT which is nearer to the Orchid Garden end, or get a taxi there. The gardens area beautiful and we also saw a couple of monitor lizards and terrapins!"
,,Must Do!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"You could spend hours walking around the Singapore Botanic Gardens, its amazing, very well maintained. i do suggest you start at one end and make your way to the other end, as its so big."
,,"Art, Culture, and A New Plant Universe -- A World Within A City-State",5.0,,"Discovery of rare, regionally common, and beautifully comprised plants are just a tiny part of what this huge botanic garden gives you even in a visit of just a few hours. Find large and completely spontaneous, ethnically diverse throngs practising tai chi and other dance/exercise forms as you come around an orange palm or emerge from beneath a waterfall -- and they just might be dancing to a 1960s American pop tune! A seemingly endless adventure as you pass from grove thru glade, meadow and tree canopy into orchid wonderlands and sculpture gardens, shady forests and rolling meadowlands. Allow at least two hours and perhaps your whole day to enjoy Singapore's botanic wonders, sip tea, picnic, or just watch others enjoy this green haven in the heart of one of Earth's busiest and most diverse cities."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Gardens were gorgeous! We used the hop on hop off bus to get there and spent about 3 hours in the garden. Really enjoyed the Orchids. Could have spent the entire day there. Go.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Definitely worth the time to see, the orchids were beautiful as was the rest of the gardens. Make sure you have comfy shoes"
,,Another restful and amazing place in heart of Singapore,5.0,,"Wonderful childrens garden ( must be accompanied by a child to gain entry!) with sense exploration, food area and great waterplay and treehouse/slide area. The main gardens themselves are packed with so many different areas to explore...all free except for very small fee for orchid garden (but we ran out of time to explore here!!)"
,,heavenly getaway,5.0,,"The Gardens are huge, well maintained, easy-going, great for jogging if you're into that and provide you with a peace of mind after you've finished your business or shopping. Bring a book and a bottle of water, sit down and enjoy."
,,Greens everywhere,4.0,,"It's definitely a sight for sore eyes. After the whole day looking at new architecture marvels and electronic screens, the verdant greens was a welcome change. Situated just around the corner from Orchard road, the Garden provided a much needed refuge from both the hot sun and the hectic mass of people. Truly, there was nothing better than just sitting down for an impromptu picnic under the shade of an old tree before going back to the hustle and bustle of the city. This place had that olden-days charm to it where time seemed to unwind as well and facebook was an alien."
,,"One of the best attractions in Singapore, certainly not to be missed!",5.0,,"The botanic gardens can be accessed by metro, but if it is really hot weather (like it pretty much always is) I recommend that you go there by taxi accessing the park through the main entrance and walk your way to the metro station. The must sees are the thematic parts of the park, especially the rain forest walk and - of course - the orchid garden. There's an entrance fee to the orchid garden, but it's money well spent - the place is amazingly beautiful and enjoyable even for those of us less interested in flowers in general. Absolutely a must see!"
,,wow,4.0,,"Singapore is a green state, and Singapore Botanic Gardens is a example of how this place want be a Green State. The place is quiet and relaxing, don't have so many people in the Gardens."
,,Lovely place for a wander,4.0,,"Not my first visit, and is as lovely as ever. So close to the city but hidden away and perfect for afternoon tea or just simply enjoying the greenery. Plenty of walking tracks, lawns etc for a picnic or social event"
,,Beautiful nice picnic spot,4.0,,Had the best Bloody Mary at halia restaurant near the ginger garden. The White swans in swan lake were magical. Good spot for walking. A lot of joggers around early in the morning.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,We spent 3.5 hrs wandering around these beautiful gardens. Visit the orchid garden it's well worth the $5 dollars Take plenty of mozzy spray if you plan on being there at dusk
,,Green and lovely,5.0,,"The Botanic gardens were a hidden treasure in this big, busy city and FREE. Lots of locals, visiting with children, jogging or walking. A seniors entry into the Orchid garden was $1 - great value! It is a stop on the Hop on Hop off buses and well worth the stop!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"My husband isn't a great fan of botanical gardens, though I am. He even found things of interest here. It is a fabulous place. So many nooks and crannies to explore and beautifully done. I truly enjoyed our time there. I would have liked a map though. It is easy to get lost because the paths twist and turn."
,,Fantastic breakaway from the hustle and bustle,5.0,,"Visited this garden on various occasions. Relaxing, manicured, beautifully crafted gardens. Would have preferred better coffee shops. Great for the family to enjoy."
,,worthwhile to visit,5.0,,we walked around for two hours. we enjoyed the peacefulness. service of available staf is excellent. next visit we shaal visit the place again!

The cool room in the gardens is a lovely respite from the heat.
Definitely recommend"
,,"Wonderful colors, landscaping, varieties -- a must see",4.0,,Amazing gardens --- really beautiful and well worth the time. Suggest you try to visit in early morning as the heat and humidity may be overwhelming in afternoon.
,,"Wonderful gardens, especially the orchids",5.0,,"These gardens were probably the best that I had seen in the World. We spend most of the day there. The Orchid section is the best. Don't miss it. Also, enjoyed the evolution park. Had a good lunch at the park."
,,Nice Walk,3.0,,Lovely walking in the gardens with different themes and native plants and flowers. Love walking through cool room admiring some rare plants and flowers. Nicely set out.
,,One of my favorite places in Singapore,5.0,,"A venerable establishment that promises numerous opportunities for reflection and wonder. Needless to write, with a 150 year history, it's a treasure trove for plant lovers."
,,A quiet and luscious retreat in the middle of Singapore.,5.0,,"What a surprise and welcomed respite in the middle of a steamy day. After coming to Singapore so many times over the years I'm surprised I've never come to the Botanic Gardens before.

After a stop on the big 'red' double decker we decided it was time to have a look at this famed tourist spot. What a great idea it turned out to be. Well established with many mature trees the garden sprawls out in all directions. It was hard to know where to start, so we followed the path to the orchid gardens. Again we chose the right path as the colour and beauty of this enclosed garden was spectacular. Just meandering the paths in this extensive layout was so interesting.

We left feeling totally relaxed and cooled down. (Maybe that was the cold beer we had at the Halia restaurant within the grounds).
The entry is free though there is a charge for the Orchid Gardens which is totally worth it! There is numerous food options and you can even buy a picnic pack to have in the gardens.

Yes, I will return as it is so easy to get to with a nearby stop on the MRT."
,,"Peaceful, Beautiful & Free",4.0,,"Beautiful gardens. Can't believe it's free (except orchid collection). Could easily spend all day here. Good cafe / restaurant. Free water fountain. Left my jacket, camera & wallet in outdoor cafe. Ran back after 15 mins and staff had it. I love Singapore."
,,Beautiful tranquil gardens,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are fresh, clean and well manicured. Wonderful to walk or jog around in any weather conditions. Also a very nice environment to meet friends and have lunch at the casa Verde restaurant which has a great selection of Italian and Asian foods on the menu.

We visited the gardens several times and loved the short walk from Orchard.

Don't miss the opportunity to visit this beautiful part of Singapore."
,,An oasis in the city,5.0,,I love coming here when in Singapore its peaceful and beautiful. The orchid garden is so lovely and it's just a lovely way to spend some time away from the crowds and the tourist traps.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Visited the ginger garden and the orchid garden. Never knew there were so many kinds of orchids. Very interesting, very beautiful and smelled great, too."
,,"Nice, calm place to visit",5.0,,"The Botanic Garden is a really nice place to visit, for relax, for long walks. Lot of beaturiful plants and flowers, place for picninc and playing for families, friends.
There are maps all around the garden, so you can easily find your way. It is pretty big, so worth to count with a whole day.
Quite easy to get there with Circle Line MRT, and there are also buses from the center.
I had an accident in the Garden, so I had to ask for help, they were really nice and helpful, they helped me bind up my wound. Nice memories. :)"
,,A freebie that is so worth the effort,5.0,,"Yes, it's free, and what a way to fill in a half day, though I am sure a lot of travellers would find it easy to stay all day. Well laid out, and easy access. We walked Down the hill to it from our hotel, just off the top of Orchard Rd, and then caught the underground from the far end back into town. Don't forget to add on the optional extra of the orchid gradens as well"
,,Beautiful place to lose a few hours,5.0,,"We had only intended a brief visit to the botanic gardens but were blown away by the size of everything that we stayed for a couple of hours. Lots to take in and soak up, and a stunning array of plants and trees. A very tranquil spot. Highly recommended."
,,Not long enough,5.0,,"We visited the gardens. We only had 2 hours. That is definitely not long enough. Could have spent so much more time there.
Stunning gardens, great walks. Paths very well maintained. Wanted to see lots more but ran out of time.
A must do for any visitor to Singapore."
,,A quiet haven,5.0,,"In a vertical, densely packed city, a great place to decompress and walk in some greenery- though there is a surprising amount of green space in the city"
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"It's amazing to think that 150 years ago that visionaries identified a huge area for plants of all kinds and it remains a beautiful environment today, the inspiration behind the late Lee Kuan Yew's drive to make Singapore a garden city.

Take a break from all the tourist attractions and expensive shopping and enjoy the wonders of nature, and you might come across a couple of lizards in a territorial dispute, as pictured here"
,,Early morning walk,5.0,,"We were staying in Singapore for just one night, and were jet lagged so up early. We knew the Botanical Gardens open at 5am so were there walking around a good hour before sunrise. We weren't alone with many walkers, runners, and groups practicing their Tai Chi.

The grounds are excellent, lots of ponds, different tropical plants, and places to sit and contemplate.

Certainly a good place to visit, and FREE to get in."
,,Must-visit Place,5.0,,Beautiful garden and clean surroundings. Well-managed and good maintenance. Nice place to go with family and spend the whole afternoon there. Better go after lunch time when the weather is not so humid.

,,Fantastic gardens,5.0,,"Fabulous gardens , well worth a visit , some amazing colours & beautiful orchids , water features etc !"
,,"Beautiful, tranquil gardens",4.0,,"This is a lovely place to wander around and explore and take in your surroundings. It was especially great to watch unsuspecting people walk into the path of a large monitor like lizard and watch their reactions. Very funny!

I downloaded the Singapore Botanic Gardens App for my phone and it gives details on walking trails, things to look at and historical facts. Was very handy. My one suggestion would be to definitely pay the $5pp to explore the National Orchid Garden - it was the highlight and shouldn't be missed. If you are short on time, head straight there!"
,,Must Do,3.0,,"it is HUGE. a lot of people seem to go here for recreation, like jogging or picnic with the family. nice place. if you want to visit make sure you either do it in the morning or in the afternoon so you don't get burned from the sun!"

,,Give yourself lots of time! and bring your camera!,5.0,,"A great place. Lots to see, well labeled pathways, and easy walking. We set our sites on the National Orchid Garden. So many beautiful plants to see, we felt a bit overwhelmed. Unfortunately, our trip was cut short from a hour long thunder/lightening storm that brought a tropical rain. Definitely a destination when in Singapore."
,,Cool for families with small children,5.0,,"I visit the garden with my 3 old daughter - there is a special area in the garden for children with many small corners - water corner to cool - this one we liked the most, sand corner, sensory corner, maze, tree house with big slides. We spent most of the day here and it was amaizing!"
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are worth a visit only if you are going to see the National Orchid Garden. Otherwise, you might find it extremely hot and humid, a bit of unpleasant experience."
,,Unmissable,5.0,,"We must confess to being frequent visitors to Kew Gardens,so our interest is clear. This is a truly beautiful place for everyone , enthusiasts or picnickers kids or crumblies.Great place to eat or sit and enjoy the views,a calm oasis in a busy city"
,,Fascinating stroll,5.0,,Being from Canada I don't get to walk through a bona fide rain forest very often so this was very pleasant. The signage on the various trees was a little small for these 50 yr old eyes but the journey was definitely enjoyable.
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"Extensive gardens with clearly defined areas/themes. Good maps and paths make getting around easy. There are several refreshment stops along the way. It's almost impossible to pick a favourite bit - the evolution garden is particularly interesting, the sculputres are brilliant and the orchid collection is a real WOW. Wear sensible shoes, prepare for a lot of walking and allow at least a half day."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Really beautiful gardens - I would recommend this as a visit. We went on an organised trip included in a tour
,,Green oasis in the city,5.0,,"No entering money, very big garden with exotic plants. A propper and silent oasis inthe city. Not very crowded. Some work of art, lakes, plants."
,,dengue fever,3.0,,"Beautiful place! Orchid Garden is especially amazing. Huge park and it takes hours to walk around the whole area, but I was so fascinated and totally forgot about time.
BUT, one thing turned everything nightmare. I got four mosquito bites in the Healing Garden and got Dengue Fever a week after I visited the park."
,,Must Do,5.0,,We went at about 8.30 am for a walk around the gardens.Lovely experience. The walk around was something everyone must do when .... Post our watch we reached the Casa Verde Restaurant for breakfast. Good food. Great way to end the morning.
,,A must-see tourist visit,3.0,,"Even if you are not into flowers or gardens, it is worth a visit just to see how beautifully it is done and to soak up the tranquillity in a busy city. Whether for a quick loop or a slow stroll, it is a very pleasant and relaxing place to be."
,,Nice retreat from the surrounding metropolis,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens occupy 74 hectares and feature an immerse variety of flora.
What I enjoyed most was the (relatively) small patch of rainforest, the orchid gardens (5 SGD entrance fee) and the coolhouse with its special micro climate.
The gardens are very popular among local families for a weekend hangout, couples as a dating place, dog owners, joggers etc.
While we were there, I didn't see any flies or mosquitoes.
If you just want to see the main attractions, you can plan 2 or 3 hours for the gardens, but you can also easilty spend half (or a whole) day there just enjoying the surroundings.
Entry is free, and it is comfortable to take a taxi there (~ 10 SGD from downtown)."
,,Wonderfully Peaceful,4.0,,"Not the most accessible by MRT but the Circle Line gets you there. Within sight of the skyscrapers but peaceful, varied and free except for the Orchid Collection which is a must see."
,,Good for a peaceful walk,4.0,,"Have been to Singapore several times and wanted to visit places I hadn't been. The botanical gardens are just outside the main City area with easy access by public transport. I walked to it from orchard rd. The gardens are almost opposite the USA, UK and Australian embassies. The gardens are very large and unless you want to walk it all I would research and pick the areas of interest. Would recommend going before the heat of the day as the humidity was high. Bring plenty of water although there arê shops/cafes near the orchard gardens. The Gardens are free except for the orchard gardens which is a $5 entrance for adults, cheaper for seniors/children/students. I didn't go as I'm not that passionate about flowers to have to pay to see them. Overall the gardens were interesting but not spectacular. If you have time then visit but otherwise would prioritise other attractions."
,,Colours,5.0,,Only had a short time there due to the fact it was part of a city tour however if returned would like to spend longer ther
,,Birds and animals an added bonus,5.0,,"we love visiting the Botanic Gardens, a beautiful oasis in the midst of such a busy city. the added bonus this time was an emerald green tree snake, two large lizards, squirrels and white swans. We also loved the display of frangipanis, didn't realise there were so many colours and the perfume is delicious."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"So much variety. A national treasure not to be missed. Good facilities. You need at least 2 hours, but could spend all day there."
,,good to take a photo,3.0,,nice place to see and also orchid garden is good to take a photo. but bring your water and juice yourself. Every thing at there is expensive.
,,good for walking,3.0,,"nice place with some nice trees and flowers,clean , without any flies,good place for running and other sport like walikng... but u should know it shouldnt be ur first choices for visit in singapore."
,,One of the most magical parts of the city!,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens has been one of my favourite places in Singspore since my first visit in 1992. Located in the middle of the city, but when in the gardens, you could be in the middle of the countryside. It has always been a regular workout spot and place to have a late afternoon stroll. They regularly have events in the bandstand and you would be amazed at the various activities that go on from sunrise to sunset. When in Singapire it has to be a must do."
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,"Great, large part with broad paths and an intresting variety of plants. Try the rain forest walk for a fun stroll especially with kids."
,,Take me for a walk!,4.0,,"Very nice place to visit if you are in Singapore for a few days. And, obviously, if you live here! Just wander around and enjoy the views. If you can, choose a weekdays, because weekends, specially Sundays, is crowded!"
,,This was truly a beautiful find. There was no cost to tour the garden but I would have gladly paid. Beautiful grounds,5.0,,"This is my favorite spot in Singapore. Beautiful trails and very well laid out Even for someone who was not reading the map.The variety of the flowers and trees was simply breathtaking. As a photographer (OK, Amateur) I was in heaven. This is a must see for anyone in Singapore."
,,Botanical wonderland,4.0,,a suprisingly quiet haven in the midst of singapores hustle and bustle. A tree lovers paradise - some very rare and huge specimens made this a great jungle feel. Certainly interesting - we decided to enter the orchid gardens and duly paid the orchid entry 5SGD fee ( entry to botanical garden is free )- the gardens are certainly beautiful but we just seem to have missed the big blooms- perhaps feb ir early March would have been better - however still worth a visit - time taken to walk around was approx 2 hrs - good if time is short or wanting to kill time while waiting for a late airport connection
,,Beautiful gardens.,5.0,,"These landscaped gardens are a lovely place to spend a few hours. The plants are interesting in themselves but the atmosphere alone justifies a visit. People watching, the other visitors, is also worthwhile. Don't miss the Orchids, well worth paying for."
,,Better to visit in the morning or evening,3.0,,Bring your umbrella and bottles of water & snacks. Also prepare your legs because you have to walks miles away :)
,,Worth a walk in the evening,3.0,,"Since this was my third time in Singapore, I had visited all the major attractions in the city country. And was wanting to visit some other ones.

I visited The Botanic Gardens - and it was a pleasant experience. This is not a must visit place, however, if you like me have visited all the loved places and want to spend a quite evening walking through open spaces and nicely laid out lawns - the Botanic gardens would provide a fitting option. You can see the locals cycling, having photo shoot or even school children just strolling around - and experience the way some locals spend their evenings.

I would prefer to visit the gardens in evening, and for a first time visitor - one can plan about 2-3 hours to be spent here (it had few entrances - so just check out the one closest for you)."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Well set out high quality attraction . Very clean excellent facilities , great restaurant and extremely well maintained"
,,A Wonderful Park for Everyone,4.0,,"Here you get to see Ginger garden, Fountain, National Orchid Garden, Healing Garden and many trees. Cool place for picnic and sports."
,,Great day for little,5.0,,"I went to Botanic garden by Bukit Timah Gate. There are so many things to do there. Check out Eco- lake and Jacob Ballas Children 's garden

It is wonderful place for half day picnic

What to bring:

- Water and fruit ( apple, banana)
- Snack for kids
- Swimsuit and dry cloth for kids as there is a water playground in Jacob Ballas garden
- Umbrella
- mosquito repellant, suncream, hat
- scooter

Many local families hang out hear

Tip: there is a small cafe near the entrance. Kids should go to toilet before get into the garden as it is hard to find a toilet inside

They close on Monday"
,,"Expansive and uncluttered, a lovely way to spend a few hours",5.0,,"This is the host garden for the Orchid Garden, which is more famous. This is a delightful place, one of the nicest botanic gardens I've ever visited. Rivals Cape Town. Do it."
,,One of the best,5.0,,"These beautiful gardens had so many beautiful and varied areas, excellent displays (labelling could be better), just sooo extensive - Icould go back an back and back."
,,Singapore Botanic Garden A Must to see !,4.0,,"This is the place to go to see a truly diverse beautiful garden in a wonderful atmosphere. You can feel the gentle ambiance as you meander through the different areas or take in a tea at the famous tea garden close to the entrance.

But it can be extremely hot so do take a hat, sunglasses and cover up with suntan lotion!"
,,Botanic Gardens,4.0,,It must have been the wrong month to visit these gardens as there were not many flowers to see. There were some interesting new exhibits and I enjoyed viewing the various statues throughout the garden.
,,Great place to get away from the city,5.0,,"Since I live in Singapore, I visit the Botanic Gardens usually about twice a month. It's one of my favorite places in Singapore to go running, walking, or photographing. The Botanic Gardens is a great environment to get away from the city for a little bit just because it's so quiet and clean. If you want to escape for a few hours from the hustle and bustle this is the place to do it. There are usually many people exercising in the Gardens and school trips milling around. People also come here to take wedding photos occasionally and to have picnics. It is quite easy to get lost in the Botanic Gardens so I would recommend grabbing a map at one of the entrances. I usually go through the Tanglin Gate since it's easily accessible, but you can navigate through the Nassim Gate past the embassies to get back to Orchard. Be sure to stop by the Orchid Gardens and bring plenty of water. There is a store where you can by snacks by the Orchids and a restaurant. Bathrooms are scattered about the Gardens. I would highly recommend even just stopping by this place just because it's such a pleasant environment. It reminds me of a miniature Hong Kong Park, but less city is visible around you."
,,A worth watching place !!!,5.0,,"Dont miss it if you are in Singapore for 2-3 days. The Garden itself is huge and beautiful. Start early in the morning coz it will take 2-3 hours to complete visiting the collection of flowers. An awesome place for nature lovers and photographers. Don't miss the ""Cool House"". Carry water along with you."
,,A superb garden,5.0,,Well worth spending at least half a day here. So well done and very interesting. One of the best Botanic Gardens we have been to. A real credit to everyone involved over the years
,,Bliss,5.0,,"there is nothing to dislike about this ""oasis"". It's a must go to place. Tranquil. Take couple of hours to just wonder around and enjoy."
,,Very nice,4.0,,"For a half day out. The lush climate does help to grow this very nice and well maintained Garden. The lunch place is a very nice alternative to for a business lunch, away from the standard locations."
,,Best Botanic Gardens,5.0,,The highlight of our visit was the orchid section. Although you have to pay to go in it is really worth it. The range of styles and colours of orchids is amazing.

,,Awesome,5.0,,If you love orchid's then go for a walk through the orchid garden. We got a picnic lunch from the cafe and had a picnic with our two young children by the lake watching the turtles frolic in the water
,,Mind blowing scenic views,5.0,,State of art technology at its best. Exquisite views and a must go place in Singapore. Highly recommended and a good day out with family. Massive trees artistically presented with lights gives a majestic feel to the whole place . Well done.
,,Short visit to Botanical garden,5.0,,Hop on hop off bus routes covers botanical garden .This is a must see location while visiting Singapore . Lush green area amid towering concrete building is a real treat to eyes . The Botanical garden is well maintained and half day visit will be sufficient to enjoy the varieties of gardens . orchid garden & spice garden are few among types gardens available inside .
,,Great Value and Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,The main gardens are free while the orchid garden has a S$5 charge which is worth every penny. Be sure to visit both and be prepared for a lot of walking!
,,Excellent lunch,4.0,,Super meal in relaxed environment where two small children were made very welcome. A good range of choices and very prompt service made this a superb experience.
,,Family holiday,5.0,,Great place to visit whether you like gardens or not. A really well maintained gardens with lots to see or just go for a walk.
,,A little peace in a busy city,5.0,,"After 11 hours of travelling peace is what you need. Head to the botanical gardens, but in comfortable shoes. Fantastic"
,,"Very nice, big park.",4.0,,"Great place to walk around of sit and read a book. Lots of beautiful vegetation. Accessible by MRT, and free! Although I paid $5 for the orchid garden. Apparently it's the largest display of orchids in the world, and it's quite nice, but I've seen nicer (Finca Dracula in Cerro Punta, Panama)."
,,Green area for a picnic,5.0,,"another green area in singapore. this is perfect for picnic. they have a nice place to eat and if you like picnic they sell a ""picnic package"" for s$30 (pizza, nuggets, fruits, soft drinks, water) and they borrow a basket. If you like medicinal plants don't miss the healing garden. They have free music concert sometimes...you have to check dates before. I love this place...you can see monkeys, squirrel, turtles and lots of birds."
,,Another gem in Singapore,5.0,,"Having been to Singapore on numerous occasions over the past 10 years or so, I visited the Botanic Gardens for the first time recently and it was fantastic! The garden is huge with many little gardens and walks within the grounds. The orchid garden was amazing with over 1000 species of orchids bursting out everywhere. The wildlife that can be seen here were surprising. Saw kingfishers here! Would recommend this to anyone who wants to stay away from the shops and experience a bit of the nature found in Singapore."
,,Quite stunning grounds - immaculate kept with a fascinating history.,5.0,,The serenity and peacefulness of this fabulous location - so well managed - really was a highlight of our visit to Singapore.
,,Awesome Place to know more about Orchid Flowers,5.0,,I love Singapore Botanic Gardens due to the nice environment and the types of plant they have there. There is also trails which you can take a breeze walk in the early morning.
,,Tropical beauty,5.0,,"I used to live next to the botanical garden for two years and used this venue as our morning brisk walk every weekend and learned more and more about the beauty that this fantastic garden offers. Its tranquil - mystic - tropical - and you can escape the urban pace and noise and enter the beauty of your own space in the fabulous garden. Ok, you are not alone......but you can find sections of the vast garden that provides the needed space and privacy. A must visit when in Singapore!"
,,Singapore lose the old fashion,2.0,,"Since my first visit and last are more than 17 Years. Yes its now a place for People how need Sports activities. With the rest of the past, it's over. Sorry"
,,Gardens awash with colour,5.0,,"vibrant plants, man made lakes, houses the keep plants,then green houses effect hols plants you've never seen before, they have a stand by the lake where motzart used to hold concertsI think!!), but then others did! You can just imagine when you glaze along the lake, thinking of music concerts been help, picnics held on glorious sunny days past, immaculate gardens, so well kept"
,,Superb and free,5.0,,"This is a massive and impeccable park enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. The only fee is for the orchid gardens (Sing $10 each) which is worth every cent. The only problem was getting round everything you want to see before your legs give out. Everywhere you look is a feast for the eyes and even though very popular (we went on a Sunday afternoon and half of Singapore was there!) the size of the park means it still didn't feel crowded. Beware of one thing though: everyone tells you to use MRT stop Raffles Place, when actually the stop aptly named ""Botanical Gardens"" does exactly what you would think and takes you right to the back gate. I still have no idea why we were directed to the next stop on and encouraged to take a bus back to the front gate. There is no entrance fee so you can get in the back just as easily, which we checked out when we left that way."
,,Huge and beautiful,5.0,,The botanical gardens are a must see in Singapore and they don't disappoint. They are currently in the process of getting Unesco World Heritage status and they richly deserve it.
,,Such wonderful colour,5.0,,To see the colour at this attraction makes it worthwhile. The orchid garden is particular spectacular and worth a visit alone. There is a cheap fee for this garden. We went to the attraction by train which is right next door to the venue.
,,Stunning,5.0,,Take your time walking through the gardens as it is like an oasis near the city. Easy paths to walk along so would be good for prams or wheelchairs. A lot bigger than I expected and is definitely worth a visit.
,,Breath of fresh air,4.0,,"Spread across acres and acres of land, you need the whole day to see each and every corner of the Botanic Gardens. Its a perfect place for a sunday picnic, with a lot of sheds built throughout the park. The evolution garden is a very interesting feature."
,,Botanic Gardens and Orchid Garden,4.0,,Very beautiful and peaceful. Lots of shade. No fee except for small fee to orchid garden which was amazing
,,very interesting visit,4.0,,"It is large and rich. Because of the weather, there are a lot of plants to see. As everything is Singapore, it is well organized."
,,Just happened to walk through,5.0,,We took a train and ended up at the far end of the Botanical Gardens which was not were we expected. This was very nice and easy walk which we were pleasantly surprised on how friendly the black swans were.
,,Fantastic display of nature,5.0,,"The walk through the botanic gardens was amazing. Well sign posted, friendly grounds staff and immaculate displays. Th ecactus display was also worth looking for but overall a MUST DO!"
,,Beautiful walk through the gardens!,4.0,,"I was here in March 2012, and I spent a day at the botanic gardens, and it was worthwhile! Everywhere you turn, you find something more beautiful! Be prepared for it to be hot in there, as there is so much vegetation, that not much of a breeze gets through in some areas. Bring lots of water with you and take breaks. My most favourite part was walking through the rain forest area. It is well covered, and a few degrees cooler than when out in the open. The Cool House is where the orchids from a cooler locale are housed, and it is a refreshing place to walk through on a very hot day! There are many things to take pictures of, but take your time, and spend a leisurely day there. It's a beautiful walk, and meant to be enjoyed leisurely."
,,Flowers amd more orchids,5.0,,"Singapore botanic garden is a place you MUST visit!!! The orchid paradise! So well trated, so nicely planted, so womderful... You will really enjoy visiting it and learnong about the story of sich important botanic garden. Do not miss it even if it is raining. An umbrella and enjoy!"
,,Beautiful and Enormous!,4.0,,"The botanical gardens are pretty awesome. There is nothing surreal or amazing, but there are many beautiful plants, sculptures, trails, etc. I did not even get to explore all of it because it is so massive. I would suggest bringing a hammock or sheet and making a day out of it. There are also events sometimes, so plan before you go. When I went there was an Acapulco concert at the beautiful stage."
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,"An oasis of calm and beauty. Lovely varied green space, easily accessible by public transport (has own metro station) not too far from downtown. Internal free shuttle bus available. Well worth a visit ."
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"So close to the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road -- yet so soothing and serene. It's hard to believe these Gardens are really in the heart of the City which makes it all the more amazing.

Great for strolling and enjoying nature , but also to admire the many unusual plant species so well tended.

The highlights for me were with Ginger Garden and National Orchid Garden .

I would leave aside the usual activities associated with a visit to Singapore -- shopping, eating and nightlife -- and make time for a visit to these beautifully laid out and well managed gardens."
,,Orchid Garden always spectacular.,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a gem--one of the best we've seen. The Orchid Garden is always spectacular. Halia, the restaurant in the garden, is a nice place to eat--special setting, good food."
,,These gardens are an absolute delight,4.0,,"Amazing tranquil, relaxing and Free environment in the middle of Singapore. Theres a small fee to walk round the outstanding orchid gardens which was well worth it, theres a cafe and shop and good toilet facilities."
,,Get in touch with nature,4.0,,We had a good time here just walking around in the beautiful scenery although I had higher expectations in terms of variety of plant but nonetheless it was clean and easy to navigate
,,Flower and natural garden,4.0,,"I love to go into a garden like this, it's very natural and can see a lot of tree and animals that grow naturally."
,,Beautiful and Serene,5.0,,"This was an amazing garden, clean, beautifully maintained and very large. The garden designs and features were second to none. The orchid garden was truly worth the extra $ to enter and the bonsai garden was amazing!! You could easily spend an entire day or more here. The restaurant on site was excellent and the banana bread dessert was very delicious and more than enough to share! The gift shop offered some beautiful and unique choices for gifts and keepsakes. We would highly recommend this experience."
,,Truly stunning,5.0,,the gardens have matured beautifully since my last visit in the 60's. there were local families enjoying this peaceful space. It is hard to believe that this garden is in the middle of this city. A lot of history to be had in this garden
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"We caught the train the North East Line from China town to Harbour Front. From there we took the Circle Line. The train only goes one directin from there so therevis no confusion.
Before we got the the Botanic Gardens we stopped off at One North to see the Lucas Art Sandcrawler building. This build is built in the shape of the Jawa Sandcrawler from Star Wars. It's nice for Star Wars fan but there is only the building to see. The garden is good and a great statue of Yoda.
From there we got back on the train and alighted at Botanic Gardens. Like all stations in Singapore the way to the gardens is clearly marked. The entrence to the gardens is at the entrance to the station.
The gardens are great to walk through. I would suggest taking a bit of extra time to do the rain forest. There are a few other nooks and crannys you can get into as well. Plus go all the way through. It is a long walk but it is worth it.
The whole place is clean with people always sweeping the path.
We stopped at the Raffles building for lunch, about half way from the station to Swan Lake. It has a little Hawker market and it was quiet nice, and inexpensice. There are other resurants in the park but they are dearer.
Remember, it will be hot and muggy. You will build up a sweat so wear something light. Also take some water with you plus a hat and sunscreen.
We had a great time. I appologise for any typos. I am writting the on the phone after a long day."
,,Beautiful and free.,5.0,,It's a beautiful and peaceful place to relax and enjoy landscapes. It's free! I recommend to get some food before going in and have lunch there. There's also a concert agenda you can check in the official web page.
,,UNBELIEVABLE GARDENS in the centre of Singapore,5.0,,"I have never seen any gardens as diverse and wonderful as these. On the Hop on/off Bus Route, so very easy to visit.
You really need at least a day to appreciate the gardens but if you only have a short time, walk through from the entrance and follow the signs to the Orchard Gardens ~ this route will give you an insight into the true diversity of the trees and plants. Then visit the Orchard Gardens and walk back to the entrance via another route. If you have time to spare, take a picnic and enjoy the surroundings.
Entrance is free"
,,Beautiful !!,4.0,,Calm and Serene .. love the beauty of this place. Orchid garden is a must visit. Wonderful place for your evening stroll
,,A total revelation,5.0,,"Just two hours left for visiting those beutiful botanic gardens still happy since it ended as a total positive revelation for me! Hope, on next occasion I will have more time to enjoy and relax more there."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"These gardens are brilliant, especially for someone from a temperate region. The orchid garden is particularly fantastic, but so are so many other parts of the garden. I can't recommend them too highly.

We had lunch in he restaurant next to the ginger garden. The food was average but the service was dreadful, so much so that the waitress deleted the service charge without any prompting from me. Sadly they'd also run out of ginger beer!

We arrived by taxi. We should have arranged to be picked up as well, or taken a taxi card, because we had quite a long wait to get a taxi back to our hotel."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Being a nature lover, this was a treat to visit. I spend almost 3 hrs exploring the gardens. Landed up there by 3 and left only by 6pm. Easiest way is to go by MRT. Amazing to see wide variety of plants."
,,Great day out,5.0,,"A wonderful place to visit. You can easily spend a full day here. Wonderful lake, wildlife ( we saw large lizards just walking by the paths as well as different birds and swans) and flowers."
,,Love being here,5.0,,"Wide and wise! I saw two black swans there! Very unique! The white swans i saw a few times! Try to go within weekday, quite and peaceful! In the weekend, philippinnos gather and so noisy, like a market! Haha!
Flowers are so fresh! Perfect for wedding photos!
Wonderful place for family staying together!"
,,An amazing garden,5.0,,Well worth a visit the care and attention that they have given to these gardens are amazing. They have specific areas with very good information about a variety of plants and their environment. We had 3 very enjoyable hours walking around the gardens
,,Confusing to walk around,3.0,,"We spent a morning walking around the National Botanical Gardens. It was a pleasant enough experience but I didn't feel that they were as well maintained as they could be.

I was quite interested in the Healing Garden but found it to be quite disappointing to be honest.

It was also quite a confusing place to walk around. We seemed to have walked miles and appeared to double back in places. Marina Bay Gardens wn heands down."
,,Beautiful Green Garden close to MRT,4.0,,Located next to Botanic Garden MRT. Easy MRT Access. Can be crowded during weekends. Ideal place for photoshoot post wedding. Can arrange for picnic with some home cooked food with the family. Ideal half day experience.
,,Nothing can go wrong here,5.0,,"such wonderful experience for us. even my son of 12 yrs age felt that this is a great place. despite of the hot weather, it didnt deter us from going to the outdoor garden and slowly walking ard and taking photos. sadly there were a bunch of tourist from china making way too much noise and apart from that, its a nice place to visit."
,,Worth taking your time,4.0,,"Such a huge garden! Take your time and explore the various themes from foliage to spices to healing gardens. Love the ginger gardens. Some cheap places to eat at the Raffles Building, much cheaper than the central restaurant. One of the best gardens I've ever seen."
,,plenty of space,5.0,,this place is amazing for the amount of space and how well it is kept we walked miles around it to the lake etc it is divided up into different section and you can spend a whole day here and its free unless you got into the orchid garden. there is a lovely coffee shop that does food at a reasonable price
,,Definitely an interesting place to see,4.0,,"We spent about 2.5 hours walking through the gardens. It is definitely worth the trip. There are many paths to walk and a beautiful lake to walk around. There are some good places to eat and good gift shops. Best to go early in the a.m. when it is cool. We did not stop at the orchid garden and later we were told that is the best part of it, so would suggest you reserve time for that portion!"
,,Nice for a walk,4.0,,"The plants is super nice, big trees, interesting flowers, beautiful lake, nice shades for taking a walk in a hot day. The cafe at Tanglin gate is cute but I didn't go in. It's amazing how clean and well-managed it is."
,,worth a visit,5.0,,the gardens are lovely to walk around and its very peaceful. it was a nice break from all the hectic sightseeing that we had been doing
,,Big and Awesome,4.0,,Really interesting and can take up a whole day if you dont' watch yourself. Entry is free. and there are a few restaurants and shops if needed.
,,good for walking exercise,3.0,,"the place is good for your feet if you like walking, so you can have exercise here, but what is special is the air, free your lungs for oxygen"
,,Bring your walking shoes,4.0,,"I have visited these gardens almost every time I come to Singapore. Do they get larger? The plant groupings are very interesting, in particular the Orchid display, but also the Evolution garden. I find the paths lead you in many circular routes so you often have to back track to see something new. That's a problem if you want to see everything in one visit, but not if you limit yourself to one corner of the park each time."
,,Probably the world’s best tropical botanic garden,5.0,,"The park has been open since 1859, and some of the trees were there before it was a park. So expect some splendid trees. The park’s original purpose was to improve agriculture in Singapore and other tropical areas, and even today education is an important aspect.
Admission is free to the main park; but there’s a small charge if you want to visit the Orchid Garden. Our favourite areas are the banana and ginger garden – lovely flowers and lots of information. The Evolution Garden which takes you through the way plants developed on earth, it’s fun and educational. The Eco garden with its fascinating range of fruit trees. We’ve visited the Healing Garden which is very informative, but we found it heavy going (or maybe we were just getting tired).
Adults can normally only visit the Children’s Garden if they have a child with them. However a sign does say you can ask a staff member about visiting if you don’t have a child. It was very busy when we saw it, so we didn’t enquire.
Distances are large, but it’s reasonably flat, and there are plenty of places to rest. However its size does mean that at times you will be some distance from any facilities.
It can be very hot in the gardens during the afternoon, early morning and evening are the best times for a visit. The gardens get much busier at weekends than on workdays, however it's a huge area, and does not feel crowded.
There are drink vending machines, water fountains, a kiosk selling good reasonably priced sandwiches, and various more expensive restaurants – enough choice for everybody. Superbly clean toilets are available in several locations.
There are many options for getting there. A bus from Orchard Road brings you to the Tanglin Gate, you then have to walk along the road and cross a major junction to reach the Gardens. The MRT station is at the other end of the park. Arrive there and you’ll think you’ve come to the back door! There’s not much to see until you’ve walked about 400m, and no facilities until you’ve done that walk. But at least the MRT takes you directly to a Garden gate.
Taxis can drop you off either at the Visitor Centre or near the Orchid Garden, so you need to decide which is best for you.
How does it compare to Gardens by the Bay? It’s many times larger, but I think Gardens by the Bay has more toilet blocks! The Botanic Gardens are much older, and in my judgement more beautiful.
No visit to Singapore is complete without spending some time here. If you live here, it’s a lovely place for a picnic or a meal."
,,Well maintained garden,5.0,,Yes come here for a healthy stroll. It is a great way to cleanse your lung from all pollution by inhaling O2 from lush and properly maintained greeneries. Bring your own meal and have a picnic on the grass.
,,A Favorite,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens, which was perhaps my favorite sight in Singapore. We had so much fun strolling through the gardens, watching people do their Tai Chi and their Yoga and their boot camp, seeing the turtles and the monitor lizards in the pond. What a beautiful asset to the city of Singapore."
,,Visit it between 5pm and 7pm.,4.0,,"Between 5pm and 7pm, the sun is not so strong in Singapore and you will definitely enjoy the Botanic Garden better. Take a leisure stroll around the garden and relax yourself in nature. There are 2 entrances and you can buy food and drinks at both these entrances if you feel a bit hungry or thirsty during dinning time."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"These gardens are beautifully landscape and provide welcome relief to the bustle of the city. The orchid garden is absolutely stunning and should not be missed. Altogether, this is one of the great public gardens of the world."
,,A rare garden for the plant lovers,4.0,,This may be the rarest botanical garden spread in a very large area. It has a large number of orchids which may perhaps not be available at a single place. Nice and a quiet place.
,,Beautiful and vast,5.0,,"Loved being able to see so many tropical plants in a gorgeous setting. There are a couple of lakes, an open air theatre for orchestral performances, and lots of space. The buildings have been really nicely done and are sympathetic with the surrounding landscape."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"One of the most, if not the most, beautiful Botanic gardens we have seen so far. DON'T miss the orchid garden located inside, a jewel."
,,A nice bit of greenery in Singapore,4.0,,Located just minutes away from orchard road this is a great place to come for many different reasons. You can come here for exercise or to walk with the family. Hang out or watch a play being shown on the weekend. Note that there are restrictions on dogs and you need to be careful if you are playing with balls etc. There are a few restaurants in the grounds if you get hungry.
,,Beautifully maintained,4.0,,"What an oasis in the city. Definitely worth a visit and wonderful to see so many local people enjoying themselves with picnic on the weekend.

Lots of dedicated zones for specific varieties. Prolific planting, good signage and also art.

All in all a great experience. I also recommend get you spend the extra $5 and visit the national
Orchid garden"
,,relaxing,5.0,,"Nice walking paths. Do the optional Orchid gardens it is fantastic, my wife could have stayed in there all day. Very clean. Easy to get to, the MRT stops right at the entrance."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"After a walk along Orchard Rd we finally arrived at The Botanic Gardens. What a wonderful place, the variety of plants and trees was amazing and it was all free apart from an additional charge for the Ochid section. Truly beautiful throughout and interspersed with historical facts and sculptures in unexpected places.
Will definitely return!"
,,One of the best gardens I've seen!,5.0,,"Spend 2-3hrs wondering around the park in the weekend. Start at around 5pm, bring along a your picnic basket and end the day as the sky goes dark, wonder down the hustle and bustle of orchard road."
,,Beautiful Place,3.0,,"Huge place, but can get a little crowded on weekends. Only difficulty is finding a toilet nearby and a quiet spot to relax!"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Easy to get to using the MRT train system. Very extensive manicured gardens with beautiful sculptures and water features
,,Favorite part of Singapore,5.0,,"Because Singapore is so developed now and constantly under construction, I struggled to get a feel for the culture or city my first few days in town. It was when I visited the Botanic Gardens that I finally fell in love with Singapore (like I do every place I travel) and the well done and free gardens are well worth the visit. While the paths all tend to wander a bit, they are well marked with signs in case you want to see specific things. There are taxi stands around the edges of the park but I took the MRT to the Bukhit Timah gate and the entrance to the garden is immediately to your right as you exit the station. Couldn't be any easier. There's a pretty robust guest services station in the center of the garden with a shop, restaurants, guides, and nice restrooms."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Went here for a run, but would love to go back just to stroll through. Everything is very well maintained, well signed, and just pretty. I highly recommend a visit to this little oasis."
,,An opportunity to reconnect with nature on your own terms,4.0,,"A beautiful place to walk, relax and feel nature. If you are interested to learn about the different fauna and flora in Singapore, this is the perfect place. My dad is a landscaper and he loved it."
,,Absolutely breathtaking!,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are so vast and beautiful that they really do take your breath away, the bonsai tree area is beautiful and the garden displays are so immaculate.

The gardens are very humid and so this can make you tire quicker, so rest breaks are advised - there is ample seating areas with refreshments to purchase to help with this.

I enjoyed a delicious lunch at the on-site restuarant and would thoroughly reccommend it.

Whilst I was visiting there was a tropical thunderstorm whilst I was in the rainforest (which was quite scary) but the views were spectacular and although it was pouring with rain, I did not mind as it was warm, and welcomed since it was so hot that day.
I visited the gift shop before I left and purchased some gifts for family and friends - the gift shop was lovely with such good quality products. not over priced.

I returned to my hotel via the taxi rank outside the gardens - which was very punctual and frequent.

Would definitely return!"
,,A nice natural place within the city,4.0,,"Having such a quiet place in an urban environment is amazing. There are several parks within the park. A marvelous place for botanic experts and amateurs, it is also good to spend good time for families or just people wanting to have nice walks."
,,Lovely gardens but take insect repellant!,5.0,,"I think the mosquitoes saw me coming as I had 8 bites within half an hour of arriving so don't forget the insect repellant. I took a taxi from Marina Bay to the visitors centre at Nassim Gate for S$12. The visitors centre provided maps and lots of interesting information on the gardens. There are many unique areas of the park including a rainforest section (watch out for the mosquitoes), fernery, bonsai garden, ginger garden, lakes and herbs and spices to name a few. The map makes it easy to plot a route to see the things you want to see or you can just wander in any direction - none of them are bad! The gardens are free to visit and open from 5am until midnight. There is a charge for the Orchard Garden but at S$5 it is well worth it. Allow at least half a day but more if you are into flora and fauna. My only moan is that not many of the plants/trees were labeled but there are so many. They offer guided tours which would be worth it if interested. A few of the trails were closed due to maintenance and cutting back trees/plants but none of this affected my visit."
,,Definitely a must,5.0,,"By far, the best botanic gardens we've been until now. Singaporeans know how to put together a place for tourists that is also well used by locals. You will find not only plants, thematically groped, but also quite a few animals wandering around freely. Is a great spot to spend the evening. If you're a runner, take advantage of this place..."
,,Outstanding...but be prepared for the humidity,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens really are quite outstanding. They really are a ""must see"" if you have never been before. Be aware though Singapore is quite humid at the best of times, and the gardens in particular will test you. Not a place for suit and coat, or even jeans and a long sleeved shirt.
Really worth a visit."
,,Great place to relax,5.0,,"Very complete of different vegetation type around the globe all displayed in specific areas. Good education as they are all grouped per type of climate.
Some very rare species of trees are displayed. They are mature, large and impressive.
Tropical forest is interesting.
Layout is very pleasant, more or less presented as an English garden with pathways traveling from one area to another. Some small lakes and plenty of shade make it appropriate for a very warm day."
,,A very beautiful garden - but could be more compact,4.0,,"This is a very beautiful garden, i love how the Asian and tropical styles blend into using different plants and flowers from various regions of the world."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"A ""must do"" visit while in Singapore, allow half a day. Outstanding gardens and good facilities. Taxi from downtown only around S$10 so not worth the hassle of MRT plus bus."
,,A brilliant experience....and for free,5.0,,"We went for an explore around the Botanic Gardens in Singapore as it was rated so highly here on trip adviser. It most definitely deserves all the praise it receives. It is a beautiful experience to walk around and has many different areas to explore. There are explanations of some of the different flowers, plants and trees that you find as well. We spent about 3hrs there which was plenty for what we wanted.
All in all a good experience and at no cost!!!"
,,Paradise in the city,5.0,,"What an absolutely superb park and gardens. So many different types of gardens, all beautifully and respectfully maintained. Free entry. Definitely visit the orchid gardens too, which you can get to via these gardens."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Enjoyed the gorgeous botanic gardens and would like to stay closer to it next time, so I can do my daily morning walk there. I saw a lot of locals using it as a place to do their daily exercise.

Loved the Bonsai Trees which are open to the public to view."
,,Try the reflexology path barefoot,4.0,,"Relatively easy to get to and free. If you go make sure to pick up a map of the 53 acres of gardens. I liked the rainforest walk as it showed what Singapore may have once looked like. Still a few giant trees left to. The garden has many different areas including orchids, ginger garden and even some bonsai trees. Great place to come and escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore. One innovative trail was the reflexology path which you have to do barefoot.

Please hit helpful if you found the review useful."
,,Put it on your to-do list,4.0,,A great place to spend a few hours or more. The Orchid Garden is a must. Come prepared for the heat and sun and comfortable shoes! Something for everyone - even if you are not usually interested in gardens.
,,A free attraction that worth explore,4.0,,This place is beyond my expectation. The plants and facilities are well maintain for free admission. Easy access by MTR and signage is very clear. Nice walk even on a hot day.
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,"A perfect oasis to spend an afternoon. The evolution garden is particularly impressive and it's definitely worth exploring the orchid garden. Beautifully kept, good facilities and a must see in Singapore"
,,Under rated and a totally amazing experience,5.0,,"We had seen very little about the night show of the lights and it really wasn't at the top of our list! We got to the gardens just before dusk and had a wander around, finding the base area of the trees just before the show. This is a fantastic experience and really not to be missed, it happens twice a night and is so under promoted AND its all free unless you want to go on the high walk way."
,,Serene amongst the city,5.0,,"Such a treat to stroll around the grounds of the gardens so close to the city. The orchid gardens are beautiful and this is a great pocket in the city to read a book, relax and enjoy the surroundings."
,,Good attraction only for them who know Botany,3.0,,"Well ! we visited Singapore Botanic Garden during our first day of visit. The place might be heaven for Botany students, but we felt bore after sometimes. but it's surely a one time watch and magnificent green house dome is a must watch. The ticket cost is a bit high. But it is always good to buy attraction package deals when you visit Singapore from local agent.."
,,The most amazing garden,5.0,,Please visit I have nothing else to say. It took my breath away! One of the best tourist spots in Singapore ! If you are a nature lover or not you'll love this place. And nature lovers will never want to leave
,,Nice!,5.0,,Flowers plants awesome! The scenery was nice too I loved it a lot and so did my parents. We spent a lot of time there
,,The best orchid display ever!,5.0,,"We would need a week to fully explore this historic beauty spot. We focused on things. Enjoy and still found time to explore new and rare opportunities to see new and amazing plants and trees.
The most outstanding feature for us was the massive orchid garden, a spot not to be missed!"
,,A walk amongst beauty,5.0,,"This is a 50 to 60 acre garden/park. Beautifully maintained and run. It is full of history and all the exhibits are well marked. There is no fee to get in and once in there are several other exhibits to see. Great place for a run or a picnic and I would say it is a must visit if you are visiting Singapore.

The trees ar fascinating and many are very old will a lot of history. There are shops and refreshment areas"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,January 2013 - A must to visit it is spectacular - but if you are catching a taxi on a public holiday allow plenty of time to get back
,,Beautiful!!!!,5.0,,The gardens are huge!!! Very beautiful and worth the visit! You could spend almost a whole day there! Many restaurants for lunch also... Highly recommend!!!
,,"Great for a run, or picnic.",5.0,,Stayed close by so I was able to go for morning runs through the park which were very nice. Able to go back for afternoon walks which we really enjoyed. They have free concert series at the park on Sunday afternoons which are a lot of fun (check their website). The orchid garden is fantastic. Just a fun place to get lost and go for a walk.
,,Beautiful oasis in the city,5.0,,Spent a lovely few hours here. Orchid garden beautiful. Easy to get to. A nice respite from the concrete. Gorgeous.
,,great place to take the family.,5.0,,We walked through the botanic gardens to get to the Orchid gardens.Its lovely to walk through very well laid out and very pretty.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Really beautiful. Great place to escape in Singapore from the city noise and rush. Some parts requires additional paid ticket.
,,"Great place for birding, walks, 53 acres nicely maintained",5.0,,This is the place for a great walk; metro station drop you right in front of the place - and it is FREE entrance to the Gardens Inside if you want to go to other gardens you pay - 5 SGD for instance
,,Another tree and another tree,3.0,,"We wondered around for a few hours. It was peaceful and relaxing (as long as you got out of the way of the joggers), but after a while it was just boring. It is mostly trees - no diverse flowers or strange plants. But, maybe I am just jaded. If you enjoy meandering or sitting watching the water, then I am sure this is for you."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"This is a must see for anyone visiting Singapore. The cloud forest and the plants, the waterfall. Just wow, you have to see it to believe it. The floor can get a little slippery on the viewing bridge so be careful."
,,oasis in the city,5.0,,"one of my favorite places to hang out and take pictures. I never tire of the place,and have on many occasions have taken my picnic basket and enjoyed a few hours sitting on the grass slopes by the Shaw foundation theater listening to the free concerts. Plenty of fauna and flora for enthusiasts or just to walk around enjoying the greenery."
,,Great Place,4.0,,A very quiet place. Lot of opportunities for photo shoot. This place has been around for a long time. Upkeep is good.
,,A place to visit again and again,5.0,,"One of Asia's most well-established botanic gardens, this is a free attraction in Singapore, the world's most expensive city, and it's conveniently located for public transportation as well, thanks to a recently opened train line. The gardens are beautifully laid out and quite extensive, and contain lots of information on the flora represented. The Orchid Garden does have a fee, but it is well worth it, especially if you are a 'senior citizen', since seniors get a healthy discount. The gardens are so large that you can spend hours here and not see them all, particularly since there are also beautiful places, such as the lake, to simply sit and enjoy nature in the midst of this modern and very busy city."
,,Childrens Garden is peaceful and enjoyable,4.0,,"We had a fantastic morning in the Children's Garden and I thought it was extremely well designed and had a good mix of activities and peace! The kids cafe was ok but I would have liked a few healthier options on the menu. That is really my only tiny gripe. Otherwise it was clean, free and my daughter had a fab time."
,,fabulous!!,5.0,,My favourite place in Singapore! Super romantic and amazingly well maintained. Beautiful exotic trees and plants from all over the world. Restaurants in the middle are very cute too. A place out of time...number one park in South East Asia
,,Extensive Historical Oasis,5.0,,This historical garden located in the Tanglin area of the City of Singapore is well maintained and carries a large maintenance staff and is free entry
,,Mrs Mac,5.0,,"We met friends and their young daughter here for a day out. What a fantastic day we had here, some of the gardens you can walk around at no cost. The Skywalk and the Green houses which are the largest in the world I highly recommend, one greenhouse has a massive indoor waterfall and plants & flowers from all over the world. We had a meal in the restaurant here, superb"
,,Fabulous free attraction!,5.0,,"Absolutely lovely, clean, and lots of runners walkers and families. A nice way to spend morning. Also make sure that you visit the ginger and orchid gardens. It is well worth your time."
,,Halia,5.0,,Excellent service and food. The first visit was in October and we so impressed by the waiter and his knowledge and expalnations of each menu dish. As a result we booked the Christmas Brunch for three which again exceeded expectations. The surroundings are perfect either eating within or outside of the resaturant. A definite must do for newcomers to Singapore and tourists.
,,Good park,4.0,,This is very good park inside the city. It almost feels like an island of its own. Reasonably quiet and good variety of plants/flowers etc. I feel it needs better connectivity (in terms of public transport) from some of the major points in Singapore.
,,Orchids,5.0,,"Restaurant a little difficult to find, and very noisy when we did find it. We opted to eat elsewhere."
,,Beautiful and nice restaurant Halia,5.0,,"Can have a nice run, nice place to have lunch, lovely Nothing i did not like. It is close to st regis"
,,Stopover from Australia,5.0,,Very well worth visiting preferably in the early morning before it gets to hot Take your time to look at and view all the plants. Try and avoid Chinese New Year period
,,"So much to do, but bring your walking shoes",4.0,,"These are just some of the best gardens I have seen, but we were a little silly and didn't bring proper walking shoes, so we didn't get to see them all. But if you are wanting a free activity and if you have kids that just want to run around on the beautiful grass then this is the place for you."
,,An oasis in the middle of the city,5.0,,Has been years since I first went and glad I went back. An oasis in the middle of an urban jungle. trails well laid out with enough signage to make interesting reading. So neat as well. lots of locals and visitors and school kids enjoying the day. Must do
,,Lovely Walk,4.0,,Lovely peaceful place to walk around! Took about 2 hours to walk from one end to the other but well worth it - take a picnic if you can! though you can get food and drink there!
,,Crowded but very manageable!,4.0,,"Came here during the local school vacations, show groups doing exercises, and very much enjoyed the lovely orchids. A pleasant experience. Flowers are labeled nicely. Don't miss the VIP named ones including Margret Thacher and Princess Diana!"
,,Free and Beautiful,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a must see attraction in Singapore. A breathtaking garden in the city. Some areas are filled with people others can be a private retreat. You can spend as much or as little time as you like. bUt, this is a nice escape from the city!"
,,A Must See,5.0,,So glad we took this in. It was beautiful! We even had a few school bands performing for us on our visit. They were amazing!
,,Amazing,5.0,,Incredible but hot so go early. Unbelievable place not to be missed. Orchids are highlight! Avoid gift shop.
,,"Free, varied, well-designed",5.0,,"Easily accessible from the MRT system, and benefiting from free admission. Clear differences between the landscape 'European' areas and lake, and the retained virgin jungle. Specimens well-labelled. Worthwhile."
,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,Nature lovers should go here! there are many varieties of beautiful flowers to look at. I had gone there during the tulip festival and enjoyed it thoroughly there.
,,Picturesque and naturally beautiful,5.0,,"Again, a must see attraction away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Need a whole day there. Don't forget the National Orchid garden while you are there. Loved the Swan lake. Undulating hills and walks and lovely atmosphere."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,The Children's Garden is fantastic! And it's free of charge. Also great for runners and other exercise enthusiasts.
,,"More like a large park, but pretty",4.0,,"I enjoyed walking through the botanic gardens, which were more like a large park. Its a nice break from the city."
,,Easy to reach besides Botanical Garden MRT,4.0,,A must to see thing in Singapore which I missed in my previous trip few years back.Eco garden is beutiful.But I have enjoyed best my walk through the rain forest.Eateries within the garden is praiseworthy.One must have an umbrella during walking.
,,Average,3.0,,A nice garden within the city. Nothing really specular to note other than a few good restaurants within the garden
,,Lovely garden,4.0,,"The garden is a lovely oasis in the middle of so much concrete. Signs need to be improved as it was difficult to follow the posted signs. We managed to take a loop that we did not want to be on and in the heat this was not great. We had to walk a long distance to get to the Orchid Garden, so be sure to check transit drop off points. Food in the park is very expensive, but we did find a sandwhich shop just outside the Orchid Garden and their prices were good. Take lots of water with you it is a huge park and the heat can be exhausting. Go early in the morning before the heat builds up and take an umbrella for shade or unexpected showers."
,,Great place to relax and see wildlife too!,5.0,,"It's one of the most accessible park in Singapore and is huge! With a keen eye, there are many beautiful birds, reptiles, squirrels, butterflies, etc to be seen! It's a great place to relax, have a picnic or do your workouts."
,,"Too much heat, too much walk",2.0,,"Remember Singapore is sunny and hot. The Gardens do not provide much shade. And it is a long walk to the Orchid Garden from the underground station entrance. On the whole, the visit could turn out to be very tiring and uncomfortable. Not recommended for the weak and those who do not like heat. The Gardens should consider providing some form of internal transport. Unless you are really interested in plants and treat this as an educational rather than leisure visit, it is probably not worth the effort.
Since it would be another long walk to the underground station entrance after visiting the Orchid Garden, the visitor will likely leave by the exit at the other end. There is no underground station there. You have to rely on buses or taxi but the latter is never easy to find on the road."
,,An oasis in the concrete jungle,5.0,,It was a delight to spend a few hours wandering around the gardens and such a relief from the traffic and noise. Well laid out its easy to walk around and enjoy. It's free too!!! The orchid area has an admission charge but it's well worth it. Don't miss this
,,Birthday treat,5.0,,"This was out third visit here - 2004, 2014 and this one. We are keen gardeners and love plants so this was a wonderful day for us, particularly seeing exotic flowers that we, sadly cannot possibly grow in the U.K. We had not seen the Evolution Garden before and found that very interesting."
,,Great way to spend the morning,4.0,,Walked here from our hotel in Orchard Rd easy to find and a lovely big park lots of different sections and large pond with plenty of fish and turtles
,,A beautiful garden,5.0,,"The botanic garden is spread over a large area with many sections. Variety of trees, plants and flowers are available. People come with family to enjoy picnic. An interesting garden for botany students and photography lovers. A refreshing place for morning and evening walkers. One can spend full day in this garden."
,,Very exiting walk in the jungle AND free of charge:),4.0,,We really enjoyed the walk in the jungle were we saw a very big monitor lizard and many small ones as well. Fantastic park. Would recommend to bring a pick-nick bag and enjoy the park even more. We missed that and had hard to get a lunch due to TET.
,,"Beautiful, extensive, but hot outdoors",4.0,,Gorgeous and extensive gardens. Bring plenty of water and a change of shirt because it is hot and you will sweat. I drank two bottles of water in about 1.5 hours and had to change before going to a restaurant because my shirt was soaked through.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Lovely exotic collection of trees and plants in a restful atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the city.very pretty lake area and some nice gentle walking paths dotted with unusual features..Also good selection of cafes/ restaurants on site for reasonable lunch/ coffee stops. H
,,True Oasis,5.0,,"Being from SE Asia, I was aware of many varieties of bamboos, but I was awed by the collection here. The collection of tropical plants seen here are really mind-boggling.
Even a walk through the garden is quite illuminating and will shed off the fast-mechanical lifestyle of Singapore."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"The orchards were breathtaking, and very unusual plants and trees and nice recreation and picnic area"
,,One of the nicest,5.0,,"We have been to botanical gardens in many cities throught the world, and this was one of the very nicest. If you like plants and flowers, don't miss it."
,,Disappointing Orchid Gardens,3.0,,"We set a day aside to attend the very much talked about gardens. Walked around, but found very little information on plants & trees. The National Orchid Gardens were a bit of a let down. Expected a lot more flowers. Some displays were great, but there was not that many flowers. A bit more variety of flowers would make it better."
,,A must do for Singapore,5.0,,The Botanical Gardens and The National Orchid Garden have to be one of the most wonderful sights in Singapore. We spent a wonderful afternoon there with my camera working overtime. It was amazing and I'd love to return.
,,beautiful,5.0,,"it is a great garden, almost like a forest. lol. very big aswell so get ready to walk your legs off. everyone should go and see it"
,,"Great, especially the orchids",5.0,,"Entrance to the orchid gardens was 5 dollars but the rest of the park is free. It's hours are 5 a.m. to midnight (but the orchid garden is 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.).

We were going to go to Sentosa Island on the second day but decided to skip it in favor of two days here.

There's and MRT station in one corner and many park-related activities: joggers, yoga, tai chi, etc. There are some food & drink establishments and several water fountains scattered throughout. My favorite spots were the ginger garden and the orchid garden. If you like to take pictures of flowers then you can spend a long time doing so."
,,Still as good!,5.0,,"Not sure why it is ""difficult to find"" as one reviewer says, as the MTR has a ""Botanical Gardens"" station, which is surely the easiest way to approach it.
After the bustle of Singapore this is still an oasis of calm, and has not been overshadowed by the Gardens by the Bay. The Orchid Garden is a must, and we did not see everything despite having a day there."
,,Nice place to have a walk,5.0,,The government keep the botanical garden clean and organised. It is a good place for me to walk around or even just sit for a while after long walking. Great tropical plant feel and let you forget the working pressure.
,,I wish I could have spent longer here,5.0,,"There is so much to see at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The gardens are beautifully presented. Take a tour through the evolution garden, marking the journey from the beginning of our planet to the present day. There is a small fee to visit the National Orchid Garden but it is money well spent.
There are many different sections to visit"
,,PERFECT DAY OUT!,5.0,,"Serene place for a weekend dayout. You can jog around, have a picnic or just a nice walk. Their plant collection are good too. when you feel hungry after doing your dayout activities, you can go to the food shop or you can start munching your packed foods from home:)"
,,Delightful oasis,5.0,,"Difficult to find, but worth it. Lots of atmosphere and many distinct sections. Allow at least a couple of hours to fully enjoy."
,,Beautiful and also peaceful,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden here is a must. It is larger than you initially think it is, so allow a couple of hours minimum to see its many gardens. It has an MRT(subway) station, so is easy to access. Everything here is immaculate, much like the rest of Singapore."
,,Nice!,5.0,,Love the rain forest and the orchids. But they need to provide some benches where visitors can rest for a while.
,,Enjoyed the National Orchid Garden,4.0,,Was pleasantly surprised by the varieties of orchids in the gardens. Really enjoyed the walk around it - lovely lovely lovely
,,A lovely walk around!,5.0,,Well thought out & plenty of shaded areas to sit. Great sculptures & easy access. Good chance to get away from the bustle of the shops!
,,A peaceful oasis in the middle of a hectic and modern city,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are just wonderful. You could spend 1 to 5 hours strolling around, admiring unknown flowers and plants, smelling the scent of the Ginger Garden or the Fragrance Garden, reading the healing properties of plants, taking photos of the thousands of orchids, or simply relaxing to the calming pace of nature.
It is easily reachable by MRT, it's free of charge (but for the Orchids Garden), and it is clean and perfectly organised and kept."
,,Great gardens,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, the orchid gardens are enclosed in botanical but the gardens themselves have a wide variety of plants , very well maintained oaths and entry is free!"
,,Pleasant to stroll through,4.0,,Liked the bonsai trees and the sense of space inside a busy city. There are lots of paths but the plentiful maps mean you never get lost.
,,"education, relax and beuty all in one",5.0,,"What a place! Simply amazing! This garden is perfect place to relax, have a walk around or just sit on the grass at the lake or somwhere in a shadow of the tree. It is divided to several parts, each one dedicated to certain group of plants or teritory. For me the most interesting was evolution garden, where is shown how the life and flora developes from basic cell to wide range of plants known these days. Another exceptional part is orchid garden with hundreds varietes in all colors and shapes you can imagine. There is free entrance to the garden, except for orchid and ginger garden they charge SGD 5."
,,A Breathaking Place,5.0,,"An amazing place which is a must see if you visit Singapore. A place of tranquillity and peace with the most amazing displays off Flowers, trees and shrubs and in particular the orchids."
,,Something for everyone!,5.0,,"This is a very large garden and all of it is free except the National Orchid Garden. There is really too much to see on one visit, but you can choose the ginger section, for example, walk by the little lake or do the dell and there are several restaurants if you need a bite or a meal. And many historic and unusual trees."
,,Beautiful Garden,4.0,,Peaceful garden where you can go for a walk in the morning to relax. Lots of exotic plants to take pictures with. There's even a orchid garden and ginger garden inside.
,,Lovely gardens away from the bustle,5.0,,"On a metro stop for easy access. Extensive walkways with all kinds of species of tropical plants. Bring an umbrella to provide shade from the sun, even when visiting in late afternoon (it's really hot and humid). Modern sculptures compliment the natural surroundings. Plenty of places to have a nice picnic."
,,What a sight its great,5.0,,"Lots walking around here, pay the extra go into other displays well worth it, the domes are good. lots plants flowers ect things you would not expect to see here."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The gardens are worth a walk through. They are very large and tricky to navigate, the colorful map was a little confusing.
Because we started at the MRT station the first part was mainly open fields, some disappointing fruit trees and rather hot but once you make it further in there is shade and rainforest areas which are beautiful."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Very nice, some features cost money but the remainder although free is very nice, lots to see and plenty of photo opportunity. Stunning cafe surrounded by water features, perfect for lunch or just a coffee"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"The best botanic garden I've ever been in my life. Totally a must when in Singapore. It's divided into many smaller gardens (not small at all, though) like Ginger Garden, Orchid Garden, Healing Garden, Herb&Spices Garden and many many more. A great place to spend a day (or even two if you're a fan of plants)."
,,A Garden of Eden,5.0,,"One of the best of the many botanical gardens we have visited worldwide. Beautifully laid out, spectacular variety, wonderfully labeled, and free and e easily accessible, the Botanical Gardens is a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of Singapore."
,,Very rewarding,5.0,,"If you have visited the Eden Project in the UK, look no further. This has many similarities and well worth a visit."
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"I absolutely loved the Singapore Botanic Gardens. First (and perhaps most notably) it's FREE...which definitely can't be said of many things in Singapore. Secondly, it's probably the most impressive gardens that I've ever been to. I would suggest going early in the day because it quickly gets hot, as well as bug spray, but you could easily spend hours roaming the gardens. For groups, it may be fun to bring a picnic lunch and find a nice area to sit and eat."
,,night time is best,5.0,,"i like all and night time is best, bring a good camera and plenty of water. the place is far so be ready early and make sure you booked in advance for the night safari."
,,Totally Blooming Magical and Terrific,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens are simply wonderful. Planted in British colonial times, they have survived, thrived and bloomed into one of the great botanic gardens of the world. We strolled along the winding paths for four hours including time in the fragrance area, ferns, orchids, and many other treats for the senses. The gardens also are quiet - serene even - and provide an opportunity to recover from the rush of Singapore life. The gardens include a number of interesting restaurants as well, so your tummy will behave while your senses are delighted and your emotions calmed. The gardens are free too! What more could you ask? If you are in Singapore, don't miss them. If not, go to Singapore. Why not?"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Stunning! Perfect day out, long walks, landscapes, history, lives up to the hype. We loved it! Enough said really. You have to see to believe."
,,Serene,5.0,,"This was a highlight to my holiday. Such a lot to see and all for free. Beautiful scenery, lots of flowers, a place to sit and have coffee and beautiful areas to walk in"
,,Splendid,5.0,,The best botanical gardens we have seen do far.And it is free apoart from the orchid house which cost only few dollars for admission. The garden is like an oasis.Beautifully kept and labeled with magnificent trees and rain forest walk.In addition there is a cold house and a misty house.The orchid garden is out of this world. The gardens are very large so one needs a whole day to see most of it.We came to visit the gardens two times during our short stay in Singapore and still haven't managed to see it all.It is a delight.
,,Must visit here,5.0,,Very peaceful and tranquil despite being so close to the main shopping area. A haven for wildlife and flora and fauna lovers.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"A must see if visiting Singapore, we spent more than one day there and still did not see everything, we will return next year and complete this beautiful attraction"
,,A Singapore Highlight,5.0,,"These Botanical Gardens should be on everyone's list of things to see in Singapore. The large parkland provides a great escape from the hustle of the city. As others have mentioned, the gardens are large with small side trails highlighting different types of plants, trees, and forests. Best of all, the gardens are free. Do not miss the Ginger Gardens, and if you are a tourist, spend the $5.00 to see the Orchid Garden. Birders also seem to ""flock"" to the park as there seem to be a good variety of species in the park."
,,Plant paradise,5.0,,What a marvellous place. The gardens are beautifully kept and the orchids were perfection. The shop is filled with lovely things and I felt overall that this made the trip to Singapore perfect.
,,... for a nice stroll,3.0,,Just a regular park but has a children's playground with some 'pretty scary' slides and a small water playground. Nice but only recommended if you are not too far.
,,Fantastic open gardens,5.0,,"Such a treasure in a busy city to find such pretty, open space. Filled with many specimens and themed gardens. Spent a pleasant few hours here. Nice gift shop with unusual products too."
,,Afternoon stroll,5.0,,"There's nothing to really dislike about these gardens. They are very well maintained, litter free, as is all of Singapore, and it's so nice to see people enjoying the gardens and just generally having fun."
,,Essential visit,5.0,,"I come here every time I'm in Singapore. A great garden with many features and exotic plants, an orchid garden, a rain forest, a bonsai garden, a ginger garden and more. It is simply amazing."
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"We visited this place on our second trip to Singapore, it is a must see! the sky walkways are great and the indoor gardesn are terrific, especially when it is hot and humid there, which is most of the year. I highly recommend a visit here when in Singapore."
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are truly impressive. Pay the small fee and go thru the orchid gardens, you won't regret it. We were there on a Monday so we were not able to go to the Children Garden and the next time it was after 6 and closed but it looked fabulous. And it is free."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"I wasn't sure at first that this place was going to be as good as I expected, but I was totally wrong with expectations!
The place is so big--that there are lovely fields of grass and art pieces placed around--just didn't seem very ""gardeny"" to me.
But--once I moved through the place, I realized how much there was! Wear your walking shoes--it's huge!
I spent 3 or 4 hours--until I was worn out---and I spent the pittance to visit the orched garden which was a highlight of the visit.
Don't miss this if you like gardens!"
,,"Large and diverse Garden features orchids, ginger, fragrance and medicinal gardens",4.0,,"The Botanic Garden is free and there are sign posts telling you where things are, but even so we got lost. There are mini gardens within the Botanic Garden so make sure you get a map before you get too far into it. We went during the ""cool and dry"" season, but it rained for a little while so suggest you take an umbrella which you can also use to shield you from the sun. There are restaurants scattered throughout the garden with clean air conditioned bathrooms which provide a nice respite from the heat or humidity7. Wear very comfortable shoes because you will walk a lot more than you think - there are so many things to see. Make sure you hit the gift shop. They have herbs and teas for purchase and beautiful carrier bags!"
,,Singapore Botanical Gardens Relaxing Stroll,5.0,,"I have visited this place before. It is nice to get out of the hustle and bustle of the city for a lovely stroll. Now I hate gardening but I appreciate flora and fauna! Its cool to check out the different kinds of plants including the weird ones! They have special Gardens within that are free to enter or require a fee like the National Orchid Garden - only $5.
I went in the evening as it was cooler. We then had dinner at Food for Thought located within the Botannical Gardens. (Food is European and was delish!)
Worth a look if you want to do something relaxing and free."
,,Superb gardens.,5.0,,"Just the most wonderful gardens- amazing views of beautiful plants and trees in all directions. Beautifully laid out- paths easy to follow. Plenty of shade, delightful lakes. Within minutes of entering the gardens the peace is broken only by birdsong. One visit leaves one wishing to return for more. An absolute joy."
,,Don't rush this,4.0,,"Beautifully laid out covering a large area, so don't try it all in one go. The cafe by the entrance was also very reasonable and a welcome stopping point. Take a brolly to cater for any sudden downpours!"
,,"Enjoy the environment, nice!",3.0,,"At a small country like Singapore, having this Botanic Gardens is really a good thing. I saw lots of people there and I don't think they are tourists, they are Singaporean residents having fun, they had picnic and that is the first time I saw the Indian tradition of using hand to eat food. I saw a couple having a wedding photoshoot or some students with graduation gowns taking pictures of each other. There is a lake which I remember they call it Swan Lake (I don't know if I remember it right) but I didn't see any swans at all. Instead of that, I saw lots of baby turtles, it's fun though. Or this is just because I went on a ""crowded"" day and I got luck to see those moments :).

But it seems there are nothing much to do there besides sight-seeing. So if anyone likes outdoor activities, I don't think this is a must-do thing. Instead of that, you can enjoy the Palau Ubin Island with kayaking or cycling. It's amazing!

I was there in August 2013"
,,fantastic gardens,4.0,,Botanic gardens are lovely - we also went in to the orchid house which was also very well presented. the botanic gardens are well kept with lots of interesting statues and wild life. we saw two monitor lizards on this visit! very relaxing place well worth a visit
,,Beautiful Gardens with lots of exotic plants,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are definetly one of the numerous Highlights in Singapore. Just take a short drive with the Metro and find a relaxing oasis in the frantic City. It offers lots of exotic plants, especially recommendable is the rainforest section."
,,A quiet & calm oasis,5.0,,"Despite being a boiling hot day, we found this beautiful botanic garden a lovely place to wander around in, sip a coffee and have a lovely lunch. The lake had swans, tiny turtles and butterflies skimming the water. Lovely in a busy city."
,,Amazingly beautiful Gardens,5.0,,Why didn't I visit these Gardens earlier? Amazingly beautiful and peaceful environment! I Will certainly visit them more often! Entrance to the orchids Gardens is free of charge to singaporeans And work pass holders.
,,Relaxing,5.0,,Great to walk around and just chill out. Many different plants to look at and admire. The displays are lovely.
,,Exceptional Botanical Gardens,5.0,,During a three day visit to Singapore we visited this amazing place. The gardens were immaculately maintained and well laid out. I don't believe that I have ever seen so many different kinds of orchids. Our visit was during the Chinese New Year celebrations so the gardens were even more colorful. Strongly recommend a visit while in Singapore.
,,Amazing and free,5.0,,"What a place! Easy to reach as the entrance is literally next to the MRT station, we paid the S$5 to visit the orchid house. Even saw a free concert on the stage."
,,Get Lost In The Orchids,5.0,,"We had a very pleasant afternoon at the Botanic Gardens. The tropical, lush green and colorful displays make you want to stay there for hours. For those who appreciate the beauty in flowers, there are so many orchid species there and you can spend hours just trying to photograph them. We highly recommend visiting the Gardens"
,,"Fabulous gardens, orchids were beautifuL",5.0,,"All the flowers and wildlife, we walked around the gardens all afternoon, preparations were going on for the Chinese new year."
,,Nice change from the city,5.0,,Went here to see another side to Singapore. This is a nice diversion from the city sightseeing and is a peaceful haven. Well worth a visit.
,,Orchid garden is the only good part,3.0,,"Too big, set a time when visiting, otherwise you'd be stock here for hours, definitely see the orchid garden it is beautiful"
,,A must see.,5.0,,A huge acreage of beautiful & interesting trees plants & shrubs of all varieties from such a range countries. The Gardens are carefully laid out & every area is clearly signposted with directions & distances to each.
,,So so,4.0,,Came here in the rainny day. Nice place but looks a bit blue. Should spend your time in other places in Singapore.
,,Awesome orchid garden,4.0,,"Dont miss orchid garden ínside Botanic Gardens in Singapore. Seniors, even foreigners only pay 1$ to get in orchid garden, regular fee is 5$ sin. Well worthed. Botanic garden is free.
Gardens at the Bay ground is very beautiful and free too. We paid 16$ to enter the Flower Dome, don't do it , so boring, all the flowers are commonly seen in other gardens and even your backyard. The only thing I have not seen is the bottle trees from Africa. That's it. We have not seen the Cloud Forest.
This is my 3rd time to Singapore. The city is not as clean as before, I saw plenty of trash, bottles, cigarette butts in the streets.
Taxi drivers are generally honest, but there are different surcharge depending on the time, either you flagged down the taxi or you ask the hotel to call the taxi .We had 2 incidents where the taxi
driver overcharge us. Ask for receipt if you suspect so, the total amount on receipt must match what you are asked to pay. Our driver just come up with an amount more than 9 $ then the receipt even when we question him . He must think we are stupid , that we would not know what to do. The receipt has a hotline number to complain so we did complain. The matter was resolved within 1 h , he was given a warning and return 10 $ to my hotel. I have to say Singapore has excellent customer services every where"
,,Really beautiful gardens that are definitely worth visiting,4.0,,"Went yesterday as part of a city tour trip and only had forty minutes at the garden; but what a beautiful tranquil place. Liked it so much, thinking of heading back to spend a little more time there. A really vibrant and rich diversity of colours greet you, along with a fantastic open parkland area and picturesque lake. Really nice place to hang out and chill, suggest maybe getting a picnic and enjoying the open space."
,,Deserving of the praise.,5.0,,"For the price (free), I cannot think of any public gardens that would rival these. Impeccably clean (as is most of Singapore), well thought out and very usable. There are smaller areas with diverse plant arrangements and large, open areas that cater to relaxing and having a picnic. Descriptions of plantings are frequent and well done. Little asides such as the 'Evolution Walk' would be highlights of smaller parks, but are all but forgotten here due to the magnitude of the overall gardens.
If your tolerance for gardens is limited, you will soon be overwhelmed as there is no natural flow to the layout and you can get frustrated by the meandering paths and endless choices. If you enjoy aimlessly wandering around (probably) the most impressive urban gardens in the world, you will be in heaven.
Also- we showed up late on a Friday morning and got breakfast at one of the cafes, which was PACKED but surprisingly affordable (for Singapore) and decent quality."
,,Beautiful and tranquil!,5.0,,"We visited in the morning this week and it was beautiful. The grounds are well maintained, the areas are well signposted and the orchid garden, although there is a small charge, is delightful. Swan lake is lovely with it's coi carps and turtles. You could easily spend half a day here as it's a large area to walk around. The whole place is very well maintained and was a pleasure to visit, a lovely retreat. To get there, the MRT runs straight to Botanic Gardens, walk through the park to Orchard, then get on a bus to Orchard Road for some shopping. A visit to Botanic Gardens is a must when in hectic Singapore."
,,Superb,5.0,,One of the highlights of a brief stopover enroute to Australia. Acres of beautifully kept gardens with plants of every kind.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning is too put it mildly. I had read several reviews and knew that this was one place that I had to visit. The National Orchid Garden inside is out of this world. And just so you are aware, the ""Hop on hop off"" bus service stops here, so make sure that this is one place that you visit."
,,What is there not to love?,5.0,,"This is my favourite garden in the world. Beating Sydney/ Melbourne botanical gardens, the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo, Luxemburg garden in Paris etc.
ITs simply superb. The care and attention to detail is everywhere and reflects a great love of the staff, not just the management. The variety of species and the number of themed gardens sets the Singapore Garden apart form the others.
Its on my list...every time I visit Singapore."
,,Walking thru the Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"Walked along the lake and the rainforest trails. Both are excellent places to stroll, stop and enjoy. Many more trails and places to stop and relax, but we did not have the time. Worth the fee.

Went about noon on a pleasant day, stayed about 3 hours. Got to see the Orchid House and Garden. For Orchid lovers, this is outstanding. More varieties than one can imagine; plus, dozens and dozens of most varieties. The VIP area was equally interesting."
,,Tranquil and Excellent Value,5.0,,It cost next to nothing to spend a peaceful morning here. I especially enjoyed the orchid and ginger gardens and the rainforest. This was the first city I visited on my tour of South East Asia. What surprised me most was that I saw few birds during my entire trip even in this beautiful park.
,,Oasis in busy city,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are well worth a visit (easy walk from the top of Orchard Road). Walk around and look at some of the amazing trees etc. and make sure to go round the Orchid Garden too.
,,Beautifully landscaped and very well maintained,5.0,,"The Botanic gardens in Singapore is verdant green and worth a visit or two or ten!!
The stage setup for performances is in such a unique setting and I could just imagine how wonderful it would be to see a performance there!

Parts of the garden are free but the Orchard garden is a paid attraction. But Orchard garden is a ""must visit"" place.

There are good restaurants on the premises as well as excellent gift shops!

You need to spend at least half a day to absorb the beauty of the place, but even if you are short on time, I would strongly recommend a visit - go directly to the Orchid garden in that case."
,,Lovely place to visit!,5.0,,"If you have time to spare, go to the botanical gardens. Beautiful settings and a nice break from the busy city."
,,Gem in the city,5.0,,Free for entry. Well organised. Clean. With different birds and lizards living freely here. Very convenient to access. Worth for a walk or easy birding.
,,"Very, very nice!!!",5.0,,"Such a beautyfull garden, very nice for a couple of hours silence!!!If you need a little battery recharge from work or a busy day, just go there and enjoy the beauty of this place..."
,,Completely Destressing!!,5.0,,"I just love it! Completely relaxing and a great place to just sit down unwind, take in nature and perfect jogging trail. It was my first visit and most definitely the first of many!"
,,When you want relaxation,5.0,,"I went to Singapore and found it very clean and nice.
Everything is in order and clean.

I would recommend everyone to go to the botanical garden with exotic vegetation from all over Asia, but first of all it has good spaces for families and children to relax and enjoy nature."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"A lovely day out walking around the botanical gardens. Well laid out and sign posted. The orchid garden was impressive and the evolution garden was rather interesting. Sculptures were also a nice addition. Make sure you have good walking shoes and a hat/shade umbrella as it can get a bit hot. Also have a water bottle although there are some drinking water fountains scattered around the gardens. Although the gardens are free to enter, there is a small charge to enter the orchid garden but well worth it."
,,Orchid display just wonderful,5.0,,"Who knew there were so many orchids in the world! The wonderful display at the Botanic Gardens certainly is a place of serenity in a busy city (especially during Lunar New Year celebrations). A lovely place to visit on a hot and humid day. Worthwhile to plan your visit to the gardens and know what bus and gate to enter, as the gardens are quite spread out."
,,Varied Parkland,5.0,,"A very nice park with varied scenes and some interesting modern sculpture. Not many facilities, you have to search out a sandwich bar in the children area. The offering was limited for lunch but cheap and pleasant. Overall the vistas are very attractive. You will find the Orchid gardens here which have further catering and the entry fee is well worth it if you have time."
,,Very good and free entry,5.0,,"Excellent gardens, very varied and a great green oasis in a busy city. Like all of Singapore they are spotlessly clean and well tended. Worth a visit, but go early in the day to avoid the heat."
,,A beautiful oasis from the hustle & bustle of the city,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed walking around these beautiful gardens, the wildlife adds that extra something that you can't help smiling about"
,,A lovely green haven in a huge city,3.0,,"I nice place just to relax ,its such a nice place ,my only moan is don't people in Singapore use a bin ,I sat down ,next to a McDonald's bag and wrappers from subway ,there were empty cans just scattered around its such a shame ,its a lovely place to visit ,but where I was sat I looked like a tip"
,,Oasis in the city,5.0,,"The park is about 2 miles long and grassy areas give way to tropical rainforests, the healing gardens to fragrant gardens, all encompassed by the growing modern city. A good half a day spent here is well worth the effort."
,,My wife and I spent a very nice peaceful day here,5.0,,The amount of space in the park even when its busy You can still find a quite place to take in the scenery.
,,Best Botanic Gardens I'd Seen,5.0,,"A delight to visit. Large area with many interesting areas well demarcated. Really enjoyed walking around looking at the various plants we take for granted. The lake was a surprise with an abundance of turtles. Best part was probably the wonderful display of orchids.
January a good time of year to go with reduced heat"
,,Breakfast and a Walk,3.0,,"We ate breakfast here to remind us of the times when we visited at weekends when we lived here. We had orange juice - freshly squeezed, coffee and toast and butter. The surroundings are fairly basic but the chairs are comfortable and the tables are cleared quite frequently although the tabletops are not exactly pristine. This particular day was very busy and a group of young children were eating there as well. The cost was reasonable and we were able to see visitors coming and going as well as the lovely view of the edge of the Botanic Gardens. After our breakfast we had a stroll and just marvelled at this lovely place!"
,,good,3.0,,The majority of the park is free while the Orchid area charges a small fee. The lake there holds a host of fish and turtles
,,Botanic Gardens,4.0,,"Lovely walk great scenery really tranquil spot in the busy city. Well worth a visit, gardens are free but you pay for the Orchid garden."
,,A HAVEN IN THE CITY,5.0,,"A friend who lives in Singapore took us to this place at sunset.Its very peacful and tranquil and it feels like you could be anywhere in the World walking through the gardens.

Its spotlessly clean and is a world away from the City centre although we walked to it from Orchid Road."
,,"Pleasant, beautiful flowers , garden well kept, very big.",4.0,,"Very big gardens. Wear really comfortable shoes and light clothing. Its worth visiting. Lots of original flowers you don't see everywhere, small water falls, lots and lots of greenery. Souvenir shops which I found expensive.
Worth going for sure especially if you enjoy walking amongst flowers and greenery and taking beautiful memorable pictures."
,,Exceptional nature's beauty,5.0,,"A large park with some of the finest Orchids seen. only some sections were with a fee and those were optional.

Gives a good feel of a semi-tropical forest as well...buzz around of various fauna amongst the lovely flora! Casual, languid walking amongst some well-kept natural greenery...really bright green. A great photo-op as they have made various designs using the natural landscape for Orchids."
,,Much better than Gardens by the Bay!,4.0,,"This is my favorite place to relax in Singapore. I love walking from the Botanic Gardens MRT station (on the new Circle Line) down to the Napier road entrance. I highly recommend the heritage tree walk and the evolution Garden walk, as these trees are beautiful and give a good insight into tropical flora. Unlike the tacky, touristy Gardens by the bay, the Botanic Gardens has shade, history, and it feels genuine since it is a 175 year old institution, instead of a 3 year old tourist trap by a casino on reclaimed land. Pity that the weather is awful year round."
,,Lovely!,4.0,,The gardens were impressive and extremely large and free which is hard to come by in Singapore. You really felt like you had escaped the city. The lake there holds a host of fish and turtles that want you to feed them (so I suggest taking some fish food along). We spent a couple of hours strolling around although it was extremely hot and humid. Take a picnic/drinks as the shop was really pricey.
,,Spend a day exploring this gem,5.0,,"The park is deceptively large. It was easy to spend an entire day here, but at the end of the day I was able to have seen everything of interest. The majority of the park is free while the Orchid area charges a small fee. It seemed that many of the orchids in some of the exhibits had been brought in in bloom and had not bloomed on site. Other Orchid were clearly in their native habitat and bloomed more ""naturally"". The Orchid cool house was amazing with a nice variety of Orchid and very interesting group of pitcher plants. The free area has a fascinating selection of bamboos, great rain forest walk, nice small bonsai collection, and very interesting marsh walk. I think that anyone interested in horticulture would enjoy spending the day here while a family with young children would probably suffice with half a day. The children's Garden is great and the Evolution Garden is not to be missed by children or adults."
,,Think twice about what you want out of your Singapore trip before going,3.0,,"I think this is a good Botanical Gardens. However, I’m not sure if it’s for everyone.

If you like nature, exotic flowers and walking around parks, it’s a good choice.

If you’re looking to do something exciting and different, your time might be better invested elsewhere.

Also, if you’re not sure about going, recommend that your research in advance to see if anything special is in bloom. I went in February and there wasn't much in bloom so made for a less exciting visit."
,,Serene and highly enjoyable,5.0,,"A fun day out walking around the gardens. a bit of a trek to get there, but definitely worth it. the highlight was the orchid garden which was $5 entry! There are lots of places to sit and have a picnic and just relax! Went with my boyfriend and had a wonderful time learning about the history and enjoying the serenity! It is definitely the quietest and most peaceful part of Singapore, it was so relaxing, I loved walking through the peaceful rainforest! I wish I had more time to explore it! I would definitely go back. There are MRT stations all around which makes it easy to get to. Bring your camera as there are some amazing scenes that you will want to capture. Should be top 5 on your list in Singapore!"
,,A patch of green in a concrete city,4.0,,"You would need about 1 hour or more to fully explore this garden. Located about 30 minutes walk from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road is this quite stretch of greenery where you can find the Orchid garden and some of Singapore's most exotic plants. I was there on a weekday evening after a shopping spree at the shopping centers and you can see bunches of locals winding their day down. Good place for a picnic, a jog or stroll with your pets."
,,Expansive and beautiful,5.0,,"This place is massive, and has so many things to look at, experience and read. Would definitely recommend taking a picnic and spending the day there; lovely."
,,An oasis in Singapore,3.0,,"The Botanical Gardens in Singapore cover a large area, a couple of miles from the city centre. The Metro station is right by the gate, so it is easy to get there. They are well laid out, and the locals make good use of the gardens for picnics, etc. The gardens comprise mostly trees and open spaces, and we saw several unusual species of birds, as well as several monitor lizards ( including one which was easily over a metre long). Overall, the gardens are worth a visit, but the highlight for us was the Orchid Garden (see separate review)."
,,My best walk through a park,5.0,,"Want some quiet time and a great walk?? Go to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. An endless variety of plants can be found every step of the way. I was lucky and even got to see a snake slithering through the thick foliage. Make sure you carry your camera as there are several stunning sights. The greenery all around calms the nerves and the peaceful environment makes you forget you are in the heart of the city. On occasion there is an orchestra playing at the Shaw Foundation amphitheater in the park. Even if you are visiting Singapore for a few days, do go to the park. It's worth it."
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"I just wanted to find a sleeping corner, it was serene....... A lot of thought went into the planning of the garden, there were a whole lot of people there taking pictures. I wish I had more time to explore it more than I did"
,,Very peaceful and fresh,4.0,,"The garden is huge and makes for a good place to go for a peaceful walk, the lake is pretty and there are a few eating places in between as well, with outdoor seating. Overall, good experience if you're looking for a tranquil getaway from the city."
,,A great day out,4.0,,"This is my second time here and I found it again, greatly enjoyable and being an aspiring biologist, also great from the scientific point of view.
You'll have to be carefuly using the Botanical Gardens MRT station because it poises you from the exact opposite end of the main entrance and it's a long winding walk to where the main attractions are. Also, it really matters what weather you come in. Whole parts of the park, the lake included, were very dried up when I visited this time and it was a pity to see everything brittle and brown. However, you get to see beautiful and grand old trees, orchids, a mist house and a rainforest walk, mostly all for free! It might be a tediously long walk for younger kids but hey, one should get into nature every so often.
The final main issue is that there is no obvious way to get a cab from there, and seeing the station is a fair distance in the sun away, prepare to search for some time or flagging one down on Cluny road."
,,Make a Day of it!,5.0,,"This is a huge park with many sub gardens - all worth visiting. Plan on spending a whole day here if you love parks, flowers, medicinal herbs, gardening and natural beauty. Bring comfortable walking shoes or be prepared to buy some in the gift shops in the Gardens."
,,The Orchids were incredible,5.0,,The only thing I regret was not spending more time in the gardens. I visited late afternoon and the National Orchid Garden closes at 6pm. Unfortunately did not have too many days in Singapore. But it is a must visit.
,,Wonderful Orchid garden of the Botanical Garden,5.0,,"Visited the botanical garden and the special Orchid garden with an excursion, and it has so many pretty flowers which smells wonderful. Paying the extra 5 SGD is well worth it when visiting the botanical garden."
,,Large park in the city,4.0,,Surprisingly large park almost in the heart of the city. Conveniently accessed by MRT. Distances from one corner to the other can be longer than anticipated. Houses a good orchid garden (which has an entrance fee).
,,So much variety,5.0,,"Large gardens with a huge variety of trees and plants. Different themed sections. particularly liked the healing garden, full of medicinal plants. Large open areas with amazing sculptures.Plenty of places to sit in the shade. There is a stunning orchid garden which you have to pay to get into but it is worth it. Really need at least half a day to do it all justice and take a picnic and plenty of water so you can enjoy being outdoors amongst the plants."
,,nice and quite,4.0,,a place where you can enjoy some quite spaces - which Singapore lacks more and more - and the orchid garden are nice
,,worth visiting,4.0,,"this is my first time to visit botanic gardens, so i can not provide comparative recommendations. however, i liked it alot. lots of walking, trees that i never saw before. worth visiting"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Lovely morning out, visited the orchid garden which was beautiful. Gift shop was lovely and bought a few souvenirs there are cafés on site too."
,,Peaceful sanctuary in busy Singapore,5.0,,This is great place to come and escape the hustle and bustle. Huge gardens with everything you would expect from a world class botanical garden. Go there and relax for a few hours for some free (no $$) time.
,,Kew Gardens of the tropics.,5.0,,Absolutely amazing array of plants. Definitely Kew Gardens of the tropics. Even better as there's so much to see all year round. Was amazed at the variety. Well labelled everywhere. Worth spending a whole day there.
,,The delightful gardens,5.0,,"It was an exquisite way to spend a couple of hours, it was worth putting up with the heat and humidity so witness such wonderful gardens in the heart of Singapore"
,,Dont miss the free show!,5.0,,This is a spectacular place. It really is beautiful. You have to watch the trees dancing at 2030. Mind blowing!
,,Large Open Space Away from Crowds,5.0,,"So much space here, no matter when you go, there are lots of quiet spaces to hide. Plenty to see and eating venues, a bit expensive but you can always bring your own."
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,Wide variety of plants & flowers. Nice landscape. A nice place to relax & walk around. Put aside a few hrs here.
,,Beautiful and well maintained,5.0,,"The garden is full of people either exercising or going for a family walk or gathering, it is well maintained and clean, and children friendly."
,,A must see,5.0,,"If you stay in singapore the gardens are a must. The hop on, hop of bus service will drop you off at the door. There is no charge except to go into the orchid house."
,,Spectacular gardens and exhibits,4.0,,Well laid out gardens and greenhouse domes to see all types of plants in wonderful settings and tree exhibits spectacular.
,,An oasis of calm,4.0,,"Beautiful environment - peaceful, colourful, (shame about the number of people - but it copes).
The National Orchid Garden is the highlight - how can there be s many different kinds? The Diana orchid is pure white and simple - nice touch.
We visited as part of a city tour, but had a reasonable time to take in the colourful array, although could certainly have spent more time there.
The city has maintained many green areas and this is a highlight, not to be missed - this comes from someone who is not really in to flowers!"
,,Serene gem near the busy shopping district,4.0,,"Had been at the botanic garden for a few times with different group of people such as family & friends and it is a great place as you would leave the place with different experience every time. Serene scenery with many types of plants (trees & flowers), it is an ideal place for pinics as long as weather permits but no fear as there are shelters around. There are also restaurants and bistro whoch serve decent meals."
,,Beautiful but hot,4.0,,"The gardens are really beautiful and mostly free (you can pay into the Orchid garden). It's a lovely layout, obviously very clean and well maintained!

My main issue was the heat, they need more trees providing shade! It was so hot when I visited. And one of the gardens I wanted to visit was closed due to it being a Tuesday. It would be better if they could maintain the gardens daily instead of closing for a day, but I don't know how feasible that is.

It's a lovely area to wander around and if you walk away from the main areas it gets a lot quieter very quickly. The map of the park is helpful, but there are also signposts everywhere, but I think the distances are a bit off! It would say 200m then seconds later 20m.

I would highly recommend a visit."
,,favorite place,5.0,,"This place is very accessible,near bus stop. We love to come here with friends specially when there is a birthday celebration so we had our picnic held here for many times. The place is so huge,so you may want to wear a comfortable shoes if you want to explore the whole place. It is nice for relaxing right in front of the swan lake."
,,A place of great flora and fauna,4.0,,"A beautiful place for picnic or just a stroll in the park. However, be sure to dress up appropriately due to humidity and lots of walking. Preferably, be in your kicks if you are planning to do lots of walking!"
,,Go Early!,5.0,,"I think this is a must see in Singapore, but would just advise to go as early as you can to beat the heat! With good intentions to go earlier we did not arrive until about 9:30 a.m. and it was already very hot and humid by that time. We sought out any relief from the heat that we could find. Lunch at Halia was very good and also gave us a rest from the heat. Mister rooms also give short respite! There are many beautiful themed gardens and we saw a good majority in spite of the heat. One of our favorite activities in Singapore...."
,,Urban escape,4.0,,Nice to be away from the business of the city. Great place to chill and breathe in some fresh air. We were on the Hippo bus and just got off for an hour to have a look around. It was a breath of fresh air to us after being surrounded by sky scrapers. We thoroughly enjoyed the tropical feel of the botanic garden.
,,A beautiful respite,5.0,,"We only had a short time to squeeze in a visit one morning before meetings started. It was easy to go by taxi, and the 2 level flower dome was a wonder to explore for an hour. You could easily expand that to 2 hours, and there are so many other things to see here. Definitely worth a day if you have the time. It is also a very pleasant temperature inside."
,,Orchid lovers delight,5.0,,"The Botanic garden is accessible by bus from the city and has a large variety of displays. We went particularly for the notorious orchid gardens, which were superb. The variety of orchids is amazing! The rest of the botanical gardens is also lovely. Take water with you as you will walk a fair distance! A lovely outing!"
,,Be ready for a long hike,4.0,,"I estimate the walk from the Botanical Gardens metro stop on the east side of the park to the west side and back is about five miles so have well broken-in shoes. You might want to allow two days. (It really says something good about Singapore that they have set aside so much land for a park when they could have built condos). The park has lakes, bandstands, gazebos, restaurants and so on. There's a rainforest garden, foliage garden, healing garden, fragrant garden and a children's garden to name a few. Definitely a nice place to spend an easy day."
,,Simple but excellent,4.0,,"Small, friendly and a good menu choice. We sat in the open area, with no aircon. A nice place to eat without searching outside the gardens."
,,Great place for anything !,4.0,,"Whether you want to go for a run early morning or in the evening, have a picnic listening to live music , take the kids somewhere on their scooters of simply chill out with a good cup of coffee at the cafe, Singapore Botanical Gardens is a MUST!"
,,One of my favorites,5.0,,Visited Singapore many times and always try to fit in a visit to the gardens. The orchid garden is superb and always changing. There are places to sit and relax. I usually take a book.
,,Take time for the outdoors,4.0,,"My wife and I have been bringing our 3 year old daughter to Botanic Gardens several times now. It's a tranquil and captivating place to be if you love the outdoors and nature, away from the hustle and bustle. Once you enter the Gardens you'll forget that it's right next to the busy shopping district! Last Saturday evening (5-6pm) we went there for a symphonic performance, and brought along our picnic mat and basket. We were entertained to delightful music in the midst of lush greenery. Previously we had also dropped in at the eco-conscious restaurant at the Gardens called Food For Thought (1 Cluny Road, Tanglin Gate) which serves quite good western and local fares. There aren't that many family-oriented outdoor places like the Botanic Gardens for family bonding. Just remember to NOT be distracted by your mobile devices and focus on those with you! :)"
,,Peace,3.0,,"It's too large to walk around, but good for running / jogging or sth like training hard You can enjoy the peacefulness, the green of the park here."
,,One of the Best,5.0,,"This is a proper botanic garden with information about the plants which are well labelled. Stunning trees and ferns, not to mention the orchids. Second only to Kew Gardens"
,,Spirit Lifting Garden,5.0,,"The flowers, the orchids, the shops, everything in the botanical garden are awesome. The variety, the color, the arrangement, the temperature, name it and you will rate them all excellent. I just loved the views. When you get there, you just want to take photographs of the flowers and also have yours in almost all corners and angles. If you plan to go here, better allocate much time so that you can enjoy the beauty of the ornamental plants. The souvenir items in the shops are also awesome but they were pretty expensive for me. If you go to Singapore, don't miss this place."
,,Unmissable,5.0,,Wonderful orchids and beautifully laid out gardens. A must see for orchid lovers. Peaceful and very well maintained. Special rates for over 65s.

The plants and flowers are beautiful a visit is highly recommended"

,,Historical & Educational - Not to be missed!,4.0,,"Its location which is just 5 minutes away from the Orchard shopping belt gives visitors a quick hop to a garden which is both historical & educational. Many heritage trees can be found here and with the Orchid Garden being within the Botanical Garden itself, it is a convenient way of visiting 2 gardens in 1 go!

Lakes teeming with aquatic and bird life.

Primary rainforest.

Orchids, tropical herbs, spices etc etc.

You need a full day to do justice to this botantic garden. Though it does not have the pre-eminance of Kew Gardens for my money it's a better day out!"

,,Amazing,5.0,,It has taken me many many many trips to Singapore and I have finally walked into the Botanical Gardens. Always thought it wasnt my sort of thing. However I was wrong. It is absolutely stunning to walk through. Mind you its quite easy to get lost in also. I was amazed at the beauty of the plants and the different sorts of gardens. Absolutely loved it. Only wished I had more time to spend in there. I will definitely re visit it next time in Singapore again.
,,Enjoy the Gardens with Local Singapore by visiting early in the morning,5.0,,The Botanical Gardens are a must see in any case but if you visit early in the morning you can observe local Singapores practicing Tai Chi which is a lovely added bonus. The gardens are extensive so spend your morning wandering through and finish with a lovely lunch on site. The restaurants range from sit down gourmet to take away for a little picnic.
,,"Great Botanic Gardens - trees, flowers and shrubs",5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a peaceful place, and attract a wide range of people, young, old, families, joggers, tai chi practitioners, dog walkers etc. The side towards Holland Road has the trees and National Orchid Garden (which is well worth the admission fee), while the Bukit Timah side has the play areas and Children's Garden. Great for a picnic, a walk, or to stretch out on the grass and listen to one of the concerts. Its a peaceful oasis just off the crush of Orchard Road, and readily accessible by bus, taxi, or MRT."

,,pEACE AND SERENITY IN THE BOTANIC GARDENS,5.0,,"The Botanic garden is a treasure in the heart of Singapore. While a peaceful and quiet place to go for a stroll and some private reflection, it is also a great place to go for a run. The grounds are laid out in such a way that it can be educational if that is your things or perhaps just to get outside for a little pleasure in the great outdoors. There are a variety of attractions, with frequent concerts in the gardens, the orchid garden, artistic sculptures and botanical information. There is also a variety of restaurants of different categories and places to have refreshment. The Botanic Garden can be enjoyed by young and old alike."
,,stunning and beautiful,5.0,,Lovely day out. Very easy to get to. Free to get in...small fee for orchids but we'll worth it. Tame insect repellent.
,,WELL WORTH THE VISIT,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens, are really beautiful, lots of lovely plants and Orchids to look at, and perfect for a lovely picnic lunch. Take a taxi to get there. It does get very hot, so take an umbrella. The trees were particularly beautiful to me and the way the gardens have been set out is just lovely. I would definitely recommend a visit if you haven't been to Singapore before."
,,Great place for picnic,4.0,,"It's an extremely great place for picnics with friends and families.The open space and shade provided by trees allowed us to have an enjoyable birthday picnic here.Different variety of plants also amazed us especially Singapore's representative flower,the orchid was also on a beautiful display here.Really a great place for relaxation from bustling city life."

Entrance is free (small charge for orchid gardens) The botanic gardens are immaculately kept, and have wonderful plants trees and shrubs. A great location for a peaceful retreat"
,,Delightful,5.0,,"One of the best botanical gardens around, free to enter and wander at your heart's content.Incorporate this with the enclosed orchid paradise for a great day out."
,,A break from the hustle,4.0,,"The gardens are of course beautiful, with all their pedicured tropical diversity on display. On a Saturday morning, the park is full of families and lovebirds enjoying the sunshine. Go for a stroll when the heat and constant construction noise become overwhelming."
,,Beautiful garden but very bad staff,4.0,,"The garden was very nice and relaxing,my problem is that when we are in the cool house i ask the maintenance where the toilet is and they direct us near the entrance area so we have to go back to the entry point. Unfortunately the toilet is just after the exit point so i ask the staff if we can use the toilet because i need to go to the toilet asap and i had a very bad back. She told me no and the toilet inside is located on the top of the garden and it is 10 to 15 minutes away. I went to the front desk and ask if they have any consideration and what about other senior citizen? She told me none, how cruel."
,,Give this a full day,5.0,,So much to discover here - themed into areas - take plenty of water and be prepared to do a lot of walking but well worth it
,,What beautiful gardens and free entry!!,5.0,,"These gardens must be the best free attraction in Singapore! They are immaculately kept with a wonderful variety of plants and trees. The great thing is that this place is child friendly, allows people to walk, cycle, push baby buggies, and explore at your own pace. In our case this pace was slow as the heat and humidity, and a touch of jetlag were having an effect on our energy levels."
,,A moment of calmness in a city on the go,5.0,,"I take my dog walking in the gardens at least once a week. There are always new things to see. New flowers, a flock of birds. Maybe a gathering of seniors singing old songs together. Of course many joggers and groups doing Tai chi to the soft sounds of fans clipping open and closed. We always go on weekday mornings. Afternoons can be a bit warm. I hear weekends are full of families pikniking. Of course there are the Sunday evening classical concerts. It is an absolute must see in an otherwise bustling city."
,,Orchids orchids orchids everywhere,5.0,,"Wao! What a sanctuary. I don't know if my travels around Asia can have a better point of arrival and departure than the gorgeous city of Singapore. This City is just a gem packed with many many treasures. I now know that Singapore should not be experienced quickly but rather one must take some time to take all Singapore has to offer in, slowly and in several occasions. The weather in Jan and Feb in Singapore is incredible! It makes all my NYC winter blues vanish...
I grew up in Latin America in a very tropical and equatorial climate. My grandmother was an avid collector of orchids, her gardens always made my summers a magical season.

Few days ago I had the same magical experience while immersed in the serenity and lavish orchid's garden at SBG. I spent all afternoon reading, taking pictures and writing and inhaling that musky, moist smell of the tropics in the middle of a vibrant, prosper and modern city. The Gardens offer lavish and exotics gardens with intricate paths and walks all within the perfectly maintained tropical forest. Casa Verde Cafe has an incredible menu. I hear from my Singaporean friends that the Concerts al fresco at the amphitheater are just glorious (I am looking for the next events to see if I can catch one during this dry and lovely season).

I will be touring around SEA for a while, and I will make sure that upon my return to Singapore I pay a mandated visit to this gorgeous sanctuary to recharge and connect with nature, to smell the tropics and to admire the orchids and feel the magic of my childhood memories again."
,,Ethereal,5.0,,"I have the fortune to live near to the botanic gardens and I treasure it's beauty and peace everyday. I manage to run most mornings in and around the gardens and there's nothing better than just taking a detour to a new corner and seeing another part of the garden. The flora and fauna are beautifully maintained and I would suggest either an early morning or late afternoon visit as it tends to get very hot without too much shade. There's a few restaurants and I'm told the Halia's carbonara is the best in Singapore. However, don't be swayed to visit the cafe as the prices and quality of food are nicely geared towards tourists."
,,A truly beautiful place,5.0,,"We had wondered if the rave reviews of this place were exaggerated but no! This is a truly beautiful place - immaculately laid out and breathtaking in its variety. The plants and flowers are an engaging indication of what nature is like 80 miles from the Equator. The hop on hop off buses have a yellow route that will take you there. There are good places to eat and drink which range from the informal to the formal (there was a wedding in one of these). The grounds are divided into areas eg one devoted to Ginger and the incredible Orchid areas. There are plenty of places to picnic and dogs on leads are welcome. There is a children's area. Some areas are a little steep but most are widely accessible. Yes, it's true, a visit to Singapore will be impoverished with our a visit to this visionary place."
,,Should have drinking tap water available,3.0,,Beautiful garden! Such an amazing collection of flowers! This garden is one of my favorite places in Singapore! But one slight problem..I came in the entrance where there's no cafe or shops to be found and was left hot and thirsty walking around looking for a cafe or a shop to buy a bottle of water. It was the longest and tiring walk I have ever done in my life! Why don't they have drinking water tap available?? After finding a shop to buy my water I was in a happier mood. The experience is great! One of the nicest garden I have ever been to in the world. I do recommend that you bring a bottle of water before you start your journey!
,,Cruise Silversurfers,5.0,,"Probably the best Botanical Gardens I have ever seen! Beautifully kept and such a calm, peaceful place to spend a day. You would never know you were in the centre of Singapore."
,,"Great gardens, if you can find your way around",2.0,,"We literally got lost in these gigantic gardens even with a map. The maps look inaccurate, the paths are poorly signposted and confusing. If you plan to visit, stick to the side that is near the orchid garden and stay on the crowded paths. If you dare to venture off to the further away areas, bring a hat, plenty of water and if you have one a GPS map. I've attached a photo of what to expect with the signs, notice the confusing information. The maps are useless, they don't match the grounds. Beautiful place but those free maps needs to be looked at."
,,Garden in the city,5.0,,"The gardens are beautifully laid out ,with areas of formal and wild plantings .There are lakes and ponds that attract birds and dragonflies .Inside the gardens are a couple of small restaurants that are reasonably priced .This is a popular venue for locals and tourists but there is always a quiet spot to be found,Within the garden is a separate Orchid garden ,which is well worth a visit and costs very little to enter.For bird watchers this is a place to visit ,as at certain times of year many different species can be seen ."
,,An Oasis,4.0,,A well thought out and maintained set of gardens in central Singapore. The area covered is very big so allow plenty of time to explore the whole area. Entry is free except for the Orchard displays.
,,Gorgeous,4.0,,We went to the Botanical Gardens and there is so much room to walk around and see everything. It was so refreshing to be there and see all that green space (especially after being in HK). I liked that you could get a picnic basket and have a picnic. Great time.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Botantical Gardens are beautiful and well worth a visit, we went early in the morning and by midday it was very hot. We took our time and visited every area of the gardens. A lovely oasis in the middle of a city."
,,nice place,5.0,,never thought a garden would be so beautiful.with so many different trees to see.get so much knowledge out of it.
,,"Well kept, huge gardens",5.0,,"My first impression of the gardens was stepping out of the MRT station where you are introduced to some history and map signs prior to hitting the gardens. From there I used the phone app as my reference for a map as there is no visitor centre at the MRT entrance. Wandering through a range of themed gardens like the trellis garden; full of arches with beautiful vines covering each one, to the bamboo and brightly coloured bougainvillea area, to the foliage garden where the emphasis is on the bright and contrasting foliage of a wide variety of plants.

The signs are easy to follow with the help of a map, with estimated distances to each sight/garden on each sign. Min the centre there is a visitor centre, gift shop and cafe with reasonably priced, tasty food.

Wandering the rest of the themed gardens and the beautiful remainder of the original rainforest area can take as long or as little time as you want, depending on how much you want to see. I did the lot and walked 10km! I would definitely recommend walking through the rainforest for untouched jungle that is reminiscent of what singapore looked like before settlement.

The national orchid garden with SGD $5 entry is a must. Full of an incredible variety of orchids and tropical plants to keep you interested, with a themed orchid garden; this time of year is themed for the Lunar New Year. Just about everywhere you look is another photo opportunity with some beautiful orchids.

The negatives are the location, reasonably out of the way from where I stayed in Chinatown, it took 2 changes on the MRT and about half an hours worth of travel, and the expanse of the garden itself could be difficult for some to see everything in one go.

Overall it is a beautiful garden with plenty to be seen, and i would highly recommend the national orchid garden."
,,Oasis in a big city,4.0,,Very relaxing park with great connections from city center. Amazing place and even without entrance fee. Worth spending 2-3 hrs including Orchid garden.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"If you want to get away from the hectic city life of Singapore, maybe this is the place you should go for. It is quite relaxing and I enjoyed our walk there. It's free to go there and it's quite big which you may not be able to cover it all. I got lost along the way in the garden and get back since we took many pictures already."
,,a beautiful garden,4.0,,It can be steamy on a hot day so pick your time carefully or your enthusiasm might wane before you have seen the beauty of the garden . Its is naturally full of tropical plants and has a beautiful selection of specimens of palms orchids and other gorgeous flowering plants that only grow in the tropics.
,,If you like gardens and plants you'll love this,3.0,,"Easy to access by taxi for 7S$ from Downtown and free to enter. Full of wonderful plants and trees and gives a real flavour of the tropical garden. It is quite large but easy to get around. If you want to see everything it could be tiring. There are good facilities for rest and eating. Our only problem came in getting back. We strayed into the period (about 4pm) when the cab drivers change shift, and the normal method of picking up a cab from arriving visitors didn't work. The advertised phone number for taxis at the entrance also didn't work. Eventually we managed but it is worth noting that if you are in a hurry pre book or avoid this time. Buses are still plentiful though. However this didn't detract from a lovely experience."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,Lovely stroll through beautiful and interesting gardens. Well identified trees and bushes and wildlife all around
,,good and free,3.0,,"A decent good botanical garden, like everywhere in the world - many lovely flowers and trees, fresh air and relaxing nature. Nothing less and nothing more. But its great if you want to spend time with nature and escape the city. And its free!!"
,,Beautiful and peaceful,4.0,,"We took the City Tours thatincluded the Byanjc Garden,I really wanted to see the orchids most of all, and they did not disappoint. We did not rejoin the tour as we wanted to see all of the gardens which are worth the time. You need to have at least three hours fre to enjoy them fully."
,,Intriguing place,4.0,,There was an amazing light and music show at 19:45. Not sure if this was linked to Chinese newyear or whether this is done at all times.
,,Beautiful oasis in the city,5.0,,"No negatives, particularly loved the orchid garden, which you pay just a small amount for, but well worth it! Out of town, but various hoppa buses go there."
,,Serene surroundings,4.0,,"Always worth a visit. A large park with lovely walks, much more authentic and natural than the new Gardens by the Bay. Easy to get to by taxi and good places to eat. Lots of interest, especially the Orchid Garden."
,,Not surprising ... Typical Singapore - highest quality,5.0,,"worth and leisurely half a day. Or a brisk walk of the dog in an hour. Wonderfully kept gardens which sit somewhat miraculously in the middle of this city-state. How does Singapore continue to do it? Always meeting and exceeding expectations of quality and experience. These gardens are a true reflection of the excellence of the country. (And by the way, lots of incredible species of plants and a few animals lurking about as well)"
,,All your favourite orchids and every herb needed for Asian cooking!,5.0,,"Carved out of a hillock covered in virgin tropical forest, the Garden's sweeping lawns offer a calm refuge before the commercial mayhem of Orchard Road and the many shopping malls. Here you will find surely the largest collection of orchid varieties anywhere in the world. The Princess Diana Orchid (pure white) rubs shoulders with the Sydney Brenner Orchid, named for Singapore's adopted Nobel-Prizewinning biologist. On the way to the Orchid Garden, you will pass the stunningly complete collection of edible plants of ginger family, including galangal, torch ginger, turmeric and others. The herbarium is a chance to see kaffir lime leaves,pandanus, kaun kesum (Vietnamese mint), lemon grass and the usually rampant Chinese knotweed - but be careful if you are tempted to taste: poisonous creeping rockfoil is very similar to the useful pennywort, while mugwort (also poisonous) looks like the cook's favourite leafy coriander. Don't miss the giant kapok trees."
,,Serene and out of this world,5.0,,"Lovely place to walk and be close to nature. Great diversity of plants, flowers, trees, waterways. A must visit in Singapore, and possibly the only place in Singapore where entrance is free."
,,Surprisingly beautiful,5.0,,We spent a lot longer than we thought we would exploring the botanic gardens as there was so much to see and it was all so beautiful. Water fountains to keep hydrated and cooling mist here and there. Gorgeous
,,Excellent place to go! A real jewel!,5.0,,"Don't miss this attraction! We have been to many incredible Botanic Gardens around the world (like Montreal, Scotland, Oxford, Vancouver, etc) and Singapore Boranic Gardens is on the top five, for sure!
It's free and you have to pay a very small fee to access the Orchid Pavilion. Don't miss the orchids! And if you don't have time to see everything go straight to the Orchids! They are unforgettable!"
,,An idyllic and scenic spot,4.0,,"The Singapore botanic gardense is an ideal spot to go if you are a nature lover. It is a vast area of greenery, which can be easily reached by MRT. Once you go inside, you forget that you are in a bustling metro. Place is totally quiet and peaceful. Acres and acres of green wooded areas, with beautiful well maintained paths to take long lazy walks. You feel as though you are in the country side. There are restaurants and they even offer you packed picnic baskets which you can take and have a nice picnic by the woods or the lakeside, where you can take a bath. There are various gardens inside, of which the best is the Orchid garden. All in all, a nice place to spend a holiday"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"It was a very relaxing day strolling round the gardens and the domes themselves contained an array of colour with plenty of great photo opportunities.

The grounds surrounding the domes were free to roam and we only wish we had allowed more time to sit and relax at one of the many benchs.

It was surprisingly quiet and easy to get a sheltered bench."
,,nice garden,4.0,,"this garden have a good maintain garden area, with many kinds of plants and trees. Better to explore it from Tanglin gate to Bukit Timah Gate."
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,This is such an incredible place. It is so relaxing to stroll through the gardens. They also have a spectacular show at night
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Spent a really nice half day walking through the Botanical Gardens and then an hour in the Orchid Garden. A bit of a must do in Singapore.
,,A beautiful place to rewind or find new inspirations,5.0,,"I was traveling for business recently and had the chance to experience this well manicured garden. Quietly tucked just behind the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd, it is an excellent place for a walk or a jog while you are in Singapore. On Sunday morning, the garden is full with healthy lifestyle enthusiasts. Definitely a stark contrast to the humid and busy business districts when you step inside the garden to be greeted with a breathe of fresh air. A must visit if you love plants, water elements and hiking. Do not forget to pack some food for a picnic amidst the lush trees. If you are lucky, you will spot the squirrels too!"
,,Beautiful gardens ....and some reptiles!,5.0,,"Many different types of gardens, plants and habitats. Enjoyed the rain forest walk and the lakes with the googly eyed fish, reptiles and swans. Very relaxing despite being close to city and well worth a visit."
,,Good place to relax,4.0,,"Wonderful place to relax and have a picnic. As with every other place in Singapore, the gardens are well maintained and clean."
,,Wonderful gardens in the middle of the city,5.0,,We had the good fortune of spending a morning here while in Singapore. The gardens are beautiful well maintained and have many areas to get away from it all in. Take a walk through the healing gardens and the Orchid garden is a must see.
,,garden paradise,5.0,,amazing to have such a garden right in the middle of a high rise city. Fantastic orchid garden restaurants & it free not to be missed when you have time to enjoy Singapore
,,"Gorgeous gardens full of friends, families, and couples",4.0,,"Huge, wonderful oasis in Singapore where so many people congregate on Sunday's for picnics and fun. The gardens themselves are lush and colorful, filled with flowers, butterflies, insects that make cool sounds, and big lizards. We loved meandering through the park like paths, checking out the sculptures on display, seeing kids run, and adults lounging on blankets. It's a beautiful space in Singapore and free of admission (except for the orchid garden)."
,,Jogging,5.0,,Perfect for morning jogging or afternoon tea side with lots to look at and enjoy each time you go there. Romantic as well and specially in weekends you find couples getting married where pictures are taken in these fantastic surroundings.
,,A relaxing oasis near the city,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens is one of the oldest attractions in Sg. It presents good value as it's free entry and opens very early in the morning for a nice jog.

There's plenty of room for everyone, may it be a jog, kids in scooters or walks with your dog. A lovely place for a family picnic and also lots of fish and turtles in the ponds.

There's a few food outlets and they tend to be fairly reasonably priced with a bit of variety.

If you're short of time and want something lush and different, or can't cope with the humidity, then definitely check out Gardens By The Bay, especially the Cloud dome."
,,Relief on a hot day,5.0,,"Very pleasant place. We walked around the big pond over to the orchid garden. The garden feels very exotic. It was great on a hot day.
Take plenty of water and some snacks - there is a kiosk but it may take time to find it."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Absolutely fantastic place. One of the oldest botanic gardens in the world and has an absolutely amazing collection of plants, trees and flowers. The park is huge, well planned and best of all: free! The only charge is 5$ to get in to the orchid gardens which is pretty much free for the experience you get. Loads of birds, turtles and other animals roaming around and easy to get to just off Orchard road. Must see! Perfect for couples, families or simply like me do it on your own. A nice break from the busy city."
,,Huge garden offers enough space for everyone to escape the city for a while,4.0,,"The botanic gardens are huge, about 2km long. This creates a lot of space for everyone. When I walked through the gardens, it happened quite often that I did not see anybody else close by, something that rarely happens in the city. So, great place to escape.

I came to visit the Orchid Garden, which was very worth the 1km walk (single way) from the metro station. On the way, I also visited the rain forest section. Most of the trees there are still pretty young , but it was nice nevertheless."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Great place to visit, free for everything but the beautiful orchids $5 but well worth it. Beautiful gardens immaculately laid out lots of flowers although suspect we were too early for some of them. For anyone not quite so able it's a good walk but there are lots of places to sit and a number of restaurants, food outlets and machines for water. Hard to believe it's such a short way from busy orchard road, indeed an oasis of calm."
,,Well Planed Botanical Garden,5.0,,"Fantastic lay out. Difficult to believe that it is in the City. Most pleasant experience. Astonish to see the varity of plants. Well displayed & maintained garden. Best part, it is FREE ENTRY."
,,A welcome contrast,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens are great and a welcome contrast to city life. Thoroughly planned, maintained, and executed, with an enormous budget, it almost feels authentic ;)
We very much enjoyed a few hours here, stopping for lunch in Halia before visiting the Orchid garden.
The rainforest section is great, with lots of shade and a cool breeze.
Highly recommended dose of the beautiful outdoors. Enjoy!"
,,The Botanic Gardens experience,5.0,,An enjoyable walk through every kinf of botanical life in Asia; educational and relaxing. You would need a full day at least to see it all but it is organised so you can concentrate on specific hobby's.
,,Ah Serenity! Take your time. Let it fill your senses.,5.0,,"Had not been well and was a bit too stressed by the time we arrived to Singapore. The perfect remedy was a morning walking through the Botanic Gardens in the heart of the city. The heat didn't feel half as hot here, and the green foliage and several water features certainly helped cool frazzled nerves.

There are so many aspects to this garden to explore. Take your time. From the museum with the history of the gardens, to the rainforest walk, the children's areas, watching people practicing Tai Chi, and the lovely lake with ducks and turtles, and green lawns. The most spectacular part of the gardens was the Orchid Garden with a huge range of the exquisite, delicate flowers.

And it's free (not the Orchids). Why wouldn't you go!"
,,A botanic garden with a big budget,5.0,,Everything is well done in this garden. Be sure to take water and wear a hat because the garden is very open and you will walk a lot.
,,An oasis in a beautiful city,5.0,,"I couldn't believe just how gorgeous these gardens are. Not only that but they are really well used. People are genuinely enjoying the space - yoga, tai chi, boot camps, dog walkers and tourists mix together in this world class garden. Skip the shops and go."
,,Well kept and verdant,5.0,,"Very tranquil park with lots of species of flora and fauna. Nice for a walk or a run. We had a very good beef burger at the Casa Verde restaurant inside the gardens, it gave us a good dose of energy to continue our walk under the strong afternoon sun!"

,,break from the masses,5.0,,"What a nice and spacious park close to the city! Huge area to stroll around, see bonsais, orchids, special trees and plants, and everything of course with the typical overboarding growth and plenty of a sub-tropical climate.

We also went to the orchid park, and the entrance fee was more than worth it."
,,Escape the Heat and Bustle,5.0,,"It's very easy to reach the Botanic Gardens by MRT and it is worth doing so. There are many gardens within the Garden plus lakes, outdoor sculptures, a concert venue, ad many enormous rain trees that offer shade for relaxing, playing games, taking a nap, enjoying a picnic. I really enjoy it on the weekends when it is lively with groups of families and friends at play. It is a beautiful natural resource, lovingly tended and well-loved by Singaporeans and visitors alike. Don't miss the beautiful Orchid Garden. It is breathtaking."

,,Great place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,When in Singapore don't miss the Botanic Garden and the Orchid Garden inside for a beautiful and tranquil place to visit
,,Love the garden,5.0,,"Best to go early in morning, avoid the heat. Fantastic. Well marked. And currently, there is a Ju Ming exhibit near the lake in the back. If you are just interested in seeing that come there by subway, short walk!"
,,Stunning place to visit,5.0,,"We chose to walk to the Botanic Gardens and had a bit of a hard time of it as there were limited signposts. Infact the only one we came across was the one right outside the front gates saying Botanic Gardens this way. Amusing!!

An alternative way to get here would be to go on the hop on hop off bus as this takes you right inside the park.

This is a lovely place to go to relax, and wonder round. If I went back there again, I would take a picnic as the space is so vast and green, and surrounded in flowers and plants.

There are also lots of lovely photo opportunities outside little waterfalls, clocks, ornaments etc.

You dont necessarily need to view the whole gardens here, however a must is the National Orchid Garden which is in the centre. It cant really be missed and is reasonably cheap bearing in mind there is no fee into the garden itself."
,,Love the view,4.0,,It is very big and you may get lost if you go alone. There aren't many people in the morning and it is worth going if you like quiet and relaxing environment.
,,Highlight of visit,5.0,,"Lovely interesting place to visit. Includes a real rain forest and lots of variety, lakes, seats and good places to eat for all tastes and pockets. The hop on/off bus comes to the door as well as taxis."

,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,We walked to the gardens one morning on a short stay in Singapore. They are beautiful and free except for the Orchid gardens. It is truly beautiful and they are so well kept and the flowers and trees are just stunning. Well worth a visit if you are visiting Singapore and you cna use the red tour bus to get on and off if you wish.
,,Gorgeous grounds and amazing orchids.,5.0,,"With only a couple of hours to spare we walked around the beautiful gardens. It is a nice flat walk and we 'oohed' and 'ahhed' our way through the gardens.
We visited the National Orchid Garden and it was absolutely beautiful. You need to pay $5 but it was worth it. The variety of orchids is breathtaking as are the way they are displayed. Some are cleverly wrapped around tree stumps, others formally arranged in rows, some are beautifully displayed in large pots. A very nice way to spend a morning. To see the entire garden you would need a whole day. There was a cafe you could visit for lunch it otherwise enjoy a picnic."
,,A green oasis in the city jungle of singapore,5.0,,"The botanic gardens are overwhelming big, very clean and definitely worth seeing. You have an unbelievable wide variety of plants in this garden. From a jungle, a palm valley, primeval old trees, orchids and many more.

In every theme you find some places to sit and calm down. In the center there are some souvenir shops there I bought som extremely tasty orchid tea."

,,Well organised and astounding,5.0,,"We were collected at our hotel (about within about 2 minutes of said pick-up time!).... and taken to gardens... Guide was very experienced, and the gardens were overwhelming in their beauty... We were directed in any particular place you wanted to see - and wow, were were blown away by the sheer beauty of the orchid garden and the abundance of flora....

,,Wonderful Gardens in the City,5.0,,"There are a wide variety of plants and flowers, including some extremely rare species. Can't imagine there's even a small rainforest within it. It's definitely a place that once can't miss in Singapore."

,,A nice park within the city,3.0,,"A nice park, free entry but you do have to pay to get into the orchid garden so we didn't bother as we are not exactly nature fanatics but we do enjoy visiting parks.

,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,Beautiful expansive gardens which are well worth seeing. Orchid garden area is fantastic. Who thought that orchids were so diverse
,,A Relatively Peaceful Attraction,4.0,,"Very busy on a Sunday and difficult at times to appreciate fully the surroundings, Stunning array of plants however that should be viewed if you have an interest in botany."
,,REFRESHING WITH GOOD HEALTHY LONG WALKS,5.0,,"There absulutly nothing your can dislike. Only thing you should take note is, if it is on Sunday it could be too crowded.

Also just make sure to note down land mark of toilets. Those signs boards showing toilets are not really helpful. Or whenever you find one just use it.

Check forecast and if these are chances of rains, you must carry umbrella or raincoats for kids.

It a beautiful place with neat roads and shelters.As it is too big, it is good to chose few place and slowly walk and take pictures if you wish too,

At the end of the day feels tired but with lots of fresh and clean oxygen in lungs and blood streams it feels very healthy."
,,A Botanic Garden not to be missed,5.0,,This is a garden you should have on your agenda stop beforehand grab some snacks and drinks and spend an hour or 2 soaking up the tropical beauty. Find a shady spot and relax very peaceful
,,Beautiful refuge,5.0,,I can see why Singaporeans seek refuge in these gardens. They are beautifully maintained and are so peaceful that you can forget it is surrounded by a bustling metropolis. Pay to go into the orchid garden it's worth it.

,,Absolutely delightful,5.0,,"This is a truly lovely way to spend some time. I strolled around here for hours. It was lovely to see so many families out picnicking, playing games and enjoying the surrounds. I paid a few dollars and went to the Orchid Garden - gobsmackingly gorgeous. I'm not a gardener but I loved this place. I didn't purchase food here and a quick look at the food service places, I didn't miss much."
,,An Oasis of calm & tranquility in a busy city,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Gardens is right up there on my World Top 10 attractions / activities. It's a true oasis of calm & tranquility but so close to the CBD. It's has a dedicated MRT station on the Circle Line as well as numerous bus stops outside. You can walk, run, stroll, spend a quiet hour or a whole day here. It's got everything by way of plants from all over the world which are fascinating. But you don't have to even remotely interested in plants to enjoy the ambience of this ""sacred space"".....entry is free except to the National Orchid Centre where there's a nominal charge of $5"
,,Lovely walks,5.0,,"I only real went for a walk here because some friends suggested it. It was a very hot day and foolishly I go forgot to take a hat, but apart from that I really enjoyed it.
The area is a lot larger than I expected and took longer to walk around, but the stunning variety of plants and trees took my break away, and I almost wish I had taken a picnic!
Swan Lake was impressive, and there were plenty of turtles about, but my favourite area was Symphony Lake, which contained a performance stage with a moat filled with large lilies surrounding it, with grassy banks sloping up and away to sit on. I would sincerely love to see something performed here, and will be keeping an eye out for performances during future trips.
Overall a great garden with stunning views, I loved it."
