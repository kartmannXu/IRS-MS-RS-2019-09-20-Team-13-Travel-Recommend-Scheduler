,,Quirky and colourful,5.0,,"I particularly enjoyed the Flower Dome for it's quirkiness and colour. The cacti and succulent section was also particularly interesting for me as it reminded me of an alien environment, other-worldly."
,,loved this place,5.0,,"its a great place, do search for the hidden alice in wonderland can take photo with them. really enjoyed the place"
,,Incredible,5.0,,"Awarded the largest glass greenhouse in the world, I loved this spectacular dome. The temperature is nice and cool, air ... fresh. The vast flowers and plants species are incredibly healthy and beautiful, each name tagged which is great for botanical enthusiasts. And the whole dome sets a beautiful backdrop for photos both day or night."
,,An outstanding attraction,5.0,,"We were amazed by the actual dome structure for a start - an engineering marvel - but the range and variety and magnificence of the trees, shrubs and flowers ( especially the orchids in myriad colours and forms) in the dome were breathtaking. We spent hours there and would have liked to return. It was one of the best flower displays we have ever seen- at least rivalling the Chelsea Flower Show.
It was also excellent to be able to have lunch in a cafe inside the structure as well."
,,DO NOT MISS THE ORCHIDS,5.0,,This was our second visit to the Flower Dome. We found new array of flowers than those we saw last time. Really magnificent. The orchids on display were best liked by my family members.
,,Nice but not so impressive as the Cloud Forest,3.0,,"I bought a combi ticket for around 20eur which provides access to both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. No need to make an advanced reservation. The Flower Dome is nice for a short stroll, but is not so impressive as the Cloud Forest. I had a combi ticket, but if you would have to make a choice in between one of the two domes, go for the Cloud Forest."
,,Lovely display of Roses,5.0,,"We visited the Flower Dome during the Rose Romance display and it was well presented - it was near the end of the event so some flowers were a little passed their best. There are a lot of other permanent displays and many other special events during the year. The building which houses the Flower Dome along with that of the Cloud DOme are impressive in themselves and a great addition to Gardens by the Bay.

On a hot sticky Singapore Day it is well worth a visit as there is interest for everyone to enjoy."
,,"Impressive Orchids, International Plants and Garden Displays",5.0,,"The orchid display was on during this visit and was really stunning and informative. As always the various gardens from around the world, including Australia, Africa, and South America are well maintained and impressive. I noticed visitors of all ages including many schoolchildren and everyone seemed to be enjoying their visit. As well as facts for gardeners there are displays directed at families and children, and an interesting Alice in Wonderland garden. I have been before and would go again."
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,The visit to the flower dome was lovely with spectacular gardens representing various regions on Earth. Well worth the visit if you enjoy plants and gardens.
,,Beautiful - Gardens by the Bay dome,5.0,,"One of the two domes in Gardens by the Bay. The displays are absolutely beautiful, beautiful plants and flowers with sculptures, wood carvings and lots of other little artistic surprises. Not to be missed, well worth the entrance fee."
,,gorgeous,5.0,,Flower dome and its sibling cloud forest are 2 really nice (air conditioned :-)) environments showing off on natural beauty (although in an artificial environment).
,,Excellent,5.0,,This is a credit to it’s creators. So much to see. Don’t forget to keep your eye’s peeled for all the hidden surprises!
,,Left in awe! 😉,5.0,,Singapore keeps Surprising me every single day!!!! We visited during the orchid festival and it was just perfect... take the day to enjoy the flower dome and to appreciate every different flower and the amazing work put in place
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"What words can you use to describe some of these displays other than spectacular – the orchids in particular are absolutely out of this world – the different gardens of regions of the world are interspaced with carvings or objects of art, carvings, statues, models etc which add interest for visitors of all ages – this dome & exhibition of flowers simply has to be seen – stunning."
,,Beautiful - but I hope the Christmas decorations aren't so garish again.,3.0,,"We visited just before Christmas & we really enjoyed the different areas inside - the cactus garden, Californian area, mediterranean, etc. It's also nice to be in a comfortable temperature & also being sheltered from tropical downpours. However there was a large area of Tsum tsum Christmas village inside. Now we're big Disney fans - but didn't appreciate the Tsum tsum circus inside the flower dome to such a large extent - it just didn't seem right."
,,Pretty but busy,3.0,,"My partner and I visited the cloud forest and flower dome on the same day. We arrived early to avoid crowds which worked well for the cloud forest however we loved it in the first dome so much that by the time we visited the flower dome it was packed!
Still beautiful non the less
However the cloud dome had more information and interactive boards with information for those walking around. The information on flower types in the flower dome was minimal, most only displaying scientific names of each- some cool ""dis you know or interaction with the flowers would have been appreciated.
The cloud forest had a bunch of rare plants, some sniffing orchard experience etc which the flower dome could of included to spice up the experience for costumers."
,,Incredible,5.0,,The flower dome is incredible. From the outside it looks big but from the inside it feels even bigger and even more impressive! The building itself is magnificent. We went during ‘Tulip Mania’. There are so many different types of flowers and plants to look at and learn about. This is a must do if you are in Singapore!!
,,A beautiful garden,5.0,,"The tickets we bought was a combo ticket for both Flower dome and Cloud Forest , so after lunch we entered the Flower Dome to see the amazing arrays of flowers in this dome.
the dome is slightly hotter than the cloud forest.
the display of flowers was a beautiful arrangement.
tons of flower to see and the fragrant of the flowers filled the dome.
lovely time to spend in the midst of flowers."
,,Extraordinarily beautiful!,5.0,,"This was our second visit to the Flower Dome. It was even better and more beautiful that when we had made our first visit two years ago.
We visited during the middle of the afternoon on a Monday and it was surprisingly crowded. The admission price for both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are quite substantial. Fortunately we had our attraction passes as part of our Singapore Airlines Holidays stopover package and these provided us with free admission to both of these attractions.
We could have spent hours in the Flower Dome as there were so many beautiful displays to see. However, as our time was limited, we admired as many of the displays as we could amongst the crowds of visitors, before having to move on.
Highly recommended as a must see attraction at the Gardens by the Bay despite the rather hefty admission fees and the crowds that it attracts."
,,Flower Lovers,5.0,,"By far, one of the best flower forest in the world. Flower plants from many countries can be seen. Wide array of beautiful flowers and plants are located here. Not to be missed. Take selfies to bring back home or share in social media. A sight to behold"
,,Wonderful display inside the flower dome,5.0,,To enter this and the cloud dome you are up for S$28 but well worth it. As you enter you will see beautiful displays of plants trees and flowers. It is set out in areas of flowers from various continents. This and the cloud dome are both air conditilned so you wander around at your own pace
,,A great place to visit.,5.0,,"This place was great to visit. We went to both domes on a wet day and really enjoyed the visit. The flower dome is not as big as the forest dome but has plenty to admire. There are statues and carvings throughout the dome, which are just as good as the plants.
The dome was crowded but it was still easy to get around."
,,Amazing,5.0,,While the vocation of the nearby Cloud Forest dome is mainly directed at environmental education the flower dome concentrates more on botany. And its not just flowers but trees too from every corner of the globe. The layout is easy on the eye (and the feet) in spite of its huge size. The cost of tickets may initially seem a tad high but in fact are very good value for money and the financial pain can be slightly eased if you present your airline boarding pass; seniors too get a reduction.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Didnt know all the plants existed let alone in one place. Spent hours there. Just beautiful. Took us so long to walk through, we didnt realize the time had just slipped away."
,,Loving the concept,5.0,,"I love this concept. A big garden with many features under one roof. An escape from the heat, but lots of greenery to see. Lots of beautiful orchid displays and more. If you like flowers and plants this is somewhere you shouldn't miss.

The Cloud Forest is practically next door, another place worth a stroll. You can get entry for cheaper if you buy a combined Flower Dome and Cloud Forest ticket. Check out KLook they often have good deals and it is where I purchased my tickets.

Allow ample time as there is plenty to see. I recommend you go late afternoon as you can catch the changes outside and catch the SuperGrove light display show while you are there (Yes! it's all in the same area). You will be in awe."
,,If you only have time for a couple of things in Singapore,5.0,,".. this has to be one of them. Don't even think about it - go. Flower Dome is a vision, brilliantly executed. Interesting, relaxing, beatiful and comfortable - incredibly, these huge domes are all air conditioned. Do Cloud Forest at the same time. If you don't have time for both, choose Flower Dome (but make time for both)."
,,Sensory Delight,4.0,,"Perhaps a little overshadowed by the neighbouring Cloud Forest, but a delightful place to visit nevertheless. Contained within the dome is a visual feast of flora from areas around the world. Of especial interest was the very large and absolutely delightful collection of varying cacti species. This alone makes a visit all the worth while. Another standout attraction was the scent garden, where visitors are encouraged to enchant themselves with the smell of various orchids.
Hidden among much of the flora are alluring sculptures, many of these being made of natural tree vegetation, and unlike their real wildlife forms, are more than willing to be photographed, which you will probably find yourself doing with considerable frequency."
,,Beautiful flowers and plants from around the world,5.0,,"Personally, this was my favorite part of gardens by the bay, much more than the cloud forest. Your admission ticket does include both though, so definitely see both of them if you have time. The flower dome has plants from all over the world – we saw cacti, succulents, a huge display of tulips from Holland, and so much more. It’s wonderful to cool off in the air conditioning and take your time to leisurely walk around the paths. We also enjoyed getting a drink from Pollen, the little café inside. Don’t miss this while in Singapore."
,,The flowers and trees are nice,3.0,,It smells lovely and must be pretty in the daytime. We went in the evening after dark so were less impressed. But worth a tour anyway.
,,"With many different theme all year round,fun and relax place to go",5.0,,"Great place for friends, couple and family trip. Nice and cooling place to spend few hours there. Staff are friendly and place is clean."
,,Good selection of habitats and plants and some excellent sculptures. We were luck enough to b,4.0,,Good collection of habitats and plants and some excellent sculptures. We were lucky enough to be there for a rose display which was colourful and fragrant. Worth a visit.
,,wonderful,5.0,,"great place to visit. im a ing flowers trees, wooden carves and stories along the way through. well kept and even the kids liked it."
,,Such beautiful gardens,5.0,,"It was a relief to walk into the cool air of the flower dome. We were welcomed by displays of the most beautiful roses, their promotion in July. The flower dome shows gardens from around the world and is set out so that the many visitors inside do not feel crowded. You could spend hours in here looking at the wonderful gardens and sculptures. It was so beautiful. The facilities are always handy and there were no waiting lines."
,,Sherin Nafie,5.0,,"One of 2 domes located inside Gardens by the Bay. When we visited, the theme was rose romance. We greatly enjoyed the beautiful scents & colors of different roses & flowers. Everything is beautifully arranged. A visit to Singapore would be incomplete without a visit to Gardens by the Bay including the 2 domes (flower & cloud forest)."
,,Extraordinary,5.0,,"We had a lovely lunch at 'Pollen' in the Flower Dome and then wandered around the gardens. We then rolled in drinks at Marina Bay Sands, and then back for the light show at the trees. It worked well logistically. A bit of walking involved, but flat and easy."
,,Get out of the heat and visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.,4.0,,"This is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex. Both offer a very relaxing, beautiful and serene setting to spend 2-3 hours and at the same time get out of the extreme heat and humidity. In fact you may want to bring a light jacket because the Cloud Forest ( that is adjacent to the Flower Dome) is very cool at all times. There are other things to do at Gardens by the Bay but these two are the highlights. You need to buy separate tickets for both locations and are right next to each other."
,,Good place for the flower lovers,4.0,,"Once you step in , you will love the place.Full of various flowers.Visited in the evening hence the atmosphere was fantastic.Some flower plants I have seen for the first time.

If you are nature lover,you will like the place.Somewhat crowdy place.

I like this dome as compared to cloud forest dome"
,,Really lovely to visit,5.0,,We spent ages in here. The feature of 'the flight of a dragonfly' is an absolute must to experience. It had me laughing out loud. Some really great picture opportunities in here.
,,"Nice plants, but too little. Too poor fantasy of designers",2.0,,"Nice plants, but too little. Too poor fantasy of designers.
You should make more bridges, places for sitting and walking on different levels, more funny objects like minerals, caves, multilevel ponds etc.
20 years ago it was ok. Now... it's not. This time it's just boring place.
Hire me and I would make a real pearl from that spot"
,,Beautiful and Educational Seasonal Floral Display in the comfort of an air-conditioned Dome,4.0,,"Interesting installation that changes every season. Always something new to look forward to, especially the temperate plants (tulips, begonias, roses, alpine, etc.) in a hot and humid tropical city."
,,nothing special,3.0,,"The flower dome is one of the two domes in Gardend by the Bay. You only can buy a combination ticket. After the spectacular cloud forest dome this one seemed small and poor. They had a rose show going on, but every European has more roses in his garden than they have in their show. Endy Julv 14
th, 2019. It is nice to walk through the flower dome, but in 30 mins You are done."
,,Interesting but not much Activity,3.0,,"Nice place for pictures (get your perfect Instagram moment), especially during the afternoon. Great variety of plants and flowers from all over the world — however should take water bottle with you. Mainly for horticulture enthusiasts though."
,,A nice place to escape hot weather.,4.0,,"Cool place with various flower from around the world, If you like flower photography this place is recommend."
,,"Well, what do I say",3.0,,I guess this is a nice place and is quite crowded. Went here with my family and was out of there within 30 minutes. I would have done something else instead of going here.
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"By far, this was my favorite attraction that we visited during our trip. There were a lot of varieties of flowers and plants that were showcased. I love their display of succulents! Bring your jackets as well cause it can get very cold."
,,A True Wow!! - A must,5.0,,"Our eyes were simply flooded by the amazing exhibits of the flowers, trees and other type of growth from all over the world. Set up in an extraordinary designed dome the beauty and colours are amazing. Te lay out based on different counties and geographies add to both the understanding and exposure."
,,A Green House of Flower near by the Bay Area,4.0,,"It is a nice green house are developed in a park nearby the Bay Area in Singapore. If you like flowers, you can enjoy the time of your visit. You can enter the Flower Dome by buying a ticket which is combined with the Dome of Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is a large area to host different types pf flowers such as cactus familia, orchids, and roses."
,,Shame we can't do cloud forest as it's closed on the same day.,3.0,,"We bought 2 adult tickets and 2 child tickets for flower dome and cloud forest together from glook. It's not easy as you need to redeem the physical tickets from the reddot museum which is about 15 mins walk distance. However, the tickets were sold under terms and conditions that we need to use each ticket on the same day. The day we went, the cloud forest happen to be closed, so, we missed our chance to go in and it was a waste of money."
,,Not exactly what I expected,2.0,,"This exhibit presents the flowers of the world. I was expecting plants and flowers from Singapore or from southeast Asia only. I was disappointed to see cactus, roses and plants growing in my own backyard in Canada, this is not why I came to Singapore... Layout is just ok. Nice sculptures and decorations, but if you only have time for one dome, prefer the Cloud Forest."
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"I will start this review by stating that I am not a gardener or horticulturalist by any stretch of the imagination, however, I was amazed by this location.

It is extremely well planned and has a wide range of plants, from all four corners of the Globe. Absolutely stunning to see.

The layout is very well planned with a lot of ramps and benches, which makes it easier to get around for people who have mobility problems.

I went with my Aunt and Uncle, both of whom are avid gardeners and they were totally overwhelmed by the place, they just loved it.

We visited at approximately 2.00 pm so there were virtually no queues to get in. That may be something to remember when planning your visit"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,I absolutely loved visiting the flower Dome especially because it has a huge variety of different flowers that a native to different countries! It was great to see such a great variety of succulents (which are my favourite so I am bias)
,,Not overly impressed,4.0,,It was an interesting place to wander (and to get away from the heat) but it was VERY busy when we went which really detracted from the overall experience. The Cloud Forest is more interesting in my opinion.
,,Lovely visit,5.0,,It is a great experience just being there. To be planned for sure. The lines are huge hence get the tickets in advance.
,,Universe of Flowers,5.0,,You can find every flower of the world cherishing and enjoying the lush green environment there. A flower paradise
,,The most amazing gardens I've ever seen!,5.0,,"Truthfully, I'm not that into gardens but, Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay blew me away! A delicious feast for the eyes and it's air conditioned too!"
,,4th Visit,5.0,,The flower dome is by far the very best in the world. I love the cactus most. its really beautiful. love the aircon comfort too.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,So many species of plant to see - global species on show too so something new for everyone visiting! Take a drink - it gets hot!
,,Exquisite Garden Experience,5.0,,Even those who are not particularly interested in gardening or flowers will find something to intrigue in here. The Flower Dome is stunning and I congratulate the team that has put it together. It is absolutely magnificent and one could visit multiple times with the changing of the seasons and the displays. Don't miss this!
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"Although not really a flower guy, I was still impressed with the incredible work they'd put into creating this exhibit. Such incredible diversity of plants and flowers from all over the world, and displayed in a creative, meaningful way. The dome itself is a work of art and sets the tone for a great experience."
,,Beautiful collection of flowers,5.0,,"I don't ordinarily like plants, but the Flower Dome was truly marvelous! The place is full of lovely plants and flowers. Arrangements are very beautiful. The piped-in music added to the relaxing feel of the place. You can just sit around and enjoy the beauty of it all."
,,Loved this,5.0,,"The other cornerstone of the Gardens by the Bay complex, the Flower Dome does a masterful job of showcasing the world's different floral kingdoms in a majestic, comfortable setting.

All of the various kingdoms are provided generous space to illustrate the various types of floral life in the region. Of particular note were the Mediterranean and the Japanese Cherry Blossoms; I found these areas to be exceptionally pleasant and well-rendered.

Much like the Cloud Forest, one can easily spend several hours here. A must-see when in the Merlion City."
,,Great way to escape the heat!,5.0,,"When you're in Singapore and walking around in the heat all day, there's no better way to escape the heat than by going to the Flower Dome (and Cloud Forest).
These two places are amazing. You feel totally transported to another place and time in the Flower Dome and can almost forget you are in the bustling modern city of Singapore. Our boys weren't that interested in most of the flowers but found it interesting generally. We highly recommend it."
,,Well done!,4.0,,"Hello traveller!

This place is well kept, clean and has done a pretty good job at making plants and flowers grow well indoors! You can see a lot of effort is taken to maintain the plants in excellent condition. It's worth a visit!

""Beyond the stars, under the sea - all you seek to see is right here in you right now."" J. H."
,,Spectacular flower and plants display,4.0,,"This huge greenhouse offers wonderful various settings of gardens from all over the World, from Mediterranean to desert. It is combined with the visit of the Cloud Forest within Gardens on the Bay."
,,Arousing all senses,5.0,,Just like all attraction in Gardens by the Bay the Flower Dome is a true masterpiece of construction and creativity. Delightful colours and scents abound!
,,Iconic,5.0,,Do not avoid this iconic place in your Singapore travel. Worth for the price and you can purchase flower seeds etc here.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing visual treats that feast the eyes & ignite the minds to imagine how GoB could microclimate the 1.5 million plants!
,,Attention Flora lovers...,5.0,,"The minute you step into this Dome...it is the holder of exotic flowers..interesting suculants..all landscaped into area's of origin. The flowers, shrubs, trees, herbs, ferns are amazing. I wish I lived closer so I could visit more often..."
,,Amazing flora,4.0,,Must see for flower lovers! Exotic flowers from all over the globe. Take your camera for great photo opportunities. There is a gift shop as well as cafes. Lots to see and experience.
,,Wonderful setting,5.0,,"If you love flora and gardening, this is a must visit. Just think twice about the fast food in the food court. We opted for Indian and the quality was about the same as a supermarket ready meal"
,,Nice,4.0,,"the view is really nice. with good ambiance. Further, there are lots of flower and landscape which will amaze you."
,,Nice and Great Tulip festival,4.0,,"i hold Garden By the Bay friend membership, I really love the different themes and festival brought by the Flower Dome, well done. The design and placement of the flower are nice, and very well maintained. Good Job!"
,,a nice break from the heat,5.0,,the flower dome is air conditioned and a nice refreshing break from the summer heat of singapore! highly recommend
,,FAMBAM,4.0,,"Our kids and I had so much fun and really amazed with the plants, trees and even the waterfalls inside the dome. The architectural design are so astonishing. Thumbs up to the architects, engineers and builders who participated in making this Flower Dome."
,,A paradise on earth,1.0,,"I heard about this place but I had not realised the great atmosphere until I visited this attraction.
As you step in from the warm and humid outside, you can feel the beauty of the flower dome hit you.
The arrangement of the flower beds, the colourful display of flowers, the shrubs and plants hold you in awe.
The variety of colours and the variety of flowers from different parts of the world make you realise how artistic is Mother Nature to produce this wonderful spectacle.
The Japanese flower arrangements were all most spectacular.
This is a must visit place."
,,Very enjoyable and air-conditioned,5.0,,"This was our first venue at Gardens by the Bay and we walked into a huge long dome shaped structure that was well air-conditioned. Despite being fairly crowded we found the place really enjoyable. It is full of baobab trees, cacti, succulents, palm trees, and all kinds of flowers in bloom so it was really colorful. There are also dragons and birds such as eagles carved from tree roots scattered around the place and also large model mushrooms with an Alice in Wonderland theme.

The flower dome is ideal for taking photos, especially of colorful flowers. So many people were taking selfies against beautiful backgrounds too. The great thing about this place is that you can wander around the paths and end up in all sorts of places, so it is really interesting to see what is around every corner.

We probably spent about 45 minutes here, took lots and lots of photos and had a really fun time."
,,Lovely to walk around,4.0,,"We bought a combined ticket for the flower dome and the cloud forest. We went fairly early in the day, and it was not crowded at all, and gave you plenty of time and space. Different displays of flowers, trees and shrubs from all over the world. The rose display was beautiful and well worth seeing.
Even if you are not an avid gardener, it was very nice to see, and also a welcome break from the heat outside!"
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,"We enjoyed the layouts within the Flower Dome and liked all the vibrant colours on display even though unfortunately, the heat was effecting many of the plants."
,,Fun for Kids,5.0,,As soon as you enter the flower dome you are welcomed with fresh air and amazing natural fragrance. We were amazed to see so many variety of flower under one roof. Kids were just enjoying the variety and busy admiring the natural beauty. A must visit attraction in Singapore.
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"The overall Gardens by the Bay are wonderful, both day and night. The Flower Dome is breathtaking with its wonderful variety of flowers from so many locations. A credit to the garderners and organisers."
,,Still Number 1,5.0,,"There's a reason why this is Singapore's number one tourist destination! Enclosed, cool air conditioning and flowers and orchids galore! Good for families, flower lovers and just lovers!"
,,Flowers for all seasons here in Singapore,5.0,,"Many beautiful displays of temperate plants and seasonal specials especially during Christmas, Chinese New Year, orchid show, etc"
,,Beautiful and constantly changing,5.0,,"In case you are wondering which dome to do first, it is best to see this one first because you end up at the entrance of the forest dome. The good thing about this flower dome is that it changes with seasons. We arrived at the moment of the Holland theme with tulips and windmill - so cute. On the upper level are the permanent collections. Depending on your interest, you can stay 30-180 minutes here."
,,A beautiful garden expereince.,4.0,,"We enjoyed the Flower Dome but perhaps not as much as the Cloud Forest. While the plants were very lovely and the way in which it was all presented very interesting it did not seem to have the same 'excitement' as its neighbour.
We liked the way in which it was themed by region and also the sculptures and other art works on view.
Very enjoyable, quite relaxing and well worth a visit."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"So many flowers from so many countrys , big display of Tulips while we were there, even though we had to pay for this and the Cloud forest together unless you were on a tour,this is the better by far"
,,Eden Project but on far grander scale,5.0,,"Another amazing concept and structure, incredible display of flowers and plants. Holland was the feature country on display, amazing colours"
,,Beautifully made garden!,5.0,,"Flower Dome is another indoors garden located across the Cloud Forest. While it's certainly not as iconic as its neighbour, and I'd skip it if it wasn't included in the price, I must say that it is quite beautifully designed indeed. While Cloud Forest is the main attraction, I feel like if not for it, Flower Dome would carry some clout just on its own still. I would suggest to visit it first, otherwise it does feel a little like you've already seen what you came for and while it's beautiful, it is not particularly mind-blowing after the Cloud Forest magnificence. Nevertheless, and I repeat myself... this is an absolutely stunning amazingly designed garden."
,,"This Flower Dome has beauty, charm and wonder. Flower lovers and photo enthusiasts must visit this place",4.0,,When I visited last there was Sakura (Cherry blossom) festival and this time Tulip festival. They always come up with various events and make us appreciate flowers of the world. Though some tulips were yet to bloom I enjoyed going round and observing other flowers and plants. If you are flower lover you can spend hours here. You can see both tropical plants and flowers from cold climate area existing in the same place.
,,Of flowers... and more flowers from different parts of the world!,5.0,,A not-to-be missed attraction when you're in Singapore. Enjoy the beautiful flowers amidst the cool air-conditioned area. Got to see many exotic flowers from the Australia and Africa continent... and tulips galore!
,,Tulipmania,4.0,,"Another season of blooming tulips in tropical Singapore. Kaleidoscopic display of multitude of colours, together with a windmill and lots of clogs ... time to go Dutch!"
,,Well put together,4.0,,"For me, not s impressive as the Cloud Forest but it amazing they can get all these varieties from different climates to grow well under one dome."
,,Buy the combined ticket,4.0,,This is a beautiful indoor garden. We were there when the cherry trees were in full bloom. The Chinese and Japanese sections were especially beautiful at that time. The sculpture is a nice contrast to the flowers. Great collection of succulent plant!
,,Fabulous way to spend a day,5.0,,We had a beautiful day at the flower dome - first I’d all because it’s cool inside There was a tulip festival and my husband is Dutch so it seemed obligatory! Lots of space to wander around and beautiful garden displays
,,Flower Power,4.0,,"Another amazing bio-dome, the biggest greenhouse in the world, with plants and flowers arranged by continent + a specialist exhibition. The entrance fee is about £16, but this also includes the adjacent Cloud Dome! Definitely worth the ticket price!"
,,Flower dome,5.0,,Great experience and worth it .must try to visit when you are in Singapore also the cloud forest .......................
,,A beautiful display,5.0,,"My two daughters and I were pleasantly surprised to see as well as the normal flowers and plants, a Cherry Blossom display which was absolutely beautiful. There were even young Japanese girls in traditional costume walking around which was an added bonus. Even took photos with them and they were very obliging. It is certainly a must to visit when visiting Singapore and is all set under a huge glass air-conditioned dome..."
,,Even tulips!,4.0,,The flower dome was best for us because of the huge South African area plus tulips and a Dutch scene. Tickets can be combined with the Cloud Forest
,,Nice visit but preferred the Cloud Forest,4.0,,"You purchase a combined ticket to visit the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. We thought the Flower Dome was very well laid out and had different regions of fauna. The tulip display was very nice but coming from UK, we have seen better.The Dutch cottage and windmill were attractive. We felt the flower dome did not hang together so well as an ecosytstem as the Cloud Forest did."
,,BEAUTIFUL!,5.0,,"These are two simply wonderful ideas to introduce the public to our wildlife, flowers, plants, trees and an indoor waterfall. The whole place is just stunning"
,,Cozy Garden,5.0,,So huge dome to nestled tons types of flower & plant. In air-cond. atmosfere make your visit so much cozy no matter what outside weather would be. Worth place to visit...
,,Tulip parade,5.0,,"I visited the Flower Dome at the start of the tulip display so some flowers still had not blossomed. It was still an amazing site and such a beautiful display of flowers from all over the world along with the featured tulips.
Highly recommend a visit. Make sure you allow a good amount of time to fully enjoy the displays."
,,So much to see,5.0,,There's a lot of information here. You could easily spend all day there if you wanted to. We just enjoyed the plants and sculptures. There's a food hall down some stairs near the entrance.
,,Well worth it.,5.0,,"Really great atmosphere although the numerous selfie takers were a bit annoying but seems to be a common problem these days. Loads of photo opportunities, lots of wooden animals and do not miss the Dragon. As it is a flower dome and subject to growing seasons how many flowers you will see in full flow depends on when you go, but plenty of other plants to keep most real gardeners happy."
,,A world-class botanical center,5.0,,It's air conditioned. It's big. And you could stay in here all day. I would advise you come before school lets out. Some parents bring their obnoxious kids in here after school.
,,Great family fun,5.0,,This - along with all of Gardens by the Bay attractions - is an architectural feat. Wonderful. Airconditioned. So much to see and really promoting environmental awareness.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"The dome is worth a visit, and is worth paying to see it. Go and discover the great flowers, relax, enjoy!"
,,Impressive,4.0,,It was impressive to see the scale of the place and the amount of various flora that were contained in this dome.
,,Beautiful and colorful tulips and awesome landscape setting,4.0,,"Singaporeans who may not have the opportunity to go overseas to enjoy flowers and gardens grown in countries far from the tropics would find visiting this flower dome an eye opening.

I came here during Mother's Day with a huge group of residents. To celebrate Mother's Day, participants paid $25/- each to visit Gardens by the Bay followed by a dinner at Bukit Batok Hometeam Ns club. I was assigned as a bus in-charge to bring the residents here.

It seem worthwhile as the entrance ticket is already around $25/- but we found it quite rushing. We arrived at Gardens by the Bay at about 4.45 pm and have to be at the bus bay at 6.15 pm, thus leaving less than 2 hrs for the sightseeing.

At least the tulip floral arrangement at the Flower Dome compensated me for the rush. The tulip flowers were fresh and matched well with the surrounding landscape. It was an ideal place for photography.

We were disappointed with the Cloud Forest as there was a huge waiting crowd at the lift lobby and the estimated waiting time was 20 mins. Some re-design need to be considered in the future to ensure the way up do not overly rely on the lift and thus deprived those who can climb up an opportunity to view the Cloud Forest. I left the Cloud Forest disgruntled and disappointed.

Nevertheless, the tulip exhibition was marvelous and awesome and I spent almost 2 hrs appreciating the beauty of the tulip landscape."
,,Amazing Tulip Festival,5.0,,The flower dome garden is currently having a tulip festival. The garden is deck out in many colors of tulips and the display is incredible. It looks as if you are walking through the Dutch tulip fields in the Netherlands! Definitely worth a visit.
,,Go in the daytime,5.0,,The domes are quieter during the day so you can look around more peacefully. You only get one entry so take your time and enjoy.
,,Even if you don't like gardening -Visit,4.0,,We went in for a visit not really knowing what to expect. I am not a gardener but on walking into the flower dome I was amazed by the amount of plants flowers and planning that had taken place. Plenty of seats to relax and take in the scenery.
,,Very well planned and an architectural delight,5.0,,Very interesting and relaxing just quietly wandering around and taking in this wonderful attraction and the reactions of the visitors
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,Must see if in Singapore. Combine this with the whole Marina Bay Gardens . Amazing gardens. Thoroughly enjoyed walking through and looking at eveything
,,Manicured distraction posing as garden?,2.0,,"Bland, boring, processed contrivance masquerading as garden. Even given the constraints of creating authentic jungle with cultivated garden, there becomes an awareness of flowers tortured into subservient line ups, looking oddly manufactured. One realises too soon that the entire concept fails abysmally. No where is there energy, no marvellous random sweep of nature, carelessly sidestepping one's path. The main event the majestic mountain should at least contain some real wild life?. If not some spectacular birds of prey, then a bit of nostalgic cinematic reference for kids and older kids, Give us a King Kong at least to have something to savour/ glimpse for a good debrief on the way home. Something to enthuse about? after all that well behaved walkabout..."
,,Nice,4.0,,A lot of strange flowers that I have never seen before. It would take around 1 hour to finish the visit.
,,beautiful,5.0,,good variety of flowers and arrangements must visit. bit crowded on weekends so prepare for Queues however staff manages it very well.
,,A Tulip surprise!!,5.0,,"In short words - ""A visual and olfactory treat!""

Stepping into the flower dome from a blazing sun, you are already treated with air conditioned environment that allows you to immediately relax and are greeted with various scents coming from different flowers.

Although it does not look so big from outside, the flower dome is quite huge inside and contains flowers of all kinds. We were lucky to be visiting at the time when a Tulip festival was going on (Till May 20th 2019) and we had a sneak peak into the Kukenhoff festival from Netherlands with a mock Windmill in the flower dome!

All kinds of flowers are on display and the flower dome is also a photographer's paradise.

A Quick walk would need about 30 minutes (assuming you are here to see the flowers and not just walk), but plan to spend at least 1 hour and keep additional 30 minutes if you are a photo freak!"
,,Awesome flower dome at Garden By The Bay with ever changing surprise,4.0,,"Awesome garden with flowers deco changed every quarter. After the cherry blossom festival last quarter, now is tulip season. Colour flowers with multi varieties, completed with beautiful related country-theme deco make visitors feel that they are in the real country itself, Holland! Looking forward to the next change. The garden is fully air-conditioned too."
,,Specacular!,5.0,,"Incredible experience in the climate controlled "" green house "" spectacular outside landscaping with was 6 years in the making. A must see when visiting Singapore"
,,Spectacular & Impressive!,5.0,,"From the moment you step into the Flower Dome you know you are going to have a very enjoyable time. The amazing smells inside of here are those like no other. You can tell you are breathing in some of the purest air and smells while inside.

This is an absolute must-visit while in Singapore. It is right next door to the Cloud Forest and is part of the Gardens by the Bay membership (which I recommend buying). The display of flowers is spectacular inside here! While I was there the other day there was a huge tulip display.

Even though tulips were everywhere within here they also have arrays from each different part of the world. South America, Mediterranean, Asian - every type of environment is displayed here. It is quite exquisite and I will definitely be coming back next time I am in Singapore!"
,,A lovely display,4.0,,The flower dome is a beautifully designed series of gardens under a massive dome. On the day of our visit it was very busy and I would recommend buying tickets online.
,,The ticket system is quite ridiculous,1.0,,"My family and I really wanted to visit the Cloud Forest Dome, but it turns out you HAVE to buy a package to see both domes at 28$... We didn’t end up going because we didn’t want to pay nearly 30$ to visit a dome we weren’t interested in... You should probably give visitors a choice !"
,,Stunning array of floral species,5.0,,"If you like nature, flowers or gardening, this will blow you away. The array of species here is incredible and the displays mind blowing."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Plants/Flowers and trees from around the world set out in the 5 continents - inspiring and quite exquisite.
,,Fantastic place to visit,5.0,,The dome was pretty crowded the day we visited but moved through the different sections easily. Bright vibrant colours with all the tulips in full bloom. Cooler inside the dome than expected so nice to visit on a hot day.
,,Singapore flower dome,5.0,,Wonderful place to while away a few hours on a hot 🥵 or wet day Stunning displays Stop for a coffee break in beautiful surroundings From the flower dome you can have a complete change and visit the cloud right next door
,,Excellent to do no matter what the weather is!,4.0,,"I was really happy we explored the Flower Dome. We had made reservations at the terrace at Pollen inside the Flower Dome and if you eat there you get a free admission into the Dome. We had no idea about Pollen, a friend told us last minute otherwise probably wouldn’t have come. The Flower Dome did not disappoint! They had Tulip Mania going on while we were there, it was great! The day we visited the heat index with humidity was 108, it was nice and cool inside the Dome. There was a downfall of rain that was really fun to experience. I highly recommend checking out the Flower Dome if flowers are your thing! There were quite a bit of people the day we were there but I didn’t find it too crowded at all. I’d also like to point out the restrooms were maintained very well throughout."
,,AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is a fascinating botanical garden in the Gardens by the Bay. There we saw the mini-equivalent of Kuikenhof Garden (Netherlands) where they have hundreds of thousands of different colored tulips, all arranged for an eye-shattering experience. It is indescribable in words and must be seen. This exhibit, paired with the Cloud Forest next door, are absolutely gorgeously beautiful and must be seen if you are in Singapore!!!!"
,,Nice assortment of all types of flora and fauna,4.0,,"Visited here when they had the sakura festival so they also had cherry blossoms around too!
Yeah there are quite a lot of flowers and different types of fauna and whatnot but if you really want to see pretty flowers I'd recommend visiting the Singapore Botanic Gardens instead (especially for their orchids).
I did like the cloud forest better than the flower dome"
,,Nice and beautiful flower dome,4.0,,"This dome at the Gardens by the bay is impressive and beautiful but not as much as the Cloud dome, but still a nice visit. Anyway, you can only buy tickets to the two domes."
,,""" Flower Power""",5.0,,"Having made a trip to Singapore last year with not enough time to visit the Flower dome, it was top of our must do's on this visit. The Dome i believe is one of the largest of its kind in the world and holds an enormous variety of plants and flowers. The dome has themed areas throughout the year and we were very fortunate in March to enjoy the Japanese cherry blossom exhibit. The blossoms were stunning as were many exhibits related to Japan. I spent most of my time over two hours taking hundreds of pictures and avoiding the humid air outside. I highly recommend a visit and I know if you love nature you will love it to.
Footnote outside the building was concert of Japanese music and dance which added to the enjoyment of the visit."
,,Asia's largest indoor flower garden,5.0,,I visited this place while the Tulip Mania was on. Amazing collection of tulips on display along with miniature gardens from each continent. Felt like bliss to be walking among the beautiful flowers. It takes around 3-4 hours to explore the complete dome at a leisurely place. Plenty of photo-ops here. They have free guided tours. Do take advantage of them to know more about the flowers and how they are cultivated. Best time to visit is early in the morning as crowds swell towards the afternoon.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,It’s a beautiful collection of trees and flowers from all over the world. We were lucky to see Dutch tulips as their season is only April and May.
,,See it to believe it !!,5.0,,The concept is completely out of the world...Such wide variety of flowers from all over the world.. Walk slowly and enjoy every bit of it.. Excellent photo opportunities too :)
,,Flower Dome - Seasonal Theme (Sakura),4.0,,"The theme of the Flower Dome changes with the seasons. In March it was Sakura, or Cherry blossom. Lovely."
,,Just gorgeous!,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world (as listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records) and houses a changing display of flowers and plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid regions of the world.

We visited in February at the time of Lunar New Year, so the gardens were stunningly decorated with that theme. Having said that, these gardens with their themed exhibits are a delight at any time of year, and well worth a visit."
,,Great visit!,4.0,,We were lucky enough to go when KLM had a sponsored exhibit featuring thousands of tulips. It was stunning. On a very hot day it was great to get into the air conditioning for an hour and wander among the beautiful flowers. Perhaps not one for teenagers but us oldies loved it!
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"If you are a flower and plant enthusiast, you should not miss spending a couple of hours walking through. Currently it is in celebration of Holland, so lots of Tulips. A must see if you like flowers."
,,Tulip time!,4.0,,"It was a Dutch tulip celebration when we visited the Flower Dome, nice presentation including a windmill, typical Holland home and wooden shoes...plenty of tree and flower varieties throughout the air conditioned dome!"
,,Lovely botanic display,5.0,,"One thing Singapore does very well - is gardening. They have the most amazing displays, and this is no exception. Pay the entry fee and have a look. Dessert, rainforest, tropical to country-based displays of interesting plants and flowers. Even if you are not normally a ""plant' enthusiast - you'll enjoy this!"
,,"Beautiful, Baobabs",4.0,,"It is not garden full of flowers as I expected, but still it was not so bad. I saw various types of baobabs, and I so wanted to see one Little Prince being one of my favorite books. I would skip this attraction next time I go, but I would still love to visit Cloud Forest again and of course seeing the Super trees are absolutely for free. Actually, entering the park, strolling, jogging is free in the park, you can also freshen up at McDonald's there."
,,So beautiful 🌺🌺🌺,5.0,,Such a beautiful space to spend time in. The display from all around the world is interesting and th current display of tulips are gorgeous. The space is lovely and cool - so easy to spend as much time as you would like in.
,,So Many Flowers,5.0,,"We went on the last day of the cherry blossoms from Japan, they were so pretty. I enjoyed seeing all the types of flowers they had. It was really beautiful. We bought our tickets on Klook and were able to walk right on it, no waiting. We also went in the morning, it was busy, but not as busy in the afternoon."
,,Very enjoyable,5.0,,Another dome at Gardens by the Bay and also an excellent place to visit for 1 to 2 hours. Just walk slowly through this and enjoy all the different plants from different countries around the world. Colourful and well displayed it is enjoyable for all ages.
,,"Stunning, don't miss it!",5.0,,"Not only is this a wonderful place to escape the heat, it is also a magical place of colour and discovery. Remember to look up for wood and bronze sculptures set in hidden places all through the Dome. Take your time and enjoy."
,,One of Gardens by the Bay's Premiere attractions!!,5.0,,Both Flower Dome & Cloud Forest are not to be missed. The brilliance of their organization is phenomenal. They will always be our most awesome memory of Singapore. Wish we had had a full time to enjoy them.
,,Safest city in the world,5.0,,My mother misplaced her phone inside Flower Dome which had all of us worried if we would ever find it. but to all our pleasant surprise the staff returned the phone at the exit counter. Thank you
,,Amazing,5.0,,We've been to many gardens over the years but never ever experienced anything like this - amazing - so many different species and very cleverly laid out - beautiful. Easy to get around and once in youu will never want to leave! Enjoy!
,,so pretty,5.0,,we really enjoyed our walk around here such pretty flowers and wonderful smells and the chinese new year display was very nice
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"This place is amazing, so much to see not just flowers but wooden carvings amongst the greenery. We included this in our ticket for Gardens by the Bay and it was worth every penny."
,,amazing,5.0,,"we were so lucky to experience this gem, thousands of plants and a special exhibtions of japanese culture was goin on while we were there. super super, we can hardly recommand this place"
,,A lovely collection,5.0,,"A lovely collection of trees, plants & flowers from all over the world in a temperature controlled dome. Expect to spend a couple of hours here before moving on to the next dome."
,,Well worth the visit!,5.0,,Decorated with a display of blossoming cherry trees and spring flowers the Dome was absolutely beautiful. Be sure to spend some time just walking thru the dome to see the other displays. There were several girls in uniform offering guided tours if that interests you. A must see in Singapore!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Amazing experience. The variety of plants, especially the cacti and trees were wonderful to see. Loved it."
,,Best botanical garden ever!,5.0,,"Just amazing setting and plants. Enjoyed every minute of the 1.5 hour we spent there. If you can only see one of the domes, see this one."
,,Definitely worth seeing!,5.0,,"Creative displays of flowers and it is air-conditioned, a welcome treat in a tropical city. We definitely enjoyed it."
,,Always something different.,5.0,,"We last visited about a year ago, and found the whole experience so good that we promised to return if the opportunity arose. The exhibited areas keep changing so there is always something new to see. A simply wonderful place."
,,Good getaway for an hour +,5.0,,The design of the building or atrium is beautiful. Every angle is photogenic and the plant varieties are wonderful.
,,Excellent display of cooler climate plants,5.0,,"One of the two domes in the Gardens by the Bay, this houses a collection of cooler climate and arid climate plants that would not normally survive in the ""usual"" hot and humid Singapore conditions. An excellent and very spacious collection - well worth at least half a day on its own with plant species from literally everywhere (including the South American deserts!). Lots of other architecture and artwork to photograph, so a definite must see if visiting Gardens by the Bay for any reason."
,,Best thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,This was a total surprise! I walked in not really expecting to be impressed but was totally blown away! Flowers and plants aren't usually my things but being in here was like a walking meditation. It's was so peaceful and beautiful. It can get very cold though so take a jacket it you plan on being in the for a while (easy to spend 2 hours here).
,,Kudos to the great work of constant updates and maintainence,5.0,,"We've been here a few times, and each time they have a different theme and a whole lot of new flowers and matching theme displays in the central garden. We love the Christmas themes each year, how they meticulously set up a nordic Santa's workshop theme and nordic flowers to match, or the rare tulips/ cherry blossoms whenever they're in town. Do take time to explore the longstanding exhibits of plants that belong to the different zones around the world, amazingly all united in this place.

Despite it being a gigantic dome, we're estimating it to be at least 10 levels high, on a space of at least four football fields, almost all the flowers we see every time are well nourished in this cool, air-conditioned dome. Quite a feat considering how hot Singapore is and how hard it is to even keep plants at home alive, definitely much harder at this scale! Always a great place for inspiring one to set up green corners at home!

The one and only eatery INSIDE the flower dome is where you can relax and enjoy some fine wines or afternoon tea. Their terrace allows you to enjoy a view of the bay. Otherwise, there are also many other food options right after you exit the flower dome."
,,Great place to Visit,5.0,,Great variety of flowers and very well maintained. Spent around an hour here and it was a great experience.
,,Incredible Variety - Great for Photographs,5.0,,"I loved visiting the Flower Dome, full of a huge variety of plants from brightly coloured flowers, cacti, big trees and even herbs. Lots of hidden sculptures to spot on your way round. We went shortly after the CNY so it was even more of an experience as they had celebratory displays set up.

The air feels rich with oxygen and you can feel it sinking into your skin. It is the most incredible feeling to breathe in clean oxygen rich air. It's also lovely and cool inside."
,,Nice,5.0,,It was PRETTY cold! Take a scarf and a jacket to stay warm inside. The cherry blossom exhibition was stunning
,,"An Awesome Experience, Absolutely Stunning",5.0,,It was very nice. when we had gone it was the Sakura festival and it was raining. Inside there was AC coooling. But you have to walk a lot so be ready for that. You can go there using the Downtown Line MRT. Admission fee to enter the Dome is $28 for Adults and $15 for Children. This fee also includes The Cloud Forest. If you go to Singapore going to the Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest is a must as they both are very beautiful.
,,Love this place,5.0,,I visit this flower Dome for the first time ever I'm a Singaporean and I love all the nature and is cooling place I spending about 3 hours and taking all the pictures is good to bring a children's too and is an amazing place in my country
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,"The dome is a lovely place to wander around exploring plants/flowers and trees from around the world. The dome is set out on areas around the globe.

The A/C is almost chilly, I was expecting a greenhouse and it to be roasting hot.

Best park is the Japanese cherry blossom garden. Beautiful to wander through and take pictures.

Busy with lots of people. Toilets are clean. Near toilets is a water fountain, great to fill water bottles up."
,,Flowers are beautiful,5.0,,"The flowers are beautiful, it makes you wonder how they must maintain it! Definitely worth a visit if you have time and if you’re into flowers."
,,Not as stunning as the cloud dome...,4.0,,...but this could be due to the Sakura exhibit being nearing its conclusion. The domes provide a welcome escape from a warm day as they are both temperate (which feels decidedly chilly)!
,,A must visit,5.0,,"This is our second trip to Singapore. The first time we went through the park but didn't take in the flower dome and cloud forest as we didn't have time. We made sure we experienced them this time around.

The Japanese Cherry Blossom exhibit was here and it was definitely worthwhile to see it. The exhibit is amazing!

We went on a weekday so it wasn't too busy. It certainly is a nice repreave from the heat to be able to spend a few hours inside the wonderfully aircooled gardens."
,,Watch and learn about the flowers and plants,5.0,,You could see as many as flowers and plants inside the dome. The place is too busy and packed with tourist. Plan 1-2 Hrs in dome so you dont miss anything.
,,Beautifulto house,5.0,,"Amazing how a magnificent structure can be used to house so many plants and beautiful statues. It was busy, but such a large area for one to cover."
,,Walk in Utopia- Cool Place,4.0,,"A place to feast the eyes on plants and flowers from all over the world in a climate controlled environment. The theme changes periodically, so the display and plants are refreshed. The air conditioned envrionment keeps the regional plants climatised, while visitors get a welcome relief from the heat outdoors. Price is a bit steep though, but you could easily spend an hour or more strolling through the dome."
,,spectacular,5.0,,"This is a must see especially in March as the Japanese Cherry Blossom trees are in full bloom. Air conditioned . well thought out, fantastic to wonder and enjoy"
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,This is a must visit especially in March as one can see the Japanese Cherry Blossom trees in full bloom without doing a separate trip to Japan. Visually stunning.
,,Awesome Gardens,5.0,,"We thought it was going to be toasting hot in the flower dome but it was the opposite it was nicely air conditioned.
Inside the dome is just awesome with a fantastic selection of plants, trees, flowers, cactuses, sculptors etc.
If you like flowers this is definitely a place to visit if in Singapore.
There is a large gift shop after you exit the dome selling souvenirs."
,,nicely done!,4.0,,The place is nicely done and they change the flowers depends of the event. The place is bit small and too many people and it is very cold!!
,,So many species of flower,5.0,,Wow what an assortment of flowers most I have never heard from. Beautiful collection and display. Temp in the dome is great considering its so hot outside.
,,Lovely garden,5.0,,"Would highly recommend GBTB to any visitor to Singapore. The flower dome is a beautifully designed space with multiple themes within. There is also a cherry blossom area currently in the dome. Have lunch or coffee at Pollen, the restaurant adjacent to the flower dome, and you'll be given free entry into the dome - no need to buy tickets."
,,Sakura matsuri,5.0,,"The flower dome is well worth a visit as you get to see so many different kinds of exotic plants and flowers from faraway lands. It also presents different floral displays throughout the year, which adds a special allure to each new visit. This time around, the theme is cherry blossoms from the land of the rising sun. I had a really amazing experience strolling in the Japanese-style garden complete with torii gates plus a tea house and feasting my eyes on the multitude of exquisite sakura on the cherry trees.What a sight to behold since I missed seeing them in Japan."
,,Overall Good..!!,4.0,,Visit this garden after completing cloud forest. So expectation is so high as cloud forest was great. So this garden is ok just roam around and capture some photoshoots moment.
,,"Beautiful, stunning, gorgeous.",5.0,,Oh my goodness this is such a beautiful place. It has been so well designed - it is like a rain forest and there are the most amazing carvings and sculptures through out the walk. The walk inside the dome takes you up to the top of a waterfall and brings you down through the trees and plants of the forest. I absolutely loved it and feel it is a must for anyone visiting Singapore. Really beautiful!
,,Flowers Flowers Flowers,5.0,,"A excellent range on display and not just Asia, it has all around the world displays. The flowers are very well maintained and making you want the take a bunch. Can be busy"
,,A gardeners paradise,5.0,,The Flower Dome is s massive air conditioned green house with garden displays from all over the world. If you are an avid gardener I highly recommend coming here and for all those who enjoy plants and flowers. Between the Dome & the Cloud Forest you could easily spend several hours walking around & exploring. A must do in Singapore.
,,Cherry blossoms,5.0,,"Quite nice cherry blossoms, go at the beginning of the display and not at the end where the imported plants are almost dead."
,,Flower dreams,5.0,,"This place is really more than just flowers, there are a lot of plants and other greenery mixed in with ""plant architecture"". It's truly a beautiful place to visit. In one area there were small models made using real plants as part of the scenes, check out some of my pictures."
,,Green Oasis,4.0,,Although the main gardens are free the S$28 charge for entry to the two domes are good value. There is a huge range of plants on display and the dome closure provides some welcome respite from the Singapore heat
,,An amazing greenhouse,5.0,,"This place is a must for its amazing architecture, the sheer size of the structure (about as big as 75 Olympic-sized swimming pools, according to the official website), and the number, variety and beautiful display of plants, flowers, and trees. True lovers of flowers and plants can easily spend a whole day here."
,,Nice but should have come here before visiting Cloud Forest,4.0,,"Nicely arranged serene setting featuring several themed areas to represent typical plant life throughout the world. The temperature inside feels surprisingly cold compared with the typical Singapore warmth outside.
A useful tip: you may want to come here first and visit Cloud Forest second. We made the mistake of visiting them the other way round, and Flower Dome – despite its beauty and impressiveness – felt sadly, well, average after the over-the-top sci-fi greenhouse next door."
,,Truly beautiful,5.0,,"An attraction at Gardens in the Bay, the Flower Dome is divided into different gardens where you can see plants and trees from all over the world. There is a charge to visit the Flower Dome but it is well worth it."
,,Spectacular and so well done,5.0,,"We visited the Flower Dome whilst visiting the Gardens by the Bay. There were beautiful flowers from different countries like South Africa and Japan. It was very cool both in temperature and presentation. The special Japanese “Sakura Matsuri Garden Trail” exhibition had some wonderful cherry and plum blossoms. Not enough words to describe how good it was .. other than to say, just go and see it for yourself!"
,,AMAZING!,5.0,,"Flower Dome is totally spectacular. It has collection of plants from all over the world. It is super colorful, informative showcasing different climates and the plants and flower growing in such environment. Mesmerizing and colorful flowers reflecting different seasons as well."
,,Wonderful Japan Cherry Blossom Display - Free Admission if you dine at the Pollent,5.0,,"Flower Dome is an amazing addition to the Gardens by the Bay. If you dine at the Pollens, the restaurant attached to the Flower Dome, you ge free admission to that part of ""Garden by the Bay"". The current Japanese Cherry Blossom Display was amazing and I highly recommend it. However you need to bring a light jacket because they keep to keep the temperature down for the Flower display. I will let my photos speak for itself!"
,,Every Conceivable Exotic Flower From Around The World,5.0,,"The colour, the variety and quality are astounding. The drop in temperature is a thing of beauty in itself but these gardens are truly amazing and well worth a look."
,,Wonderful attraction,5.0,,"Just amazing can get cool when walking around so a scarf or cardigan around your shoulders is a must, beautiful flowers and displays."
,,Stunning.,5.0,,These domes are a sight to behold and a welcome respite from the heat outside. It can get so cool in there that a little cardigan can be needed if you are going to be there for a couple of hours. Allow at least 1 hour but for a more relaxed time where you can sit and just look at the surroundings then allow 2+ hours. Plenty of photo opportunities to be had here.
,,Flowers flowers everywhere!,5.0,,Such a beautiful sight! It's a little cold just like the cloud forest so remember to dress your little ones in something warm. The blooms are arranged beautifully and you can find some really exotic trees also. Beautiful place to visit. Will defiantly visit again.
,,Crazy!,5.0,,I doubt there is anything like this in the world! Very tall and also organic. This is a must see in Singapore; you won't even believe it.
,,Great,5.0,,"Bought the ticket as a duo with the cloud forest and it was excellent.
Lots of different flowers to see and it's not too crowded inside, I'm sure I sae a guided tour available advertised which would have given me a better insight.
As it was I walked around and read up on the exhibits from all different countries.
A photographer's dream"
,,INCREDIBLE to See this Flower Dome! LOVED IT! AWESOME!,5.0,,"This is a part of the Gardens by the Bay complex. You really need to see this biosphere. You'll really love being in here on a hot day outside! The superstructure dome is quite amazing to see. It's a photographers dream to take photos. The variety of plants and flowers inside are amazing to see. There are a variety of countries and regions represented here. I loved the Japan traditional ""gates"" and blossoms.

BOTTOM LINE: A must see excursion to see when visiting Singapore. Well worth your while to see! MY RATING: 10/10."
,,Beautiful bit Cold!,4.0,,"Maybe it's just me! I could have used a jacket. Temperature inside is about 20deg but feels like 18deg!
Beautiful place to visit, easy to loose half a day wandering around and more time if seeing cloud forest dome too.
It's worth hiring the audio guide for s$4 (hire before entering the dome), giving you a nice insight to the dome and plants all around.
Also a nice cafe inside, a bit expensive, coffee average but good for a relax and top-up."
,,A Must See,5.0,,"Admission is a bit pricey but it includes the adjacent Cloud Forest. Both of these attractions cannot be missed on a visit to Singapore. Note, do not pay extra for Gardens by the Bay - not worth it."
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,"Spending Xmas in Singapore, or any other time of the year for that matter, this is a sight that simply no one should miss. Amazing artificial waterfalls, exciting presentation of a huge variety of plants, representing flora from the various corners of the world. Among the plants, sculptures of fantasy creatures are hidden, creating very nice photo opportunities. A huge souvenir store for those who like memorabilia."
,,Very good,4.0,,"Not quite as good as the rain garden, but equally colourful and again worth the entry and time required. Catering facilities a little limited."
,,"World class, stunning display of exotic flowers and trees from across the globe under one giant glass dome !!!",5.0,,"The Flower dome at the Gardens by the Bay is a World class, stunning display of exotic flowers and trees from across the globe under one giant glass dome !!! Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world. The place is very well designed and is quite huge. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It took us about 3-4 hours to see the entire flower dome peacefully. They have plenty of places to sit n relax if one gets tired walking around. The artificially controlled temperature replicates a mild, dry climate and has plants found in the Mediterranean and regions like Australia, South America, South Africa.

The Flower Dome is about 125 feet high and maintains a temperature between 23 °C and 25 °C. The Dome has 7 different theme gardens within itself as well as an olive grove with a bistro and a central changing display field.

Its a must must visit place in Singapore and is a real relaxing experience !!!!"
,,Easy to get to by MRT. Good signage.,5.0,,Ticket applies to both domes. Consessions apply. Gardens surrounding are free. Good little coffee shop inside dome. Not crowded. Free maps.
,,feast to the eyes,5.0,,the most beautiful display of flora anywhere should not be missed at Marina Bay Resort. The layout is perfection.
,,Worth a visit if this is your thing,4.0,,When we visited this place it was very busy and we had difficultly moving around due to the crowds. It was interesting and it was great to get out of the humid heat but there was no areas where you could relax.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"The flower dome was hosting special celebrations for the chinese new year during our visit. The displays, mainly dahlias on this occasion, were specatacular. It's a delight for anyone keen on flowers and photography."
,,Enter for free via Pollen,4.0,,"Don't waste your money buying an entry ticket. Make a reservation at Pollen for coffee and desserts, and enter the dome for free - look around and enjoy a delicious coffee after. This works especially well if you are travelling with family or in a group, where the amount you'd pay per head would add up to more than what you'd spend at Pollen."
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,The Flower dome is amazing. They have all different gardens from lots of countries under this dome. They have done a really good job in creating these gardens
,,A Very Nice Botanical Garden,5.0,,"I'm not a huge botanical garden fan, but this one is just the right size to walk through and interesting enough to spend an hour on it. It is sectioned off by geography - i.e. plants from SE Asia, plants from North America, etc. - which makes it easy to follow."
,,mother of all green houses,3.0,,no plastic flowers here. this is what i imagined where plum fairies live. it is cool and well ventilated. i want to bring my mother here on mothers day. do not buy souvernirs! the entrance fee to the cload forest and flower dome is expensive. you can find cheaper souvernirs that looks the same in chinatwn and lucky plaza
,,interesting and colourful,4.0,,"Interesting enclosed dome allowing flowers from a variety of countries to be grown and displayed. Set on a number of levels combined with sculptures the gathers are well set out and maintained. With some of the displays changed quite regularly to maintain variety.
The lower levels in the dome were quite cool so may want to take a light jumper or cardigan."
,,Out for the day,4.0,,Nice to see all the flowers out in bloom nice to see the arrangement of the dome in which you can find all types of flowers in natural surroundings and the colours that are used to create the best show
,,Amazing flowers,5.0,,We loved the flower dome. It was a photographers dream and flowers and plants were beautifully displayed. Well worth the entrance fee and great air conditioning
,,One of best place for flower lovers,3.0,,Nicely built flower dome.it has variety of flowers and quite big enough.nicely maintained and kept...
,,Wasted My Time Here,1.0,,What seems to be remnants of the Chinese New Year exhibit were in the form of wilted flowers. The flow of the paths do not make sense. The only nice thing about this place is the Aircon.
,,Beautiful Flower Dome,5.0,,"Flower Dome in Singapore is located at Gardens by the bay. A very popular tourist attraction, it is an air-conditioned green house dome with a large collection of flowering plants including the exotic varieties. The interiors of dome is segregated based on different themed gardens.
The Dome is open from 9 a.m till 9 p.m and accessible using Bayfront MRT station. There is an entry fee of about 28 SGD to the dome and a ticket is provided with combined entries to flower dome and cloud garden. Tickets can be purchased at location and in advance as well. Evening hours between 4 and 7 p.m are peak and might result in waiting time.
The dome is considered largest glass greenhouse in the world. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Amazing and reasonably priced,5.0,,"Had such a good time, I went again when I traveled back to Singapore. Lots of walking but they change the main display each season."
,,Loved the Flower Dome,5.0,,"Of the two conservatories, we preferred the Flower Dome. We went early in the morning and as amateur photographers, had a wonderful time capturing all the delights hidden around each corner. Loved the LEGO flowers and the Chinese pagoda and lanterns."
,,surganya aneka jenis bunga bunga,5.0,,"feel amazed when the front door open... the smell, the air and the landscaping absolutely great... feel like in real Forrest"
,,As a nature lover I find this awesome,5.0,,"The most highlights of my trip was seeing , smelling and enjoying the Tulips flower. I was so lucky to see them. I know . I'm weird about it but we don't have it here in Philippines and those are my favorite flowers."
,,Exceeded Expectations!,5.0,,"We spent a lovely two hours touring the Flower Dome and the nearby Cloud Forest Dome. The flower displays were wonderfully done and quite varied, the crisp cool air inside the dome refreshing and views out to the city and marina very nice. Definitely worth a trip."
,,Did not meet Expectations,3.0,,"Flower dome was a disappointment, may be because Iam not a flower person. We visited Flower Dome after Cloud Forest, if we did it the other way around then the flower dome would have managed to score a bit. But if you see Cloud forest and then flower dome it fails to leave an impression."
,,For flower fans,3.0,,"Cooled place (I was suprised how those warmth-loving flowera survive in this dome) so the ppace where you can cool off. No drinking or eating inside allowed, but there are toileta. I would say that this place thinks about tourists. A lot of nice places to take pictures at."
,,Spectacular Flowers,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is situated next to the Cloud Forest, it is well worth a visit to see the beautiful displays of various plants & flowers from around the world. A kaleidoscope of stunning colours and flowers of all shapes & sizes. If you are visiting The Garden of Bays we recommend you see the Flower Dome."
,,Lovely way to pass an hour,4.0,,"I had a long stop over in Singapore, I had wanted to go to the Chinese and Japanese gardens, but rainy weather put paid to that. I looked for something to do inside, and this came up as a top suggestion. I am keenly into photography, and I bought a combined entrance ticket at the airport for $25 and took the MRT - total excursion cost $30. I found the flower down a lovely climate controlled place to spend an hour and two and enjoyed photographing the flowers."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Truly stunning displays of flowers and gardens from all over the world, extremely well laid out with comprehensive labelling of exhibits. We visited when the Dahlia display was on and came away with the names of so many varieties that we loved and will now try to source fro our own garden"
,,Raining Flowers,3.0,,"Same with Cloud Forest, this attraction is also amazing since the floral life can be seen blooming and spreading love all over the place and among its visitors.

I'm so glad that during the time we visited this place, they had an exhibit which showcased the tulips of Amsterdam.

Overall, this was a nice experience to live by.

A good family activity.

Entrance fee is required. We bought ours together as a bundle with Cloud Forest."
,,Almost as good as the Cloud Forest,4.0,,Next door and with the same ticketing as the Cloud Forest both are 'worth a diversion'. When You leave get stampted for a free return (same day) if you have time.
,,Awake but in a dream,5.0,,"In the era of smartphones, everyone finds it hard not to take pictures at every step in the dome. But it's important to remind us that our eyes and memory are a better souvenir and enrichment of the visit in flower dome. The dome is totally worth a visit as it's so beautifully engineered and we literally forget where we come from and just want to stay in the real life dream"
,,Wow,5.0,,This is a must The place is awesome you can't believe this is in the middle of a city. Best time to go is when it's hot lovely and Cool inside.
,,Beautiful Flower Arrangements,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is one of the attractions to see at Gardens by the Bay. Inside it was beautiful and cool as the entire Dome is airconditioned. The flora that was on offer was from all over the world, with great facts and information placed around them. The arrangements were very beautifully done and allowed for good views of all the flora. There are tons of good photo opportunities, and lots of learning to be done by little ones. A good way to get out of the heat of the day, and beautiful at night as well!"
,,Paradise on earth,4.0,,"My family visited the Flower Dome last year, and it was really a cool and breathtaking stroll, scented with the fresh fragrance of pristine petals from Mother Nature. Easily the finest selection and perhaps what made the walk most refreshing was the cool ambience that almost instantly transported us to a world beyond the madding crowd. An inspiring walk through paradise."
,,Beautiful flowers over Xmas,5.0,,I visited the Flower Dome over Xmas and was really happy to see all the beautiful Xmas flowers. The place is temperature controlled so that the beautiful plants and flowers from the colder countries are at its best in this tropical heat. The flowers and exhibits here change very regularly so it is worth a visit everytime you come to Singapore. Highly recommended.
,,Good for Adults,3.0,,"Overall good experience but probably we visited at the wrong time. it was damm crowded and kids were very tired byt the time we reached to the top. We took nearly 1.5hr to reach top but once we reach top, the view was very good especially in the evening they switched on the shower and it was quite good to view that."
,,Absolutely gorgreous,5.0,,"Amazing experience in conjunction with the Cloud Forest, they have their own unique qualities and you can definitely spend hours in both"
,,Beautiful Arrangements,3.0,,"There are certainly a lot of beautiful floral arrangements in the Flower Dome - there are sections for plants / flowers from all over the world. Lovely to see so many different varieties of flowers and display for optimum viewing - a lot of good photo opportunities!

If you are short on time - I would recommend seeing the Cloud Forrest over the Flower Dome as there are more unique features in the Forrest."
,,Vacation,4.0,,"Went to the flower Dome, it was very pretty. Colorful flowers and decorations for Chinese New Year. It was busy but well worth taking a look."
,,Wonderful display of plants from around the world!,5.0,,This is a massive indoor space which we visited at night after the light show in the grove! We could have spent hours in this beautifully displayed garden!
,,Flowers paradise,4.0,,"Different flowers displays are held here, exhibits are changing throught the year. Been there several times and it's a pleasure each time. Think of taking a jacket with you, the AC is particularly strong there."
,,Wonderful floral displays,5.0,,The floral displays in the Flower Dome are are just stunning. When we were there they had concentration of Dhalias. The size and colours of the flowers are a joy to see. In March they are likely to concentrate on a Cherry Blossom garden. When they did that in 2018 the Japanese Ambassador was invited to open the event. Another must see as part of the Gardens By The Bay.
,,A must visit Garden,5.0,,"This garden is really unique and has a different theme every few months. We went during October and the theme was sunflower surprise. Aside from sunflowers, you can also see other beautiful flowers"
,,"""Whatta Remarkable"" Flower Garden!",5.0,,"This is one of the two Conservatory complexes which are a part of ""Gardens by the Bay"". It provides ""all weather"" entertainment for visitors as well as ""locals"". It is quite large--- covering about 2.5 acres/1 hectare. It s amazing design allows it to be the ""World's largest glasshouse"" that has no ""supporting beams"". It is also cooled so as to have a""Mediterranean climate that hosts many plant for all seasons, and requiring little water to thrive! The aroma provided by the flowers is also ""totally interesting"".
TripAdvisor has awarded it ""The Certificate of Excellence""... and, kt's definitely a worthwhile place to visit while in the ""Gardens by the Bay""!!

I hope that this Review has been helpful."
,,A Haven of Floral Collections,5.0,,"On a holiday season, the place is massively decorated. The collections were amazing and beautifully well arranged. The ambient is cool like in a sub tropical place. So many beautiful flowers to see and admire!
We really love our visit here, despite so many visitors came in.
You should bring a bottled water as the drinking water tap is not well distributed."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"The biggest and most beautifully presented collection of flowers from all around the world we have ever seen inside a greenhouse (a huge one, certainly). A must in any visit to Singapore."
,,singapore holiday,5.0,,"amazing view and flower, worldwide flowers collection can seen there, don't miss to go, its near by garden bay the way and cloud forest"
,,Beautiful park,5.0,,There are several levels representing different continents and ecosystems. Lot's of flowers and plants. It was an absolute pleasure to travel there while it is so hot outside. Don't miss it.
,,Worth the price,5.0,,"How else could you travel to see exotic plant species.? This was wonderfully laid out with real baobabs, cactus, orchids amazing and worth the entry ticket for this and the cloud forest."
,,Happy Lunar New Year,5.0,,Beautiful rich & colourful flowers blooming for u & me. Awesome decor. A must visit to all in Singapore 🇸🇬
,,beautiful man made park,5.0,,"if you are a nature person you will love it here, its beautiful at night as well with lighted man made trees.."
,,Amazing place and we got to see the Lunar New Year setup,5.0,,"This is the second dome in the Gardens by the Bay complex and is as amazing as the Cloud Dome. The smell of the flowers wafts over you as soon as you walk in. There are thousands of different plants to see, smell and experience from all over the planet. We were lucky in that there was a lantern and pergola setup to celebrate Lunar New Year, very striking and worth visiting for that alone."
,,Lots to see,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed the Flower Dome. There were a lot of displays and sculpted animals and dragons. See my pictures that I posted for my review of Gardens by the Bay.
,,Plants,5.0,,Such an huge showcase of plant life from countries around the world. The plants are beautiful but the timber sculptures are just amazing
,,THANKS FOR THE UPDATE 👍,5.0,,"This place has a nice aroma. The flowers are very pretty. Moreover, the price of a ticket ain't too shabby, either."
,,Lots of unseen Mediterranean plants,5.0,,"Lots of Mediterranean plants of cactus family, we we're amazed to see those even few flowers so so beautiful. Must visit place under gardens by the bay Singapore, I found it better than cloud forest."
,,Huge and beautiful.,5.0,,"It's hard to comprehend just how large the Flower Dome is merely by looking at photographs of its exterior. It's huge and impressive - the upkeep must be a huge undertaking, as everything is perfection. The Flower Gardens within the Dome are broken into several levels representing different continents and ecosystems. It was an absolute pleasure to wander through, and pleasantly cool compared to the heat outside. We were a little disappointed that we visited on a day when the exhibition in the hall area was being changed, and hence it wasn't open to the public, but this inevitably needs to happen fairly regularly, and there is an online timetable available if your heart is set on seeing a particular display."
,,Absolute beauty,5.0,,"The flower dome is an explosion of colour and designs.
Dahlias were the flowers of the season and they just blanketed the dome with colours of the rainbow and beyond.
Listening to other visitors saying how beautiful it all looked and why can’t I grow Daliahs like this at home we’re constantly being said.
The selfie brigade were out in force and everyone had a photo taken with the beautiful flowers.
Do yourselves a favour and put the Flower Dome on your must see list when visiting Singapore."
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,"A really wonderful garden, with about 9 different regions of the world on display. I particularly enjoyed the orchids and the sculptures.I spent over an hour here."
,,Sakura in Singapore,3.0,,"Because going to Japan is very expensive, I went to see the Sakura showcase here. When I went the flowers are starting to wilt already so I didnt enjoy much."
,,A large variety of plants from across the globe,5.0,,"A definite must-visit when in Singapore. They display a huge variety of flora that spans across the globe, all in an air-conditioned environment."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,We really enjoyed the flowers. They have a special Chinese New Year theme at moment and is very pretty. Even if your not into flowers etc it's a good couple hours walk and is actually quite cool with the climate control. Have a look.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"This, along with its sister, the Cloud Forest is a modern wonder which should be seen by all visitors to Singapore. We found it simply amazing. The breadth of plants on display from various countries is simply breathtaking. The dome is an attraction by itself as it is somewhat of an architectural marvel. The cost of a ticket to visit both dome is $28 - well worth it."
,,Just o.k,3.0,,We weren’t very impressed even though there were a few pretty gardens and statues. As The entrance ticket is for the amazing cloud forest too I recommend taking a peek.
,,Mesmerized by the view below,4.0,,"Visited last September 25, 2018.
The plants was hang on the wall with the beautiful exterior design and view behind. (Although in our country Phillipines, We have the same plants and other flowers too. :) and for me it was an ordinary plants). We amaze on how they put it together to make a picture perfect. I am sensitive to cold and it was cold inside the dome bring light cardigan or jacket."
,,Magic,5.0,,My family and I were blown away by this magical place. Clean beautiful so much to see. Good value for money. so much to see words cannot describe the beauty.
,,December was not the best blooming month.,3.0,,We have been here before in April and the whole dome was ablaze with colors. In December this dropped to the seasonal ones and potted plants brought in to supplement the colors. Christmas music was added and made ordinary seems very special.
,,Great place,5.0,,"Although the cloud forest was better...this one is beautiful in its own way. Very clean and well-maintained. If you have kids along with you, they'll enjoy it as well."
,,Not as good as the cloud forest,4.0,,"It was nice. But I felt this was not as good as the Cloud Forest so if you get the combo ticket, definitely do this one first. We were unlucky as we were there in between display themes. So this mean we had a lot of incomplete displays and half empty flower beds. You don't really know this until you get there on the day so that's a bit disappointing.

There were so amazing displays and interesting plants/trees. However, as I come from country full of green and plants - some of the ""awesomeness"" may have been lost on me.

It was freezing in the Flower Dome so those with young kids (or just sensitive to cold like me), I would really suggest bringing a light jacket for comfort.

Otherwise it was good. I just wish i came at time when there was complete displays."
,,A nice and amazing garden,4.0,,"A very nice and amazing garden. In the garden, you can find various rare flowers and plants from various countries. Inside the dome feels so cold that you don't need to worry when visiting during the day. I visited him with my family during the new year 2019. 2 hours was very short when visiting this place."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Unbelievable amount of all sorts of plants and a huge waterfall all contained within a huge glass dome.
,,Natural Heaven on Earth,5.0,,"Flower Doom is one of the major attraction for nature lovers. It is one of wonder in Singapore. Tourists enjoy this place the most in their visit. Variety of flowers, plants and cactus attract everyone. Visitors enjoy photography of nature. It is very well maintained."
,,Hmmmm,3.0,,If you're short of time maybe give it a miss. Areas of the garden are in desperate need of repair. Staff are aloof. Dwindles into insignificance compared to its big brother - the cloud forest.
,,Loved the beautiful flower dome and so did the kids!,5.0,,"Although I didn't love the cost of admission to both domes, we actually were really glad we went. The flower dome is just beautiful and the kids loved it too. I think the Cloud Forest Dome is probably the highlight out of the two, the Flower Dome is still absolutely worth a visit. The dome is cooled so its great to escape the humidity of Singapore."
,,honeymoon 2.0,5.0,,"beautiful, colorful, just as what to expect in a place with flowers from all over the world. its like having a walk through to different continents"
,,Fantastic place to see rare plants,5.0,,"This is one of the two domes at Gardens By the Bay. It contains plants from all over the world, interspersed with a whole array of different sculptures. The explanations accompanying some of the displays were excellent, and I particularly enjoyed the succulents and the plants from South America. There were even plants that imitated rocks, and plants from South America that had developed a survival strategy by looking diseased to avoid being eaten by herbivores. This dome is worth spending several hours visiting and should be a must do for anyone visiting Singapore for the first time. Children under 3 years old get in for free."
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful and interesting place. There has been put lots of effort and work do get this done. Very impressive!
,,Two domes,5.0,,"There are 2 domes, the flower dome is colourful with some very Wierd plants that are really interesting. The time we were there it was still dressed for Christmas which was great for the children. Plants from around the world are shown in their own ""garden"" the second dome, in my opinion the most spectacular, with a waterfall and sky walk took you to higher altitude plants and explained ecology and what the world needs to do,......now. Thought provoking"
,,Flowerlovers unite!,5.0,,"At the ticket office only the combined ticket for both domes is mentioned, but if you ask you can pay for visiting just one dome. I loved the christmas flower display. It is a bit cold in the dome, despite thinking otherwise."
,,Not a flower guy...but,5.0,,This is so impressive. The government has invested in something really spectacular. And with some many other great amenities in the area - it is worth your time to check this out
,,Wow!,5.0,,A great place with family to get clicked at every spot. Excellent picture opportunities. The flowers and presentation will lift your mood up. There is a free tour at 11 am and 3 pm. Take a photographer with you if you can.
,,Just a large arboretum,3.0,,"Admission to Cloud Forest also includes the Flower Dome which plays second fiddle. While more spacious, it’s not much more than a well kept arboretum although with superior design than most. It’s still a pleasant hour or so walking around viewing all the colorful plant life."
,,Enjoyable afternoon,5.0,,"Since we are only in Singapore for a year, we are trying to see as much as we can. We recently visited the Flower Dome and enjoyed it so much we hope to come back when family comes to visit. It is also a great place to go to escape the heat and humidity! The exhibits are well done and pleasing to the eye. We were there during Christmas so we got to see the place all decorated for the holiday. Luckily we were there when the crowd was manageable but it seemed to get even busier later in the day, so maybe go earlier to avoid it being too crowded. We were thinking more people came later to stick around to watch the first light show in the super tree grove. Anyway, the Flower dome has a great variety of flowers and plants as well as wood carvings and other forms of art. This is a great addition to put on your list of places to visit while in Singapore. Don't forget the cloud forest. We bought a pass that included both."
,,Thank God it’s air conditioned!,4.0,,It was a hot day in Singapore when we visited. We decided to see this during the day to escape the heat. I would advise doing this first and doing Cloud Forest next as you will be more impressed with Cloud Forest. Then you can save the Tree Forest for the evening. All three would make an amazing day!
,,Wasn't blown away by this attraction,3.0,,"If you're a plant lover than this is a must see! There is a pollen cafe inside which does great afternoon tea.

I must admit I'm not usually into this kind of thing which is why I have rated this a 3 - But as this attraction was included in our ticket price when visiting Gardens By The Bay, we made the most of it and it was nice to have a look around for an hour or so."
,,Amazing as the Cloud Forest,5.0,,Amazing as the Cloud Forest with with a different theme. Again it is amazing. Should never miss this and will go again.
,,Visit after Christmas..,3.0,,This was the second time we visited. While it was nice to see holiday colors it was all sponsored by Disney. It took away from natural beauty of being in the flower dome...
,,A day at flower dome.,5.0,,Man- made dome but all are looking very spectacular there.Flowers and plants are very nice to see and christmas decorations also very nice when I got there.
,,Amazing display,5.0,,If you like flowers and plants this is a must visit as it is quite spectacular. The Dome is air conditioned and very pleasant to wander around in. There are interactive displays and educational areas for those interested.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"We really liked this place. We bought the tickets to visit the flower dome and the rainforest during the same day and it was ok. I think it's one of the places you need to see. I thought it was bigger, but the size was alright."
,,Great Christmas Display,4.0,,"Really well thought out area and as it was Christmas, the displays on the ground floor were great, particularly if you have children."
,,Dissatisfied,2.0,,"Disappointed by how the done was ruined with Xmas trees, Xmas decorations and Disney toys all over the place. This is a place to look at flowers, not plastics toys."
,,Flower-tastic,5.0,,"It's a giant greenhouse with spectacular flowers, it's busy but doesn't detract from the experience."
,,Xmas season,4.0,,"A huge glasshouse for flora from all over the world. Seasonal activities and now it’s xmas for disney to sponsor the centrepiece. Apart from the garish commercialisation, the norway and colorado spruce/fir trees are nice for the season"
,,Fascinating Display of Plants (For Garden Lovers),5.0,,"If you are a plants and gardens lover, this is heaven and well worth its money. If you are not into such things, perhaps best not spend your $28. A fascinating display of the world's flora."
,,It was great,5.0,,"It was so cool to get the feeling you are in another world. It was very smart , genius and refreshing Great way to spend your mornings."
,,Ok for a visit,3.0,,"Ok for a quick visit, although I felt it was a little over priced and thought the cloud forest was better. Was a good way to escape the heat from outside as it is air conditioned inside :) It is just full of plants from all around the world. Interesting if you are into that sort of thing."
,,So so pretty,5.0,,"Visited here during the day and was amazed by the beauty! So impressed. The flowers were nice, and the succulents very cool. I highly recommend a visit. They had all the Christmas decorations set up too."
,,Flower variety,3.0,,"They have managed to keep a wide variety of species from all over the world in one location, giving a very pretty place for you to wander about. Inside is the Pollen cafe, and during December they will have Christmas-themed decorations. One ticket usually covers both the cloud forest and flower dome."
,,Awesome space,3.0,,Preferred the cloud dome but this was pretty cool too. Nice temperature inside. Learnt a bit about plants from all over.
,,Average visit,3.0,,We visited the flower dome in november and it was not very colourfull. Not very interesting. The cloud forest is worth a visit.
,,Giantic air conditioned flowers dome,5.0,,Flower Dome showcases exotic plants from five continents which are displayed in nine different Gardens.
,,Detailing!,5.0,,Impressed with the detailing done to exhibit trees and flowers of various parts of the world. Can't afford to miss if you are a flower lover.
,,Magical place to be,5.0,,"A night full of great surprises ranging from flowers of all kind...Alice in wonder land,and christmas decoration merged with the floral theme of the place.never in my life have i seen so many flowers of all kind with different colours."
,,Christmas display a bit tacky,3.0,,I really enjoyed the displays here five years ago but at present (December 2018) there's an enormous Christmas display that is just a bit tacky to my taste and takes up a lot of space - little kids seemed to love it but we adults were disappointed. Do the Cloud Dome instead at the moment!
,,Nice place,5.0,,It so big area and nice place.a lot of beautiful flowers to see u can find different type of flowers inside also.got in and out door .
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,Adjacent to other botanical areas. Definitely included in your Singapore visit. Ticket price will gain access to several activities. Give at least 3 hours for your visit.
,,Disappointment. No flowers 😲,1.0,,The flower dome was certainly a disappointment we were expecting to see flowers and flowers and flowers but they made it into at Christmas attraction with a lot of Christmas decorations. Not worth the money at all. The cloud forest was fantastic and I would choose to only do that one if I would have known.
,,Christmas spirits in the dome,5.0,,"This is a second time visited this dome, it always arranged the difference landscape to suit the season. The flowers displayed were not easyly to see outside the dome in Singapore, although is a tourist attraction, but also for flowers admirers, you will spend at least few hours to admire the flowers."
,,Air conditioned walk within the dome,4.0,,"One of two cooled and dry conservatories, the Flower Dome replicates the climate within the Mediterranean. ... With beautiful Baobab and olives trees, and our particular favourite the Monkey Puzzle Trees. Interspersed are sculptures and art work e.g. stone sculptures from Zimbabwe, a bronze piece by a French artist, and animals made out of driftwood.

This is a lovely place to spend a couple of hours. We did wear sweaters as it did feel a bit cold after a while!

(December 2018.. We thought the festive display of plastic Disney figures rather out of place.... although loads of tourists were in awe)."
,,Gorgeous!!,5.0,,"A real pleasure for the eyes. So beautiful flowers, orchids, trees, plants. And what a good ideas to represent several countries (South Africa, Mediteraneen, .....) Christmas decoration was also there. I really enjoy"
,,If you like Flowers then..,4.0,,"I wouldn't call myself a green-thumb by any stretch, though I felt compelled to visit the Flower Dome being so highly regarded. The architecture, design, thought and effort gone into a building of such magnitutude and variety was what I took away with me. Walking around was beautiful, but if time was tight, I'd go to the Cloud Forest."
,,Such a beautiful indoor garden experience with amazingly beautiful plants.,5.0,,"A photographer's dream even with a modest cell phone camera. Easy walk through, a great way to spend a couple of hours even if you ate not a flower buff. Pose and click if that is all you want to do but reading about some of the unique plants in the garden on the plaques made it way more exciting. 1000 year old olive trees and pretty succulents and plain old very pretty flowers. Stunning art pieces interspersed. Singaporean highlight for sure."
,,Yes for sure to visit,5.0,,"Do visit as I was not so found of flowers or related stuff but after watching it , it was worth visit"
,,They Had Christmass Trees!,5.0,,The place was very festive when we visited. But the plants didn’t were in better shape when we last visited October / November 2017. I loved the many Christmas trees and Pointsentias. Enjoyed the Lavander Plants. This place is still my happy place in Singapore.
,,Disappointd,3.0,,We paid 28 dollars to visit this and the cloud forest. I had expected a hige display of colour and was very disappointed. It all seemed sparse with mostly greenery. There was a large area dedicated to christmas with plastic looking toys. I would not have paid to go in if i had known.
,,Very beautiful place,5.0,,Absolutely gorgeous location for pictures and calming walks. The place was decorated for Christmas with a Disney Tsum Tsum theme and it was wonderful. There was even a hall in the attraction for functions and dinners. Definitely bring a camera/phone for the scenery.
,,Flower dome,5.0,,This place is truly amazing. The plants and flowers are incredible Thee design and architecture of the building is something everyone needs to see. When I return I will do the night tour.
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,I got lost while in here hahaha but this place is really beautiful and also can’t believe this place is exist
,,Refreshing place to be!,5.0,,"The flower dome will be everything you'll need when you're looking for a relaxing place to be. It was bigger than I thought it was. The plants, trees, and flowers are well-arranged."
,,"not bad, a little to staged",3.0,,"not the best of the two domes, I found this dome a little too staged for me. The planting was pretty average too."
,,Intersting and cool,3.0,,"I have mixed feeling about it. It was vey Christmasy and for kids. I loved some part of it and some I did not. Go with children but if you are short of time, go somewhere else."

,,Fantastic collection,5.0,,"Well worth a visit ($28 Singapore for flower dome/cloud forest- foreigner ).This dome houses a fantastic collection of plants from around the globe with some added scupltures to really set them off,spend as long as you like wandering around the dome filling your memory card up with pictures of natures amazing creations."
,,Light and beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"So enjoyed walking around in the flower dowe, take your time and walk around, take a moment to sit in the gardens and enjoy the moment! The holiday decorations were very fun to take some selfies!"
,,Night show,4.0,,"70s theme night show, pleased we went, nice casual atmosphere. Mr17 not so excited and said it was a let down after seeing the light show on the Promenade."
,,Flower wonderland,5.0,,"This is really hot under the dome. Orchards are Singapore nation flower and there are lots of them. However every other flower in Asia can be seen too. Lots of photo opportunities and places to rest and eat . Worth going round and the continual perfume wafting from the flowers make you light headed.
We did this the last day and we both slept deeply on the plane. Maybe a good final site to see before flying?"
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Another good attraction in Singapore, albeit a bit repetitive with the same plants and flowers. This is still worth and a welcome break from the humidity. If you are a keen gardener then this is right up your street."
,,A must,5.0,,"A must when visitng gardens by the bay. Great for nature lovers, couples, families with kids. Great for taking photos."
,,Not for nature lovers,1.0,,"If you’re in Singapore—a country with the most beautiful botanical gardens and where lush beauty is everywhere—why spend time and money on a tacky, amusement style theme park “garden”? The antithesis of natural gardens: fake snow, a cheap gift shop at every turn, and even a McDonalds. But if you do go, wear a parka—it’s very cold."
,,Better to visit Kew Gardens,3.0,,"Rather limited range of areas and flowers and trees. A South African, South American , succulents, and Mediterranean section. Large parts closed off for corporate events."
,,AWESOME!,5.0,,"It was AWESOME because all the flowers were beautiful and amazing - and they are all REAL! The sights are amazing and also, the air-con is so nice since Singapore is so hot and humid. 😂😃"
,,wow what a place!,5.0,,I have to admit that usually to see few flowers never got me excited but this place is totally different. it is amazing with huge selection of trees and plants never to be seen on a daily basis. it is also have statues and art inside the gardens so it also kind of artistic as well.
,,Beautiful place and well maintained.,5.0,,Beautiful place and well maintained.Natural beauty under a closed environment. Exceptional good. Must visit place in Singapore
,,beautiful place,4.0,,Loved my visit to the flower dome so much! It's really nice to walk through the air conditioned conservatory especially when outside is so hot and humid. The flowers and all plants are well maintained and so beautiful. Must visit if you're in Singapore!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A very beautiful place to visit in the Gardens by the bay. We went in Nov, so we saw the Christmas decorations. A must visit if you are going to Gardens By the Bay."
,,Really enjoyed the dome for a first visit,5.0,,"I recently had an enjoyable visit to the Flower Dome, one of the showpiece pavilions of Gardens by the Bay. The mainly glass and steel dome allows plenty of natural light in, but airconditioning made it a very pleasant environment to wander around. Looking at the cleverly-arranged gardens, it was quite easy to identify the regions that the different shrubs, trees, bushes, creepers, and flowers belonged to, like the Sonoran desert, North African bush, Australian outback, or Mediterranean. My favourite section was the succulents, but what I found most intriguing were the tiny plants that mimic small rocks in order to survive."
,,Another must,5.0,,"We spent two days at the gardens by the bay . This was lovely and on a hot or wet day just the place to be. Wander round all the paths and enjoy the beautiful gardens, even stop for a coffee and a rest."
,,Not just for flower-lovers,5.0,,"Get out of that shopping mall and spend some time walking around the Flower Dome instead. I find it therapeutic every time I come here even though I'm not that interested in the flowers. Flowers still beautiful though. Besides, the temperature is perfect for you to take a long stroll to admire nature without sweating and burning under the sun."
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,"Flower Dome is one of the two cooled indoor conservatoires of Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. Paying SGD 28 for both, which includes the re-entry stamp, is well worth it.

Flower Dome is a collection of a very large collection of flowers from different parts of the world - cacti, roses, hibiscus, marigolds, sunflowers, and what not? One may get mesmerised by the beauty of all the varied types of flowers. It has various sections, too - Mediterranean Garden, South American Garden (was under maintenance during our visit) and some others too.

Definitely worth the time you spend here and surely recommended for visit."
,,Lovely place to visit,5.0,,We went and had a look at this and the cloud gardens it was lovely and they had all the Christmas decorations up . Some very interesting plants and a lovely waterfall
,,Orchid garden is better,3.0,,"The Flower Dome is one of four parts of the Gardens by the bay complex. It was my least favorite - not bad, but not exceptional. If I had to choose between this dome and the National Orchid Garden at the Singapore Botanical Gardens, the Orchids win out. But when combined with the other three parts of the Gardens by the bay, namely the Cloud Forest dome and the Supertree light and sound show, I would be happy with the Gardens by the Bay. If you have limited time at the Gardens by the Bay, go to the Cloud Forest dome first. The 15 minute long light and sound show at 7:45 and 8:45 (check website for times) would be my second pick, followed by the Flower dome. Hope this review and opinion helps!"
,,Meh. Don't waste your money on this,1.0,,"Yes it might be pretty if it was a backyard. But it should be better than that. The flower dome is very boring. It has a bunch of sections, and each one has some plants from all over the world. Meh. Go to cloud forest instead"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Been here recently. It's amazing experience. since it's Christmas time they have decorated according. Even person who doesn't like flowers will enjoy this place
,,Flower R us,4.0,,"Impressive display of what must amount to millions of flowers.
Whilst we were there they had a ""Wizard of Oz' theme with Dorothy and friends - not sure if this is indicative of what it's like regularly but it was extremely busy to the point it detracted from the sights at times.
If you go early you might avoid the worst of the crowds as it's well worth a visit - once you've done the Cloud Forest, set aside some additional time for the Flower Dome."
,,The Flower Dome in the Gardens by the Bay is Fantastical,5.0,,"Well worth a visit and your time. The Flower Dome in the Gardens by the Bay can use up one hour or three hours of your time. The ancient olive trees and the unique boabab trees caught my interest. Christmas decorations added another dimension to the whimsical character of the Dome, with fascinating sculptures made from wood and vines throughout the Dome that are just as worth seeing as the flowers, shrubs, plants and trees. Don't miss it."
,,Christmas decor,4.0,,"We went on a weekday. Not too crowded. Plenty of cactus plants. Christmas decorations is up. The place is beautiful. For the elderly, wheel chair is available for rental at a very reasonable price."
,,Lots of flowers,5.0,,I visited this lovely place with my boyfriend one week ago and it was decorated with Disney cartoons.
,,Not the best place to visit,3.0,,I think everyone should try the skywalk in the garden by the way but the flower doom was not very exciting. The cactuses are nice but the flowers are not so exciting. Maybe this is because I’m living in New Zealand and I can see beautiful flowers and plants everyday there.
,,Poinsettia Wishes is On!,5.0,,"Was there for Poinsettia Wishes. This year is presenting Disney Tsum Tsum, so tsum tsum lovers, be sure to visit by 6 Jan 2019! Not much crowd if you visit in the late morning, but definitely the lightings in the evening is more instagrammable. Flowers and plants are well maintained by the employees of GBTB."
,,Spectacular use of plant life.,5.0,,"November they put up the Christmas theme plants. Wonderland for children. Each garden has a country theme, Australia, South Africa and South America.
Some of the plants you recognize, others are completely new to you. They incorporate sculptures to portray the area. Springbok leaping through the South
African landscape.
There are benches dotted around for you to sit and just take in the beauty. So worth a visit."
,,Another piece of an amazing puzzle,5.0,,"This is the sister building to the Rain Forest. Again, done is what is amazing development in the Marina Bay Area. Just go and enjoy with the many others. It’s a must see when in Singapore."
,,Good but it wasn’t as flower filled as I expected,3.0,,Going by the name I was expecting a riot of colour instead it had been disneyfied for Xmas and seemed to be more about that. Next time I’d just go for the cloud forest
,,Flowers from smallest to largest ones are here,5.0,,All types of flowers from miniature to large ones are here. Aesthetically placed so you can zoom in to see the small ones easily through magnifying glasses.
,,D&D,3.0,,The dome is huge and good. The space is Aircon. You will appreciate if you like green. Lot of plant from different countries.
,,Acceptable but crowded,4.0,,"Nice place to chill (great aircon) and watch some plants, trees, cactus. Bit too crowded to my appetite though."
,,Simply amazing greenhouse under one roof,5.0,,Our visit to the Flower Dome was the most enjoyable experience in Singapore. Wonderful world horticulture displayed under one roof. One must visit this place when in Singapore.
,,Short visit,4.0,,"It was a very nice view especially at night. My father had a tantrum that is why we had to cut our visit short, but based on the minimal view of some parts it was very beautiful. I would love to visit again."
,,Beautiful place to wcplore,5.0,,This is a fantastic horticultural hangout. The displays change through the year and are always maintained to an impressive standard.
,,Attractions,5.0,,Great variety of plants. The bonsai trees of large formations were something. The architecture of the building was interesting.
,,Like a work of art...,5.0,,"If you love nature and beautiful things, this is a must see! There are incredible gardens based on countries all over the world, very well looked after. Lots of opportunities for some great photos!"
,,Nice display,3.0,,Sg$28 for a combo ticket with cloud first dome. Nice and cool inside. Nice area to walk around and explore. Signs with plant names and descriptions but nothing about the ages of the plants or how they got there. Would of been interesting to know especially the olive trees.
,,So beautiful.,5.0,,"While we were there the Dome was full of sunflowers, with a Wizard of Oz theme. Also there were beautiful azaleas, hydrangeas, roses, and many more."
,,FLOWER DOME,5.0,,It has different types of flowers and a lovely vibe in the dome. Well ventilated and air conditioned which makes it nice to admire the flowers there as well.
,,Beautiful Flowers!,4.0,,Great selection of plants and flowers from around the planet. I would plan on almost two hours in this dome.
,,Skip this and just see the Cloud forest,3.0,,Unfortunately we happened to visit whilst the current display was being changed over and some of flowers were starting to die. Overall it was ok & a nice way to escape the heat but I found it underwhelming compared to the National Orchid Garden in the Botanic Gardens. It was nice to see the succulents and different varieties of plants/flowers but personally I would skip this and just visit the Cloud forest! The Cloud forest was amazing & also has a whole section of different orchids on display!
,,Good,4.0,,"An enjoyable experience.
We went when the focus was Poinsettias and Disney Christmas - loads of children (and adults) having a lot of fun.
The theme during our visit was plants of the Mediterranean climes. This meant that we knew virtually all the plants and there was nothing exceptional.
Well worth the visit"
,,Such a Natural Beauty,5.0,,Just amazing place to be at... Full of different types of flowers and frangrance... Need to walk to visit the whole place but have sitting areas everywhere in between. So cool and relaxing place to be at...Even small kids love to watch such beautiful flowers.
,,Peacefull place,5.0,,"Nice chilled place filled with all kinds of flowers and trees from different parts of the world. Perfect to walk around with children and spend some time out of the heat.

We took the combination with the Cloudforest Dome. We would recommend to do the Flower Dome first. The second one is more impressive."
,,"Not a gardner or flower lover, still go",5.0,,"They have made gardening cool and spectacular displays. If you are staying at Marina Bay Sands just ask staff to get you to the right elevator otherwise it will take a while to work out where to go. Also if its raining staying guest can get to use a free umbrella, just go to checkout and ask for one. Its actually cooler in the garden than outside so its a good place to go if you want to cool off from the Singapore heat. You don't need to use the car that drives you around unless you have trouble walking, save yourself a few dollars. You can spend an hour or a few hours here depending on the time you have. We were only in Singapore for 20 hours overnight arrived at 1 pm. Went to the Botanical gardens, Gardens by the Bay, both domes, China town and saw the water display and light show. If you haven't been to the flower dome it is quite amazing just to see the displays, they had the sunflower main display which was great. See photos."
,,Right in mid of nature,5.0,,"Refreshing, soothing, beautiful collection of flowers. The places has benches all over so you can sit and enjoy the flowers all around. It is covered so nice way to escape Singapore heat and still be close to nature. It is wheelchair and stroller friendly."
,,Flowers everywhere,5.0,,"I love this place! Every time I have friends or families visiting I will bring them here. You would be surprised to see the types of flowers they grow here, considering Singapore is a tropical country. The place will offer different themes from time to time. Last time I was there was about tulips. If you go to Garden By the Way, you do not want to miss this place."
,,It's just OK. Some got damaged by tourists,3.0,,"It is just OK to me, since I saw many green houses like that already. Anyway, it just need more maintenance and protection from the tourists, just overflown with guests."
,,Took awhile to reach,5.0,,"Thanks to gbtb very few, camouflaging signages. I was starting to resent deciding to go here. But when we got to the dome, everything is AMAZING. it is well kept and very beautiful and the best feature of gbtb if i may add. You can easily spend relaxing hours on there if not for the crowd. We went on a sunday and place is packed. Better go on a weekday i guess. Still giving it a five star though cuz it is just so lush and beautiful."
,,Skip this one if your own city has a nice botanical garden.,3.0,,"For someone who had the privilege to live in cities with lovely botanical gardens - indoors or outdoors, it's hard to appreciate why the plants in the Flower Dome are in an airconditioned space in a tropical city. Yes, the blooms are lovely. Yes, perhaps, this is a real attraction for a certain group of tourists. Most of the flora are from temperate areas except for the desert plants and cacti, I guess. Most people I see visiting this place are from temperate countries. I don't necessarily think they will be gushing over the blooms in this place.

The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are pretty symbolic in reminding people that Singapore is a bubble. Great for a visit, has all the first world comforts, but probably ambivalent to reality in other parts of Southeast Asia. So, if you are traveling in the region, please don't just stop in Singapore - which is a real amazing international hub. Step outside and see what Southeast Asia really is by picking another city on the map."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, this is a must. They have theme seasonally and they change every few months like cherry blossom in Spring, chrysanthemum during autumn. Flower Dome and Super Dome are a must visit place."
,,Beautiful displays of gardens from around the world,5.0,,Layout is easy to navigate. Displays authentic and beautifully arranged. Christmas display in the middle was great for the kids but detracted from the gardens themselves. Still a must see.
,,Average botanical garden,3.0,,"The dome is spectacular, but the presentation of the plants is not. Does not worth the ticket price. An interesting variey of plants and flowers, but not spectacular"
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"it is worth seing!!!time to stop and enjoy nature without thinking of work behind, I will surely recommend for holiday goers to come and enjoy!"
,,Absolutely stunning flowers.,5.0,,Planted areas from around the world. The inside of this huge greenhouse is surprisingly cool and calming. The flowers stunning and constantly changing throughout season's as they die down. There is a Christmas decorated area there now with masses of poinsettias.
,,Recommend,4.0,,Beautiful flowers and a nice spot to escape the heat. Between the two domes though the cloud forrest is more unique and impressive so if you just want to pay for one do the cloud forrest. This dome is laid out by region and has some exotic plants and trees you might not have seen elsewhere.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Wow! This place took my breath away- beautiful collection of plants from Africa, Americas, Australia... you have to see it for yourself."
,,Perfect Place for nice photo shoot!!,5.0,,Simply perfect if you are looking for nice place for photo shoot. The flowers are really nice. Accessibility is also not an issue as there is MRT to Garden By the Bay
,,South African flower,5.0,,This one of the attractions to see in Singapore its worth some time. There is so many different flowers and all indifferent styles.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"This is amazing, unbelievably beautiful and best of all it’s airconditoned . Don’t leave Singapore without seeing this"
,,Nothing special,1.0,,"Unlike the magnificent cloud forest, the flower dome is nothing special. I could not get the sense of a Disney's Christmas tree in the middle of the pavilion."
,,Great place to view different continents plant life.,5.0,,"Well worth a look, the dome is set into different continents with their specialised plant life on show in each. Easy to spend a couple of hours wandering through."
,,Optional,3.0,,There is an entry ticket for flower dome. You might get it cheaper if you take from local vendor at China Town. The flower dome has a theme flower according to the season. October was sunflower. It was pretty. They have made up a castle in the centre and stuff like that. But if you are in a time crunch. It's skippable. It's not as if you have never seen anything like this before.
,,"Flowers, flowers and more....",5.0,,"Make sure you visit this place both at night and during the day... (get the stamp when leaving so you can return same day) words really can't describe this place, it's a wonderland of plants and make believe statues that will keep the kids amused... start of November they set the place up for Christmas which takes on a whole new meaning to the Flower Dome. I just loved the place."
,,Flower dome,5.0,,"Excellent trip. Amazing flowers , essence all over the dome. Staff extremely friendly , knowledgeable."
,,Incredible.,5.0,,You simply have to visit while in Singapore. This place is phenomenal and the decorations change with seasons.
,,Well done,4.0,,"Thought this exhibit wasn't the best of the two, but very nice, showing sections committed to regions of the world. On our visit not too many flowers, but still enjoyable."
,,Flowers,5.0,,The flowers change with seasonality but there's a lot of fix displays within the attraction. A combine ticket booked on line to skip waiting to purchase tickets. At this moment with Christmas coming up there is a lot of Xmas trees and flowers on display.
,,Good displays,4.0,,"Good displays of both arid and Mediterranean plants in a great setting, slightly marred, for us, by the extensive area dedicated to a Disney Xmas themed display, which detracted from the permanent planting."
,,Must see,5.0,,Visited the Flower Dome on recommendations and it was so good. So many plants and an easy walk. You can take your time and enjoy the setting. Loved it.
,,Sunflower show,4.0,,"We visited the Flower Dome during the sunflower show and it was excellent decorated, especially for kids. The structure is well organised on different plants from different regions."
,,Fantastic.,5.0,,"We were not aware that the garden domes close fairly early so we had to rush which was a bit of a shame. We should have arrived before sunset so that we could have experienced the daylight affect as well as night. Too many highlights to mention, if you are in Singapore this is a must visit."
,,Absolutely wonderful,5.0,,What an amazing attraction. It is hard to describe the beauty of the flower dome and its contents. The attention to detail is incredible. It is certainly a must see in Singapore.
,,Prefect place for viewing flowers,4.0,,This is a lovely place with cold air and you will enjoy this place if you crazy about flowers and trees. You can brings kid here to show them different types of flowers and trees and it is huge place for them to run around.
,,Spectacular with plants from all over the world,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is amazing. Not only the plants but there are very clever carvings of eagles, deer, horses and birds hanging or in amongst the gardens. The Flower Dome is a must see."
,,DEFINE BOREDOM,1.0,,Flower Dome means BOREDOMe! trust me.. this is the most boring part of our trip. I suggest that you should pay for the Cloud Forest/Dome instead of going here. We enjoyed the cloud forest simply because it is airconditioned. Realtalk. Thats it.
,,Oasis in Tourist City Region,5.0,,"The flower dome is a tourist attraction, however if you like flowers then it is good to see. It also provides a cool relief on a very hot day :)"
,,👍👍👍👍👍,5.0,,"As a fan of sunflowers, this place is fantastic! Bright yellow sunflowers ""welcomed"" us upon entering the location. Many variations of sunflowers are also made available. The Wizard of Oz theme was pretty cool as well."
,,Treat to the eyes,5.0,,One of the most beautiful gardens with flowers from all across the globe. The colourful flowers were a treat to the eyes.
,,Huge Greenhouse full of flowers,4.0,,"This is a vast greenhouse with areas dedicated to different regions or types of plant e.g. a Mediterranean area, an Australian area, a succulents area etc. On the occasion we visited there was a dedication to the sunflower and this incorporated the Wizard of Oz. (the sunflower being the state flower where Dorothy lived)

As well as the flowers there were sculptures which appeared to be made of driftwood.
An interesting visit."
,,Garden of Eden,5.0,,"A gardeners paradise, with lots of exotic plants and fantastic sculptures spread throughout the gardens. There are plenty of things to keep your interest."
,,The World's Largest Greenhouse?,5.0,,"This is another man-made attraction featuring flowers and numerous other species of flora from the Mediterranean and semi-arid regions of the continents. The layout is attractive and well-presented, displays are complimented by some quirky artworks and sculptures. Fabulous blooms. Our particular area of interest was the succulent garden, a wonderful range of plants that you seldom get to see and enjoy.
The Dome showcases areas of Baobabs and Bottle Trees, Succulents, the
Australian, South African, South American, Californian and Mediterranean Gardens. S$28 per adult to visit both greenhouses."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,"Everyone should visit this place to understand, what can be created from scratch to the beautiful garden in the world."
,,just WOW,4.0,,"amazing collection of flowers, plants and cactus. instagrammable worthy and you will never get tired of strolling around because of the huge garden ambiance. we bought the pass which has both flower dome and cloud forest. the pass is worth it!"
,,"Crowded, beautiful, artificial",4.0,,"We brought a guest here yesterday, and yes, as other reviewers have said, it’s beautiful, full of flowers, amazing cacti and sculptures, and theming... it’s also nice and cold and a good break from Singapore heat... but it’s also always very very full. We did come at dusk, and there was an event in the ‘ballroom’ so that didn’t help things... but we have always found it full... To the point that your pace is at times dictated by the people pressed against you, not all of whom are aware of flow or stopping suddenly to play on their phone. Cloud forest was also at capacity and had a wait time, so we didn’t manage to get in this time. The interesting out guest made, which is an extension of all of Singapore really, is the fact that the whole thing has an artificial and manifactured quality to it... you’re looking at real flowers and nature... but definitely not in a natural environment... I just thought it was a comment worth noting."
,,Beautiful sunflowers,4.0,,Beautiful sunflowers take you to a dreamy land. But my favorite were the huge cacti and the bonsai .. the pollen restaurant isn't that great which caused me to not give 5 stars
,,Flowers...,4.0,,"Adjacent to the Cloud Forest this is, as the name suggests, crammed full of flowers of all kind - also much more attractive to the selfie brigade so you have to let that not put you off."
,,Indoor botanical garden,4.0,,"Flower Dome is a big indoor botanical garden. If you like flowers, it is a right place to go. Just to go through, you need only half an hour, but you can also stay for a half day if you like. There is a combination ticket for Flower Dome and Cloud Forest."
,,Beautiful Garden in the city,5.0,,"Love this place so much. Too many various types of plants and flowers, great scenery and cool surroundings (Building with air conditioner)."
,,Beautiful Nature,5.0,,This is a gorgeous display of global flora & fauna. The variety & colour is nature at it's best. Highly recommend a visit.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"I loved the flower dome, it was extravagant and amazing. Such detail everywhere. All the plants were amazing and the atmosphere was wonderful."
,,Good...cloud forest is better,4.0,,"Glad we went to this one, but if you're picking one or the other do the cloud forest. Still cool, the smell of the place as you walk in is amazing with all the flowers. Really enjoyed the microclimates they create in the garden."
,,Beautiful exhibition of nature,5.0,,"Flowers, trees and plants from all over the world. Temperature controlled and comfortable which makes it bearable in a not so bearable Singapore heat. Beautifully set up and designed. We spent a couple of hours with a child in here, that is how nice and family friendly it is. Highly recommend it for people of all ages."
,,Flower Tour de Force,5.0,,Simply fantastic displays of flowers from around the world playfully presented with animal characters like Poo Bear and piglet and a Wizard of Oz thing. Simply loved it.
,,Fun for everyone,4.0,,"I highly recommend this place. It's just a good size not too big as to get boring. It's well set out with plenty of places to get nice selfies, nice pieces of art too dotted around. The cactus section I found very interesting and particularly well done."
,,To do list,5.0,,Make sure the domes are at the top of your to do list in Singapore. By far the most amazing spot I the city. Give yourself a good couple of hours to look through the domes.
,,2018 Oct - Flower Dome - Sunflower Kingdom.,5.0,,"Our visit this time was to admire many types of sunflowers especially my mother, who is a flower lover. This wheelchair friendly site also have a stairlift for the Wchair user to see the Californian Garden which is on a higher level with steps. On the whole, I'm glad to see my mother was so happy with the magical sight of the sunflower kingdom."
,,Lovely displays with touches of whimsy,5.0,,The flower dome is impressive (though I preferred the forest cloud dome). I enjoyed the displays according to regions and the quality of the flora. It is worth a visit and children would enjoy aspects of it too.
,,Visit it before the cloud forest,5.0,,"Both domes are beautiful and certainly worth a visit, however an order in which to see them may not be obvious. I would advise coming to the Flower Dome before the Cloud Forest, so as to avoid the impressions from the more spectacular one overshadowing the experience of another."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Unfortunately visited cloud forest first so this was quite disappointing, the wizard of oz theme was quite amusing, and there were some purple sunflowers otherwise not fantastic"
,,Pretty,4.0,,"This dome is very pretty but the Cloud Dome is better,well maintained and well worth doing, and a nice way to escape the rain"
,,Flowers everywhere,5.0,,"A pleasant escape from city life. We really enjoyed our visit to the Flower Dome. There is a lot to see, up and close. There are many ""themed"" exhibits. A good location to introduce children to flowers and plants. Incorporate visit with Cloud Forest."
,,A Place to Spend a lot of time,5.0,,The flower dome is an amazing structure without and columns interrupting the view. There are flowers from all over the world set in the appropriate climate. There is also a lot of artwork in the form of sculptures that are sometimes whimsical and at other...More
,,Didn't float my boat,3.0,,"Yeah there were a whole heap of sunflowers, but other than that I saw more flowers on the walk to Satay by the Bay and in my dad's garden at home. Not the showstopper I expected it to be."
,,Nice visit,4.0,,"I really like that this is a family friendly place, most especially that we were able to bring in our baby’s stroller."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"It was a stunning well kept area. Every plant, tree or flower was planted with care and with how it looked in mind! Me personally, I preferred the cloud forest but this is still a great place to visit."
,,The Heaven of Flowers,5.0,,Just prepare your camera since there are so many photogenic flowers in there. The air con is really good since the temperature in Singapore is quite hot.
,,Serious Hayfever issues.,3.0,,"I really should have considered by Hayfever allergy before buying a ticket and entering the flower dome. On entry my eyes were beginning to sting, must be alot of pollen knocking about it there. Wasn't easy to get out the place either once you were...More"
,,Must visit once unless you are into flowers and macro photography,4.0,,This Flower Dome is but one of the many attractions at the Gardens by the Bay. There is a modest entrance fee to enter and you will be able to see various flowers from all over all growing and thriving under this dome. If you...More
,,For the nature/flower lovers :),4.0,,"A beautiful display of flowers and best thing is you don't have to rush to appreciate it all in the heat, the dome is air-conditioned!"
,,Changing themes.,4.0,,"The theme during our September visit was sunflowers and the Wizard of Oz. Hence, I guess that’s less interesting being familiar with this.
Nevertheless, the displays from various regions were informative and beautiful, though somewhat repetitive in some zones. The plants all look so healthy.
We went after 10am and whilst there was a queue at the ticket sales, generally it was easy to move around."
,,Just loved it!,5.0,,Well worth the few $ entry. Nice cooked conservatory with gardens from all areas of the world. Lots of areas based on the Wizard of Oz which we loved.
,,Really pretty,4.0,,A very pretty walk around. Not quite as good as the Cloud Dome but still a really positive experience.
,,Okay,3.0,,Im not into gardens so didn't hold my attention Ive seen better displays and exhibits. If you don't get there no biggie. So many tourists hard to take photos as always a stranger in your photos. However close ups on flowers are good.
,,walk to artificial garden,5.0,,this is a really nice indoor garden with thousands of plants and a waterfall.also this garden contains of sky walk which gives you amazing photo backgrounds.
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"Made our very first visit to the Flower Dome, coinciding with Mid Autumn Festival
Enjoyed the floral varieties on display. As I visited the dome in the evening, was informed at the ticketing counter that the ""views"" would be better in the day. Do take note of this, if one would like to visit this attraction. Not a bad view in the evening though..."
,,Multiple visit.,5.0,,Great experience to spend much time here. Lots of beatiful flowers from over the world. Access by walk from Marina Bay Sands hotel.
,,Enjoyed the Supertree Grove more,3.0,,"Flower Dome is kind of pricey to visit, so unless you're really into flowers and gardening, I recommend to just see the admission free Supertree Grove (outside) instead.

Reach Gardens by the Bay by alighting at the Bayfront MRT station and following the signs that bring you outside the hotel, to an elevator and then to a footbridge."
,,Very pretty!,5.0,,Bought tickets to this and the Cloud Forest. Both were interesting with plenty to see and stroll at your leisure.
,,Flowers from all over the world,4.0,,"It costs about $20 USD for entrance to both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Even though I preferred the Cloud Forest, do spend some time wandering the unique flower dome, consisting of the Flower Field, Australian Garden, South American Garden, South African Garden, Californian Garden, Mediterranean Garden, Succulent Garden, the Olive Grove, and the Baobabs. It’s fascinating how flowers from all of the world have found life within this one dome. The dome itself is as big as 75 Olympic-sized swimming pools."
,,Great day,5.0,,This also a must go u will realy nice flowers and kaktus see i have a lot fun with my wife we make realy nice day there.
,,A must,4.0,,The flower dome is a very large cooled conservatory featuring spectacular gardens from around the world. Currently there is a special exhibition featuring the wizard of oz theme. A lovely walk around in a cool environment. There is a large gift shop as you exit.
,,Flower Dome not just for flower lovers and gardeners,5.0,,"I enjoyed this flower dome very much. It has flowers growing from all regions of the world in different sections of this cleverly designed dome.

It has dry, hot, and humid climate flowers that showed the diversity of floral life on earth. Great place to visit. It appears to have themed displays also through the year. In Sept 2018 it was Sunflowers."
,,Flower Clone,5.0,,Different gardens from all over the world to check out. Get the bundle package for all 3 sites to see.
,,"nice, but cloud forest is better.",4.0,,"If you love flowers you will like this but we Highly recommend cloud forest during day, and tree walk at night (stay for light show) the light show was incredible. I was DYING from food poising and was super happy I stayed and watched the light show. It's free to lay under the trees (everyone sits/lays down so bring small blanket if you don't want to be on ground) The sky walk was a huge wait and I think it would be cool to be up there for lights but the true view was from below. If you only had time for a couple things cloud forest & night trees would be the best! Though we did enjoy the flower dome as well, paying twice we would skip this and do cloud forest instead."
,,Very Unique,4.0,,This is the companion dome to the Cloud Forest. Both are very worthwile to see. The flowers are from all over the world and uniquely displayed. It’s easy to get around the Dome and is wheelchair friendly.
,,Stunning sunflower surprise,4.0,,"Natural odyssey, nice atmosphere. However, you only need around 30 minutes to see all the scenery, but the admission fee still acceptable."
,,Great experience,5.0,,An incredible place to visit especially the succulent and cactus displays. Flowers from all over the world.
,,Exceptional,5.0,,"Part of my top 5, especially combined with the ‘Cloud Forest’ next door. An amazing collection of world plants attractively presented along an inviting walkway. The architecture is spectacular, and the temperature is cooler than the standard Singapore 30C degrees."
,,Nice place to cool off yet be in nature,4.0,,"Neat place that offers ac but also allows natural light and outdoor feel. the place was moderately busy, but with multiple stories to explore didn't feel crowded. I especially enjoyed the succulents garden. Recommended visiting time is midday when you want to escape the heat"
,,Boring and tacky,2.0,,Felt this was a waste of time except to enjoy the cool aircon. The whole thing felt tacky and artificial. Only bother if you have time to kill
,,Highlight of my visit to Singapore!,5.0,,"Having read so much about the Gardens by The Bay, I pre-booked the entrance tickets to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It was worth it! I visited in the afternoon and as both domes are air-conditioned, it provided a welcome respite from the heat. At the time of my visit, the Flower Dome was decorated in various Peranakan themes (I believe they change the themes every few months?), which I really loved. I spent several hours in the Flower Dome and the flower arrangements were really spectacular. Would recommend that you spend more time here rather than the Cloud Forest. Absolutely loved it! If you only get the time to do one thing in Singapore, this would be my absolute choice :)"
,,Definately a must in Singapore,5.0,,İt is within the Gardens by The Bay Complex and is a relief from the humidity and heat of the city the instant you enter. İncredible collection of flora. İts worth to wait the line inside to get to the upper walking area to see everything from above. We went as a couple but it can be an enjoyable attraction for families with children.
,,Orchids flower show,4.0,,"Have always enjoyed the colorful display of orchids. As it was almost end of show, some flowers are almost dried."
,,Floral beauty,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is within the Gardens By Bay complex.

Like the Cloud Forest, it is housed in a futuristic building made of glass and steel.

As you enter the flower dome, you get a feeling that it is an awesome place.

The flower dome has gardens from South Africa, South America, the Mediterranean and Japan. The variety of flowers is incredible - all very colourful and pleasing to the eye.

There were shrubs too and some were shaped. The flower dome has been designed to showcase the wonderful variety of flowers. In the South Africa Garden were some sculptures of animals.

The Japanese garden was very pretty. It had lots of cherry blossom trees. I spent a long time admiring the beauty of this garden.

There was an exhibition - Sakura Matsuri - at the time of my visit in an hall. There were many things showcasing Japanese culture and products.

i would recommend a visit to the Flower Dome.
I had problems in uploading all the photos in doing this review - and all the uploaded photos may not be shown together in this review.."
,,Good if you like this sort of thing,4.0,,"As the title says. If you're not much into flowers and gardening I'd give this a miss. I mean, it's nice and a good escape from the heat, but where I live (Hamilton, New Zealand) we have amazing gardens and it's free."
,,More than a garden,5.0,,This is the most magnificent garden I have ever visited. I only ask that all visitors read the signs and not touch the flowers.
,,Its Different,5.0,,This place is wonderful. You can spend much time here. A cool climate with plants from around the world. This is our 2nd visit and look forward to going again.
,,A little tacky,3.0,,It was good to see but honestly this dome wasn't my favourite and felt a little tacky and very fake in a way
,,a bit taki,3.0,,though the whole scene a bit taki better suited for young kids I appreciate the work that goes into it just thought it was a bit over the top the exhibition opposite is much better laid out if you have young kids worth the visit the rest of the park is amazing though very well planned you can do all the park not pay a cent but the enclosed area take the whole day its huge
,,Beautiful collection,5.0,,This was beautiful with an enormous amount of flowers. A great escape from the heat too as it is air conditioned.
,,A surprising highlight of a brief visit.,4.0,,"I had my doubts, but this is a really great botanical space. And it is so nice to get out of the sweltering heat! Just wish they could turn the music off (The Wizard Of Oz.... really? Singapore seems for much of the time aimed squarely at pre-schoolers.)"
,,Pretty,3.0,,"A nice variety of flowers; very easy to walk around; lots of hidden statues to try to find, including a Christopher Robin and several owls."
,,From all over the world,5.0,,Great for more than botanists. Mild to cool air inside with a maze of walkways past continental flower zones all signposted with info on where they grow etc. A nature lovers dream
,,Best to visit when there is some seasonal flower display,4.0,,"Been there multiple times, but it is alot more vibrant when they have seasonal specials, like the orchids or tulips display. Best to spend an entire day roaming the gardens and good deal if you purchase tickets for both the conservatories together. Try to avoid weekends for lesser crowd."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I'm not into flowers at all but this place was well presented, tidy and interesting. Some great photo opportunities and in many areas the scent of the flowers was amazing."
,,Beautiful Garden,4.0,,"Though it pales in comparison to the adjacent Cloud Forest, the flower garden has samples of trees and flowers from all around the world. Concentrating on the flora of Mediterranean climates it also has representatives of more arid desert climates. On our visit there was an exhibition of sunflowers with dozens of varieties surrounding a Wizard of Oz theme."
,,Magical,5.0,,"very beautiful. the flowers, the design, the way it is organized is perfect. one of the most beautiful things ever seen in my life. I think it's a must in Singapore."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Wonderful exhibition of plants and flowers from around the world. Well worth the entrance fee. Really enjoyed
,,Pretty place,4.0,,If you are a botanical boffin you will love this area. The presentation of the plants and trees are quite beautiful. You need to go there in daylight to enjoy its full beauty.
,,Amazing view!,4.0,,"We went there on National Day, and were so lucky to catch fireworks while we were at the Top! There are ushers who will love people along though, so we can’t really stand there for long. Perhaps 20 mins to complete the round."
,,Flowers and lot's of them!,4.0,,"If you love flowers, you can spend hours here. Very big. We appreciated the beauty of the flowers but we are not huge flower people. We enjoyed it but did not spend too long here. Most people seemed to do the same. Leisurely browse and some photographs."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"See this place during the day and night it's amazing, even the restaurant up in the garden tower was nice"
,,always spectacular,5.0,,"Ive been so many times but each time still a joy. Always proud to show to visitors, such a happy place."
,,Coffee,5.0,,After thoroughly going through the other Dome we enjoyed sitting down for a coffee together and relaxing in this amazing environment. As expected coffee was quite expensive so if on a budget you may not enjoy the relaxing vibe of it. It was nice to walk around and always cool when you see plants from your country :)
,,Beautiful 😍😍😍,5.0,,When you say flowers.. come visit this place. How God created the beauty of each plants and flowers stand me in awe😍 Truly Beautiful 😍
,,Such a lovely orchid extravaganza,5.0,,"My hubby and I enjoyed the visit to Flower Dome during our layover flight in Singapore enroute to our honeymoon. The orchids were so beautiful, captivating and so picture perfect. We had a fun time!"
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,"The colour and the sheer vibrancy of this wonderful dome is unlike anything I've ever seen. The theme on this occasion was based on the wizard of oz & Alice in wonderland.

WORD OF WARNING: I am a person who is allergic to pollen. I was so taken in that i forgot myself and by the time i was leaving the dome i was wheezing and the morning after in considerable pain. Please make sure you take necessary precautions if you have allergies."
,,If you like flowers.....,3.0,,We weren't taken by our visit. If you're an avid plant lover or gardener then it's probably great; but we weren't very impressed and only spent about 15-20 minutes in the place. The Cloud Forest in our opinion was far better.
,,World of flowers,5.0,,This is also located in same place. You will see flower from wold over and enjoy this its greatplace to visit
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Absolutely stunning conservatory. Saw things we would never see at home. Well worth the entrance fee. Loved it.
,,Amazing place to visit,5.0,,The flower dome consists of a wide variety of flowers and a beautiful place to visit. This is at the same location adjoining cloud forest. recommend everyone to visit this place.
,,Most wonderful couple of hours,5.0,,"Visited this place during the day when it just began to rain. It was the most wonderful of time spent. We loved the collection of different flower varieties and our young one just loved running around touching and smelling the various flowers on display. There were even couple of guys dressed as Bees, Elephants etc and our kid just enjoyed going over and playing with them. All in all it was a memorable experience and would recommend it to everyone."
,,A Must visit whilst in the Gardens,5.0,,"This is a superb and well maintained flower dome. Fabulous and not to be missed whilst in the Gardens by The Bay. Take the MRT to Bay front, walk direct to the Gardens or through the Marine Bay Sands Hotel."
,,Another Dome,5.0,,"After visiting the Cloud / Mist dome we entered the Flower Dome.

Same arcihtecure, just flatter and more elongated its interior is equally repfeshing as the cloud dome.

Lots of flowers and lots of people posing in front of them.

Nice cacti and succulents, unfortunately not a singel flowering one, which is one of the best things of cacti.

Having been in the National Orchid Garden in Singapore two days before, the flowers in this dome did not offer much more. A nice experience though, nevetheless and well worth to visit.

We did take even more nice photos of the flowers. ""Portrait"" mode on the iPhone worked great for really nice photos of indivdual flowers."
,,Fun cooling spacious pretty garden,5.0,,"My company did our family outing and community outreach event here. We were lucky as Flower Dome just changed its exhibit, this time its the Sunflower and Mid Autumn celebration. So the best time to visit is around late afternoon such that you get to enjoy the lighted up Mid Autumn decoration when evening comes. Here adult and children can indulge themselves around the mysterical Wizard of Oz Sunflower theme decoration. After a great time exploring the sunflower and castle, you can continue to Cloud Forest."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"As one of the two enclosed Domes at Gardens by the Bay, the Flower Dome has a vast array of Mediterranean plants & flowers, including very, very mature olive trees that have obviously been transplanted as they are older than Singapore itself.

The flower displays are frequently changed and the theme running while we were there was the Wizard of Oz.

Gardeners work the whole time watering, transplanting and moving pots but despite off of the activity, and the number of visitors it’s still possible to find a bench to sit down, relax and enjoy the surroundings. All in air conditioned comfort."
,,Picture perfect,4.0,,Great for snaps and like rge changes in terms of themes. Recent one was orchids for National Day. Would love to see more local flavors versus the western ones i.e to reflect the Singapore heritage that is so very rich and diverse.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Go during the day and get your hand stamped for a pass-out then return at night, its a whole different perspective. At night the man made tress light up to the sounds of music. Well worth a visit"
,,A Man Made Orchid Conservatory,5.0,,"A very well made and maintained conservatory at Mediterranean climate conditions. Star Attractions here are the Olive trees, Sunflower gardens and the orchid collections. Definitely a not to miss attraction at the gardens by the bay."
,,Every colour imaginable,5.0,,"Stunning and beautiful presnetation, with thousands of flowers and plants of every colour, integrated with fanatastic quirky sculptures and ""art"". And it is beautiful cool haven in the hot Singapore climate. Well worth the entry fee."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is a beautiful spot to visit if you love gardens. To see gardens from all over the world is beautiful.
,,"Visit only if you have time, nothing special",3.0,,"If you are tree lover , then you will find variety of trees here. Just plan if you have time. May be 1-2 hours enough to roam around."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"We visited during a Sunflower exhibit which was gorgeous but the long term sections were the best. Seeing the Australian section brought back memories from home and the Alice in Wonderland themed ""Aloes in Wonderland"" was very clever.
Every inch of this huge conservatory was perfectly cultivated. Absolutely amazing.
I took 100s of photos but all on my digital camera and unable to upload atm.
You'll have to check it out yourself to appreciate the true beauty anyway :-)"
,,Great for flower lovers,4.0,,This is a lovely place to stroll and see lots of plants from Mediterranean climates around the world. They currently have lots of sunflowers and a Wizard of Oz theme. It’s nice but not as great as the Cloud Forest but worth two tickets for one price and seeing both.
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,Another example of the way Singapore displays its love of flowers and plants encouraging people to help in the greening of this beautifully modern city. Modern in its architecture but still retaining the historical buildings from the early Singapore. A truly beautiful venue not to be missed. It is truly spectacula
,,Only for Flower maniacs,3.0,,"If you are in the Garden by the Bay and have nothing to do till the light show, you may visit this dome too. The architecture is mesmerizing but as a programme, I can only offer this to flower maniacs. Rest of us can enjoy a short walk there."
,,Indoor flower garden,4.0,,"If you want to see indoor flower garden, this is the right place..
Located in the Garden by The Bay, it is a place you have to go when you are in Singapore.

How to get here?
Flower dome is one of the conservatory that Garden by The Bay have. To reach here, you can choose Bayfront MRT station as your destination (same destination with Marina Bay Sands). It was a clear direction in the exit. So you can easily find the way to get here.
Personally, I recommend you to use shuttle service which takes
SGD 3 per passenger (no fee for my 2 y.o child). Because it will be so hard to to walk in the sunny day by bringing stroller. It also needs more than 15 mins walking. So, shuttle service is the best way. But if you have long time to explore each spot of the Garden by The Bay, it's not a bad choice to walk.

What can be seen here?
Flower dome is a indoor garden which full of plant. You will not easily get bored because it is a new experience to explore the area. It's a good place too for your children to learn about plant.
In the first area, you will see succulent (cactus family) and any other greenery. Then you will see a lot of flowers in the next area.
Don't forget to take some pictures here because there are a lot of spot to be taken.

☉ When is the best time to go here?
Go in the morning before sun is shining to high. After reaching here, don't worry about the weather because it is a fully air conditioned area.

What is the best outfit?
Wear an outift which comfort you. Casual is the suitable outfit. Because again, you need to walk more here.

Admission
In the official website, the admission is
- SGD 28 for adult
- SGD 15 (3-12 y.o)
- Free for kids under 3 y.o
(The admission for 2 conservatories, incl Cloud Forest)

Opening hours
9 am - 9 pm daily
It will takes between 1.5 - 2 hours spending time here"
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Want some good background for your OOTD during your trip in Singapore? Then, don't hesitate to come here. They always have different theme in different season. This place never ever disappoint me. Feels like always the first time when I come here. 😍😍"
,,There weren't as many flowers,3.0,,We expected to see beautiful flower displays. Actually there was a lot of the same flowers everywhere. We were a little disappointed to be honest. The theme when we visited was around the Wizard of Oz with lots of sunflowers
,,Beautiful,4.0,,You will get to see different and colorful flowers. Its an indoor garden and fully airconditioned. A must visit place when you travel to Singapore
,,Excellent presentation of gardens & plants,5.0,,"You must see the beautiful displays of gardens in this dome. The flowers, plants are well worth the visit. Even the castus gardens are well presented."
,,This was a truly amazing experience.,5.0,,"I loved spending time at the Flower Dome. So many varieties of flowers, plants, tress. It was a wonderful experience."
,,Very Interesting International Display of Plants,5.0,,"Visited this Dome and glad we did. You follow the marked paths and look at the huge variety of plants from around the world, very well done. I like gardens and seeing different countries flora being displayed.If you like seeing different plants from around the world then definitely find the time to visit here. If you're not that interested in different plants then this place may not interest you as much as the Dome next door. I would go again."
,,Spell Bound !!!,5.0,,"March-2018 me with my daughter visited the ""Flower Dome, Gardens by the Bay"".
I have no words to express the beauty of the garden. Don't think 2nd time to visit the area if you are a flower lover. Different types of flower from different countries. Really it was mind blowing. Can't forget the beauty in my life time.

** The area is fully cover with air-conditioner, you may require light winter clothes."
,,Diverse plants in a nice environment,5.0,,I went with the family and it was great for young kids. It's very stroller friendly and the cool temperature inside the dome made it a good relief from the humid weather. There are plants and flowers from all regions of the world and they change the main display every couple of months.
,,For flower lovers,5.0,,Book all the gardens at one shot and it is a memorable experience. Better to go on the day or evening to see the flowers in their natural colors.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Really interesting and lovely and cook. One of the highlights of Singapore and lots of food places on site.
,,Amazing,5.0,,To see a garden in a dome in a country as hot as Singapore was just what I needed. The park was well laid out and the dome cool and refreshing I wanted more time there!
,,See something new each time,5.0,,"Have had an annual pass to Gardens by the Bay for the past 3 years, and I have to say, it hasn't gotten old. The changing exhibitions at the Flower Dome especially, gives me something to look forward to - I visit once a month, on average."
,,Fantastic!!!,5.0,,"Maybe the best thing we did in Singapore, I wish I could give it 10 stars. It is incredibly beautiful, with 9 gardens featuring plants from all over the world, under one dome. There was a tulip exhibit when we were there, usually not my favorite flower, but I was immediately a super fan when I saw the variety and sheer abundance. The attention to detail was amazing, exceeded only at the Cloud Forest next door. The admission price is more than worth it. I think I could go every month and never see the same thing twice. I also recommend the Cloud Forest next door, but suggest a visit on a different day, so as not to be overwhelmed and therefore less appreciative."
,,Flowers,5.0,,a lot of flowers let people take photo and selfie. follow the direction can view each flowers beside the road.
,,Nice but not great for little ones,3.0,,"My children are 3/5/6 and think they would have appreciated this more if they were older perhaps. An amazing building and concept however was a little disappointed with flowers inside, was expecting a little bit more colour. Better value when combined with cloud forest but probably wouldn’t pay to go and see again or recommend people to pay to go in. In saying that my 5 year old enjoyed the smells and walk around rest of the family weren’t that interested."
,,Lovely flowers,4.0,,"You will find flowers from all over the world in the dome. It you go there, buy a combi ticket (for both domes), then it's rather cheap. Important: go there in the early morning, we have been there when the domes opened and there have been nearly no tourists."
,,Overcrowded but nice,3.0,,"Unfortunately we visited in May 2018. This month is very well known as per another review I’ve written, to be another country’s holiday season and they were in Singapore by the thousands. So the place itself is lovely from the little bit we got to see. We had pre booked our tickets through a travel agent to the domes and satay dinner before hand before we left to travel to Singapore. Again due to the other holiday makers by the bus loads at this venue it was a total waste of money. Our guide just had to walk us through. No stopping to view, just watching who you were bumping into and your step. I ask the management team how they control the health and safety here as clearly there are wired walks and seriously with them absolutely jam packed from who to go I’d be concerned if I was in charge. Please do not go during May as it’s not worth the money for this tour. Maybe there is another time of year to visit. Even our guide was surprised but he clearly stated this is ...... holiday season and they do come by the thousands. Sorry I can not tell you when is best to view. If numbers were limited this would be a nice place to view but clearly $$$ rule and ticket sales dominate over customer experience."
,,Enjoyed the Orchid Festival,5.0,,The Flower Dome was bought alive by mountains of Orchids! What seemed like an infinite number of varieties were on display and as an orchid grower myself it was great to see what was being done in Singapore with these beautiful flowers.
,,fantastic flower dome,5.0,,"the range of beautiful flowers and sculptures is amazing, allow plenty of time to explore and keep a good look out for sculptures in unusual places."
,,Amazing Flowers,5.0,,This place is a must see if you like plants the flowers were so beautiful. I didn't realise how many beautiful flowers there were. Just do it
,,Flowers everywhere,5.0,,"A great exhibition of flowers within the famous Gardens by the Bay. It is the larger one of the two domes within the gardens where is other is the cloud forrest. You can enjoy the wonderful arrangement of flowers and some plants grouped in small areas according to their location. They have an Australian garden, a mediterranean garden, a South African garden, s South American garden, a Californian garden as well as the olive grove and the flower area all in the lower floor. For the upper floor you can fin the succulent garden for the desert plants and the baobabs area for Madagascar famous trees. Usually they have themed exhibitions in the flowers field area. This place is heaven for kids as well as nature lovers and it is another example of the multi-ethnic Singapore attractions aiming to collect the whole world in one place."
,,Flower dome,5.0,,We have visited a few times and always different displays really enjoyed the Christmas theme. Especially good for families to visit. Enjoyable for all age groups
,,Too crowded in the flower dome,4.0,,"It's very crowded in the flower dome, hard to take a nice photo here. Ticket to the flower dome is a little bit pricy but can see different type of plants in the dome."
,,ORCHIDS,5.0,,"If you love orchids, this is a must see. The place is air conditioned and there is every species you can imagine, even one from Peru and much more. The colours are amazing!"
,,Good but not great,4.0,,"It is good but nothing compared to Cloud Forest. After visting Cloud Forest, the flower dome was a bit of disappointment."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Though it is overshadowed by the Cloud Forest and the Supertree Grove, the Flower Dome is still pretty spectacular. It is definitely worth a visit. Though I recommend going first before the Cloud Forest because the Cloud Forest is much more amazing."
,,See the Flower Dome first,4.0,,"Realistically, the Flower Dome was great. But it wasn't the equal of the Cloud Forest or the Supertrees, and if you see this at the end of your day at Gardens by the Bay, you will be over the beautiful orchards that are so common there and think ""what a great venue for a wedding"" rather than being blown away by them. Do the Flower Dome, then the Cloud Forest, then the Supertree walkway for maximum impact."
,,Great gardens & sculptures,4.0,,"There is a such a great variety of plants,flowers,trees & sculptures on display here.The sculptures are of great detail"
,,thousands of plant and flower varieties,4.0,,a nice place to see different varieties in one place especially on a hot day as it is a cool enclosed climate
,,flower beauty,4.0,,"fully air conditioned dome with flower beauty everywhere . wander among olive trees, and beautiful flowers of different sizes,shapes and colours.this is place not o be missed
trees and flowesr from Asia , Pacific, Africa, and other regions.
time 9 am to 9 pm.pl also visit cloud forest and night show (must )at OCBC skyway.show is very beautiful"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"The flower dome was magnificent. The dome has different areas from across the world with plants and flowers on display. They have also incorporated sculptures or animals throughout the exhibit. They maintain the facilities very well.
Food options are a bit limited and pricey so best to take something with you.
Great on a steamy hot day to enter the cool dome."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Totally amazing place, there is so much to see, fantastic displays, we would definately go back again"
,,Unforgettable,5.0,,"The garden is nothing that I have seen before. The flowers, little decorated houses and the paths were just amazing. My surprise was that there were relatively few people, not crowded at all (early August) and I could enjoy it to the max."
,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,"It's one of the most beautiful dome of flowers , as it's called cloud forest dome . One should visit this place for sure when u r in Singapore."
,,Great place & a Must do!,5.0,,"This is a great place to just loose yourself for hours, it’s impressive to see the way this dome is layer out with interesting flowers for all over the world. You can purchase headphones to get audio on the different exhibits.
Great day and a must do if your in Singapore."
,,Good place to spend a hour or so.,5.0,,"We enjoyed visiting the flower dome, so much different plants of all sizes and color. Very unusual plants to see. It is very pleasant to walk round and learn about the plants. Looks so pretty."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning from the moment you enter the dome. The flowers & displays just blew us away. The hanging orchid baskets look like they are floating on clouds, just incredible."
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,This is my third visit with three different people and they and I were amazed. Each time they have had a different theme which is great.
,,Must visit,4.0,,"An amazing experince and great for all ages, including children. Take a leisurely stroll through the 'garden' then head over to the waterfront to eat."
,,Flower Dome Not Cooling,3.0,,"Was at the Flower Dome on 11 August 2018 and as the weather was hot that day, i find that the place is rather warm and especially at the higher level near to the Dome glass ceiling"
,,Floral wonderland,4.0,,"It's the place to be if you like flowers. Alot of different flowers in one area and is indoor. Tend to have seasonal floral theme at different moment. However, will be overcrowded during peak season."
,,Cool and with beautiful displays,5.0,,"Went during the Singapore Garden Festival and can understand why it's the most popular spot in Gardens by the Bay as the air-conditioning is a relief to the hot sun outside. The orchids are by far the most impressive in its variety and unique hybrids. Most displays were thoroughly imaginative, from the local and Peranakan theme to the Mediterranean, Australian and African plots refurbished with a delightful Alice in Wonderland theme complete with White Rabbit, Cheshire Cat and Caterpillar with the Hookah. My only grouse is the difficulty of finding the exit as we ended up going round in circles before locating it, leading to the gift shop. There's an interesting eatery, Pollen, on the premises, bit pricey especially the cakes as cheaper food outlets an be found outside the Dome."
,,Migical place,5.0,,This is a must visit when you are in Singapore. Suitable for family with kids. Cooling and feel outdoor.
,,Heaven for all flower lovers,5.0,,"I've visited this twice, in 2015 and last week. And, still have the same result: Like it!
But, my wife loves flowers and for her it's like heaven. Beautiful flowers everywhere.
In addition, it will be a great place to visit during the day where outdoor is too hot because this dome is fully air conditioning. After a nice outdoor walk at the Gardens by the Bay, you can chill here.
I hope that you guys enjoy the dome."
,,A must go.,5.0,,"I still find this place enchanting despite this being my 3rd visit during the Singapore Garden Festival. Despite this being a constructed authenticity of nature, it still offers a respite from the urban madness of the city. On my last visit, it got very warm in the early afternoon with the large crowds. I would suggest heading early to beat the crowds when the tour buses of Chinese tourists arrive. I particularly enjoy the ice-creams that come in floral and local flavours at the small café at the exit."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,So much detail to take in and great photo opportunities. A good value attraction and a credit to those that maintain it.
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"It certainly is a must place see so make your way there if you are in Singapore. Although beautiful, it is not natural so looks too manufactured. We still enjoyed it though."
,,Beautiful Flower Garden,5.0,,"Every season, the dome has different flower theme. Sakura, tulip, Begonia, latest, Orchid. The flowers has a theme decoration. Every season is refreshing. Advise to go at the start of each change of flower season. Towards the end of each display flower season, most of the flowers withered."
,,Flowers everywhere ... indoors but you think you're outdoors!,5.0,,"This indoor flower & tree garden is so massive you think you're outside if it weren't for the cool temperature control!

Tulips, roses, trees! The wood carved statues & figures are must see works of art!

Bring a good camera & a light jacket & practice you're photo skills ... there's plenty plenty to photograph!

It'll take you an hour or more to see everything but time passes when the view is this good!

My wife & I went here on our honeymoon in April 2017
Make sure to check out the Cloud Forest & Supertree Grove next door!"
,,Garden week not the best time to visit,4.0,,"The flower dome has beautiful displays of plants and trees from various areas around the world. The changing displays of flowers are dependent on the events happening. For instance during garden week the displays were mainly orchids. Last time we visited, July 2016 it was iris mainly. Whenever you visit it is air conditioned and colourful. Lots of walking and photo opportunities."
,,More beautiful than we imagined!,5.0,,We spent a couple of hours at the Flower Dome in April.The quality of the displays and plants/flowers was astounding. Our 3 children enjoyed it as much as we did. Beautiful photo opportunities and so much to see. Definitely worth visiting and seeing Cloud Forest the same day. You can buy a ticket to visit both.
,,Night visit,4.0,,Day visit will allow you to see the wonders of the trees..There are many flowers that will blow you away.As for night visit you will be treated to light show display
,,One of the places we visit item in our limited time in Singapore.,5.0,,"Absolutely spectacular. Dome was awe inspiring , vivid colours, a huge variety of flowers, plus carved wooden animals jumped out to you in some of the scenes. The underwater theme was amazing. So glad we visited this beauty."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Beautifully set out with Flora from various countries and magnificent sculptures, works of art, creations all throughout."
,,Flowers in the city,5.0,,See for the pictures to find out how amazing the place is.. Located at Gardens by the bay. There’ll be an entrance fee for tourists. Unless you have this special tour card provided by some airlines (if you are tourists whose on a stop over flights) Get ready your cameras and phone and enjoy exploring the most beautiful and wildest flowers here..
,,"Silver, not Gold",4.0,,The Flower Dome is worth a visit but is outshone by its sister dome - the Cloud Forest. We visited during the biennial Garden Festival and were fortunate enough to see the Orchid Extravaganza that is on at the Flower Dome until 22nd August 2018. Just stunning!
,,A beautiful display,4.0,,"We caught the end of th orchid display, very beautiful. The place is air conditioned so can be a welcome break to cool down when walking the gardens. Gets a bit busy with people taking photos but you get that in these places."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,I want to go back in daylight to see all the detail. We went in the evening and it was so great! I loved it so much! Loved the succulent garden. Could spend ages in there.
,,Flower Dome @ Gardens by the Bay Singapore,4.0,,"For flower lovers, this is a place that is worth a visit if you are in Singapore... Beautiful blooms from all around the region on beautiful landscape."

,,Flower Dome,5.0,,"A stunning display in a stunning setting, with views of Singapore Great diversity and photo opportunities"
,,absoluetely magical,5.0,,"I was fortunate to receive a complimentary ticket to see this, I was blown away, the work put into this attraction was exceptional, this is a must do, whether you're a garden lover or not, its simply beautiful."
,,Sensory overload,4.0,,"The dome is a sensory overload as there are smells and colours galore. Whilst it is busy, there is plenty of room for everyone."
,,Cool dome,5.0,,Lots of beautiful plants from all over the world. Part of the gardens by the bay but an extra you pay for. Well worth it.
,,Exquisite and beautiful.,5.0,,"Beautiful Flowers and arranged so elegantly,natural and so beautiful how it’s all cared for. A must to see.you never get tired of it . Just a wonderful place to visit."

,,Very nicely made - HUGE collection of beautiful flowers,4.0,,"Its really beautiful and we spent about 30 minutes to enjoy the place. The kids enjoyed lesser than we had expected but a must visit place in Singapore nevertheless. We went in evening which was not suitable for this I think, Better go in day light"
,,Liked it so much I went twice,5.0,,"You have just got to go there. It is the most amazing display, so much effort put into the display. So much variety and contrast. Even I took photos."
,,The Flower Dome at Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,"What an amazing experience to wander through this lush, tropical dome filled with exquisite orchids, The floral displays were simply stunning. The temperature inside the dome was very comfortable which made for a very pleasant stroll through the various zones.
Could have spent so much more time here."

,,Sculptures and botinical beauty,4.0,,The wooden sculptures and the colourful scenery is amazing. Definitely worth visiting you take a combined ticket for both attractions it turns out cheaper. Each experience is different. The mist only lasts for 10-15 mins in cloud forest so take it in as the next one you have wait for quite some time. If you have just missed the timings go to the flower dome to kill your time and then right before the misting go to the flower dome exit and take a re-entry stamp if you haven't finished flower dome and go to the misting section. With the stamp you can re enter the flower dome later once you have finished the cloud forest
,,Beautiful indoor flower garden..,5.0,,"CYC_CG ( 18.07.19 )
This indoor garden made us surprise with many plants and flowers. This garden was pair with Cloud Forest, and only bought ticket for two place. My family stayed many times because there was many flowers that make stop-and-go. If visited this area, Gardens by the Bay, Must visit attraction."
,,SINGAPORE FLING,5.0,,Excellent place to visit. Especially for kids. So much to learn about flora and fauna. Great experience.
,,Amazing assortment of flowers,4.0,,"I am not that big into flowers, and having walked for hours already before getting here, my feet were already aching, but even so, I found this to be beautiful. Not quite as spectacular as the Cloud Forest, but worth seeing. And if you are even remotely a flower buff, then you will enjoy it immensely."
,,The biggest floral Green House,5.0,,"The conservatories of Gardens by the Bay are absolutely gorgeous. The Flower dome holds many, many kinds of flowers, from different parts of the world. The most gorgeous displays and even a cafe called Pollen, could it get any dreamier?"
,,A great stop,4.0,,"I was hesitant about going here, it is not my usual cup of tea, but since I was in line for a ticket to the Cloud Forest I thought it would be a waste to skip this site. I was very happy I went in, really cool environment to see, lots of different zones set up to see all sorts of different things. If you are in to plants and gardening you will love this, if you are not (like me) it is still a great stop and you will probably be surprised at how much you like it."

,,Many flowers from overseas,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is constantly refreshed with unique flowers from overseas e.g. tulips, sakura, dahlias, orchids. Very picturesque place and perfect for a date - a garden in an air-conditioned environment. You get the best of both worlds."
,,Beautiful indoor garden,4.0,,"This was our first visit to the Gardens by the Bay and we really enjoyed the Flower Dome.

We were lucky that it wasn’t crowded so we had plenty of opportunity to see all the exhibits. We took our time walking round - it’s qute cool so a great respite from the heat and humidity of Singapore. We were pleased that it was cool as it has water pipes in the ground to chill the air, and warm air is vented out of the top. This makes it comfortable to walk round.

The displays continually change so whenever you visit there is something interesting to see.

It’s a fascinating construction, as it is the world’s largest columless greenhouse. The glass itself sits on a steel grid and has over 3332 panels of 42 varying shapes. It’s like a huge jigsaw puzzle!

There are some wonderful sculptures hidden between the plants, they are well worth looking out for.

As it was just after Christmas the special Christmas area was still there which was an added attraction.

There is a cafe hidden away where you can have a refreshing drink and a cake or snack.

We spent over an hour wandering through the dome."
,,Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim - Tourists Should Visit When in Singapore. Good enough for North Korean Leader.,5.0,,"Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim. Tourists Should Visit When in Singapore. Air-conditioned. Very nice flowers. Nice walk. When we went there, there were many orchids, Bring along a bottle. There is a water cooler to fill up your bottle. You can have lunch outside the Flower Dome,.There is a McDonald's nearby. Not gourmet but fills the stomach. Flower Dome was Good enough for North Korean Leader when he visited the Dome during the Trump-Kim Summit. Regards Dr H C Matthew Sim"
,,Dramatic floral gardens and a free light show in the evening - orchid lover must see,5.0,,Interesting walkways well designed in a curving soft declining path that spotlights several countries. Children (and adults) can easily be entertained with a game of spot the driftwood animals - these are lovely pieces of art scattered and part hidden throughout the dome.
,,Beautiful but preferred the rest of the gardens by the bay,3.0,,"Beautiful indoor garden with plenty of variety of plants and flowers. A must-see for the gardeners out there. However, I preferred the rest of the gardens by the bay, since the flower dome was more crowded, less attractive (in my opinion) and had an entrance fee. If you only have time for one of the domes, I would recommend the Cloud Forest over the Flower Dome, or just spend more time outside in the gardens."
,,"The largest column-less, all climate controlled glasshouse garden in the world",4.0,,"Singapore’s tropical climate can be very uncomfortable for the nature’s lovers. But this problem is not a concern to you when you visit Flower Dome and Cloud Forest at Bay South Garden, one of the three waterfront nature parks built around the Bay area. When government of Singapore designed and built city’s gardens it aimed at reclaiming and preserving city’s limited land space; to create nature greenery and to advocate the quality of living in one of the smallest nations and most crowded city state in the world. Bay South Garden is the largest of city’s three gardens at Marina Bay, featuring two popular conservatories Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Flower Dome replicates Mediterranean’s mild cool environment and semi-arid dry climate, provides idea environment to nurture many rare and exotic plants originally from five different continents. Visitors can learn varieties of succulent plants, unusual baobabs and bottle trees that are rare to the region; it also exhibits many theme display gardens and location-specified gardens. This world largest column-less glass dome is an ideal place for all ages whether it is for educational purpose or for leisure entertainment. You can take your time stroll around different area of the gardens, browse through some of the world most precious life plants and spend more time for whatever interesting you the most. This indoor garden and tropical forest structure is an innovative genius, designed to be environmental friendly by connecting the vent-cool system at nearby Supertree Grove where rain water is collected and then recycled to work as venting-cooling-watering functions for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It is an outstanding engineer work runs on sustainable energy to minimize the environmental footprints.

Singapore’s MRT system is an affordable way to get to Bay South Garden. You take CE (yellow Circle Line Marina Bay Extension) or DT (blue Downtown Line) Line and get off at CE1/DT16 Bayfront Station; follow the directions to Gardens by the Bay ticketing office. The admission ticket is SD $28 for the adult and 10% off for the Singapore Airlines passengers (just show your boarding pass). It covers admissions to the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. The park shuttle services are available for SD $3 per person if you want to skip the walks from the ticketing area to the entrance of the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. You can get re-entry permit by having a stamp on you hand when you exit the exhibit building. The visits to the open area of the park is free but access to the Skyway OCBC needs another ticket and only opened when weather is permitted. We didn’t have an opportunity to visit it due to the storm forecast.

I recommend that you spend at least 3-4 hours since the admission ticket covers two conservatories-The Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest and many themed gardens in the park. If you like you can download Plant Explorer App to assist your visits; otherwise the information boards and markers are displayed near the plants. The annual celebratory event is the Singapore Garden Festival. For this year it is held from July 21st-August 3rd."
,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,Never been to Garden of this kind. Its a giant green house. A dome fully air conditioned. Full with flowers and plants. They design it very unique especially the trunks of the trees is designed very unique.
,,Fabulous Flowers,5.0,,"One of the two great 'greenhouses' in Gardens by the Bay. Great - well designed and well laid out, lots of wonderful flowers, areas with different themes.
Wide walkways and so it doesn't feel too crowded
A flower lovers/ gardeners delight - and the colours can be spectacular.
Beautifully kept."
,,"Tulips everywhere, don't forget to bring jacket",5.0,,"We visited this place because we wanted to see the tulips. And to avoid the queue, we bought the ticket online (from klook). We came here in the morning, hoping that it wouldn't be too crowded. When we went inside, we were amazed by the tulips and other flowers. They arranged the tulips. The staffs were so helpful. They helped us to take a picture.

We suggest you to bring jacket, the temperature is set just like early spring."
,,See this before the forest dome if you must.,3.0,,"Don't get me wrong; the flower dome is stunning - if you went there on its own you would love it and be amazed by the great design and the fab array of flowers and plants - the excellent vision of the different world areas and with the city back drop it is well worth a visit.
Do you feel a ""but"" coming on?
The forest dome next door is awesome. It puts the flower dome in the shade. To do each dome justice, would take 3 or more hours each. That is a lot of flowers in one day and probably too much. If you have oodles of time, then break it up.Don't try to get two domes and the supertrees and the lightshow done in one day it is too much.
If you do not have this much time, then the flower dome is definitely the inferior one to miss. If you do go to both, make sure flower dome is first, because I did it the other way round and flower dome was an anticlimax that I had to rush around.
But still great though!"
,,Flowers galore,4.0,,Think overall it was a bit overpriced and I preferred the cloud dome instead. But still good to visit if you have time
,,Cloud forest is better,3.0,,"We visited both attractions on a combine entry ticket. If you however are forced into choosing only one attraction, I’d pick the cloud forest instead of the flower dome (unless you have a particular fascination with flowers). Kids will also prefer the cloud forest."
,,Best part of Garden's by the Bay,5.0,,Without doubt our favourite part of Garden's by the Bay. Must see! Can get busier later in the day so come early.
,,"So much colour, and a whole lot of wow!",5.0,,"The varieties and floral displays are fantastic. All set out in different regions and/or themes, it makes it an interesting and informative walk around inside this amazing structure. I was also surprised how pleasant (cool) it was inside, as I was expecting a 'steamy' glasshouse. Welcome relief from the heat/humidity."
,,Pretty flowers!,4.0,,Thank goodness for AC! It got a bit crowded and hard to take photos without strangers in it but the flowers were pretty to see. It was not as impressive as I expected but great place to visit and experience. 30 minutes to an hour is efficient to walk around.
,,The World of Perpetual Spring,5.0,,"Spectacular and innovative! It is the largest glass greenhouse in the world (I speculate).The flower Dome houses almost 30,000 plants of over 150 species in 9 different gardens from 5 continents of the world- Australia, America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Don't miss this place if you are blooms lover. Huge hydrangeas, orchids of different kinds. I can't resist photos of them, hundreds of them. Shall I say: Singapore is an orchid country."
,,Orchid Extravaganza was worth it,5.0,,"Visited the Flower Dome when Orchid Extravaganza was on display - it was a riot of colors and shapes. The guide explained the Orchids and the exhibits. There are regular displays on a rotationalbasis. Other areas were California, Mediterranean, and Soth American. The upper level has Cactus and arid plants. A good break from the city and the dome is cooled, so helps to beat the july heat."
,,Lovely,4.0,,"Should come by day, so you can see the flowers gloomy, and come around June - August, they often has flower festival."
,,Amazing location,5.0,,"This is a remarkable facility with a diverse range of plants, sculptures and experiences. We would highly recommend coming here."
,,Annual membership renewal,4.0,,Returned here last weekend to renew the annual membership (taking advantage of the special offer to renew at half price). Since we were there anyway we decided to visit the domes. Quite crowded inside (it was around 12pm) but still enough space to move around and admire the flowers. The special exhibitions have changed since our last visit earlier in the year. Lots of pretty orchids on display.
,,Second Stop on Visit To The Gardens,5.0,,"In contrast to the cloud forest, the flower dome is bit dry perhaps because of the plants and flowers from regions like Australia and Americas. The main area has beautiful display of flowers. We could see some award winning orchids and interesting history behind them.

In other parts there were plants and flowers from different regions of the world (Australia, Africa and Americas). The garden by the bay android app helped a lot in getting to know some plants well."
,,Nirvana,5.0,,"A must see, I had to pinch myself so beautiful and although busy a sense of peace prevails. Must be all the breathtakingingly beautiful flowers."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"It's extremely cold inside, but wow, this is the very definition of amazing. There are flowers from all over the world, and the way they're laid out is nothing short of beautiful. There's even a wooden dragon in it. The finishing is brilliant."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The flower dome was absolutely beautiful with the begonias as big as grapefruits. The coulours were stunning from whites to orange and all the other colours . They change the theme now and again as abviously all plants don’t flower at the same time . Whatever the theme is it will
Be amazing . The dome is full of shrubs that come from all over the world ."
,,beauty,5.0,,this place is not something I usually go to but I was bored one day and then I thought I might as well try it out. when I got there I realised that this place was great for taking photos.
,,Soothing garden,5.0,,"I always visit here when there're special event like ""Chinese New Year"", ""Sakura"", or Easter, as they always have amazing displays of flowers! Most of the areas are on ramp, so it's good for families with strollers or even wheel-chairs. However, do note that on special events days and especially on weekends, it gets really crowded with locals and tourists alike. Don't forget to check on GBB Website because the dome do closed for maintenance every now and then"
,,Relax with the flowers.,5.0,,"We've been visiting Gardens by the Bay since its inception and there's always something different in this dome. We have seen beautiful tulips and begonias as features, as well as the regular little gardens from different parts of the world, including Australia and Africa. The trees and flowers are gorgeous and the sculptures amazing. It's a nice, relaxing walk around this dome, there is a lot to see and at night it's lovely with the lights."
,,Great if you are really into your trees,3.0,,"We didn't mind visiting the Flower Dome, however I would not be in a rush to head back. It was very busy when we went, so would suggest timing your visit outside of peak periods. It was interesting to see the different gardens from different countries/regions, however didn't wow me. It was more of a check the tourist box for me."
,,Tourist Spot,3.0,,"basically, the flower Dome is more for tourist unless you are a horticulture freak. I would day for local, unless there is a special theme, otherwise been there once is sufficient."
,,Green and colorful,4.0,,"When we first entered the place, it looked very ordinary and crowded but then as we reached down, they had marine land created using flowers which was fabulous and well created."
,,beautiful flower,5.0,,"Many flowers from many places gather at one place.. kids love to see that many plants, learn how their live cycle and memories it.."
,,Average,3.0,,"Was expecting a lot more, but nice for a one time visit when in Singapore. A bit basic but clean and tidy."
,,Largest glass greenhouse in the world,4.0,,Award winning & largest glass greenhouse in the world - not to be missed. Very comfortable visit and will not tire as the whole dome is air-conditioned. Flowers & plants from all over the world are beautifully arranged & displayed - worth a visit
,,Go to a real garden instead,2.0,,"I was less than impressed by the Flower Dome. It fails in comparison to the Singapore Botanical Garden, including a tour to the National Orchid Garden, which are real gems. The only good thing I have to say is that the climate in the dome is real nice."
,,Unexpected surprise,5.0,,Very informative and something you wouldn't expect to see in the middle of a city. Great attraction for all ages at a reasonable cost.
,,Lots of collections from around the world,4.0,,"They have lots of collection of flowers, cactus, and succulents from around the world. When I went there, there's begonia exhibition, so plenty of begonians."
,,Flower Dome,4.0,,Flower dome is just opposite the Cloud forest & Simply awesome. What a variety/collections they have. These places can't be described in words just visit & feel the experience
,,Impressive but crowdeda and needs more time,5.0,,"Impressive collection of flowers even for someone with little interests of flowers.
Sadly its so crowded that it takes hours instead of adviced 30 minutes to go through all. Specially if you are planning tp yake pictures. So count on it will take hours to see all and enjoy."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Outstanding display. So many beautiful flowers in one place...a flowere lovers dream. Very well set out and displayed and so colourful.
,,Em's on Tour,4.0,,"Along with our visit to Gardens by the Bay we enjoyed a visit to the Flower Dome.
This illustrates several climates from around the world and the beautiful plants you can find if you were fortunate to go to Africa - South America and the Mediterranean.
A wonderful place for student parties to learn about plants and their role in our world. We watched several school groups visit and the wonder in their eyes at the structure with no columns, and the varied trees and plants that were there.
The whimsical garden of Under the sea has you looking for Nemo and Friends and the plantings here were worth the visit to the Flower Dome"
,,Spectacular! Roam the Dome!,5.0,,"Flower Dome, Cloud Forest & Gardens By the Bay is one or our getaways in Singapore because it is cheaper than therapy! The Flower Dome is my wife's favorite because of the garden like environment, and it is very cooling. They change the main displays with the seasons. The orchid and cherry blossom exhibits are superb. We do not approach it as an attraction but as an atmosphere. Every attempt has been made to give that natural environment feel. We always feel refreshed after leaving. Highly recommended and better to go during less busy days or seasons. Whether you are a traveler or local, Flower Dome and Gardens By the Bay is a must see experience! If you find yourself hungry, we also recommend Satay By the Bay. Nice walk along the Bay and many Satay stall choices, as well as other local favorites."
,,Lovely Time,5.0,,"Flower displays are beautiful, displays are changed every few months, took lots of photos with family."
,,Specimens you may never have seen,4.0,,"The Flower DOme is not as spectacular as the Cloud Forest, yet it contains some stunning specimens. How they managed to transplant and nurture those ancient olive trees I will never know! ANd it was interesting to compare the Baobobs from Africa to their cousins from Australia. Worth a visit. Also, it is cooled and not heated as you would expect to find in a European glasshouse."
,,Very big interesting art work.,4.0,,Very large greenhouse with plants and trees from around the world. Some very interesting art work amongst the flowers and trees.
,,Man-made Garden,3.0,,"Its a man-made creation and done really well. However, it lacks the beauty and feeling of a natural gardens and wilderness elsewhere in the world. However, must visit if you are in Singapore."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Wow! How they managed to get 1000 year old olive trees transported and inside the dome, or represent each of the continents plants in 1 place, or even the structure itself with no inner support beams... this place is amazing. Even if you have little or no interest in plants, this is a must see. Would love to find out some more on the artist(s) responsible for the wood carvings."
,,Brightly Coloured,4.0,,The Flower Dome is air conditioned. It has gardens from different countries and California. The flowers are very beautiful and brightly coloured. You get a lot of information about the trees. I prefer the Cloud Forest but I also recommend the Flower Dome.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Have visited the ever changing displays at the Flower Dome on several occasions. Always beautifully presented and ever-changing makes this place a favorite of mine. Great place to escape the heat or rain as well. There is a restaurant in the rear as well, although it is a bit expensive."

,,"""A world of perpetual spring""",5.0,,"“Enter a world of perpetual spring” is the fanciful but apt tagline for this floral conservatory that is larger than 2 football fields. In addition to the year-round gardens, there is a changing special display. When we visited, the theme was “Blue Beauties,” featuring flowers in all shades of blue – one of the least common colors in the plant world."
,,Man made flower wonder,5.0,,This is one of the two gardens by the bay. The dome is air conditioned and is perfect for spending time in humid Singapore. This dome contains all the exotic flowers from all over the world. Try to enjoy the beauty and know about the flowers rather than taking pictures. You can spend around 45 minutes here.
,,the succulent plant collection!!!,5.0,,"I went to Garden by the bay, and deeply impressed by the succulent plant section, some cactus-es are so huge, some are so beautiful and breathtaking, i think the worker are doing such a great job, the whole place is awesome.

,,Riot of colour and artistic masterpiece,5.0,,"So much to see in this exceptional attraction, helpful that it's air-conditioned and plenty of places to sit down on the way around, you might need them too as you should allow a couple of hours if your into plants. I really liked the driftwood art scattered around, antelope, eagle, dragon and many many more plus their seafloor display which is a riot if colour. It's an absolute credit to designers and the gardener's who maintain it."
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,The flower dome is a beautiful conservatory with a stunning collection of flamboyant flowers and exotic plants and trees. The flower dome can be entered by purchasing tickets.

,,flowery display,5.0,,"Beautifully arranged plants and flowers.. love the nice scent and freshness felt in the dome. Neat, tidy and clean"
,,Breathtakingly beautiful,5.0,,Incredible range of flowering and exotic plants interspersed throughout thematic displays within the air conditioned dome. Hours of peaceful enjoyment were spent photographing the magnificent floral displays.
,,Lovely,5.0,,"We did this dome & the Cloud dome on the same day. You can take as long as you want to wander around. They were setting up for a new exhibit, but it was still lovely. They are a lovely attraction & I am sure you could visit numerous times a year as the exhibits change."
,,Perfection.,5.0,,You can not come to Singapore and not visit the Flower Dome. The Gardens By The Bay was our sole reason to return to this beautiful city. Highly recommend a visit by day and by night.
,,Beautiful Display,4.0,,Flower Dome is located within Gardens by the Bay and adjacent to Cloud Forest. Really worth paying the entrance fees. Very well laid out and good information. Flower lovers will love this place. Go see for yourself
,,Every visitor's absolute favorite,5.0,,Do give yourself more time to spend in this area. I have visited this place three times and every time the time was simply not enough!
,,Average,3.0,,Could probably walk through the in an hour although one would expect more time was needed. Not impressive in its set up...and this comes from one with an interest in and experience of world gardens. Just a display and not a very had dropping one at that
,,Flowers,5.0,,A large number of different plants and flowers. It's a paradise for any gardener from anywhere in the world.
,,Flower Dome Review,5.0,,Must see attraction. Entry fee. But tickets from the hotel where you stay. They give discount.It is best to visit in the day light. Toilet and restaurants are nearby. It's near the Bay Front MRT. One can also enter from the Marina Bay Sands Mall.Good place for adults and children. One can take a lot of photos. But it is crowded. They change the flower arrangement after every 2 months.
,,Must See Place,5.0,,"I liked Flower Dome better than Cloud Forest, which I suggest to visit, as well. You should spare at least an hour for each. It costs S$28 to enter both places."
,,One time when reality exceeded expectations,5.0,,"Having heard of this venue, I agreed to adding it to our itinerary. Am I glad! It was among the really wonderful experiences of my life... and I am now in my 80s. I will therefore mention that I found no challenges at all in completing the whole Flower Dome. Time constraints mean we shall schedule 'the clouds' for a future visit."

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This is a must see while staying in Singapore. Although at times it was a little crowded, I was still able to take some stunning photos in this dome. Well presented and well worth the money. I could have spent all day here. The gift shop has some nice t-shirts and jewellery."

,,Stunning,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore, you HAVE to go here. It is amazing, walking around and seeing everything is really special and I recommend, especially to families."
,,Incredible,5.0,,The general dome showcases plants from Europe and the Mediterranean - while we were there the specialist display was from Holland - Tulips from Amsterdam - something we as British residents were very familiar with. The displays and colours were stunning and it was amusing to watch the locals and far east visitors enthusiasm over a plant we grow in our own gardens - they probably felt the same when we gushed over the orchids in the Cloud Dome !!
,,Lovely Place & Lovely Flowers,4.0,,"The atmosphere is chilled ,so better carry some warm clothing . The flower dome is nicely conceived & executed. The flowers & plants have been displayed artistically"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Must to see when in Singapore. The variaty of flowers and trees is huge. You can find here flora from all over the world. Also very funny kaktuses 🙃
,,Excellent Exhibits,5.0,,"If you're flower lover or just like to see various plants and flowers, this is a must go if you're in Singapore. It is not as big as the Cloud Forest so about 2 hours should be sufficient. The dome is cool and covered so like Cloud Forest next door, it is quite suitable for a hot day or a wet and rainy day."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"Located near by Marina Bay Sands, this place is really a very good place to visit when you come to Singapore. In this Flower Dome, you will see flowers from all over the world planted at this green house. Inside the green house, the environment inside is very cooling. You will also get to see some fruit trees as well like orange, lemon, apple and many more to be listed here.

People with the hobby of photographing will really love this place a lot as there are many good spots for taking pictures. By the way, you can also purchase the tickets for Flower Dome at the open area park nearby.

To sum up everything, this place is really worth coming despite paying for the tickets."

Maybe it depends what your preference is. Also be aware that it is very cool in the dome so bring a cardigan!"
,,Flowers from around the world!,4.0,,"If you like your flowers and would like to see some exotic and foreign varieties, then this is the place to be!"
,,Sadly closed,3.0,,"For maintenance reasons, the Dome was closed on the day of Tuesday 22 May, 2018. Fortunately, we were able to still visit Supertree Grove and the Cloud Forest Dome, but was a shame not to take in the other Dome and experience more of the majesty of the Gardens by the Bay."

,,...small and not very interesting,2.0,,"...we 've been there for a local sakura event , with stops to take photos and queuing it took us 15mn to finish. The park is far being from outstanding, no much to see but a lot of people and bit pricy."

,,I Preferred the Cloud Dome,3.0,,"We visited both ""domes"" at Gardens by the Bay - and I much preferred the Cloud Dome. If you only had the time to visit one of the domes - I would recommend the Cloud Dome. While the Flower Dome was still nice - it wasn't as impressive in my opinion."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,The Flower Dome is wonderful. The Dome is air conditioned. The flowers are beautiful and well maintained. The desert section is wonderful. The sculptures are excellent. The staff are helpful. We paid $28 for Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. We also paid $3 for shuttle.
,,Love the tulips,5.0,,"Love this so much, even my 3 years old enjoyed the collection of cacti. I was so happy finally to see tulips again. Love the alice in wonderland theme. Just fantastic"
,,Beautiful flowers,4.0,,"The succulents, cacti and different flowers are definitely worth watching. There are many photo opportunities, but not as much as in the cloud forest. The flowers are within reach, so there were some patrons who couldn't help but reach out and touch them. There are quite a few staff walking around offering to take your photo for you. They're very friendly and easy to approach."
,,Amazing marvel,5.0,,"If you are interested in nurseries, this is the ideal place for you. There are wide varieties of saplings, plants and gorgeous flowers like tulips. Located in Gardens by the Bay and fully air-conditioned, its a must visit."

,,We loved this place,5.0,,"Again part of the gardens by the bay experience to see together and with tickets purchased in advance for best value. Stunning displays which are changed seasonally, so always something different to view. Spring was cherry blossom time..."
,,Tulips,2.0,,"We caught the seasonal exhibit of tulips, but it was rather disappointing in scope and scale. I realize that I shouldn't compare it to Keukenhof but the Flower Dome's effort seemed less than inspired."
,,Feels too artificial. Spend your money elsewhere.,3.0,,"Compared to the Cloud Forest, the Flower Dome feels more artificial and is much, much less impressive. The flower displays are OK but nothing wow. I would rather have saved the money and for amazing flowers in Singapore go to the National Orchid Garden which is truly amazing."
,,Just Wonderful,5.0,,"This is one place NOT TO MISS. The flower displays are just so beautiful and the layout of different type gardens is amazing. Easter time, Christmas time, there are special flower displays, just magical. Make sure you take enough time to wander through the domes, and it is a lovely cool break from the humid weather outside. We have visited here 3 times and going again late 2018 to enjoy the sights there."
,,Beautiful garden of flowers,5.0,,"It's a cooled conservatory, and has a variety of flowers. Tulips were the main attraction here when I went. So many other varieties as well.
They have separate sections created for different regions of the world, such as Australia, South Africa, Mediterranean and you can see some of the region specific plants here. Yes some information is missing about plants but there's plenty to see.
It gets crowded in afternoon (I went on a weekend) so better cover it in 1st half of the day."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Amazing place had a tulip show on when we were there guess change at times appropriate to seasons well worth seeing very pretty plants etc the smell is amazing shame you can't put smells on camera
,,Never miss this one,5.0,,"This is really nice place, whole place is covered and air conditioned. You can witness amazing flowers and plants."

,,Tulips and Daffodils at the equator!,5.0,,"The Japanese cherry trees, azaleas and spring flowering bulbs were at their peak inside as they would be on a cool morning while the outside temperature was in the mid nineties. All of this is accomplished using renewable energy!"
,,Loved the Tulip Display,4.0,,"I really loved the Tulip Display. Once again it was too crowded to enjoy as people kept jostling for space etc. Hence you couldn't even stop, enjoy and live in the moment. Instead you have to just rush in and out of each exhibit. It was a rather messy."
,,Great variety of flowers,4.0,,"The theme of the current season is Tulip. The gardens changes theme once every few months, hence its great for repeat visitors to see different types of flowers every time. Expect to stay here more than 2-3hours, the whole conservatory is big and lots of areas of explore.

However, crowd controls is really needed, it's sad to see the flowers near the pathways being sat on by specific group of tourists. Nasty behaviour by them, not enough staffs around the control them. These flowers eventually all died because of being sat on, it is so unsightly. Otherwise, it will be good experience."
,,A place to be for all the plant/ flower lovers,5.0,,"They have an app which helps you tour the place easily with all the plants, trees, flowers information provided. They have certain branches carved in shapes of animals. Loads of varieties of cactii. A huge collection of different flowers."

,,Overcrowded but a Must,4.0,,"You will see a variety of flowers from different parts of the world. The displays can be enjoyed by flower enthusiasts and casual tourists alike. Very ideal for taking good pictures, just be prepared though. This place is overcrowded, but definitely worth a visit."

,,You must do this!,5.0,,"Wow, absolutely stunning. We were lucky enough to go to the Flower Dome when the tulip display was on. It was beautiful. You must put this on your itinerary when visiting Singapore. Make sure you go during the day with the natural light coming through the roof.
Tip: download the klook app to your mobile phone. It is cheaper to buy from Klook and instant download of vouchers to your phone. No waiting in line to buy tickets."

,,Too beautiful for words!,5.0,,"Breath taking, so much to see, the Japanese Cherry Blossom themed garden was just gorgeous. Don’t miss out on this gem."
,,Smells divine!,4.0,,"The different fragrances as you walk around are just wonderful although my favourite part was upstairs where the succulants and cacti are. So many weird and wonderful shapes and sizes. I think kids would love these! Personally i felt some of the flower beds needed tending and the tulips past their best. You could clearly see they hadnt been planted just left in trays and jammed in where there was a space, this looked a bit shabby. We ate at Pollen and chose several of the light bite options and enjoyed them."
,,Flower dome,5.0,,"Firstly I am not that into flowers. However I really loved this. It was well set out beautiful, colourful and visually brilliant. It was crowded but not uncomfortable ,I would thoroughly recommend to do in conjunction with the cloud forest"
,,FABULOUS,5.0,,A must visit along with the super trees a wonderful collection of plants immaculate displays it puts the Eden project to shame
,,Where is some sympathy?,4.0,,"After Cloud garden, we visited Flower Dome. When we stepped inside we saw treas that were native to the other parts of the world. We saw African, Australian and Mediterranian native plants. The number of giant olive trees really surprised me. It is incredible how they manage to keep them and other plants healthy. The part where different cactuses grow is on the other side form Mediterranean area. I have never seen so many different varieties of cactuses and succulent plants in my life. In the middle, it was an area dedicated to the flowering plants. That was where we spent the most time as it is perfect for taking macro photography of perfect flowers. On every step, you have another one just waiting to be documented in all its glory. This area was the most crowded one though, but if you have the patience that is not an issue. It would be much easier if visitors would be aware of others and not sit in the same spot forever. If you are curious to find out more about our trip to Singapore, feel free to visit our blog page."
,,Exquisite!,5.0,,What an exquisite experience! The plantings were amazing and all the sculptures were absolutely brilliant!
,,Nicest Greenhouse I ever seen,4.0,,"Although it is the most beautiful greenhouse I've seen, the ticket is a bit expensive and maybe, if your budget is tight it is better to visit the botanical gardens paying 5$ to see the orchid garden."
,,Tulipmania,4.0,,"Raging colours of tulips set amongst a cool environment. Beats the heat in Singapore. For the best photographic results, to go in the morning when the sunlight is most engaging."
,,Nice place,5.0,,"I guess this place is awesome for people who loves nature, you can find some of the best plantation. You can find some best and unique flora..."
,,Wonder Flowers!,3.0,,"Many different flowers and spectacular. Crowded place in the afternoon. May be, morning time is better if you want to take photos without much disturbances. After seeing few flowers, everything is more or less same, at least I felt same...though it depends on one's interest:-)"
,,One word: Amazing,5.0,,"This is amazing, one of the best attractions in Singapore. The flowers and different plants are breathtaking. Beautiful and intricate surroundings, usually it isn't that crowded. Be sure to go everywhere in the dome so you don't miss the amazing and stunning displays of plants. Do you know what was the best part?? I even got to meet a famous artist called Shawn Mendes and got to take a photo with him!! Hope you get lucky :)

However, it is a cold, so do remember to bring a jacket and insulating gear."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,A beautiful conservatorium with an amazing collection of gorgeous flowers and a intricate landscaping. The technology that wrnt into the creation of this remarkable place is truly awe-inspiring!

,,Tulipmania,5.0,,Must see activity. We went during Tulipmania and were blown away. Bring a cardifan if you are going as it can get cool in the dome. The carvings are quite beautiful.
,,Not what I expected,4.0,,"This was not what I expected, being from Europe we tend to use domes to keep heat in and have exotic plants, however the flower dome is kept cool and has plants from these type of climate.
The use of sculptures around the dome intermingled with the plants made it more interesting."
,,Family Oriented place,5.0,,"This place exibits different kinds and species of plants. They change their theme from time to time like autumn, christmas, tulips till summer! this place needs an entrance fee. So i suggest better get their offered package to get a good discount. Their website also offers discounts for specific credit card. It is airconditioned so you don't have to worry about the heat. You can take as many photos as you can but you better not touch the plants! There are a lot of employees around so you don't need to worry who will take your photo with a nice background if you plan to visit alone. Gardens by the bay also offeres wheelchair rental for 2$ only. Just leave your IC or any identification to their customer service."
,,"Many flowers, threes and plants!",4.0,,"Many beautifull flowers and threes. Entry is 12 singapore dollars, or if you take ticket with cloud forest is 26 dollars booth."
,,Wonderful Tulipmania,5.0,,Tulipmania is back at Flower Dome from 13 Apr to 13 May 2018. The colourful sight of lovely tulips is certainly amazing!
,,Spectacular! Don't miss it.,5.0,,The Flower Dome is the largest columnless glass greenhouse in the world. It replicates the cool and dry Mediterranean climate - the internal temperature is maintained at 23-25 deg. C - very comfortable to walk around and enjoy numerous exotic plants from five continents which are displayed in nine different gardens within. You will be amazed by the changing colours of flowers and plants. Highly recommended.
,,Flowers flowers flowers,5.0,,I have never seen so many flowers in my life. They are currently having the tulip display. Amazing flowers! Lots to see. Pram friendly with ramps. Can be a little chilly in there. But so many flowers and settings from different countries.
,,Don't miss the Flower Dome - great rainy day activity,5.0,,"I've been to the Flower Dome at day time and at night time and this place is just as beautiful at either. Such a different experience each time. Great for kids - my 8 year old loved it. We loved looking at all the different types of cactus and other trees and flowers. We spent about 3 hours here and there was just so much to look at. A great place to visit on a rainy day as we did. We were lucky enough this time to catch a tulip display - just beautiful. Last time (Dec 16) I saw a beautiful Christmas display. A top place - love it and will visit it every time I go to Singapore.
It is surprisingly chilly inside - below 20'C. I had a scarf and a jacket and was still cool."
,,Lovely,4.0,,Great place to go with kids. It is very peaceful and many kinds of flowers and trees. They have exibitions for kids.
,,Flowers from across the world,4.0,,"Very interesting place. Lots of displays and great sculptures representing countries from around the world. South America, Africa, Australia, Japan etc.....Can get very cold at the bottom but warms up towards the top so take a light jacket if your prone to the cold (yes this is Singapore but this is a controlled indoor climate)."
,,Flowers oh flowers,4.0,,"If you love flowers you will love this place.They change exhibits frequently..Currently its tulips on display .Showing plants from South America,Europe,Australia and even my home country South Africa.Takes time to walk through everything so keep this in mind if you have limited time"
,,Inside the domes are cool and the planting is carefully thought out.,5.0,,Go and see the different flowers and themed in countries. Its a fabulous display. We saw the cherry blossom which was very popular with the tourists who could dress in traditional Japanese costume.
,,Not much to see unless you are a flower aficcionado,3.0,,"Again, it is one of those things that you do because it is on the top 10 of the city, but don't hold much expectations. It is a beautiful construction indeed, but not much than flowers to see as you can expect by the name. Extremely overpriced and we pretty much walked by, no stop. If you come to London you have bigger parks with flowers of all kinds and it is free."
,,fell in love with the sakura,5.0,,"it was my dream to see the cherry blossoms of Japan and our visit was just in time for the Sakura blossoms exhibit. I was so happy! the sakura blooms were awesome. Though there were many visitors at that time since we visited on a sunday, the AC was cool enough to keep the temperature cold inside. I simply love the exhibit and all the flowers."
,,Flowers everywhere,5.0,,So much flowers of different kinds. It is my first time to see so much different kinds of flowers in one place. Great for flower lovers and plant lovers.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Another great attraction at gardens on the bay, the tulip display is fantastic and the other displays that take you around the plants found in different countries and not forgetting the fantastic sculptures incorporated within the plants are amazing."
,,Keep going back!!,4.0,,"I've been here before, but am so happy I went again. This trip had a glorious tulip exhibit that I could not stop taking photos of. They also had a very cool Alice in Wonderland theme in the succulents area. Make sure you take trips through all the different gardens in the dome - Mediterranean, Australian, California + more."
,,Large glass greenhouse,4.0,,"A conservatory at The Gardens by the Bay, the Flower Dome offers beautiful landscape and garden artistry. During our visit, they featured the sakura."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Absolutely stunning display of tulips .Also cacti snd olive trees. The cost of creating this dome must have been great. Worth every penny.
,,Cherry blossoms,4.0,,"Visited here when they exhibited cherry blossoms. Recommended to go during weekdays when it is less crowded for proper admiration of flowers and good photo taking with them. I love how they ensure great maintenance of the whole place and provide good care to the plants and flowers. Not a single plant or flowers were sick and every stalk of them were beautiful, vibrant in colours and blooming."
,,Expensive but worth it,5.0,,"We bought tickets for both domes and although it seems a bit pricey, it is worth it. It's the only time we felt cold on the whole holiday so perhaps pack a jacket!"

The work they put into it is outstanding. The flowers in the dome are beautiful, a photographers dream. There are areas that have species from different countries including Australia. Very well done. Highly recommend. Buy as a package with Cloud Forest and get 10% off of you flew Singapore Airlines."
,,great,5.0,,"my second time in Flower dome, still as neat as 6 years ago, if not better. There was a tulip festival when i visited on April 2018. Pretty flowers and art installations from around the world.It was very cool inside, great to escape singapore heat for a while.."
,,Sakura Flowers,5.0,,We visited during April when it showed flowers from Japan. Lovely sakuras and cherry blosoms. There also had a Japan Fair so we were able to try all the food and drink.
,,Colourful flowers,5.0,,Was lucky to see the tulipsmania. Very beautiful. Did not expect to see so many varieties. A lovely place to spend time
,,Flower Dome....a cool experience.,5.0,,"This was truly amazing. The different gardens of the world were amazing. We opted for a non guided tour with a one way transfer by RMG tours, so we were under no time limits. A most enjoyable and interesting afternoon."
,,Tulip heaven,5.0,,The main display when we attended was tulips and contained every colour and type imaginable. There are also other plants galore. Big cactus display. Good to visit.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,The rain forest dome is the more impressive space. Incredible collection of orchids and the number of plant species is quite amazing. We were lucky enough to visit when it wasn't overly crowded.
,,Good experience,4.0,,"We pre-booked our entry ticket online which included entry to the cloud dome. We went after lunch and there was no entry queue at all.
Not as good as the cloud dome but still worth a visit if you have any interest in flowers & plants. Some nice models such as Alice in Wonderland to entertain young children make it very sweet, although plenty of adults were enjoying these too and taking lots of photos. I expected it to be very hot inside this dome but the air-conditioning made the experience very comfortable.

Some gorgeous flowers, I loved the tulips area especially. If you are at the gardens by the bay, definitely worth a visit.
If you are coming from the Gardens cruise terminal it takes approx 20-30 minutes to walk."
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,"Get to see and understand various species of plants/flowers around different places, nice to spend some time"
,,What beautiful displays,5.0,,This was such a peaceful area to regenerate among all the lovely displays. The sculptures were amazing. Easy to spend an hour walking thru here. So pleased I spent the money to visit both this and the cloud.
,,Cool inside,4.0,,Not sure if it's worth the entrance fee. It's nice and cool inside so if you're feeling hot and sweaty this is the place to go and get energised. Lots of different plants from different countries on display and signs with information on the plants / climate etc.
,,Pretty but crowded,4.0,,"The flower dome is full of a vast array of flowers and vegetation. It has flowers and plants from all over the world and is extremely pretty. However, it was a bit overcrowded which made it difficult to move around. But overall it is beautiful and lovely."
,,The idea public space,4.0,,"Singapore's greatest spot must be the Gardens by the bay, for the effect they have on a visitor, even if he were to make a repeat visit. This seafront paradise demonstrates amazing plant species. If I were to pick out one place that is unmissable in the city, it is the two domes inside the Gardens by the Bay.
The best way to skip the queue here is to buy a ticket online. I did - one hickup was that despite having a print out of the ticket voucher I had to pick up the physical ticket from the One Drive shop inside the Shoppes at Marina Sands. An avoidable detour.
I walked from the Marina Sands under a flyover to the Gardens by the Bay.
Entry to the Gardens is free, only the two domes are ticketed along with a skywalk.
The Flower Dome has nice spaces for children and for young people to take selfies. There is also a restaurant on the premises - during my visit, it was reserved for a private party.
Another space on the premises is used for exhibitions - during my visit, there was a Japanese exhibition plus sale on.
There is a common area between the two domes which has a very large gift shop plus several eating joints. Would make for a good half day excursion followed by lunch."
,,Lots and lots of beautiful flowers,5.0,,"We love all the flowers and took as much pictures as we can to show our mom back home. Even though she couldn't visit the place herself, at least she still gets to see them."
,,Awe-inspiring indoor botanical garden,4.0,,"As indoor botanical gardens go, this is unique because of it's shear size. They have plants & flowers from various regions around the world including S. Africa, California, the Mediterranean etc. I wandered intoeach garden and tried to take it all in. Gorgeous and worth a visit. You can go to this dome & Cloud Forest for $28 SGD combined walk-up rate."
,,Tulips!!,5.0,,Its the season for tulips. I love tulips and they had displayed many types of tulips in the dome. It was a cool beautiful walk in the dome and it is definitely a great excape from the humid weather in singapore. I love all the flowers and cactus and plants displayed. My son and i had a lovely time taking pictures of the lovely flowers. We talked about where the flowers came from and visualize ourselves stranded in the desert while looking at the huge cactus!
,,Flowers from (almost) every continent,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is located in (and included in the admission price for) Singapore's Gardens by the Bay. As you might expect, it has beautiful, well kept flowers and trees organized by region/continent. I love having all the signs telling me what I'm looking at. A good attraction for almost anyone."
,,Good place to cool off,5.0,,"This is better than I expected. The queue was ridiculously long, but then it was Good Friday. Even with the fifteen minute wait to get a ticket then fifteen minute wait to get in the place is big enough for people to spread out and when inside it was not packed."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,"Just a tremendous place to visit, even if you are not a flower fan. Plenty to see and walk around, and note that there are seasonal attractions."
,,Stunning floral displays in an air conditioned greenhouse,5.0,,"This is the largest of the domes in the Gardens by the Bay. The displays are stunning. There was a cherry blossom display when we went.
There are a number of sculptures dotted around - watch out for dragons.
This is a welcome respite from the heat and humidity outside."
,,Beautiful dispalys,5.0,,Worth a visit to see the beautiful cherry blossom displays and the fuschias and other stunning flowers. We happened to go on a wet day so it was ideal to be inside.
,,Oh boy - what an experience!,5.0,,"Terrific in every aspect. Flowers and plants from around the world including olive trees 2000 years old. Respectful staff who are happy to talk, this is a ""one off"" experience that we thoroughly enjoyed and recommend."
,,Colourful Flowers,5.0,,"We were amazed with the variety of flowers and themed gardens at the Flower Dome. The place is air-conditioned, so the entire experience is very comfortable. There is so much to see, and I am sure you will be amazed with the variety. Enjoy !"
,,Flowers from all over the world,5.0,,"The dome has sections devoted to flowers and trees from certain places all over the world. You can walk form the flora of South Africa to that of South America and then to that of the UK. The daffodil display (UK) was second in popularity only to the special Japanese flowering cherry exhibition, based on the number of visitors taking photographs when we were there. The Japanese section was a riot of pink blooms with miniature figures, houses and bridges interspersed. Lovely. There must have been thousands of selfies taken on the day of our visit alone. Highly recommended."
,,Great place!,5.0,,"Great place with a lot of interesting flowers! Very nice, well kept, it is an amazing experience. Great place to visit!"
,,Creative displays of flowers and art works.,4.0,,The flowers are beautifully displayed - and interposed with creative art works. But beware the selfie sticks. It is like fighting your way through a forest of dangerous prickly thorns.
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,The flower gardens are lovely. Beautiful displays of flowers for photos. The glass flowerdome is a good retreat from the heat. A great experience .
,,Good,3.0,,Makes for an enjoyable addition to a visit to the gardens. I particularly enjoyed the Japanese blossom exhibition
,,Take a cardigan and enjoy,4.0,,"First things first... it's spring in here... there is a nip in the air so take a wrap or a cardigan.

The whole place is thoughtfully designed and interesting to look at. The information is well presented and we had a lovely time exploring it all.

The only downside was the ""market"" area where ""food"" was available at a price. It was clearly designed to fleece $$ rather than add to the overall experience. This venue would do well with an afternoon tea shop in it rather than this market nonsense."
,,Colorfull Flowers Realtim Presentation,5.0,,"Not to be missed atraction.
Many flowers and trees combined with lovely sculpted figures - very unique variation. The garden divided into regions according to origion (south america, Japan etc.)
You can pass and look, but my advise is to stop read and learn. Take a profound scholarly look. Pay attension to spectacular variations of the plants.
Temporarily ( until 8th april), you can visit Japanese life style experience at Sakura Pavilion."
,,Fantastic flora,5.0,,"Part of gardens by the bay, this is an indoor extravaganza of plants, flora and flowers from all over the world. It's also sakura season so lots of cherry and plum blossoms 1 of a kind attraction"
,,Flower dome,5.0,,"This was another amazing place, they are all thriving in this environment, and those wooden sculptures were fantastic in between the flowers , another place i could spend all day at xx"
,,Great Varieties,4.0,,"This is one of the 2 domes in the Gardens by the Bay Complex which houses flowers and plants. Man of the flowers and plants are rotated depending on the time of the year. The Catcus Garden remains the same,. It is better when the catcus flower. It is an easy walk around the dome and great for photos. There is a restaurant inside about half way around which makes a nice break. The added touch which makes it great are the sculptures which are integrated with the flowers. My favorite are the horse. Some things to keep in mind. It gets very busy on weekends and with tour groups. You want to go when it is not too busy. Early or late otherwise people just seem to get in your way. Make sure you get your hand stamped so that you can visit the other dome at no cost. If you are doing Gardens by the Bay, this is a must. The local bus stops near by and there is an MRT Station a short walk away."
,,A must see,5.0,,We were here at Cherry Blossom time and it was so very pretty. The flower dome as a whole has so much on offer to see and worth a good hour or so of your time.
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,"The view was great, the flowers were in bloom, and we were in luck as the Cherry Blossoms were in full bloom. The dome was cool which was a plus since it was quite warm outside. The flowers were well taken care of and had such beautiful and vibrant colors. It's a must-see!"
,,Floral paradise,5.0,,"It is a huge greenhouse with controlled temperature and humidity. It houses themed gardens. Continent wise plants and flowers are exhibited with nicely laid out spaces. Plants and flowers of Australia, South Africa, South America and Japan demonstrates an amazing range of variety. The Japanese gardens with Sakuras in full bloom create a floral paradise."
,,Good if youre into plants,4.0,,"Wide variety of plants and flowera from around the world. Lots of cactus and succulents.
They have themes quarterly i beleive in the middle of the dome. We were lucky enough to go during the cherry blossom season which meant a Japanese theme with lots of cherry blossom trees. This also meant crowds which moved slowly but it wasn't that bad.

Please also note when purchasing tickets, the signage may say the wait time is 40min but it moves really quickly so don't that put you off by that

Worth the visit of you like plants. Good place to escape the heat but bring a jacket as it can get quite cool"
,,If you're into plants/flowers then you'll enjoy this,4.0,,I didn't find this spectacular but it was worthwhile wandering through. The displays are set out by country and are quite interesting. I found the wooden sculptures on display to be the best part.
,,Beautiful man made garden,5.0,,"This dome is not free of entrance. Well maintained garden, a little bit crowded but don't worry because the place is air conditioned. Trees and flowers are labeled. Lots of fruit bearing trees!"
,,Too expensive and too busy,2.0,,This is an impressive garden dome with about 500% too many visitors. What should be a relaxing stroll through the gorgeous gardens is in fact a fight to pass the throngs of crowds and millions of people taking photos.
,,A lovely walk,5.0,,Well organised and a good display of plants from all over our globe. Very interesting. I had a good visit.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,It was our last day in Singapore and our remaining time before our flight is quite limited already. But still we took chances to go here and be amazed of their wonderful collection of flowers. It was still worth the visit. We will go back to check the entire area Flower Dome next time without hurrying.
,,Definitely buy the add on tickets for the domes,5.0,,"The variations in plants, representing Spring (when we were there) were just lovely. Gorgeous daffodils, and the wonderful Japanese cherry blossom (sakura) cultural display was such an incredible bonus."
,,Mesmerising!!,5.0,,"Do not miss the flower dome! At first you will feel that it'snot worth it. If you are a flower lover, you will need 3-4 hours of your day just to admire the flower dome...........Beautifully created and well maintained!!"
,,"Flower Dome or Cloud Forest to go? Flowers theme are changed quarterly, dont go when they are changing theme.",3.0,,"If you have time constraint and need to choose either flower dome or cloud forest,go for flower dome. At least it got more things to see. But if you are not a flower fan, go for cloud forest.

Avoid going during the time when they are in the midst of changing to a new theme. It can be quite an ugly view and nothing much to see. Check with them first.

Flower dome's main theme can be found in the middle of the dome itself. No eating in the dome and toilet is located next to exit, right below the entrance door. Can be real cold during a rainy day."
,,Beautiful plants and flowers,5.0,,"I have really enjoyed this. A great activity for all ages. Indoor, fully air-conditioned. Value of money."
,,Flower bloom,5.0,,Such a pretty sight..so many flowers from all over different continents wonderfully grown preserved..so many of them couldn't believe all were real.. it has a separate entry fee when clubbed with cloud forest maybe a bit cheaper..amongst the Gardens of the bay..lovely place but for us second to cloud forest
,,Lots of flowers,5.0,,Lots of beautiful flowers. An ok experience. Not much else to see or do here. does not have the wow effect
,,Amazing,5.0,,This garden has a huge number of flowering plants from all over the world. I went at night which gave if a really amazing atmosphere as there is lighting.
,,It is ordinary,3.0,,It is beside cloud forest u can see 1000 kind of flower from all over the world . It is nice but in my openion average
,,Impressive flower dome,5.0,,We enjoyed wandering around all the garden displays inside this very impressive air conditioned flower dome. Next to the Cloud Forest. Cost $28 entry for both domes and requires a half day.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Beautiful displays and so nice and cool inside. I just loved this conservatory and can't wait to be back. The busiest part of the display is the Japanese garden but there is an awesome dragon carving on the 4th floor, I think. I took the elevator and it took us to the 4th floor. Everywhere you look is a site of awesomeness. The view outside is also breathtaking, we saw dragon boat racers practicing. Bring a thin sweater as it gets cold coming in from the outside and make sure your camera and camera phone are charged up and have plenty of space for the pictures you'll take here. The staff is also helpful and very nice."
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,This air-conditioned dome has plants and flowers and trees from throughout the world. Some are very odd shaped and rather interesting to look at. We spent about an hour walking through the Dome. This is one of the two domes of gardens by the Bay. There is a entry fee of $28 which includes the other dome.
,,"awesome, don't miss",5.0,,"If you are thinking what can I do at a flower garden, I must tell I was in the same boat but once inside my view changed drastically. Only one suggestion - go and see for yourself."
,,A wonderful place to visit!,5.0,,"We spend a long time here, wandering through the plants, shrubs, trees and flowers. We particularly enjoyed the Japanese tree blossom displays and the cacti in flower"
,,Beuatiful,5.0,,This is again one of the attractions in Gardens by the bay. Its an indoor garden but well maintained. Had a nice time
,,Aww!,5.0,,"We loved the flower dome at gardens by the bay! There were whole lot of different cactus, orchid, and we loved the Japanese garden too!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Be sure to make time to explore the flower dome. It is a spectacular display of horticulture from around the world. The flowers are displayed in a way that lets you get up close to see their beauty
,,So beautiful--a must!,5.0,,"The flower dome was beautiful! It's also a great place to escape the Singapore heat. We spent about an hour here, so many exotic plants from around the world. This attraction is definitely worth the money, highly recommend!"
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,Excellent display of plants and flowers from around the world. Lots of art work on display. Enjoyed strolling round.
,,A great half day out,5.0,,"I visited this with my sister and her family. It was a really enjoyable half day - the flowers were beautiful, the architecture was amazing and we learned a lot too!"
,,Lower temperture,4.0,,This is one of the best place to go in Singapore. The temperature is Great so you can enjoy the views. The flowers arrangements changes
,,Well Worth a Visit,5.0,,"I went to the Flower Dome in February for about 2 hours - it is well worth a visit. The architecture of the dome, the views in the background made the visit a very enjoyable experience. The displays apparently change once a quarter, so it can be visited again during subsequent visits as well.

There is a paid shuttle near the Gardens entrance available, but the 10 minute walk through the gardens is quite enjoyable."
,,Tulips in Singapore,5.0,,"Welcome reprieve from the humidity to wander around different countries flora. The art work was amazing, some made from tree roots. The colours were just wow! A feast for the eyes and a leisurely stroll around different landscapes."
,,Really nice,4.0,,"Enjoyed a good 2 hours here, walking around the Flower Dome. Such a wonderful attraction. Very busy, but where in Singapore isn't?"
,,Nice!,4.0,,This is a really relaxing place to wander round and experience. The plants and displays were really well done.
,,I Didn't Even Think I Liked Plants Very Much...,5.0,,"I spent a couple hours in the Flower Dome last week and was pleasantly surprised! I'm not even a big flower/plant person, but I found myself fully engaged from the moment we entered and eager to see what was down the next path. So many unique plant species that I've never seen before...and I travel a lot! The architecture of the dome, the layout of the various sections, the Singapore skyline in the distance, and the peaceful music playing in the background all worked in harmony to make my visit enjoyable. I liked it far more than the Cloud Forest, which seemed gimmicky in comparison. But you be the judge..."
,,Bring shawl with u,4.0,,Big area to see different kind of flowers & trees. Ambience is super cool. Inside temp is slightly cold may be because of the abundance of trees.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Visit the gardens by the bay and do the flower dome and the cloud dome they are both so well worth it. The flower dome is beautifully laid out, themed areas highlighting the species from that region, and with lots of sculptures amongst the varieties. A lovely place to go."
,,Sakura 🌸,5.0,,"It was a hot sunny day when we arrived Garden by The Bay. Therefore, we decided to take the shuttle bus, which cost $3/person.
Inside the dome was cold. so refreshing.
Luckily, there was Sakura when we came. This event lasts till 8 April 2018.
We spent abt an hour so much to see.
prepare the camera!"
,,Stunning flower display,5.0,,"We decided to visit the Marina Bay gardens. Absolutely stunning! Then bought tickets to the flower dome. I have been to many flower displays around the world. This blew my mind. Besides the fact it was a Cherry Blossom theme. The detail was fantastic. The variety was staggering. The sculptures were just amazing. Temperature inside is around 12'°. You can easily spend 2 hours walking around. A truly unique experience. Highly highly recommended. Then outside you can essily spend the day enjoying the gardens at no cost. Really beautiful.

A must do when in Singapore. Easy access using the metro. Consider taking a picnic if planning to spend the day."
,,Flowers galore!,3.0,,"Personally I am not a fan of flowers. During our visits there were displays of the Japanese blooms amongst other gardens.

Good for those who love the aesthetic beauty of the blooms, however I prefer the cloud forest.

Get your tickets online, eg klook, for discounted fares. If you have young children or elderly, you may want to take the shuttle there from Bayfront mrt since the distance is quite far on foot."
,,Amazing,4.0,,Just magical how this dome can bring on the season of flowers 🌺 very clean well kept gardens from a dahlia to cactus ! Keep up the good work a credit to you all
,,Amazing,5.0,,Flower dome is a part of gardens by the bay...it is a large glass dome which have a lot of flower plants from all over the world....it is a great place for flower lovers...dome is totally air conditioned...u can see and enjoy a variety of flowers from difffernt countries here....a must visit place...
,,A Must Visit During a Trip to Singapore,5.0,,"Great flower exhibits from all over the world. Definately worth the price of admission. Suggest that you purchase the conbo ticket for both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Also, good eateries around the exhibit area."
,,Beautiful Giant Terrarium!,5.0,,"Step inside as IF you became a miniature person walking into this gorgeous place. Awe inspiring, and ah-mazing!"
,,Plants Heaven,5.0,,"Flower dome

The name of the place is misleading. There are some flowers, but the main theme is desert plants. To see flowers you really need to go to the Cloud Forest dome next door.

Having said that, it is worth paying the entrance fee. The plants are spectacular. I would buy the combined ticket to both domes. This dome is kept pretty cold. Some people may need a sweater."
,,Nice for photos,4.0,,Went here when they have sakura. Spent around 1hr here. I prefer this dome compared to cloud forest just because i could take more pics with the flowers.
,,Impressive Garden.. Must see,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is one of the Garden inside Garden by the BAY.
It has massive Trees, Flowers and Greenery.
The Entire Garden is fully Air conditioned.
Its a true Masterpiece.

I am impressed by the way they have decorated the entire Garden and maintained it.

Must Visit at least once."
,,Beautiful cherry blossom and flowers,5.0,,"Queue was long o buy entrance tickets but worth the wait. I queue for around 20 minutes probably because everyone is here to view the cherry blossom

One can purchase tickets to got to both domes.

We went in the late afternoon, Sakura is nice and so are other flowers. Worth the time and money to see!"
,,Flowers flowers and more flowers!,5.0,,"Even if you aren't that into flowers, you will find this place really beautiful and colourful and just all round lovely and calming. There's plants from every continent (except for Antarctica of course!), with a temporate climate fit for all sorts of flora. My favourite part was the range of cactuses and the Japanese garden."
,,Amazing Flower Garden,5.0,,"This is my second time coming here. The first time was on Dec 2016 and the decoration is all about Christmas and I love it! This time the decoration is Chinese-themed since Chinese new year is just around the corner. I love the flowers! I went here with my parents and they love it. There are several place where you can sit and rest. There is also a coffee shop inside which looks very nice. This place is great for taking photos. But it is a little cold, so dress warmly."
,,What a genuine surprise,5.0,,"Although we had to pay to go into this in-door flower dome, it was worth every penny. So much to see, it was difficult to take it all in
the sheer beauty of the flowers on displays, a real sight to behold, a must see place to visit."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Worth paying the entrance fee for this exhibit which showcases gardens from various parts of the world. The exhibitions are huge and give a great insight (including smell) into the environment of each location.
,,Better than expected,4.0,,"I was told by 2 people not to waste my time visiting here but I did and I'm so glad that I did. Its not exactly bulging with flowers but lots of interesting cactii and other unusual flowers I had never seen before. Its right next to cloud dome and I had time. The entrance ticket covers both domes so I thought why not.

I hope you look through the photos myself and other visitors have posted. It may give you a better idea. A large area is Japanese style with little red bridges and blossoms. The whole area is wheelchair friendly"
,,Fantastico,5.0,,"Flower dome was multi storey walking round and round. Exihibits were well ilustrated and at every turn something else would attract your eye. The way they had set the plants up was just fantastic, the variety, and colours were all planned out. Lots of families were about and we took many pics."
,,Loved the place !!!!,4.0,,"The first one we visited was the Flower Dome. The dome is the world’s largest “columnless” greenhouse in the world. The conservatories’ glass sits on a steel grid that acts like an eggshell. This dome is home to a lot of flowers and plants. It was so huge, modern, and cold that I was glad we had light jackets and sweaters with us.

There are a lot of plant collections from different countries including Australia. There are labels and audio tour guides to provide you with more information about the plants as well.

As it was Christmas time so there were Christmas trees and lights everywhere and our daughter loved it."
,,Ok,3.0,,"If you're really into flowers save your money and go to Botanical Gardens instead! It was very busy, nothing special, preferred the Cloud Forest for a different experience."
,,Mesmerizing Attraction!,5.0,,"Wow, what an amazing attraction.....an absolute must-see for all travellers, young and old alike! The floral displays were exquisite and I was mesmerised by the beautiful varieties of dahlias!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I bought the ticket (28$ including Cloud Forest) and loved every minute. Beautiful flowers, trees and decorations. There were a lot of people, so I would avoid Sundays and holidays :) Took me about 2-3, and could've stayed more. Recommended."
,,Visit first before Cloud Forrest,3.0,,I visited Cloud Forest first then felt a little underwhelmed by Flower Dome. So I’d advise someone to do it the other way around.
,,A poor sister to the cloud dome.,3.0,,The flower dome was like a poor sister to the cloud dome. It looks like all the clever ideas were used up in the cloud dome and there was nothing in the budget for the flower dome.
,,"Selfie flower paradise, but skip on a tight schedule",4.0,,"It was beautiful but if your time is limited I would choose the cloud forest over the flower dome. A bit overpriced too for a garden, no matter how beautiful. But hey this is Singapore."
,,Flower Heaven,5.0,,No attraction in the world is comparable to what the Singaporeans did in their Flower Dome! I was completely awed by the variety of flowers available for all to enjoy! I was also blessed to see their Sakura exhibit in full bloom! It’s not just a place to see flowers but also to be educated about the many different species of flowering plants from all parts of the world. Tip: bring a jacket as it can get cold inside.
,,Not my thing,3.0,,This place is not my thing. I only visit this place because the ticket for cloud forest include this place too.
,,A must see!,5.0,,"You must go into the flower dome when visiting the Gardens by the Bay. Such a wonderful collection of plants displayed in a magnificent way,"
,,Five Stars all around,5.0,,"All visitors of any type would absolutely love these gorgeous gardens, and relaxing pathways. A true joy to meander through such lovely and vibrant vegetation and floral displays."
,,Great escape from the heat,5.0,,"If you need to get away from the heat and humidity, this and the cloud forest are great to visit. The flower dome features a variety of flowers and plants from around the world. It is very scenic and great for photos. There are activities related to holidays throughout the year. This is very family friendly. It is very spacious and I wouldn't worry about crowds unless you're trying to take a large group photo. It is best to get the combo ticket to also get access to the cloud forest. Overall this is a great feature in the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Beautiful Garden,4.0,,"Lots of flower plantations around the world inside this conservatory, such as orchids, tulips, cactus, and many more. Like the conservatory next door, this one also has air conditioning that will make you feel cool."
,,Pleasant stroll amongst flowers,3.0,,We had a joint ticket for the Flower and Cloud Forest domes and it made a pleasant stroll after the heat of outside. There were quite a lot of flowers we grow in our gardens in the UK so for us nothing special but the Cloud Forest was a must see! usnnothing special and
,,Most beautiful gardens,4.0,,"On our visit the place was being rearranged so not as spectacularly as the Cloud Forrest, however still very enjoyable and educational. Loads of different species and very well presented indeed."
,,Not much to it,2.0,,"Bit disappointing, we felt. Nice and cool, a relief from the humidity outside! Interesting if you are into flowers maybe 😀"
,,Lovely gardens a cool respite,4.0,,"The temperature is a deal cooler than outside this is a bunch of different style gardens under one roof. A great way to spend some time, the things I loved in this garden were the wooden sculptures they were stunning and great for kids to find the next one (the dragon was amazing) definitely a must visit if you come to the gardens"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is another air-conditioned garden in a glass dome located in Gardens by the bay. Here are several different gardens: California, Australian, Mediterranean, South African."
,,Beautiful gardens in a dome.,5.0,,"Superb flowers and themed areas of flowers, trees and foliage. A welcome walk round in the climate controlled areas of around the world plantings."
,,"A must do while in Singapore, a unique garden environment.",5.0,,The dome itself that houses the flora displays is amazing. All the gardens are well laid out and labelled. The variety and detail in which the plants are displayed is truly artful. Cost was 28 SD each for both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.
,,SPECTACULAR,5.0,,So many beautiful flowers. I have never seen so many different colours and the orchids... Amazing. Gardeners heaven
,,A riot of colour!,5.0,,"What a spectacular vision for the eyes. Everywhere you looked was just a riot of colour. The planting and thought that had gone into this conservatory was phenomenal. I’m not normally one to easily use superlatives but , in these conservatories and gardens, I have to make an exception. Even if you’re not particularly a gardening person, you surely can’t fail to be impressed by the work and thought that has gone into here. You could’ve got lost in here for hours. Words can’t really describe it, but don’t visit Singapore without coming to these truly wonderful gardens and conservatories"
,,"Unique experience, cool temperatures",4.0,,"It was pre-dinner visit during a cocktail reception. Simply a great place to enjoy the serenity and peace for a moment in any part of the day. Away from all the heat and rush, anyone would surely enjoy a short stroll around the tranquility of the venue's ambience. Only a panoramic photo would do justice to this place.

There are spaces for private events but they were not intrusive at all. Events were held within a sound proof hall.

All vegetation were housed in movable pots, hence, the change of scenery is expected over time. It's always worth a visit whenever one's in the vicinity."
,,Amazing!!!!,5.0,,An amazing garden in Singapore. Well decorated with many types of flowers from around the world! Really it is a place that worth to visit!!
,,This is one magnificent garden,5.0,,We were simply blown away with the range of flowers and plants from every part of the world. Amazing displays with detailed information made it more interesting.

,,Stunning!,5.0,,Absolutely a marvelous garden depicting a variety of warm climate zones from more arid and dry to humid. Incredibly abundant flowers and HUGE trees. The olive trees alone must be 100s of years old. Worth the one hour or so walk!
,,Paradise for flower lovers,5.0,,This place truly has wide range of beautiful flowers. They are so beautifully decorated and well maintained. This is a must visit if u are going to garden by the bay or for that matter singapore. Also visit the cloud forest besides it. Entrance fee is around 35$ i guess.

,,Outstanding,5.0,,"If this attraction isn’t on your bucket list, it should be! Absolutely extraordinary and not just for gardeners or folk who like plants. Do not visit Singapore without visiting this dome, and make sure you allow plenty of time to wander through, and take your fully charged camera......you’ll need it! I saw it at night which was fantastic, but I think I would have preferred to see it during the day."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Beautiful, beautifully maintained, well organized, expolore at your own pace, and make sure you do not miss the cloud forest next door. A must stop for everyone"
,,Another great attraction,5.0,,Flower Dome is just as amazing as Cloud Forrest. A must see in Singapore and definitely worth the money
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"When we arrived in Singapore we had several days of rain, so the second morning we ventured over to the Flower Dome. It is an enclosed environment focused on plants, trees and flowers. They were taking down the Christmas flower displays and installing the Lunar New Years displays. Still is was very impressive."
,,a Flower enthusiast paradise,5.0,,they have a great collection of flowers and plant from different parts of the world. and they decorate according to seasons. This is like heaven to the Flower lovers out these.
,,Place of calm,4.0,,Went as part of a joint ticket with the cloud zone. Very laid back and peaceful a lovely place to wander around
,,Unmissable place to visit in Singapore!,5.0,,"Flower Dome! Located inside the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, is my favorite place to visit with marvelous decoration and flowers. The dome is fully air-conditioned and has a fantastic architecture with unforgettable flowers views. The flowers colors, the smell in the perfume air is awesome. Unmissable."
,,excellent,5.0,,"this is one of the best garden i have visited. temperature can be a bit chilly, so bring along a light jacket."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Worth a visit, the flowers and trees are breathtaking .
We were amazed by such beauty , each part of the flower dome is very unique .
Wear comfortable shoes as there's quite a bit to walk .
Children will love the open space to run about and play while you get to take breathtaking pictures."
,,Another Riot of Colours in the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Different gardens based on countries and type of plants are displayed. Beautiful species and well maintained
,,"Flowers, flowers everywhere",5.0,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay on our first evening in Singapore, and the first space there that we saw was the Flower Dome. This, as its name indicates, is a vast dome-shaped glasshouse inside which are planted entire gardens. Paved paths lead through the different gardens, allowing you to walk about and get up close to the trees and the flowers. The gardens are spread across several levels, and besides the gorgeous foliage and flowers, the decoration also includes large ‘sculptures’ (crafted out of wood pulp? I’m not sure) of animals and birds, sometimes even mythical—I saw a stunning dragon rising up amidst the greenery at one spot.

Among my favourites in the Flower Dome were the fuchsias (lots of species here, and all beautiful); the Olive Garden (which has some really lovely olive trees); the plantation of Canary Island date palms; and the little ‘children’s fairy tale garden’ sort of thing on the ground floor, which looked straight out of a fairy tale, gingerbread cottage and everything.

Entry to the Flower Dome also includes entry to the Cloud Forest, so keep your ticket safe."
,,A don't miss part of Singapore,5.0,,Not to be missed and can be visited as part of visiting the Gardens the bay and the Cloud Forest. Constantly changing flower displays as well as the permanent displays - flowers from all seasons flowering all at the same time in some areas! Buy a joint ticket - also there is a reduced ticket price for people over 60.
,,Big nursery under giant roof,5.0,,If you are visiting garden by the bay then trip is incomplete unless you visit flower dome and cloud forest. Flower dome has multiple plants trees from various continents grown under controlled climate and beautifully arranged. Since temperature is around 25 it's good place to escape tropical Singapore heat.
,,Love the flowers inside,5.0,,"Always love this flower dome. I visit this dome everytime my parents are here, and we seem to always enjoy ourselves and take a lot of photos."
,,must do trip,5.0,,This attraction is well worth a visit when combined with cloud forest and super tree light show will take all day and is well worth the trip
,,Awesome,3.0,,Very well done....children will have the opportunity to see and feel the variety of plants/trees and flowers all under one roof. Worth a visit
,,Check out flowers from around the world,4.0,,"While we preferred the Cloud Dome, the Flower Dome was a lovely walk around the world of plants and flowers. Worth visiting as part of the Gardens of the Bay complex."
,,Well maintained,5.0,,"First of all, this place is a wonder! It took us about an hour and a half to go around this dome and explore the different types of flowers and cacti. The are is fully airconditioned and very beautifully landscaped.

We visited the dome during the Lunar New Year and they even offered fun activities such as painting and creating a Chinese ribbon for free. Even if there were a lot of folks in the area during the time we visited, it didn't feel crowded.

The place even got lockers for rent which made our visit much more pleasant since our flight was scheduled at midnight that day and we had to bring our luggage so that after the visit we would go directly to the airport.

The area is also complete with a shuttle to take you to the domes and back to the train station. Also, they have restaurants near the meadow by the supertree grove and souvenir shops once you exit each dome."
,,Dead flowers,1.0,,"Really overrated and overpriced place. Boring, nothing fancy or colorful to see here. Many of the flowers were dead. I would not recommend this place to anyone"
,,Climate controlled indoor garden,4.0,,Air conditioned dome with a walking route designed to show the plants in different locations around the world. Useful to enter during the heat of the day and leave the outdoor gardens for when it is cooler.
,,Worth the time to visit,5.0,,"Once again a very nice display and the staff works so hard to keep it all green and colorful. So many flowers, but not crowded. A lot information detailing the flowers."
,,"Everything is bigger in Singapore, even the flowers.",4.0,,Still another example of singapore's love of everything showy. Well worth the modest entry fee. A fantastic display of beautiful flowers
,,Fantastic destination,5.0,,A wonderful time spent here on the afternoon before going to The adjoining dome. Good value. Lots of eateries and fantastic light show @ 7:45 repeated at 8:45
,,Afternoon treat,5.0,,"One of the many places we have wanted to visit in Singapore is the Flower dome. It's a mix of Wisley, Wakehurst place & Hampton court all rolled into one. The flowers are amazing. Lots of interesting gardens with exhibits from Australia, South Africa & the Mediterranean to name a few. There were some lovely Chinese gardens that were Chinese New Year themed. Well worth a visit. There were also lots of little stalls where you could try your hand at calligraphy, Chinese knots etc. Great afternoon out"
,,The Largest Green-House in the World!,5.0,,"The Flower Dome houses a huge variety of flowers from around the world. And, it also happens to be the largest green house in the world!"
,,Nature lover,4.0,,"A must visit in SG. We had a great time looking at different plants and flowers. The place was very well planned. Although its crowded beacause it chinese new year, we still have a great time. Visit this place if its not holiday."
,,Kitschy,2.0,,"I find it kitschy, but my fiancee loves it. I think it is the question of taste. The only flowers I love to observe is the'tiny' Orchids"
,,Flower Dome...,5.0,,"Not as impressive as its partner ""Cloud Forest"" but impressive anyways. Don't know if it was that we were already ""flowered out""."
,,"Nice, exotic flowers",4.0,,I love botanical gardens and have been to many. The flower dome had a lot of things I had never seen before. 4 stars not 5 because I think it's too expensive and the cloud one was a bit more epic.
,,Too beautiful,5.0,,Flowers and plants of different colours and designs adorn this attraction...Too beautiful to miss...Loved the variety.
,,So Beautiful....,5.0,,"The Flower Dome in in the Gardens by the Bay. You need to pay to get into this exhibit. If you go to a Tourist Office in Singapore you can buy tickets ahead of time at a discount and then you don't have to wait in line for tickets at the venue. Saves time and money. The Flower Dome is a beautiful place to visit with so many different types of flowers and ecosystems. If you don't have alot of money, skip this and just wander through the Gardens and catch the Tree show each night."
,,Wonderful display of flowers,4.0,,"Set within the Bay of Gardens, this is one of 2 must see exhibits. For 28 Singapore dollars you will get entry to both and it is well worth the money. You will probably be aware of the humidity in Singapore but when you enter the Flower Dome all that changes. You find yourself in a cool area, looking at a wondrous array of plants, trees and flowers. Really quite a sight to behold."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The flower dome is amazing , beautiful. From the time you walk in it was amazing .Plants and flowers from all over the world . Definitely worth going to see."
,,Charmed by nature,5.0,,I visited the flower dome with my wife on our wedding anniversary this February. The huge dome is air-conditioned. It is easy to get around and you can get some brilliant Couple photos.
,,Unique,4.0,,A unique experience. Big indoor garden with flowers. Educational experience for children to learn and enjoy the scenery.
,,Intersting,5.0,,"It is part of the combined Flower Dome Cloud Forrest ticket. If you have your Airline boarding pass you can save 10%. The Dome is divided into separate regions like Mediterranean. African, California, etc. The Olive trees are some of the largest that I have ever seen. I cannot fathom how these trees were transported there. The same can be said for the Australian Bottle trees. A fascinating way to spend a few hours. Be prepared as the temps are quite cool."
,,Flowers & Plants Oh My !,4.0,,"Just beautiful ! Lots of flowers, plants and succulents displayed beautifully! Just be prepared for a lot of people ."
,,Great view,5.0,,Fabolous view of various flowers from around the world. The place is totally worth to see. A gem inside Gardens by the Bay.
,,Absolutely Amazing,5.0,,A fantastic display of plants from all over the world put together in a fascinating display. Fantastic for all ages with easy access and air con. I would highly recommend it if you are in Singapore and if you have your Singapore Air boarding pass you get 10% off.
,,The flora experience of a lifetime,5.0,,"From the rain forest to the desert, and everything in between, from all 5 continents, one could experience the diversity of the flora of the entire planet."
,,Flower dome,4.0,,"Amazingly well done, very creative, so much work and effort gone into this. Can casually stroll through and enjoy. The admission is included with the price of the cloud dome. A must see, more than just flowers."
,,Trip to Singapore,5.0,,Nothing like these gardend. You must see day time and night time. I wish we had more time to spend there.
,,amazing,5.0,,I can't imagine how they can grow such different plants in one place. starting cactus and finishing nordic pine trees.
,,Chelsea quality,5.0,,We had afternoon tea at Pollen and got entry into the flower dome included. The quality of the displays is equivalent to the Chelsea flower show with some fun themes that you don't expect. Everything is of a very high standard.
,,Interesting....look out for details of any temporary displays,4.0,,"While the flower displays are stunning, some of them are 'normal' for those of us coming from a temperate climate, however while we visited there was a new display of driftwood art works, which were amazing."
,,Gorgeous display of flowers,5.0,,"Our second time visiting, highly recommend though it is a little expensive and can be very crowded. There are usually special or themed exhibits, it was a dahlia exhibit on this time and obviously Chinese New Year, so lots of dogs. Incredibly beautiful, this isn’t a particularly educational exhibit, it just sets out lots and lots of wonderful flowers. If you want thrills or excitement, if you want to be educated you’ll probably be a little disappointed, if you just want to bask in the glory of amazing flowers, it’s for you."
,,Nice! But can be cheesy,4.0,,"The permanent plants like the very old olive trees and other exotic trees are what make this place for me.
The seasonal flowers, like poinsettias for Christmas along with Christmas decor are rather cheesy! Its sacrilegious as Christmas IS a religious observance, reduced to nutcrackers and snow scenes? I wonder if they do that for Vesak Day or Prophet Mohammed's Birthday in this multi-religious state?
The tulips around Easter are my favorite, but no mention is made of another religious holiday - just Spring, but they do not say where? Same with Lunar New Year! I caught the Cherry Blossoms once and that was beautiful. But other times of the year, pretty floral offerings. These special floral offerings must cost a bomb. And that must be why it's so expensive to go in.
I found all the African sculptures completely out of place.
Forgot to mention that for the Waterfall dome. Those carved dragons and all, really detract from natural beauty!
That Cafe, Pollen is good though pricey!"
,,Beautiful,3.0,,"A beautiful place, but too much ordinary garden plants and rather uninteresting decorative objects to be really good."
,,Flower lovers only,3.0,,"As im not particularly into flowers, it was boring for me. But it was extremely neat and pruned to perfection. It was so neat, i had to check to see if some plants and flowers were fake."
,,Flower Dome in Gardens by the bay,5.0,,Great opportunity to learn more about where certain plants originated and why some do not require much water.
,,1 out of 2,5.0,,"Flower dome is part of the garden by the bay, a must visit together with its ""sister"" cloud forest.."
,,Romantic,5.0,,"This place is romantic. I can't get enough of the beautiful flowers. During the Christmas season, they added some additional decorations that makes my steps hard to leave this place."
,,Gorgeous Plans and Flowers,5.0,,"This is a review of the Flower Dome, which is 1 of 3 paid entrance exhibits in the Gardens by the Bay.

I went during the Dahlia exhibit, which was impressive and absolutely stunning. The entire Flower Dome is indoors, making it a great rainy day activity. There are separate collections throughout the dome of different regions of the world."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Such a beautiful indoor garden with different plants from different parts of the world plus some thematic exhibition.
When we were there, the garden was decorated for the upcoming Chinese New Year and there was also the dahlia exhibition, where they displayed different kinds of dahlia in a setting of Chinese/oriental garden. Very beautiful!
Our son was enjoying himself looking at different plants as well as running around."
,,A global collection!,5.0,,"The flower dome is another part of the superb Gardens by the Bay experience and houses an amazing collection of trees and plants along with some very creative sculptures.
As there can be long queues at the Gardens by the Bay ticket office, tickets can be booked in advance online which can save a considerable amount of time. From olive groves to Baobob trees from Madegascar, desert cacti to South African flowers, displays of roses and all manner of flowering plants, walking around the Flower zone is a horticultural journey around the world.
The Flower zone is also used for themed displays. When we last visited, the theme was Christmas complete with very realistic artificial snow! Photo opportunities are plentiful whatever the theme.
There are plenty of places to sit and rest increasingly weary feet and any gradients are gradual. It does become busy, particularly in the themed areas but the crowds don't really detract from the overall experience.
Three things are essential... Comfortable footwear,fully charged camera/phone batteries and, if you're a gardener, a notebook and pen!
Not to be missed!"
,,Interesting,5.0,,"A biome conservatory similar to the Eden Project or Kew Gardens. Contains plants from warm temperate and tropical areas around the world, divided by geographical area. It’s as much a tourist attraction as scientific exhibit, but none the worse for that.

A great place to while away a couple of hours, and it’s climate controlled. S$28 admission for both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It’s a “must do” for Singapore."
,,Tranquil and Beautiful,5.0,,The flower dome is an oasis in the concrete jungle of Singapore. The tranquility and beauty are as serene as could be - you must visit in person to do the experience justice. A MUST if in Singapore!
,,Gardeners Delight,5.0,,Absolutely amazing display of beautiful flower & succulent displays. Loads of beautiful sculptures that leave you amazed at how creative & talented some people are. Money well spent visiting this amazing Singapore highlight. At the time we visited there was a fabulous cherry blossom display that was so good it made you feel like you were in Japan.
,,Flower delight,5.0,,Really nice way to pass an hour or so and great value. We spent an hour here before visiting the cloud forrest. Lovely to be out of the Singapore baking sun in middle of day and a wonderful sight to see.
,,Largest greenhouse in the world!,5.0,,"Flower Dome is one of the greenhouses (""conservatories"") at Singapore's Gardens by the Bay located just behind the famous Marina Bay Sands hotel. The other one would be the Cloud Forest (which I personally like more). It is enlisted on the 2015 Guinness Book of Records as being the biggest greenhouse in the world. It is open from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Admission tickets costs SG$28 for adults. You'll save a bit if you buy a combined ticket for both the ""conservatories"" (for SG$28 per adult).

The place features plants and flowers from all over the world. Hence, if you can't travel around the world and you love flora, then the Flower Dome would be your best shot. The collection is divided into different gardens ... Mediterranean garden, South American garden, Californian garden, South African garden, and so forth. It is impressive how temperature in the dome is regulated so as to keep the plants and the flowers, as it were, in their natural habitat. Aside from the permanent exhibit, the flower display is also changed from time to time. A visit to the Flower Dome is a must for plants and flowers lovers when they visit Singapore. Thumbs up!"
,,Vibrant and beautiful,4.0,,A must to go if you are in Singapore. Amazingly beautiful and built fantastic. Worth to walk around with your DSLR alone or with family and friends.
,,Extremely Beautiful,5.0,,You will find a great variety of Plants and Flower here. Worth the time spend. Avg duration 2 hrs required.
,,Nicely laid out,4.0,,"You can get in here for a relatively low cost of you are already going to the Cloud Forest. It is worth walking through and does a not take near as long as the Cloud Forest. It has a number of plants growing in different areas that are sorted out by climate of origin...mediterranean, etc. Worth a visit if you are already in the cloud forest."
,,THE BEST!,5.0,,"I can still remember the vivid colors of flowers and plants in this garden. The place was so big and so colorful, and you will forget how hot it is in SG while you're inside!"
,,SHEER JOY,5.0,,"After a wonderful lunch in Pollen we went for a walk in the Flower Dome. Stunning. Everyone was walking around in a state of unbridled delight, marvelling not only the plants, which are arranged on the basis of species and properties and countries, but at the delightful 'accessories' - the shower of red and orange parasols descending from the roof. The huge revolving Chinese lantern in one of the gardens. And - because it's the Year of the Dog coming up - giant dogs sculpted from moss and turf with eyes made from pine cones etc. Gone are the days of stuffy scientific museums - Singapore is showing the way to go. A MUST!"
,,Beautiful Serene,4.0,,"Beautiful and fragrant full stroll. Nicely done, with flowers from all regions. Its a must watch if you love Nature"
,,LOVELY FLOWERS BUT DO BEFORE CLOUD DOME,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is a lovely experience with a huge assortment of flowers, bushes, cactus and other species but it is low key and homey.

Things like the Santa Claus cabin? and Christmas decorations are pleasant and enjoyable. You will like them more if seen before the dramatic Cloud Dome."
,,Calm and relaxing visit,3.0,,"I came to the flower dome as it is apart of gardens by the bay. The visit was calm and relaxing visit. I got a lot of photos (which made my parents jealous) nice and cool in the dome, which was great on a hot and humid day"
,,Flowers!,5.0,,"I am a big fan of flowers and this place caters to that. They have a vast variety of flowers, succulents, and baobabs from different parts of the globe. If you get hungry while strolling around the dome, there is a cafe/restaurant just inside the dome so no need to worry."
,,essential for every visitor to Singapore,5.0,,"I have been to the flower dome on numerous occasions. The flower displays are changed regularly. I continue to be amazed, surprised and delighted by all that the domes have to offer. Yesterday there dhalias, daffodils,liliums, ranuculuas - if you are a budding botantist head for the domes."
,,WORLD OF FLOWERS,5.0,,"So many kinds of flowers from different corner with their descriptions and origins...i dont think someone can't being amazed by going there...not that expensive but it can make you happy from the very beginning at the entrance..you might be exploring the plants from your backyard well organized,neat and clean and ask yourself why my backyard don't look like this... worthy visit..i never liked flowers that much before visiting here...but now i am pretty sure that i love that garden so much...."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,If you are going to buy tickets to both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest I would strongly suggest seeing the Flower Dome first. It is fantastic and well worth the visit but you will not appreciate it as much as it deserves if you see it second. The areas of the dome are in sections from around the world and it is well thought out and fantastic statues mixed amongst the plants to enhance the experience of the country represented. The paths are wide and wheelchair friendly to get around the air conditioned dome.
,,Interesting concept,5.0,,This gardens comprises of many variety of flower species kept and showcased in a extremely cooling environment which is pretty unique for a plants exhibition
,,Great variety of flowers,5.0,,"There is a huge variety of flowers inside the dome, coming from all over the world. Every flower has a description detailing its origin, conditions for growth etc. It is also air-conditioned inside which provides a good break from the sweltering heat outside."
,,Unbelievable Place,5.0,,"Just go and you will be amazed. Even for people like me that can take or leave a flower, it was very very good and worth the effort. It is easily accessed from Marina Bay Sands and it isn't too expensive. There are 2 domes and you can visit 1 or both for slightly extra admission. They have different themes so you can choose either or both. Ask at counter when paying about any discounts as between flying with Singapore Airlines and/or using Mastercard to pay, you can save a few dollars."
,,Flowers from Across the Globe,5.0,,"Flower dome has collections from across all region , set as theme for each region well maintained , neat and clean"
,,flower everywhere!,5.0,,"for those who love flower, you must be happy there is place that will fulfill your amorousness! they separated the flower depend on their categorise. yet still beautiful!"
,,Great place,5.0,,"We were there when the harvest was on, the way all the displays were laid out was great. The different themes was also very good to see."
,,Good,4.0,,Not as good as the Cloud Forest but certainly well worth the expense of going round here as well. Plenty of amazing plants and some extremely old olive trees.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Stunning place. Well presented and loads to see and learn, you can get a joint ticket with the cloud garden too to save a bit more money. Well worth it"
,,Spring flowers!,5.0,,"Different types od Orchids and flowers around the World is planted when we went. Enjoyable experience, it is good for everyone who like to relax during the holiday in Singapore."
,,Beautifully presented,5.0,,"Gardens of all types & featuring some from different countries set out in a huge hot house dome. All beautifully laid out with clean concrete pathways throughout. Unique features in each garden, some with wood art & sculptures. Also colourful displays such as the tulip garden complete with boat & rotunda. There is also a cafe in the complex if you fancy a coffee or something to eat."
,,Spectacular display of nature,5.0,,I was truly stunned by these gardens. Their magnificent beauty caused me just to shut down my cognitive processes such as naming the species etc and just allow myself to be overwhelmed. This is a MUST SEE in Singapore.
,,Simply beautiful,4.0,,Part of the gardens by the bay flower dome is a wonderful place to visit.How plants have been planted over a high dome is amazing.the whole environment is pretty good and the waterfall adds to the beauty.Must visit place
,,Part of gardens by the bay,5.0,,"Beautiful landscaped Dome with flowers, cactus etc. Divided into flowers of different countries. Must see."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"So many flowers all from different areas around the world. Singaporeans don't do anything by halves. The variety here is unbelievable. All organized, well maintained and spotlessly clean. One of our favourite outings."
,,Amazing collection,5.0,,"It's a great achievement to construct an architectural marvel like this without any supporting pillars. They have some amazing collection of succulents, cacti, orchids, tropical flowers and the likes. Must visit along with the adjacent cloud forest."
,,Average garden,3.0,,"Better to go only to cloud dome. This is normál botanical garden,whitch you can visite in every big city"
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"A return visit for us. The gardens keep a very high standard. If you do not want to do it all on one day you can get membership for a year, worth it if you visit more than twice a year. Highlight: the temporary garden for Chinese New Year"
,,Nature Lover Only,3.0,,"As the title goes, this place is suitable for nature lover only. There are various kinds of plants and flowers from the variety of places. But I find it quite boring as I am not a nature enthusiastic person. Overall, the place is still nice, especially at night."
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,"This place is very neat and beautiful in every-way. Nicely designed and have all kinds of plants, trees and flowers. This is a must see attraction if you like plants and flowers."
,,Colourful,4.0,,"Colourful and vibrant flowers laid out by countries, inter-mixed with the sculptures makes it unique."
,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay, alongside the Cloud Forest",4.0,,All gardeners and flower/flora enthusiasts must see! Plants collected in areas representing continents or geographical areas.
,,Mind blowing and draw dropping!,5.0,,"This was on our To Do List since previous trips to Singapore, but this January 2018, we had tickets to go inside and it did not disappoint!

We went in the early evening when it was still light but the sun was slowly setting, thus avoiding the heat and experiencing the Flower Dome as the lights began to illuminate.

It was extremely busy with massive long queues to see each geographic garden (Australian, South African, Chinese etc). Give yourself sufficient time, not only to experience but also to account for the rest of the world who are wanting to see it simultaneously also."
,,Skipable,3.0,,Generally I don't think this place would be particularly interesting for the europeans. If you don't have a lot of time this might be a place to skip - you can go to the botanical garden in your home country.
,,Extraordinary,4.0,,Your Singapore holiday is incomplete if you don't come to cloud dome. Under one roof you can see tree planting from Africa Asia north America south America. It's amazing
,,Awesome sight of flowers,4.0,,"Its a beautiful place decorated with colourful flowers, beautiful wooden scraptures. Great place to visit for people interested in flower photography."
,,Refreshing. Fragrant. An oasis.,5.0,,"Living in an urban jungle, this dome is a very much needed break. I like the fact that it is not too big. That it is not open air (it was raining really hard, and we were safe inside from the downpour). That, though the collection is not extensive, good 'samplers' are all there. I, of course, know nothing about plants. I really enjoyed the time there. Sitting in different areas and just enjoying different plants and fragrances. Very wheelchairs accessible. A nice cafe/resto is available inside the dome - otherwise, no eating/drinking is allowed."
,,Must visit place,5.0,,Whatever u review about this place it’s always less as for me it’s still fascinating how they are maintaining this place in simulated environment. Money is not the only thing that should be required but it needs a strong will and determination.Lucky that i went to this place during pumpkin festival and its beautifully decorated with pumpkins.All the flowers are arranged based on regions and climatic conditions.Its a great educational tour for children and good romantic place for couples.Pls spend 4 hrs in this place and don’t be in a hurry.
,,Educational biome.,5.0,,"This is a very well laid out glasshouse that takes the visitor through the various climatic zones. The most memorable were the Mediterranean sections that demonstrated the different vegetation found in Europe, South Africa, North and South America and Australasia. We loved the animals made out of driftwood, the ancient olive trees and giant baobabs. It's beautifully maintained and carefully supervised."
,,Dinner and dance,4.0,,Had our company dinner and dance inside the flower dome and had time to walk around the place. It’s nice and cooling with quite a good varieties of flowers and plants. Worth a visit if you love flowers and exotic plants.
,,Lovely,5.0,,This was the second dome in gardens by the bay. Very big and the displays were excellent. I loved all the wooden carvings out of drift wood displayed around the dome. Dahilia display was being arranged loads of colour and photo opportunity.
,,Great Attraction but Spare us the Lecture,4.0,,"Visited this and the Cloud Garden last week. Both Spectacular horticultural attractions with the waterfall in the Cloud Garden a real highlight. Although It could have done without all the plaques blathering on about how climate change is endangering the plant life on display, we all know climate change is an issue but you don't necessarily want it thrown in your face while you are trying to enjoy the visit"
,,A magical change,5.0,,"The “plants of the world” tour is always a delight but the way the Dome incorporates different events into the displays is wonderful.

The Christmas one was magical - the home of Santa complete with presents, Christmas Trees, Nutcrackers and snow left adults as well as children feeling the joy of the season.

A visit to the Dome is on our “to do” list whenever we visit Singapore.

Thanks to the staff for all their hard work and efforts to ensure we have a wonderful visit."
,,A Spectacular Showcase of Nature,5.0,,"Flower dome is part of the Garden by the bay and is only accessible after paying the entry fee.
Flower dome has done an exceptional work to collect flora from all over world. It's has got plants from Australia to Madagascar, from USA to Olive groove from Greece. It is truly a spectacular showcase of beauty of nature.
The best part of flower dome is that it is given information about every flora in it, which also very commendable."
,,Holiday adventure,5.0,,Like the cloud Dome you can buy a ticket for both. Easy to walk around and stunning to see..an awsome activity what ever the weather. Refreshments available and plenty seating to rest and take a moment to take in the beauty. Well worth the visit. Beautiful
,,Dont miss,5.0,,"Well i dont think anyone hates flower but this place is awesome , Its an indoor air conditioned garden with lots of varieties & amazing display of flowers , plants & trees . We arrived late but still stayed for at least 1 hour , wish had more time to have food at indoor restaurant"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Be sure to make time to explore the flower dome. It is a spectacular display of horticulture from around the world. A relaxing and pleasant way to spend a few hours in Singapore.
,,Stunning variety of flowering plants,5.0,,This garden has a huge number of flowering plants from all over the world. The flowers are displayed in a way that lets you get up close to see their beauty. many of the displays are at waist level so you can better see them.
,,Combine with the Cloud Forest for a world class experience,5.0,,"You need to spend a minimum of 45 mins in this place as it's just amazing. Combine it with the Cloud Forest for a superb Singapore experience. I went at night which gave if a really amazing atmosphere as there is lighting. However, the lighting is not strong enough to light everything so going at sunset would allow you the best of both worlds."
,,Beautiful enclosed dome for flower viewing,5.0,,This dome houses flowers from all over the world. They are beautiful! The garden is divided into areas from around the world and is handicapped friendly.
,,a glimpse of wonderland,5.0,,"It was so cool to get the feeling you are in another world. every corner of it has a theme. It was very smart , genius and refreshing Great way to spend your mornings."
,,"Great displays and nice and cool, but you soon get round it.",4.0,,"I downloaded the free app to help me with plant identification which was good but very, very limited. It tracked where I was and told me about the area, but the plant lists were too small. I was amused to see Australia classed as having a ""Mediterranean"" climate and some of the amusing but completely incorrect facts about the country. Having said that, I also learned a few things.
We hit the last day of the Christmas display which was cute.
The cacti displays I found fascinating and I saw plants I did not even know existed.
It was busy but the place accommodates many people, so it didn't feel cramped. However we beat the daily cruise crowd in, so I cannot guarantee that they don't make a big difference.
I left wishing it was a bit bigger, but I accept that is unrealistic. Maybe I was just enjoying it too much?"
,,One of the best Flower Dome ever seen,5.0,,It is in the Gardens by the Bay area and is a not to be missed place .. Lovely collections of flowers ... Well maintained too .. must visit for nature lovers
,,Good collection,4.0,,"While this may not be as good as the Cloud forest in the Gardens by the bay, in its own this is also a marvellous place. If you have time, please do visit this after Cloud forest. Great displays awesome collection. Time worth spent"
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,A breathtaking display of tropical flowers housed in a stunning glass house. Walkways wind through the building offering vistas from different angles.
,,The flowers were not as fresh,2.0,,"It was my 4th time to visit and quite dissapointed with the flowers. It was not as fresh as usual, was informed that 2 days after they will close the garden due to maintenance."
,,"Impressively large conservatory, worth the visit",5.0,,"Whilst it helps to be 'into plants' this is an impressive attraction in its own right, and unless you are particularly anti things like this, make sure you pop in. The ancient olive trees and tasteful sculptures and art set this apart from a normal botanical garden experience. If you are doing both (which you should) do this one before cloud forest as it lacks the impact, but is beautiful and relaxing. Al at 'leavetoroam.com'."
,,very cool inside,4.0,,"very good selection of global plants, well laid out pathway and accessible for all. Good views looking back to Singapore City, Flyer etc"
,,Great variety,5.0,,As someone who doesn't care for flowers I was expecting to not enjoy this dome however I was happy to be proven wrong. The flowers are beautiful and there is great variety. There are different gardens and each one holds native plants to that area or theme. It is easy to get around and you can get some brilliant photos.
,,Architecturally Beautiful,5.0,,"Housed in an amazing building, the flower dome is really worth visiting. When I visited it was just in the midst of changeover for the display from Christmas to Chinese New Year, so didn't see a full display. Still the other gardens are amazing - my favourite was the succulent gardens which had succulents from all over the world. I had never seen many of the varieties that were there. Really enjoyed my visit. Think this place is good for all ages. Also you can hire wheelchairs if you have elderly parents who can't walk."
,,Beautiful and airy,5.0,,"The under-glass area is spectacular and provides a welcome break from the weather if it’s raining. Lots of flowering plants to see. In line with my own heritage, I particularly liked the South African garden with some unusual streptocarpus and clivia varieties. The Chinese garden was hosting the temporary seasonal dahlia exhibit which was lovely. The cactus and baobab section is well done. Good sign boards with interesting information. 60-90 minutes well spent. Get your hand stamped with a re-entry stamp on the way out and come back after dark when the light shows elsewhere are lighting up the sky."
,,nature under glass,5.0,,"its the best garden setting and presentation in the world, you can enjoy it rain, heat, , its made to observe, relax, clean, safe. beautiful"
,,great,5.0,,Nice and relaxing walking round seeing all the different flowers and plants from around the world being preserved
,,Sci-fi place,5.0,,Visit these structures in the evening when they do a light show. It feels like the set for a sci-fi movie.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I am not usually a ""flower"" person so I was very surprised by how much I appreciated the Flower Dome. I was fortunate to visit in the lead up to Christmas and the place was decked out with poinsettias creating a floor of colour underneath beautiful Christmas trees.

Just check opening times as the Flower Dome does close for maintenance regularly."
,,Gorgeous array of flowers and other plant species,5.0,,"This is one of two domes to visit at the Gardens By The Bay. Visit this dome first, then make your way to the Cloud Forest dome (I wrote a separate review of that). This is one of the best botanical gardens I have seen and the fact that it is located inside a spectacular dome offering amazing views of its surroundings is even more enticing. If you can only do one thing in Singapore, visit the Gardens by the Bay."
,,mesmerising,5.0,,the place is fabulous and well laid out...lot of learning for the children..makes the experience enriching
,,a must see in singapore,5.0,,absolutly amazing displays of flowers and you need at least two hours to cover everything we were lucky to be there over christmas and the displays were wonderful
,,Beautiful display of flora and fauna,5.0,,"One of the highlights of my recent Singapore trip. The Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay is a must visit! Beautiful display, perfect photo opportunity as well as air conditioning!"
,,Nice if you are nature lover,4.0,,Well maintained gardens. I found cloud forest better than Flower dome. This can be visited. Try not to spend more time at this place.
,,Great spot when the weathers not,4.0,,Wonderfull display of trees and plants from around the world... from cacti to kauri ..we were blown away by the diversity . This place is a credit to the vision of Singapore’s ongoing commitment of its leaders to create a clean green city. Well done.
,,Four seasons experience ..all in Flower Dome!,5.0,,"We frequently visit Flower Dome and every season, there is a certain theme and flowers are either exotic, rare or abundance!"
,,Stunning Architecture a must see whilst in Singapore,4.0,,We visited the flower dome yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by the short queue to buy entrance tickets. The dome is cooled by air conditioning inside making the experience pleasant to enjoy. There is lots to see here if you are into horticulture. Kids may find it a little on the dull side. Adults will love this. There is a restaurant within the dome. No food or drink to be consumed inside the dome except in the restaurant. There are also restrooms inside the dome. A proper look at this place will take up to two hours of your time.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Spent 2 hours here and could go back again tomorrow. Huge variety of colours shapes and textures. Suitable for all ages.
,,Excelent,5.0,,After cloud dome a stop and drink we walked through. Excelent. After we walked back to Raffles City just got to cover when heavens opened up.
,,Amazing for all ages,5.0,,"The Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay is an amazing experience. Climate controlled and so perfect for a hot humid day, the exhibits are a wide range of beautiful plants in a stunning and innovative display. Even to an 11 and 12 year old the experience was interesting and engaging.

Very inspiring with a stack of ideas for the gardening fan and just stunning and fun for everyone."
,,Nice,4.0,,Overall nice. Cosy place and lot to see. Lot of peoples during festive season. Xmas display are nice
,,Stunning,5.0,,This place is pure magical. The flowers from all around the world and the interiors give it a fairyland appearance. Definitely worth visiting. Redeem your Singapore Airlines boarding pass to get a discount.
,,Beautiful displays of flowers,5.0,,We were lucky enough to visit while the Christmas displays were still there. Just stunning. The different gardens representing countries around the globe are spectacular. There were a lot of people there but it didn't feel overcrowded or rushed.
,,Stunning!,4.0,,"This place is similar to the Cloud Forest, however its designed horizontally instead of vertically. Loosely clustered into different environments, the sprawl takes you all over the world. Keep an eye out for the driftwood sculptures placed throughout the exhibit - I personally loved them the best."
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,The collection of plants in the Dome is amazing. A credit to the designers and the workers. The Dome was clean and the signage was easy to read and also easy to navigate.
,,Green and phantastic exhibition,5.0,,"I watched the autumn exhibition with a lot of interesting plants, orange figures regarding Haloween. This beautiful flower dome is made with lots of love. G o and visit it!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It was so beautiful and interesting, well set up with so many kinds of plants. Amazing place and deserve to be visited again. with the ticket allow for re-entry on the same day, suggest to visit it during daylight and night time."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit if you enjoy plants and trees. They have them grouped by countries/regions. Everything is labelled so you can learn about the various species. The flowers are beautiful. Everything is immaculately maintained. Great photo opportunities. The Field of Flowers changes with the seasons or festivals such as Chinese New Year, Easter, Xmas, etc. really lovely. It is cool inside with places to sit down if you get tired. I have visited several times and enjoyed it each time."
,,Too many man-made objects,3.0,,"I expect more natural flowers or plants in an enclosed and climate-controlled environment. However, I find wooden, metal and plastic objects everywhere. I spend only 15 minutes and leave although I have to paid for the entrance fee."
,,"Good, but not great",4.0,,"If you are buying tickets for Gardens by the Bay, they give you single entry passes to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest together. Go to the Flower domes first. They are full of beautiful flowers and trees. It is very cool inside and there are a lot of great backgrounds to click photos in.
When I went, Halloween was approaching, so the deco was all themed. Christmas might be much better.
You can roam about here for an hour at max. Would not suggest spending more time here. There are much better places to see other than this. The cloud forest and the Supertree grove are better options."
,,Very Good attraction,4.0,,Although it is a bit touristy it is a very good attraction to have a walk. As it is in an indoor environment there is not that sense of being in a real garden
,,Must see,5.0,,"Really enjoyed walking around the flower dome, so many themes and all sorts of different plants trees and flowers. We were visiting mid November, so there was a Christmas theme happening too."
,,beauty in an oasis,5.0,,Amidst the hustling bustlung city lies the gardens by the bay and in that we have the beautiful flower dome. where flowers from.all over the world are on display. its beautiful. must see must do
,,Ok...but outdoor garden is better...,2.0,,"Ok experience, i think not really worth it to pay money for it, when I visit the Christmas decorations still there where make people feel the atmospheres, I cannot imagine without the festive decoration the place will become very dull n boring."
,,Not too impressive,3.0,,"The Flower a Dome was nice, but no better than any other botanical garden in any other city. The National Orchid Garden is a much better choice to see."
,,Essential part of Gardens by the bay visit,4.0,,It is a must visit place even if you don’t have special interest in botanic. It is crowded at the weekends.
,,Impressive array of plants and environments.,5.0,,"A great way to spend some time studying plants from all over the world. Climate controlled and easy to navigate, the plant descriptions could be a little better. Best to visit during the week as the weekends are full of families and very busy."
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,"At this time of the year they have the Christmas theme. There are a multitude of Christmas trees, Santa house and other displays. Going at night will allow you to see it all lit up with the sparkle of Christmas lights. There is plant life from all over the world, laid out in a very nice manner. Amongst the plants are numerous sculptures, some large, some small. For the price of the entry fee, I think it is worth it. Once inside everything is on an angled walkway, therefore, catering for those with wheelchairs or prams. There are toilets inside as well."
,,Good but kind of lacked the wow factor.,3.0,,"This may sound so foolish but because of the name, I was expecting to see lots of flowers. Don't get me wrong, there were but I guess I just thought there would be more AND that you would see general progression of changing of plants. Don't go in expecting peace and quiet or an ambience of calm. It is noisy."
,,Exotic,5.0,,You may experience different places and different countries having different kinds of flowers. My kids love it and its comfortable cos its in the air conditioned place.
,,"For tourists, VERY expensive!",4.0,,"Tourists pay more than locals to visit this attraction, which is very sad and unfair as most tourists earn a LOT less than the average Singaporean. The Flower Dome boasts an assortment of flora and is managed well. It's cool inside and less crowded than it is outdoors. I have visited this attraction thrice and it has not disappointed (except for the price). Most recently the theme was Christmas, because it was just that season. The fake snow was there, the letters to Santa were ever present and the unwrapped boxes beneath the displays enticed the imagination and excited the children.
My focus was, however, on the immaculately landscaped gardens and healthy flowers that gave my macro lens reason to dance, sing and be merry... ho, ho, ho! If you have the time and the MONEY for this attraction, Go, Go, Go!"
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"You get to see unique variety of flora and fauna, washroom facilities available. you can get combined ticket of cloud forest and flower dome together."
,,Spectacular and Innovative,5.0,,"Its Awesome! Replicating the cool and dry Mediterranean climate, Flower Dome showcases exotic plants from five continents which are displayed in nine different Gardens. Wander amongst thousand-year-old olive trees and unusual Baobabs as you take in sights of the Flower Field Display."
,,Incredible,5.0,,The whole area is a must. Flower Dome was lush and well maintained. Kids can roam fairly unrestricted. We also spent hours roaming the parklands where the domes are. Haven't seen anything like this before.
,,Flower Dome Singapore,5.0,,"Please do not miss the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest when visiting Singapore. Even if you hate plants this is just an awe inspiring spectacle to witness from an engineering perspective.
The plant diversity is bewildering but if you take the audio tour (SG $4)you will definitely learn a few things."
,,Part of GbtB - must see,5.0,,The second of the two Domes which you pay to enter in Gardens by the Bay. A must see stop for any visitor. There is a lovely coffee shop / cafe in the Flower Dome
,,Flowers 😍,5.0,,"I have been here in summers (last 4 pics) and in winters (first 5 pics) and I loved summer presentation more - more variety and colors! In winter the Xmas and snow themed arrangement was nice too.

At one time, there was a private party inside the hall in the dome and was too much crowded but otherwise it’s always been nicer place to visit. Smell of flowers, temperature moderated environment and wheel chair/stroller friendly."
,,Superb,5.0,,A must visit spot... awsome place. Full of nature gift. Recommended to visit it at night. Kids will enjoy it.
,,visit on december,4.0,,I went to this place in December and i’m very happy because a lot of Christmas decorations that add the beauty of this place. many people come to take pictures on various sides.
,,"Average, underwhelmed after visiting the excellent Cloud Forest Dome and stunning Supertree Grove",3.0,,"After visiting the truly excellent Cloud Forest dome and stunning Supertree Grove, both also at the Gardens by the Bay, was somewhat underwhelmed by the Flower Dome. Although large and well maintained it seamed to lack any kind of uniqueness and I usually like Botanical Garden type attractions, although the area with the Boabab trees and Cactus plants was quite nice. It probably didn't help that the area was overly made up to look ""Christmassy"" which made it appear too gaudy for my liking.

The fact that I only have a couple of photos, both of the Baobab Tree area, probably sums the place up."
,,Very well executed but botanically unexceptional,3.0,,"Pros: great air conditioning; dining and snack options available; downhill sloping design; multiple paths; some diversity in the flora on view; cute sculptures.

Cons: one controlled environment so limited in biodiversity range; lack of exceptional / unusual plant specimens made up for by previously mentioned sculptures; despite the name, this is more about plants than flowers; very crowded of course and pushy competition to take the same photos.

Maybe see it if you have never been to a botanical garden. If you have, unlikely to be surprised by anything new."
,,Mini world,5.0,,Flower dome of Singapore provides a glimpse of amazing diversity of plants and flower found in different parts of the world.
,,Nice evening in Singapore's Garden by the Bay,4.0,,"I spent an evening in the Gardens by the Bay and visited the Flower Dome, among other attractions. It is quite nice but not overwhelming. My recommendation: When going to Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, go there first since the Cloud Forest is more impressive."
,,Nice visit but not too impressed,3.0,,It is nice and cooler than outside but I was not very impressed. I had seen most of the flowers and plants before. Kept thinking how much nicer it was to visit the Botanic Gardens. If you have to choose one of the two domes then visit the Cloud Forest instead. I found it much more interesting.
,,Mr B .Perkins,5.0,,"The Flower dome is well worth going to .Heaps to see and be amazed at .Hard to describe , it is so well designed."
,,Around the world in a dome,5.0,,"Divided into sections showcasing plants unique to different countries, I was astounded by the size of the West Australian grass trees, bigger than any I've seen at home, but there was no denying the truly ancient olive trees in the Mediterranean section. It's a wonderful educational tool for all ages and an amazing horticultural achievement, best seen when you are not tired."
,,Amazing place.,5.0,,"If you like plants and flowers, this place is hard to beat. Huge diversity, very cool trails. Combine your visit with the amazing Marina Bay Sands across the street."
,,Unique and wonderful experience,5.0,,"Together with the Bay Gardens and the Cloud Forest, this completes a very special and unique trio of attractions. The sheer size and the designs of the various layouts make this a very pleasant way to spend a complete day. Do not rush - take your time - the experience offers a fantastic opportunity to view plants in a very new and different way and allows for great photo's."
,,Garden to be visited,4.0,,Nice place to relax your eyes.. Lots of flowers colorful.. Sit talk chit chat relax enjoy the garden.. Take snaps.. This will be enjoyed most with family visit.. Specially Seniors..
,,A place for pleasure and educating,5.0,,"The place is amazingly beautiful with a superb plants nursing, and it’s good for family, especially young children to learn more about plants."
,,Cherry Blossoms,5.0,,One of the best reason i come there is to see cherry blossoms. Wowww it have nice smell mix with all the flower.
,,Lapland @ Gardens on 09Dec17.,5.0,,"We visited Flower Dome for the Poinsettia Wishes floral display. It is a lovely site with outstanding flowers arrangement that make you feel delighted. What's good for us is this place is disabled friendly for our 2 wheelchair elderly. Only one thing that's lacking in our interest is the northern lights display that appear on a narrow long screen. It should be on a wider panel so that they look huge and more interesting and beautiful as we've seen them in the arctic. Overall, it's a happly outings for us in this wonderful place."
,,Worth a look,3.0,,"Reasonably priced, we got a dual ticket for both domes, the flower dome was well set out, the only sad thing was, they were setting displays up for Christmas and we wouldn't be there to see them, well worth going in."
,,Worthwile visit,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit and exceeded my expectations. I certainly enjoyed learning about a variety of flowers etc
,,"If you love flowers, this is for you.",4.0,,We enjoyed our walk around the flower dome. We visited during the Christmas period so this made it more interesting for us with all the Christmas trees and Christmas music. It's nice to walk around and see the different plants and an escape from the busy city. I don't really know much about plants but I imagine that if you do this would be a place of great interest to you.
,,Good place to check out while you are in Singapore,3.0,,"The flower dome is located opposite the cloud forest. However when it compares to cloud forest, it doesn't surprise me. The flower species is very limited. However it is a good place for family to visit, especially when you are coming with kids."
,,Beautiful indoor flower garden,5.0,,The garden was really beautiful..lots of beautiful flowers and... its ver cool inside. The wooden statues was just amazing. Overall it was beautiful to stay inside for couple of hours.
,,Flowers of the world...,5.0,,What an eclectic sight ... a huge dome with a show of flowers of all continents... Many were such that we had not seen even on net. It looks beautiful anytime of the day.
,,Alright,3.0,,"Came here anticipating something spectacular and thought it was just average/slightly above average. But again I come from a place where gardens are gorgeous so my expectations might have been a bit high.

The good: There were a variety of different species many of which were beautiful. The decorations inside the flowerbeds (i.e. Winnie the Pooh) made it more fun. The lovely Christmas decorations definitely enhanced the experience.

The bad: This place attracts loads of tourists, many of which seem to come in only to take pictures with the flowers instead of enjoying the experience. Some are rude and obnoxious but that's not the fault of flower dome."
,,A feast for the eyes,5.0,,Lovely concept. Beautifully and interestingly laid out. Entering this giant conservatory with lush foliage then progressing to the dry climes vegetation was a delight. It was also botanically interesting in the detail of planting rather than just the overall impact.
,,Family trip to Spore,5.0,,Beautiful place! We love it. It's near Christmas & New Year and they have nicely decorated the flower dome accordingly to the festive! Nice!
,,Enchanting,5.0,,"If you love gardens, this is a place you must . Well maintained and well arranged. The christmas decorations are a real beauty. Worth every penny."
,,Vacation,4.0,,A well organized and good arrangement to see floral around the world according to the season. However not all staff had good knowledge on floral. Maybe the reason is more economic learner the floral students. Its good to see such a good arrangement of floral.
,,Air conditioning after walking the Gardens,4.0,,You get a good price to see these and cloud forest. See these first since the Cloud Forest is over the top.
,,Pleasant,4.0,,Great display of flowers from all over the world. I was here in December so they had a Christmas theme happening.
,,Nice but not special,3.0,,It was nice to visit it but we have seen similar venues before and therefore for us it was nothing special.
,,Best for Flower Lovers,4.0,,This is an Indoor Glass dome with lots & Lots of Flower which they change according to season.. there were lots of pretty structures displayed in it as well.. it is a great place for some one who loves plants & flowers. i was there when they decorated the dome with halloween decorations.. Beautiful Stuctures & lots of flowers
,,Sakura festival,4.0,,"When i went there, it was on sakura festival. It was so pink and crowded but beautiful but i can't enjoy it much because of the crowd people which made me bumped into people when i walked. But the flowers were very beautiful and they always change the theme of the flower festival which makes it interesting"
,,This can also be named as Pumpkin Dome!!,3.0,,"I am specifically talking about Flower done here. This has lot of flowers but also, Pumpkins all over the place. The ticket price includes both flower dome, so you are not left with option to visit only one dome. Cloud forest is much better and good than Flower dome. If we had been given an option, we would have paid only for Cloud forest and seen the same."
,,Pretty flowers,3.0,,This dome was okay but a bit disappointing after being at Cloud Forest. Having said that it's worth going to atleast once to see the flowers and different gardens inside.
,,Visited the Flower Dome & the Cloud Forest,4.0,,"A great morning spent visiting the 2 conservatories which are very different.

The Flower Dome presents plants from various parts of the world arranged into their territory of origin. There are multiple pieces of art spread throughout the park - some ceramic or metal, but some of the timber items are incredible.

Wide paths make moving around easy & there are ramps or lifts as required.

I think this is a must do in Singapore."
,,If you miss this you are crazy.,5.0,,This place is so amazing and you need a whole day to do it all justice. The gardens are continually changing and having such a variety of themes keep it fresh and new so people can go more than once.
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,"Many flowers to see and beautiful christmas theme. Can take many photos of christmas spots

Tips:
- come when its a bit dark so you can see the christmas lights
- wear warm clothings. It can be a bit cold for some people.
- come on a weekday so its not too crowded."
,,Gorgeous and always dressed for the season,5.0,,"This is such a lovely area to take time and enjoy flora from around the world. They always dress it up for the local festival (CNY, Diwali, Christmas, etc.) so there's something new to see each time you go."
,,Seeing the botanic of the world,5.0,,There's a vast selection of botanic imported around the world. Exhibitions is changed quarterly there's always variety to see when you visit the place.
,,All decked out for Christmas...,5.0,,We really enjoyed our visit to the special place. We loved that it has themed areas. A great place to spend some 'cool' time. YMMV
,,Interesting enough but not outstanding,3.0,,We were spoilt by the nearby attractions so this felt a little underwhelming the plants were very familiar it was aimed at a Mediterranean climate so for those who did not hail from these regions would find it interesting
,,Visit to Flower Dome,4.0,,I bought a package ticket at S$28 for entrance to Flower Dome & Cloud Forest. Flower Dome worth the price. It is quite cold in the dome. Do bring a cardigan.
,,Technology & nature,5.0,,Another beautiful venue within the Gardens by the Bay. It's worth buying a joint ticket to cover this & the Cloud Forest. It was decorated for Halloween while we were there & very attractive.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is worth a visit some gorgeous flowers and plants and while we were there they had Christmas themes which was lovely. Definately worth a visit
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"Part of the gardens by the bay, this is a closed dome with vareities of flowers set all around the world. Beautifully designed and maintained. Take out sufficient time to walk through them and if you love botany then you are in the right place. Have fun"
,,#unimpressed,2.0,,"my wife and i are avid travellers. we are also expats who have spent the last decade living in the middle east, so we really appreciate things like rain, and flowers. maybe it was the time of year we visited (december) but i was unimpressed. it was 2 levels of cactus and one level of a ""christmas"" theme. if you can, check ahead to see what the arrangements are before you buy tickets."
,,Pleasantly surprised - a must see,5.0,,"Most tour guides suggested that the Flower Dome should be visited. Although I'm not a mad flora fan, our family visited this site and we were not disappointed. The various species of flowers and plants and the way they were presented was amazing and incredible. It is a photographers dream. All in all, we were highly impressed and we enjoyed the visit immensely"
,,Awesome,5.0,,What a fabulous place to go the flowers were amazing it took my breathe away its a must see place to go to
,,The themes are always changing and interesing,5.0,,"I loved the dome this time I visited. I always go here in Singapore to see the changing themes. This time it was Autumn and the pumpkin festival. As many Asians have not heard or seen of pumpkins it was interesting to talk to them, We are used to them in the west but have not seen so many varieties. So clever were the amazing displays..
Lovely to stroll around to see different plants in every corner."
,,Flowers everywhere,5.0,,"In an air conditioned dome you can see the display of many kind of flowers, when it is the season you can also display of tulips."
,,Flowers diversity,4.0,,you can see all the diversity of the flowers under a Dome. This a good experience and you can also visit in the same day the Cloud Forest as the Other Dome is near.
,,It was okay,3.0,,"It was okay. I am not a huge plant or flower person, but I would recommend the Cloud Forest instead. It was much better."
,,Nice,3.0,,"It was good, but visiting it after the cloud dome, it was a second. Arrays of flowered plants arranged nicely..."
,,Eh,3.0,,"It was very pretty, if you're visiting the Gardens by the Bay, I'd recommend the cloud forest instead. This was really just flowers and plants but the cloud forest was an experience."
,,A Place for Flower Varieties ...,5.0,,"This is part of teh Garden Bay Area .. You have to be there if you like to know and see lots of varieties of flowers ,, Though i am not much into it , but frankly saw lots of varieties never heard or seen ever .. Once in a lifetime expierence .. must visit"
,,Magnigicent Garden,4.0,,"A Balm For Frayed Nerves and Senses! Magnificent! From The Collection Of Exotic Orchids, The Cacti And Succulent Sections, Insect Eating Plants, Not to Mention The Composite Figure Of a Person Made of Different Vegetables and Fruits, etc. These are just a few Sights that Entice Anyone who Visits the Place! I Definitely Recommend it as a part of the Itinerary When Touring Singapore!"
,,Well presented,5.0,,"Really well presented display of plants/trees from around the world, Visted in med November and currently has a christmas theme in centre which was great"
,,Fantastic flower dome,5.0,,"We arrived almost at opening time to avoid the crowds and had the place mostly to ourselves. The plants and flowers were breathtaking. Hard to take in all the abundant vegetation - but this was one of those times where you just said ‘wow’
Don’t miss this"
,,Wonderland,4.0,,"This place is out of this world!
The size of some of the trees in there is amazing.
There is a Alice in Wonderland themed section which is cute. Also wood carvings of dragons, birds, owls everywhere but you need to look for them as they are so well done.
There was a Christmas setup when we were there which would be great for the kids to see, so pretty at night all lit up.
Lots of cacti, agaves and some really pretty flowers in the bottom section.
There are country themed gardens such as Australia and South America.
We went with a baby and stroller and it was easy to get around"
,,There are no flowers!!,1.0,,"When you say flower dome..You go there expecting to see some flowers, we only saw cactus. Maybe it was an off season when I went, giving them a benefit of doubt. But a very disappointing experience. Would recommend you skip it if you are short of time.!"
,,Not many flowers,2.0,,"I was so disappointed. Not many flowers, it is more a plant dome. The area with sukkulent is great, but the rest not really worth it. The flower Field was replaced by Christmas exhibition. Go to Forest Dome instead. Entrance to both cost 28 SGD for one adult. Opens at 9am and closes at 9 pm. Tickets at park entrance or at the domes. The domes are 10 minutes walk from the park entrance. Or you can pay 3 SDG to take a shuttle There."
,,So Amazing garden,5.0,,I was great moment and i really love the garden. Nice place and i took a lot of pictures. The flowers dome overall is so pretty. Love the flowers and they are looked beautifuls.
,,Spectacular Flower Display,5.0,,"The Flower Dome in Gardens by the Bay is an amazing display of flowers, plants and trees from all over the world. It is in an air conditioned dome which offers a nice respite from the heat and humidity of Singapore. Take your time and enjoy the spectacular floral displays which are like none other in the world. If you are there before Christmas you will also enjoy a Christmas themed display of flowers, decorations and music."
,,Amazing greenhouse - air conditioned beautiful flower display,5.0,,"Visited here for 90 minutes in October, 2017. Very impressed with the comfortable air conditioned dome, filled with amazing plants from around the world. The displays are meticulously laid out and there are many amazing driftwood sculptures within each area. We were blown away by the colorful fall display, sculpture, art and floral areas. Look for other surprise displays. When we were there, they had a nice Cinderella's coach display, and an area for Halloween (slightly scary but fun!) displays. This is a must see for Singapore - one of many highlights of our trip."
,,Flower garden under the dome,4.0,,"The garden is full of flowers, plants and trees placed in sections sorted by geographic locations (like Africa, Australia etc). There are loads to see including several nice wooden statues placed between the plants. There was also a Christmas theme in the garden."
,,"A lovely place to visit, full of unusual tropical flowers and trees",5.0,,"Well laid out, some superb wooden sculptures, unusual trees. They were getting the dome ready for Christmas, rather weird to walk round looking at artificial snow and Christmas trees in the middle of the tropics, but it was a lovely site and very well done."
,,Christmas theme lets it down,3.0,,Having previously been to the National Orchid Garden and the Cloud Forest our expectations were high. Although the dome is well organised with themed areas for different parts of the world the Christmas influence detracted from the quality.
,,Very impressive,5.0,,This is an interesting place to visit with so many different species of plants. It is very clever how they have laid everything out.
,,Winter wonderland in sunny Singapore,4.0,,"My numerous visits to Gardens by the Bay Flower Dome, this time w/ the Christmas theme all the way from Finland. Beautifully decorated centrepiece and great detailing to recreate a real Xmas feel. Def worth a visit even if you have been to the Dome before."
,,Paradise of flowers,5.0,,"The area is not so big,but the landscape and the setting is very good and beautiful.Various kinds of amazing flowers around the world, was grouped and located properly.One-way walk made it easily to see all of them. It's a strikingly attractive tourist's place."
,,Astonishing but not the best!,4.0,,"Fantastic and spectacular without any doubts, but I honestly prefered way more the botanic gardens. But don't get me wrong. This place with adjacent ""cloud forest"" is a must-see attraction of Singapore. It takes 2-3 hours to see the entire complex."
,,"Exciting, and peaceful",5.0,,"Garden with flowers from around the world. Some smells good,some doesn't. The plants are beautiful, and no regret to visit here."
,,Expected more ... not really worth the entrance fee,2.0,,"After the worth-the-money Cloud Dome, we went to the Flower Dome and were disappointed. Okay, there are some nice flowers there. But since Christmas season already started, and with decoration and music, it felt more like in a shopping mall (or the space between shopping malls) than an actual first-class tourist attraction. Hence, would not spend money to go there."
,,Ok attraction to kill time,3.0,,If deciding on cloud garden or flower dome this can be missed. Quite pricey to enter given you're looking at plants and a man made botanical garden in air conditioning. Currently has a Christmas exhibition.
,,Worth every penny,5.0,,"Impressive. Beautiful colours, you can spend hours strolling around different flowers, trees and decorations. Many benches and areas to sit for those who need to rest from time to time. Children will also have great time running around. Don't get lost!"
,,Great flowers,4.0,,"Well arranged and thought out. Beautiful gardens, but a bit small for the price. It’s about an hour worth of activity in the dome. But the grounds are very nice and free to explore."
,,A must visit flower dome.,5.0,,Many never seen before plants and flowers from around the world. A must visit and they will also change their flowers from time to time so you will not see the same flowers twice.
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,If you are a flower lover then this is a prefect place for you to see in Singapore. One of the most attractive tourist spot in Singapore. You should also include the cloud forest and gardens by the bay since it's in the same place.
,,Overrated.,3.0,,"This was rather disappointing. Except for the lovely trees (olice, bottle, baobab, etc) this dome felt more like the hallways of a high-end shopping mall than the flower dome we had expected. Rather go wander in the great Botanical Gardens, unless you need to be in an air-conditioned ""nature"" setting."
,,Superb,5.0,,"The visit to the Flower Dome was a memorable experience. There were enough provision for seating if one gets tired. This was helpful for my elderly parents.

The climate inside the Flower Dome is a replica of the cool dry Mediterranean climate. Flowers from various parts of the world like South Africa, Central Chile, California, South West Australia and Mediterranean basin, are grown in the Flower Dome. Particularly fascinating is the thematic flower field display. Look out for typical Mediterranean plants.

Opening & Closing Time : 9 am to 9 pm

Ticket price was reasonable (when clubbbed with Cloud forest)"
,,Christmas decorations,4.0,,"Came back here on the weekend, this time with the kids and made use of our recently acquired gardens membership to visit the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Both domes are good options on a rainy day in Singapore and the kids seemed to enjoy it (although it can be a little cold inside the Flower Dome). Christmas decorations are now in place which also helps to keep the kids entertained."
,,Boring Halloween themed pumpkin exhibits,2.0,,"As tourist, we had no cholce but to buy the combined flower dome and cloud forest ticket for $28. Locals have the option of buying either for only $10 each but as tourists, it was both or nothing. Well, Cloud Forest was worth its half but Flower Dome was a huge disappointment. We spent maybe 30-45 minutes, and that was the fastest we could walk through the place. We visited early October so we were treated to exhibits after exhibits of pumpkins. There were exhibits of flowers from various continents but they were boring. On the scale of 1 to 10, if Bouchart Gardens in Victoria is a 10, flower dome is a 2. Wished we could have bought only the Cloud Forest ticket, but then, they probably would get very few people to visit Flower Dome."
,,This is an amazing indoor garden,5.0,,"First, give yourself a few hours to tour Gardens by the Bay. Second, take at least two of those hours to visit the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, both of which are indoor climate controlled gardens.
The Flower Dome will teach you about tropical flora while you enjoy a walking stroll through wonderful gardens. There are seasonal themes, so you could return a couple times each year and have new experiences.
This is a child friendly venue, for those with kids."
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"Don’t miss this one out, if you go in flower dome and cloud dome you get a special price. Both are well worth visiting."
,,Nice Christmas decorations,3.0,,Gorgeous Christmas decorations but Hardly enjoyable with the cold inside. Wear warm or bring a jacket recommended.
,,Beautiful,3.0,,"I am not usually a big flower/plant person but as my colleague wanted to visit I agreed to go along and I am glad I did... really beautiful place!

Nice place to walk around for an hour or so and bonus is that it's air conditioned so on a very hot day was also a good escape from the heat!"
,,Really well thought out,5.0,,This was part of the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. I'd recommend going in the early afternoon to allow time to see both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest before the evening show of the Super tree grove. It was pretty and the night we were there the sunset was spectacular to give us some brilliant pics.
,,Pleasant attraction,4.0,,"A nice thing to do on an evening in Singapore. The Flower Dome is air-conditioned, easy to access and provides an interesting array of plant-life from direct area of the globe."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Love this place ! Have seen it in most seasons now. Just saw the Autumn show, try to see Summer ! The tulips are amazing !"
,,Very nice,4.0,,Very nice place. You can stay 2 or 3 hours and have really good time. Very interesting especially if you love flowers
,,Diwali visit,4.0,,"excellent tour of flower garden, provided you are a nature lover. The whole area is so beautiful, specially colorful at night"
,,Wonderful place to visit,5.0,,"As a part of the Gardens by the Bay, this is a wonderful place to visit. It is packed full with the most beautiful plants from around the world that are so well displayed with lots of wooden sculptures. The Christmas scenes were well underway when we visited that added to the spectacle."
,,So many plants!,4.0,,"Great place to visit if you want a whistle-stop tour of all the major (and some lesser known) plants of the various eco-systems in the world. From Australia to the deserts of Africa, they have most of it here. It's air-conditioned too, so very comfortable and you can easily spend 2-3 hours here. They have placed benches and seats around too, so that you can take a break when your legs get weary."
,,Worth during the day,3.0,,"It is nice to see the succulent and the baobab, but this is nothing extraordinary. We received free access from eating at Pollen restaurant and I wouldn't like to pay to enter. It is ok indoor garden"
,,Not impressive,3.0,,"I went on the wrong time as they were about to close for maintenance. Some plants were not ready for display, causing some areas in this attraction were closed. I like the cloud forest better.."
,,Fantastic pumpkins,5.0,,"It was still pumpkin time and they were fantastic, and all real, unbelievable, they were setting up Christmas, , seem so many different plant s from all over the world, the pointsetia's fantastic so red and all kind of colours even pink!!"
,,Prefered cloud forest but loved it too.,4.0,,If you're a foreigner then you can only buy a ticket to enter the flower dome and cloud forest which for the price is a bargain. However whilst we spent 2hrs in cloud forest we did the flower dome in about 30-45mins. It is beautiful too and the autumn display of pumpkins was gorgeous we just prefered cloud forest. But for the price they are a bargain and must do in Singapore.
,,Amazing structure,5.0,,A huge climate controlled dome beautifully landscaped inside with a wealth of flowers and plants. A must see in Singapore.
,,Highlight in Singapore,5.0,,Highly recommend this site. We completed our visit by a meal at the Chinese Restaurant. Try the lychee liqueur served with iced lemon tea. I do not particularly like alcohol but this was refreshing.
,,Stunning,4.0,,The Flower Dome was a big hit with our family! The dome was very vibrant and there was lots of photo opportunities.
,,Beautiful Garden! Wonderful!,5.0,,"Very nice garden! Recently had an exhibition of pumpkin of abundant varieties! Neatly decorated with different flowers and vegetables! Amazing place! A must in Singapore! It’s great if you could find an exhibition! We had tulips, Gladiolus and now pumpkin! Check website often to get the information!"
,,Gardeners Paradise.,5.0,,We were lucky enough to experince the Orchid Extranaganza while we were here. The gardens are amzaing and very well kept. The flowers were amazing. Can we very ht in the sunlight. Walking is at your own pace and is wheelchair / stroller friendly should that be a requirement you have.
,,Stunning display,5.0,,Excellent display of flora and fauna from around the world. Easily accessible and well laid out for a comfortable walk around the display area.
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"We visited on a hot day and the dome was refreshingly cool. Not only stunning flowers, but amazing works of art scattered about. Look for dragons, eagles and other creatures carved from wood or made from driftwood. Not to be missed. You do need to be reasonably fit as there is a lot of walking up gentle slopes."
,,Somewhere to get out if the heat and see some orchids,5.0,,"A great place to spend an hour or more taking in the gardens and tropical plants. If you're there when the ""misting"" of the plants happens then it's like being in a cloud at the top. Lots of walkways and interesting areas."
,,Don’t bother,2.0,,"We visited here after the botanical gardens and they weren’t a patch on them. It’s called the flower dome but there were more trees than anything. Very cold in there which is nice at first coming in from the heat but then take a jumper.
Considering you have to pay to get in (28 sgd for both conservatories) when the botanical gardens is free and 5 sgd for the orchid part it’s just not worth it.
The cloud forest is good but don’t pay to come in here it’s rubbish"
,,Worth a look,4.0,,We visited around Christmas time & the Dome was tastefully decorated for the Festive Season. It may seem a bit pricey but myself & my teenage son spent 2 hours in there & didn't realise we had been that long.
,,"Huge garden packed in a capsule, shows variety of plants and trees",4.0,,"A good place to visit if you love tress and flowers. Interiors are nicely done and a lot of pictures can be taken here. The time we visited they had decoration of Pumpkins and was very nicely done. Not sure if that was a permanent set-up or they change it as per the season. Visit the first floor to see huge variety of Cactus that you would have not seen ever in your life. On the exit, on your left and write side you have small windows, just peep in it and there are some nice videos that are played."
,,Wonderful Peaceful Place,5.0,,"Such a fantastic biosphere with countess plants trees and flowers as well as many sculptures. Wonderful and educational too,"
,,Flower Lovers Paradise,5.0,,"If you love flowers then this will be the one for you, This is the Mecca as far as flowers go too good to be true with the variety of flowers from different countries and towns."
,,Must Visit Garden,4.0,,"Flower Dome at Gardens By the Bay is a must visit to see the different flowers from across the world, it as a artificial climate set up to keep all the flowers."
,,Great variety of flowers and trees,5.0,,"Enchanting experience in the world of flowers and trees. I have been there second time this time the theme of Halloween is displayed on trees with plenty of pumpkins, previous experience a year ago was during Christmas and similar perfect experience with different theme."
,,Beautiful gardens.,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is one of the most spectacular gardens i have seen. It was interesting talking to some of the gardeners to find that a lot of them are volunteers, doing a magnificient job."
,,For the love of flowers,4.0,,"If you love flowers then this is the one, too good to be true with the variety of flowers from different countries and decorations with fruits and flowers are a treat to the eye..."
,,"Average, average and one more average",3.0,,"Just would repeat that ad nauseam. Anything remotely related to Gardens by the Bay and would give only that rating. Similar to the cloud forest, only there are different kinds of flowers and pumpkins (am not too sure they were real) here. Some from California, India, China and what not.
The place is awfully cold, perhaps the air-con is on testosterone. Be sure to carry something warm, especially for children and elderly."
,,Very pretty,5.0,,"If you dine at The pollen, you can have free entry. Flowers are very pretty. Aircon too cold. Bring a sweater. A must go"
,,Nice flower exhibition with cold weather maintenance,5.0,,We enjoyed this place with viewing decorations of flowers in various fashion. Halloween structure was also good. One can see heliconia and black flowers here. You can come back second time for night view. Good place at Garden by the bay.
,,This is the best display I have ever seen & it has air con T,5.0,,This is a must see if you are now in Singapore The Autumn Display is awesome and we have seen most of Singapore gardens Orchids gardens are good but I preferred this one No discount for seniors unless locals
,,One of the Best places,5.0,,Beautiful awesome good. First start your Singapore visit with flower dome.2-3 hrs is needed. Then you can visit cloud forest located nearby.
,,Acceptable,3.0,,"Although there are beautiful flowers here, the highlight is really the Cloud Forest. If you had to choose one, go to the Cloud Forest and skip this one."
,,Breatheless - Perfect for Everyone,5.0,,"What an Engineering feat. Left to your own to discover the wonderful plants, lots of seats if you want to just relax and take it all in. Great information to read and learn more. The waterfall so beautiful. Staff very pleasant."
,,Pretty but Tourist Trap,3.0,,Nice to see for a little while but it's crowded with tourists from all over and you need to pay to get in. Both worth it and not.
,,Part of the Garden by the Bay,5.0,,The garden made in a big green house is excellent and well maintained.. worth a visit by the tourists..
,,Perfect for All Ages,4.0,,Such a good place for family vacation as it is not only offering a tourist attraction but also a place to learn. Tickets for tourist is SGD 18. Went there by bus.
,,Excellent Tourist Destination,5.0,,"It is highly recommended for every one, very beautiful place and it is one destination where you are left at your own pace, there is no rush or people running around or queues."
,,When the humidity and cityscape gets too much,5.0,,"Take a delightful strolll in the cool , dry air of the flower dome. The gardens are pristine, I literally saw workers dusting underneath hanging plants and trimming imperfect leaves! There is also a delightful place to stop and have tea and cake, or a light lunch, surrounded by edible plants. The plants and sculptures are spectacular, my favorites are the ancient olive trees and the driftwood sculpture. Don’t miss it!"
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"If you have not visited the Flower Dome when in Singapore, you have missed out on a true visual delight. The variety and number of flowers here is amazing and for a flora enthusiast a real treat."
,,Great fun for a day,5.0,,It's a great way to escape the heat. Lots of exotic flowers in the dome. Ticket price is reasonable. Visit weekday for less crowd.
,,Excellent,5.0,,You must take a trip to the Flower Dome as its so tranquil and beautiful. There are so many different types of flowers and shrubs from all over the world and displayed off beautifully. If you are a nature lover a definite must visit
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"The floors, the artwork, the special celebration displays (October means Halloween) It's a must go, you'll regret it if you don't. Allow 2-3 hours , you won't regret it!"
,,Dome of Planting Efforts,4.0,,"It is incredible to see the amount of effort that put in into this Dome in planting large varieties of vegetation. The range of plants is simply amazing - from Africa to America, from desert to tropical, even including festive celebration, such as Halloween. Not a large compound, but interesting enough."
,,"Even if you dont like plants, it's still worth look",5.0,,The different types of plants they had here was really amazing. The size of some of the pumpkins was out of this world. Aircon inside and very comfortable walking around. Even if your not a plant person it is still very interesting.
,,Looks like Alice in Wonderland,3.0,,"This is indoors and air conditioned. It is flowers, shrubbery, and trees.

Most flora is from the Eastern and Southern Hemisphere, with a few Western Hempishere offerings.

The Hydrangeas are impressive.

There's nothing all that wrong with the gardens, just the tourists taking selfies every minute and blocking the beauty of the flowers and scenery made this a bit annoying. I also found it a bit too air conditioned for my liking.

If you were short on time and had to decide what to do, I would opt for the cloud forest, the super trees and walking around the gardens. Having said that, if you have not seen a wide variety of flowers from the southern or eastern hemisphere, it is worth visiting as everything is conveniently located under one roof...from proteas to hibiscus and various ficus trees.

You can purchase a ticket to do the flower dome and cloud forest.

I also found that it was a bit too manicured and disney-ish for my liking. Out of all the exhibits, this might be the most kid friendly as there is a lot of sensory overload."
,,I loved it,5.0,,I simply loved it. I felt like a young kid and I actually think this is a fantastic attraction for children and children-at-heart.
,,Great setup,5.0,,"A beatiful place to visit. Though book a combo plan online which is discounted with cloud forest. Good bluetooth based app drien explanations as u walk along.
People with allergies to pollen, like me, must cover their noses when entering else you will sneeze from the word go"
,,"Extraordinarily colorful,,,",4.0,,"Clock ticks and we will never notice that, it has crossed some hours of time,,, the colors and flowers, millions of green shades leave us in an awe,,,"
,,Pretty and arty,5.0,,We enjoyed the views. It had all the fairytale characters in amongst the plants. A really nice touch. Lovely to take in when you have a little extra time.
,,A nice few hours,5.0,,We spent a few hours walking round the flower dome relaxing in the cool environment and enjoying all the display on various plants. The pumpkins in the flower field were impressive!
,,Great place to spend a couple hours,5.0,,"Great things to see and so well assembled, this place is world class attraction. I highly recommend. All of the other sites in Gardens by the Bay are worthwhile as well."
,,All blooms,5.0,,It was late in the evening and I hope that's why the place was poorly lit. Flowers innumerable and grown in look alike terrains where they belong to was worth a watch. Videos on trees that did not catch fire and many more were really fascinating.
,,"One of the highlights of my trip...lvely arrangements, well tended garden types. Camera!",5.0,,"I didnt expect this display to be as well put together in such a limited space. So much crammed into the space, inclusive of cafe and the facilites were sort-of hidden by the foliage. Needs a few hours visit to appreciate."
,,Superb and air conditioned,5.0,,"This dome is well worth the visit, not only because it lets you escape from the heat (the dome is air conditioned), but also because it's fantastic, with lots of exotic plants and displays that will keep you occupied for hours. It can get a little crowded though during peak hours."
,,Nice Walk. Beautiful Flowers. Tourists must visit.,5.0,,"Review by Dr Sim. It is a Nice Walk. Beautiful Flowers. You must love flowers. Cool environment. It is like walking in the park in Europe. Tourists must visit. However, if you have walked in Europe in cool spring, you may not find it spectacular. Bring your own water. Regards Dr Sim"
,,ONLY FOR GARDENERS,1.0,,"What a Rip-Off , only for the truly Horticulturist types, we were disappointed in the so called attraction"
,,Some area under repair,3.0,,"No need a long time to round yhis dome. Actually it's evening time, and in the next 3 hours will be closed. Some area aren't clear enough to enter because it's under repair. All the colorful can't be seen clearly."
,,So many gardens of colour and variety,4.0,,So many gardens of colour and variety - beautiful varieties of flowers from different countries around the world with so much colour and beauty
,,indoor garden,5.0,,Various plant. Suitable place for family especially kids & flower lover. Every season has its own theme.
,,Beautiful and vibrant,5.0,,I love this place always when I visit. Will definitely recommend anyone to visit this place while you are in Singapore
,,Great,4.0,,This is a great place to visit while in Singapore. Lots to see plenty of walking so if you don't line to walk maybe it's not for you.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"This was a lovely attraction, as it's Halloween month it is all done up with pumpkins which really made me happy to see. The flowers are gorgeous and a lovely day out."
,,Jaw Dropping Structure!,5.0,,Beautifully made and the structure is jaw dropping. This place can be visited before the light and sound show and Gardens By the bay in evening to avoid long queues.
,,"Can look, cannot touch",4.0,,"In this cold indoor garden, you'll see beautiful plants and gorgeous installations. Just be aware, there is NOTHING for kids. Once we went there during Christmas, because in all the ads was an adorable merry-go-round. Guess what: the merry-go-round was just a decoration and I with my daughter were disappointed. I would say the Flower Dome is only for adults."
,,Flowers,4.0,,We went at night but I think daytime would be easier to see all of the plants details. We went after the light show
,,An interesting visit,4.0,,"This dome contains displays of various gardens world wide - Australian, Mediterranean, American etc. it also has a seasonal section which was Autumn while we were there. The main focus of that was a huge display of a large variety of pumpkins. Everything is beautifully maintained and lots of information is provided on the signs."
,,wounderfull,5.0,,"very nice place I recommend to visit specially if you like plant and flower, this place plant are changed depending on season we went on Halloween seasons."
,,beautiful environment to see plants that are not tropical but no flowers as such,4.0,,"called the flower dome so i expected orchids and tropical plants in flower. what was there was a magnificent dispaly of plants that were from other parts of the world tha singapore, plants from australia, south africa and europe so overall it is not a place for tourists visiting singapore. the botanical gardens are more specific to the singapore region. tourist pay more than locals to visit this place which is annoying. not a cheap visit!"
,,Is Singapore Icon,5.0,,The dome is a cool structure. Cool fresh flowers to feel tranquility. Must go attraction in Singapore
,,Pumpkins and they are real...,5.0,,I visited the dome last September and their theme for a month I think is Autumn Harvest Floral. I thought the pumpkins are just display but they used real props. I saw flowers and plants that I haven't seen before and it is amazing that they have put a lot of variety inside a dome. A must visit place.
,,Good but enjoyed the Cloud Forest more,4.0,,"We enjoyed our visit here today, but I thought the Cloud Forest was more stunning . This was more about trees and succulents and a lot from temperate areas similar to where we live-so I guess we see a lot either in our bush or as cultivars. I thought and the huge Autumn Harvest display seemed to take away from it all a bit too. Lovely and cool if you are looking to escape humid Singapore for a while."
,,Nice decorations although it felt like Halloween/Christmas exhibition,4.0,,"The flower dome is definitely better than the cloud forest but I have to say that it is pointless having an array of flowers/trees from all over the world without any descriptions on them. I came out not really knowing where the trees are from and what kind of temperatures they grow in and how they’re keeping them in an eternal spring.

The place looked nice though with huge pumpkins and pretty looking flower beds. It felt like a Halloween/Christmas show but wasn’t really fitting for what it’s meant to be.

I would suggest skipping the cloud forest but going to the flower dome."
,,Simply Fantastic,5.0,,"For me the Gardens by the Bay is the best attraction in Singapore where you can visit , among other things, the Flower Dome and (adjacent) Forest in the Clouds for a double attraction cost of 56 Singapore Dollars per person. The cost is reasonable given the WOW factor of these attractions. Moreover they are both fully air-conditioned. As someone who finds botanical gardens boring it was amazing how you felt transported by the beautiful plants and displays of flowers. You can easily spend an hour here and it should not be missed."
,,Do not miss out,5.0,,Excellent - we were lucky enough to see the orchid show. A must see for all gardeners. Pleasant stroll through - hot inside and but cafe very expensive even to for light lunches. But Flower Dome still a great experience real value for money.
,,Disney Plants and Flowers,5.0,,Everything is spotless. Just perfect. Educational. It has a lot of Dinsey engineering behind. Undoubtedly. Bottom line: I loved it.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I was expecting great things from the Flower Dome & i wasn't disappointed.
They've cleverly added points of interest into the displays to make it fun e.g. Alice in Wonderland- this would work for younger kids but i'm not sure it'd entertain older kids as they'd get bored quickly.
As for the adults it is a beautiful, well managed area to immerse yourself in the world of flowers- there are areas to sit & chill out & just relax in these amazing gardens.
To visit both the Flower Dome & the Cloud Forest i would suggest a few hours so that you can take your time & take it all in."
,,HUGE,5.0,,"Been here twice, basically i enjoy flowers and plants so id said it is stunning. I enjoy my last visit there, my favorite was the white plant (i forget the name) took some beautiful picture with its surrounding"
,,"Autumn Theme, Intersting but my kids were bored.",3.0,,Came here after seeing the Cloud Dome and way prefer the Cloud Dome. The theme was Autumn and there was a Huge Halloween display. I presume they change the display according to the season or Celebration. The Dome was broken up into different countries and they had their foliage was represented. It was Ok but not as exciting as the Cloud dome.
,,Good,5.0,,Beautiful place to visit with a various kind of beautiful flowers. Clean and comfortable place to visit.
,,"Beautiful, lots to see",5.0,,Great for adults and family as there are things for children to look out for but even without this the place is beautiful. Highly recommend going here although you willl need at least a day to see everything
,,Stunning,5.0,,I loved walking around in this beautiful dome. The Alice in Wonderland theme was very cool on the upper platform. I also loved the restaurant inside. The flowers and art sculptures were just gorgeous.
,,Huge selection of flowers,5.0,,"There was a ""pumpkin exhibition"" when we were here, nice decorations in an air-conditioned place. You can find every flower you know in here and probably more :)"
,,"Impressive but,",4.0,,"Some nice displays. A lot of pumpkins, not so many flowers for this seasonal display. Interesting and fantastic to appreciate the magnitude of this indoor garden. If you only want to visit one dome-go to the cloud forest."
,,The major disappointement during my stay in Singapore,2.0,,"In all fairness: I was expecting something much more natural and I have found some kind of ""Disney Land"" with plastic figures and main stream stuff I don't like at all. Being the day before in the Singapore Botanic Garden and the National Orchid Garden I would recommend any tourist who is after ""pure nature"" to avoid Flower Dome"". Especially for families with kids all the plastic figures might be exactly the right thing."
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,"Visited the Flower Dome as part of a joint ticket with the Forest Dome. It was very good, with lots of varieties from around the world arranged in different zones. Allow at least a good 1.5hrs to get around and see it all."
,,Loved the creativity,4.0,,"Very crowded with families, probably appeals more to the families with younger children - lots of weird displays but worth wandering around in."
,,Lyn Lim,4.0,,Went for the mid Autumn Festival at flower Dome and around garden by the bay. It was wonderful & the display was bright with pumpkins around enhancing the Dome. Night life became lively and was having great moments at the Super Tree Grove where you can experience the changing of lights with soothing music.
,,Nice,4.0,,This is a good place to escape the heat when visiting the Gardens. Many types of trees and plants from all over the world. Beautiful blooms and very informative.
,,Double wow,5.0,,"A place of serene beauty. The gardens are a credit to those who tend to them. The layout was fabulous and such an amazing variety of nature. Spent many hours just browsing, was fantastic."
,,A pleasant stroll,5.0,,"You could spend hours inside the flower dome, the temperature is perfect with a perpetual spring like feel. There are so many flowers and plants to see and the colours are dazzling."
,,For the Lovers of Nature and the Children at Heart,5.0,,Like the Cloud Garden this place is truly remarkable. It's beauty is awe-inspiring and a place where beautiful memories are made.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Spectacular display, went all over Singapore, this was a standout, the effort Singapore has put into this place for tourism is outstanding, an example for other countries to follow, well done"
,,peaceful walk,5.0,,"Had a peaceful evening walk at Flower Dome. You find creative pumpkin structures everywhere. Management could have reduce the entrance fee, because this dome is smaller than the cloud dome. But as a first time visitor,it was a pleasant experience"
,,Stunning and tranquil at the same time,5.0,,"The Flower Dome has the effect of making you happy as soon as you walk in. There is something very tranquil about it even though there are lots of people. It covers a range of geographic regions and there associated vegetation. All-in-all a very well setup and managed attraction, highly recommended."
,,"Disappointing, kind of cheesy",4.0,,"This is one of the two domes which comprise part of the Gardens by the Bay. You have to purchase a ticket to see both domes, and each has a separate entrance ticket for a one time visit. There is a center area with some food places and a gift shops and then the respective entrance to each dome.

As recommended, I opted for this dome first as it is the more simple of the two and less awe inspiring based upon what I could read here on TA and in my tourbooks and other sites. After seeing both domes, I believe that this recommendation is spot on, see this dome first and save the best for last or you will be disappointed seeing this dome second after Cloud dome.

The dome has flowers everywhere and plants too of all kinds and from all regions of the world. Lots from the US that I had obviously seen in nature but surely 4/5 of the visitors to this Dome had nor will ever see. I saw the Botanic Gardens and Orchard Gardens all on this same day, some overlap of course here too, but beautiful nonetheless. You walk in, go right and there are lots of cactus and other more arid plants, they are displayed well with signs describing each plant. They plants are grouped as a theme of sorts usually with some sort of sculpture or art piece, to me, some of these were very cheesy and did nothing to enhance my experience, others may have loved them though.

You then walk down kind of in a snake seeing all the levels until you are in the bottom and the center of the floor of the dome. Along the way are many species of plants and flowers from all over. You can go as quickly or as slowly as you like, lots of photo ops at every turn.

The dome itself is very cool, man made of course, perfectly air conditioned, with all natural light. In these regards, the Flower Dome is smashingly interesting. You can take tons of photos as you walk and explore both close up and even panoramic of the gardens in the dome below. Everyone is taking tons of photos so be prepared for that too pls.

There is a nice restaurant in this dome, which was closed for a private event the day I was there. It looked interesting in terms of setting and of its menu. I read some good reviews about it also, but did not eat there. Still, it would have been a nice stopping point.

This dome has a theme throughout the year and when I was there it was an Autumn based theme. This meant lots of yellow and orange colors and leaves changing and lots of pumpkins and gourds of all types, sizes and colors. Then, in the middle of that is this very very large kind of farmer figure to tie the Autumn theme together or to try to anyway. To me this was just very cheesy, but those visitors with families were loving it. As always, to each his/her own. Just not my cup of tea at all. There are photos of this display now in the photo section and surely on some other sites including Instagram and Youtube. Look there to see if you like the Autumn display before you go if you want to.

I spent about 75 minutes in this dome taking it all in, probably more than 100 photos too. I would recommend seeing this dome as part of any trip to Gardens on the Bay, just manage your expectations please against and contrasted to the other Dome and Super Tree Grove.

Definitely do not miss this though, even for a quick visit."
,,Lovely,5.0,,Lovely to walk around. Lots of information. Loads of pumpkins on display. Great photos. Busy but not so many people that it ruined the visit
,,Not what we expected or wanted,2.0,,"The garden is a lot smaller than the cloud dome and as we went to the cloud dome first, this dome was a disappointment. There were more flowers in the cloud dome than in the flower dome. The flower dome just doesn't wow like the cloud dome. I say this especially for those who are a bit tight on time or budget and have to choose one over the other."
,,Flower dome.,5.0,,It's another attraction inside the gardens by the bay which is located in the heart of singapore. It's has hit a separate entry fee which comes to about 23 SGD per person. When we visited the place autumn pumpkin festival which include lots of freshly bloomed flowers and multiple statues made out of pumpkins. There are many photo locations inside this park. There are many varieties of beautiful flowers and different types of gardens inside this. Altogether it's a must visit location on your trip to singapore
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,Has plants from all over the world. Nice to visit on a hot day. The cool domes offer relief from sun. Educational for kids and grown up alike. Rest room and drinking fountain are very good
,,Just Gorgeous!,5.0,,This reminded me of the fruit and vege display at the Royal Easter Show. PLenty of colour and interesting species of plants from many countries.
,,Not much time left to explore this area,5.0,,"Located in the same area as Cloud Forest is the Flower Dome - which we did not have enough time to explore as we spent too much time in Cloud Forest itself. Please allocate at least half day in Garden By The Bay in your visit... as the whole place is huge. The time we went to Flower Dome, there was display of pumpkins from all around the world and the kids were fascinated by the pumpkins in various shapes and sizes."
,,A wonderful place to visit.,5.0,,Being a flower lover it's a must o visit the Flower Dome. The Autumn Harvest festival is being held and it's so beautiful. I could spend all day in this place.
,,technical dome,5.0,,"Flower Dome is a part of Garden by the Bay. it is amazing place, near metro (MRT) station. if you are with kids, better to have a pram or use shuttle. it is very very beautiful place with great technology"
,,Another World Wonderful.,5.0,,"Spent a wonderful day in this that can only be described as Another World,wonderful flowers,fantastic location and with so much to see and do a great location for families,with loads of places to eat and drink and with fantastic views of the city a must visit if ever in Singapore."
,,For the Nth time,4.0,,"I love bringing my guests/family/friends here as the theme keeps changing, so is the whole design. So from flower to pumpkins, I get to see varieties all the time everytime I come back and the scenes are never the same."
,,Instagram-able place ^^,5.0,,"Flowers everywhere. Definitely a place where you can find a lot of colors and any kind of flowers around.

Take a lot of picture as the place is very interesting. A lot of good spot that is very ""instagram material""

The dome is located right in front of Cloud Forest, and you have to pay to enter the dome."
,,Get an annual pass,5.0,,"If you live in Singapore, get the annual pass. Especially in June when there us a 50% off. The exhibits are rotated, so its worth visiting several times a year."
,,"Flowers, flowers and more flowers - beautiful",5.0,,This is part of Gardens by the Bay and is well worth a visit - should appeal to all ages and to people from all over the world.
,,Stop and smell the flowers,5.0,,Definitely allow time to fully tour this facility. We cut ourselves a bit short but were amazed with what we did manage to see. It was great to see a section that is our outback here in Australia. The variety of flowers and plants was enough to keep my camera going flat out.
,,A very beautiful set-up!,4.0,,Flowers from different regions of the world are grown indoors.Wide variety of plants and flowers are on display.It is a good place to hang out with family.
,,A must visit,5.0,,"This is an amazing attraction, the flower display was incredible and would be worth visiting at different times of the year as the displays would change. Highly recommend"
,,Beautiful displays,4.0,,"We visited in early September and the theme was pumpkins! Colourful displays, not as large as Cloud Forest so doesn't take as much time to see."
,,Greenhouse Like No Other,4.0,,"This giant horticultural marvel is worth seeing at least once. Took us about 1.5 hours to fully enjoy all the nooks and crannies of this facility. There is also a seasonal display that rotates every few months to keep the exhibit fresh. The building itself is worth seeing, as well as giant trees from foreign lands."
,,A floral wonderland in the centre,4.0,,"The dome and the layout of the permanent display are quite impressive. The design makes for a very unusual, chilly stroll in an otherwise very hot and humid island. It was a rainy evening when we were there and so brrr... I was actually more fascinated by the play of lights reflected on the dome and the sheer artistry and engineering that must have gone into the lighting and positioning of the trees. Outside the supertrees were something else altogether. See for yourself."
,,Stunning colours and a rich variety of plants,5.0,,This is like going to a top garden expo. We were amazed at the ancient olive trees in the Mediterranean section. I would love to know how they got them inside the dome and keep them happy. Also a wonderful collection of plants that would otherwise not be able to thrive in Singapore's hot and humid climate. I loved the hydrangeas and fuchsias in particular. The kids loved the huge statue of a man made from vegetables.
,,"A wonderful, colourful display of plants and shrubs from around the world.",5.0,,"This Flower Dome is thankfully air-conditioned, allowing visors to meander around rain or shine to see plants and flowers from many parts of the world. Fully developed, it is a very colourful experience, with elevated paths and rest areas. A photographer's Paradise, and all for $8."
,,flower kingdome,4.0,,very nice ! flowers everywhere. we were there at the beginning of september everything is just ready for autumn colors and halloween. in singapore none loose time. like cloud forest it s better to have combo ticket for saving money
,,At this time of year not that many flowers,4.0,,Maybe this is better at other times of year but there wasn't a whole lot of flowers. Still quite enjoyable but don't expect a stunning array of flowers at this time of year.
,,Cloud Garden is better,3.0,,"I did both the Cloud Garden and the Flower Dome on the same day and whilst there is a little more colour in the Flower Dome, I preferred the other dome. Loads of different gardn styls, plenty of bright colourful flowers and a great statue designed from garden items like pumpkins (see all the photos people have attached) but for me it was just another garden and seems like the effort went into the Cloud Garden and this was an afterthought. Visit if you like plants and flowers from different parts of the world (the Australian themed garden did have a lot of local plants) all in one place."
,,NIce place to visit,5.0,,Gardens by The bay is HUge Garden in Singapore. Interesting and nice place to take a Picture. Recommended place for holiday in Singapore
,,Beautiful,3.0,,It was beautiful yes it was but I expected to see many more flowers there. The choice and seasons of flowers was limited. For a gardener like me I was not blown away! Sorry! No exotic flowers as well
,,Stunning,5.0,,Visiting the Flower Dome was just beautiful. To see all types of plants grown in ideal conditions made me very envious but also appreciate the effort it takes to keep the standard up. The whole pklace is a must see.
,,Disappointing,3.0,,Perhaps its the season or because I had done cloud dome first but I was disappointed. There is creativity and certainly the arid gardens are fascinating but over all it lacked something for me.
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,"Its so neat and beautiful and what an experience for people with a green thumb. It even has gardens from different countries, including South Africa😁"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Another must see while in Singapore. The colours and displays are magic. Every flower from around the world. Beautifully cared for. The displays change with the seasons. The Halloween theme with all the pumpkins was amazing.
,,Man made beauty!,4.0,,"Must go for photography and especially if you love being closer to nature.

It took us 1 hr to 1.5 hr to cover this place from entry to exit.

You may want to club this along with cloud forest, night show at Gardens by the way and marina bay sands. All are nearby and at walking distance.

Caution: you'll need to walk a lot to cover all these places in a day"
,,Surprisingly few flowers!,4.0,,"One of the main attractions at Gardens by the Bay and you have to pay a moderate entrance fee. As with the Cloud Forest it is a large glass structure with controlled environment. Loads of cacti a whole load of baobabs and numerous areas representing different parts of the world.
There are lots of beautiful wooden sculptures in amongst the plants.
There was an exhibition for autumn on in the centre when we visited with hundreds of pumpkins that was very pretty.
Despite the name though there were not many flowers!"
,,Fascinating Floral Fantasy,5.0,,No visit to the Gardens by the Bay would be complete without visiting the Flower Dome. The colours and displays are breathtaking. There are just so many different vistas to see and some of the sculptures are incredible. Now we want to go and update our own garden after seeing so many little gardens!
,,Pretty!,5.0,,"A fairly small space but packed with different varieties of flowers all split up by country, There is normally a special exhibition on, currently its the Fall Harvest theme which is quite interesting. Worth visiting Gardens By The Bay if you have time. A couple of hours here is usually enough."
,,Flower heaven,5.0,,"This attraction is part of the Gardens by the Bay attraction and you have to pay about SGD28 to enter. There are a fw different gardens from all over the world like the Australian Garden, South American Garden, South African Garden, Californian Garden, Mediterranean Garden, Flower Field Succulent Garden, The Baobabs and Flower field. When were there recently, it was the season of the Autemn Harvest and we saw lots of pumpkins in all manner shape and form. Quite a spectacle. Botanist would love it here. Plenty of opportunities to take photographs."
,,Pumpkins growing from the ceiling?,5.0,,What wonderful imagination the designers of this display exhibited. A very busy but well organised display. They show that anything is possible and one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore in the Gardens by the Bay. You need to allow at least 2 hours to view and some of sculptures inside are amazing. Suggest going mid week when there are fewer crowds and toilets are located on the ground level
,,Great for Flower Lovers (or even if you're not one),4.0,,"It's a great place to see lots of different flowers that are not usually found in our gardens. The collection of flowers is huge and they have themes that change from time to time, depending on the season. The one that I caught was Tulipmania, where they had on display lots of Tulips. Other than that, there are always cactuses on display (which look really interesting). Even if you're not usually a fan of flowers/plants, this would probably appeal to anyone for its novelty. I prefer the Cloud Forest though I must say both are really different and anyone should visit both attractions if you're in the area."
,,photo op!,4.0,,so colorful and photo friendly!themes keep changing every time you visit it.very big place need a stroller / wheelchair fro children/ elderly people.
,,Great attraction,5.0,,"A must see. very impressive. If your an avid gardener or you like going to plant nurseries then you will love this place and I'm not into gardening but I must say it nearly turned me into one until I got home and saw our garden, ""lost cause I think"" But the Flower garden was fantastic and would I go back to see it again, yep sure would again and again."
,,Halloween theme!,5.0,,"Yay! Its halloween! Superb displays with all real fruit and vegetables. One of a kind. So colourful, loving it very much. Awesome!"
,,Flowers flowers flowers.,5.0,,Lovely place with many variety types of flowers. You can spend hours here doing nothing and have a peace of mind. Try to buy tickets online to beat the queue and google more on the price of the tickets. some online agency quoted higher prices.
,,My favourite,4.0,,"Like the revolving displays that goes with the seasons, like going overseas without the need to travel. For example, the current pumpkins display was new and I would not have seen so many varieties even when overseas on a sight seeing holiday."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"Buy your tickets on line to beat the queues. No need to print, the barcode can be scanned from your phone.
Lots to see here and many, many, many photo opportunities.
Pollen bar/restaurant is found within the Flower Dome and offers a good selection of snacks/meals.
We thoroughly enjoyed our time here."
,,beautiful flower dome,4.0,,All types of flowers set in controlled temperature and amazingly done worth a visit and a walk around the place is superb
,,Lovely place!,5.0,,"Honestly spent hours here because there was so much to see! There was a harvest theme when my sisters and I went so the scarecrows and pumpkins were slightly creepy...

But so many different plants and fruits/veg to see, definitely worth it to visit both here and the Cloud Forest"
,,Spot the wooden sculptures.,5.0,,"Well landscaped area with variety of flowers, plants and trees. You can spot wooden sculptures of a dragon, horse, etc also characters from Alice in the Wonderland. You might spend a few hours here as I did, the place is huge and if you are hungry, there's a restaurant within."
,,Lovely,4.0,,But not as good as the cloud dome so if you are penny pinching pick the other one. They have themes which change.
,,Colourful and Vibrant.,5.0,,This dome at the Gardens By the Bay has a large variety of flowers from around the globe under one roof. It is definitely worth the visit.
,,Plants from all over the world,4.0,,"If you like flowers or plants you'll love it. Nice and cool inside to escape the heat of the day. Walk around and you feel like your in a rainforest, a tropical garden or among native flora."
,,My kid loved it,5.0,,Bird park and their shows are a day worth visit. My kid loved the shows. There are free water dispensers available so carry your own bottle if you want to save some petty cash.
,,Must visit,5.0,,"The flower dome is awesome. Lots of flowers and plants, and there was a spring exhibition on. There was a massive display of pumpkins. I never seen so many pumpkins in my life. There was a big statue made out of plastic pumpkins and other sort of vegetables, surrounded by real pumpkins. The kids loved it."
,,Chill place to relax,5.0,,If you are the type that like to have a little walk at night...join the membership for annual free entry...nice place to do yoga too...provided you dont get caught
,,Must see,5.0,,"the flower garden is a must each season the flowers are change in the central garden display, and you can get a discount when combined this and the cloud dome together"
,,Greenhouse with plants,3.0,,"Unless you are a super plant/flower lover, you wouldn't feel thrilled to see the great variety of plants there. Except taking some pictures, this is only a place to relax and avoid being exposed to the sun outdoors."
,,Flower lover,5.0,,Equally divided into different areas of flowers according to countries Detailed descriptions of the flowers Rare flowers available
,,Lovely flower,5.0,,"the air so fresh and smell good from the flowers. everything was good, the building so incredible and I can enjoy the view from second floor. loved it"
,,Nice place!,4.0,,It was nice but not quite as cool as the cloud forest! We visited in 2016 and when we visited for the 2nd time in August 2017 it was closed for maintenance :(
,,Loved this space,4.0,,"An enormous green house full of exotice trees and plants from all over the globe, some planted as permanent displays, and others seasonal displays... a couple of hours including some learning!"
,,Beautiful yet not really surprising,4.0,,"The flower dome is very beautiful architecturally speaking, but as someone who comes from Europe, the vegetation itself was not that exciting. Both the northern Europe and the Mediterranean have a lot of the featured plants or similar and the rest were pretty common for me. I realize that most visitors from the region will find these plants different and unknown so that's a different story, but a lot of the visitors seemed European too. The place is well kept with informative signs placed around the place and the design is pretty so it's still worth visiting, but be mindful that it is cold inside!"
,,Great orchid display in August,4.0,,We went end of August and the orchid display was amazing. It was really nice to wander around and see the cactus area and the olive grove etc. We didn't enjoy as much as the Cloud Garden - but that was because of the amazing engineering editions to the cloud which make it even more unique.
,,Fresh flowers and a great place,5.0,,I find it relaxing going around in the dome. Flowers are indeed very nice. Its also cold inside and its amazing to walk around and see real flowers. Great idea! I will come back for sure.
,,Absolutely Beautiful,5.0,,"Informative and beautiful the flower dome is a vast engineering structure that highlights the Beaty snd fragility of nature. It is magnificently maintained with everything so well presented. For anyone who loves gardens it is s must see. The cafe inside also looked lovely, though we did not stop as the time was not right."
,,Spring time,5.0,,"A must visit, It is the worlds largest glass green house.It is spring time always.Look with awe at the display of beautiful flowers and exotic plants from five continents.The large columnless glass house has many distinct areas.You need lot of time to explore enjoy the large floral displays."
,,Lovely wander,3.0,,It was nice but not quite as cool as the cloud forest. Had a few snacks at Pollen restaurant which was nice too. Cute little Winnie the Pooh statues in places.
,,Delightful visit,5.0,,Part of the Garden by the Bay complex.The flower dome is truly amazing .Such a great variety of flowers of all hues is a delight to see.Must visit when in Singapore

,,Lots of flowers in a nice dome,5.0,,I am not into flowers in general but the Flower Dome with it's temperature regulated environment is a great place to see a wide variety of flora not normally seen in tropical climates. Everything is beautifully laid out and there is even a cafe to relax and have a break. A nice place to enjoy an hour or two.
,,Many Many beautiful flowers,3.0,,"Flower Dome has a lot of beautiful and rare flowers, especially orchids. Many kinds of flowers from different parts of the world are displayed. I went there around the National Day of Singapore so it was quite crowded. The dome is spacious but could be crowded on holidays. There are places to sit down, relax and feel the beauty of nature. A nice place to visit while you are in Singapore."
,,photos for the flowers,5.0,,"beautiful but little crowded, i prefer if you can go before sunset to see and take amazing photos for the flowers."
,,Extraordinary -Concept,5.0,,"The whole concept of Gradens by the bay is extraordinalry and two of its jewels would to cloud forest and Flower Dome.
Its full of surprise- the design is super and its executed to perfection- its preserved and maintained so well. Its extremely educational for all ages of people."
,,Nice!,5.0,,Load of flowers and enjoy walking around the area inside. it's really cold but it was fun. Another good thing to do when especially raining day.
,,(In Gardens by the bay) Welcome to heaven! If you assume heaven was full of them.,5.0,,"One of the most visited places in Singapore is Gardens by the bay and when you are over here you may pay a small amount of 12 SGD to visit the magnificent Flower dome. You will find all kinds of beautiful flowers and plants here. And this is one place to make sure to go with your woman. She will love it. You can probably spend about 2 to 3 hours inside easily taking amazing pictures of yourself with the beauty in the background at each and every step. If you are not a keen photographer, so be it. You can pose for someone who is, just make sure you get some pictures clicked, coz you aren't gonna see something like this again any soon."

,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,"Flower Dome is a spectacular and innovative man made garden. It’s the largest glass greenhouse in the world!

Cloud forest is located next to Flower Dome therefore better to buy entrance tickets to both Conservatories and visit the Cloud forest after visiting the Flower Dome.

If you are travelling with children you can end the visit by having fun at the water play features at Far East Organization Children’s Garden.

Highly recommended for families with children!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We visited both Domes. The Flower Dome was amazing. We spent most of our time in here exploring the many different plants and flowers. It's nice and cool atmosphere inside, makes for a comfortable visit, as apposed to the humidity outside. We took our time and strolled through the Gardens and there are benches you can rest on, also a place to eat/drink if you need to. Definitely need to visit here if you come. Worth every penny!"
,,Awesome attraction,5.0,,"A must visit day + night, starting with day and get re-entry stamp for night (before 8:30pm). Visit 1 hour + 1 hour at the Cloud forest. Bring Camera with plenty of battery charge."
,,A photographers delight.,5.0,,"We paid to go around both domes yesterday 25 th August and it was not that busy. The flowers were displayed beautifully and we walked around slowly for a couple of hours. I do get annoyed when people walk in front of you and position themselves in front of the display and they do the selfies. Very rude! I know this happens everywhere but they didn't even look at the flowers, they just need to put themselve in the picture what ever it was. Moan over!!"
,,Unique experience,5.0,,A unique place to visit. A place which respects and protects the environment. It is easy to understand because labels are everywhere and the kinds are grouped. Definitely a must!!

We had been to the cloud forest earlier, so it felt like a flora and flower overdose for us.

Good to spend about an hour here. Check out voyagin for discounted tickets."
,,You don't have to know about fowers and plants to enjoy this place,4.0,,Add this to your timetable when coming to Gardens by the Bay. You don’t have to be a naturalist or flower love to appreciate this place.

,,Some spectacular displays!,5.0,,"During our most recent stay in Singapore, we had a Singapore Airlines Stop-over Holiday package which provided us with passes allowing free admittance to a number of attractions around Singapore.
Whilst visiting the magnificent Gardens by the Bay, we were able to use those passes to gain free admission to the splendid Flower Dome. The Flower Dome is a massive totally glass covered area in which there are masses of beautiful live flower displays incorporating many plant species from all around the world.
We were totally ""blown away"" by the beauty of many of the enthralling displays. If we had not had our holiday passes, we would have been quite happy to have paid the admission charges to view such marvellous displays!"
,,Big dome,5.0,,This is a big dome where you can see many different plants from all over the world. The plants are well maintained. It is bit cold inside too. Great place to cool down and escape from the heat of city.
,,Lots of flowers . .,3.0,,"Strangely, as it's the flower dome - it's full of flowers. An orchid exhibition was ending so there were thousands of similar orchids. It was nice that some areas were separated into sections e.g. Australian garden, South American garden etc. But I would have liked to have seen more information provided about the climate and native species of these areas. There was limited information provided about flower names etc which also would have been good! Beautiful flowers though!"
,,For flower lowers...,4.0,,"This is another part of gardens by the bay premises which requires entry ticket, you get numerous varieties of flowers on display"
,,Awe Inspiring,5.0,,"Such a great asset to Singapore. Spent the day wandering through the Flower Dome, Cloud Dome, and some of the outside areas. Returned in the evening to an amazing light show. Viewed the orchid exhibition that was on and was extactic to have timed my visit when there was a guided walk through this exhibition, August 2016. I will be back and will allow more time to enjoy this amazing space."
,,A special place,5.0,,just seen the amazing orchid display at this dome and for me a highlight of our Singapore trip. There is also a cloud forest dome to see but gave that a miss. Spent a good 2 hours in the flower dome and took amazing pictures.
,,Orchid Display Season,4.0,,The queue is long but quite fast moving. Purchased two tickets and there was a discount due to Singapore National Day (month) promotion. It costed S$7.00 for citizen or PR. There were many kids (students) visiting the flower dome as well. They are being guided by the volunteer staff to introduce them the different types of plants which can hold water in the trunk or stem. The orchid display was at the center of the dome. Of course compared with Botanic Garden orchid display will be smaller.
,,Nirvana,5.0,,"We visited Gardens by the bay in Singapore in July 2017, the whole place is breathtaking, so much so, we spent 7 hours there the first day, went back that night for another 2 1/2 hours then went back two days later for another 5 hours, there is soooo much to see. My fav spot was the Flower dome, my Gardeners heart just did somersaults of joy, what they have created here is nothing short of amazing, Tips, wear walking shoes, take your time , there is so much to see, amazing driftwood sculptures blended into the displays, lots of querky ideas, take reams of pictures, do the route, then go back and do it again, you'll be surprised what you missed the first time! There's no time limited once you enter the domes, so no hurry, hordes of people, but you won't feel crowded in, the place is epic in proportion! The flower dome is beautifully colourful, blissfully cool, and every Gardeners ( and non Gardeners) dream. You won't be disappointed, it's an amazing place and so very well done, the staff are very helpful, friendly and knowledgable and as is everything in Singapore it is all spotlessly clean and well maintained! Absolute highlife of our trip to beautiful Singapore!"
,,Feast for the eyes,5.0,,The flower dome was very beautiful. The airconditioning is refereshing and enabled us to browse and really enjoy every display.

Loved a lot thanks Singapore very memorable holiday. Could not see at Kashmir but was lucky to see tulips at Singapore .
,,Really Beautiful Place,4.0,,"Absolutely amazing place. The sheer size and scope of the Flower Dome and the adjacent Cloud Forest are scarcely believable.
Amazing variety of flowers, trees and shrubs all inside a cavernous glass structure, climate controlled and full of colour and scents.
Make sure you buy the combo ticket to see the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest as they are both very different yet both breathtaking in their own way.
I don't know much about flowers but it didn't matter. This place was so beautiful and so relaxing and totally unique in the world. An absolute must see."
,,rainy Sunday joy,5.0,,"First heavy rainfall for two weeks and I asked the cab driver: can you drop us under a shelter? No worries, this s Singapore. From entrance walk up under a sheltered walkway to the ticket office and enter the domes. Skywal was closed obviously during the rain period. Cloud forest and Flower dome are good to spend 2-4 hours depending on your mood.Discover what you have not seen before in the flora and fauna, don't forget to take hundreds of pictures."
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,If you like flowers and trees you will love this place! It was very pretty and interesting to see plants and flowers from all different regions of the world.
,,Both is Best.,5.0,,"When it comes to choosing between the two dome, the best choice is, do both. We were not sure about spending the money, but were not disappointed. Comfortabe shoes and a water bottle is a must....then take your time as you stroll through water falls and plant exhibits....what an experience"
,,Amazing flower collection,5.0,,"I did not expect to see unique flowers and all blossoming. I can't know if August is the best month, but flowers were everywhere. Some flowers are really interesting and you will spend hours taking photos. It is an experience that you won't forget.
Generally, it is a dome glass and you are gonna walk around flowers and plants divided by zones such as Australia, Mediterranean, ...."
,,Amazing place - must visit,5.0,,"This is a paradise made in singapore which is really hands on and well done to Singapore

The way that reflects the tropical flowers and gardening is made to meet the actual reflection

The flower dome consist of big number of flowers and trees from around the world and the person who is looking for relaxiation and nice photos must go there

temperature inside is very nice around 23 - 24 C and you may enjoy with your kids if using strollers and also wheel chair can move nicely"
,,Great place for Flower lovers,4.0,,"One of the jewels of Singapore's superb Garden by the Bay's area. Though I preferred Cloud forest dome , if you have the time it's definitely worth the visit. Even for those aren't Flower fanatics will enjoy the displays and nice place to chill. The dome setup easily allowing you to spend as much time as you like without missing anything"
,,Orchid Spectacular,5.0,,There was a wonderful variety of plants from all regions of the world. We were lucky to visit the dome during orchid time. Wow!
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is a must see when in singapore. It was beautiful. Air Conditioned too so great respite from the heat.
,,Nice place to wander around in,4.0,,"I enjoyed wandering around the Flower Dome, but I found the Cloud Forest was a more enjoyable experience so if you can only do one for some reason, stick to the Cloud Forest!
The Flower Dome currently has an orchid display going on and it is nice to look at as they arrange the orchids in a way that tells the story of the butterfly (starting from caterpillar). However, if you want to see orchids I highly recommend you go to the Orchid Garden as part of the botanical gardens, it is a much better experience and worth the trip!
The Flower Dome was a little packed while I was there, so I wasn't able to enjoy it as much as I would have liked to. It would be nice if you could find a time to view it when it is less busy. I'm not sure when that would be though, because I was there around 10:15 am on a Friday morning.
All and all, not a bad place to get out, but it won't take you too long to get through it."
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,"Amazing flowers. A great variety of plants from all over the world, with wonderful fragrances. Good place to visit when raining. It's also a good place to practice photography."
,,Best to visit Flower Dome from 4:30pm onwards,5.0,,"Visited Flower Dome at Garden by the Bay during SG National's Day, one of the best places to practice photography. Recommended to start your tour from 4:30pm to 6pm. 1.5 hours should be good enough. :)"
,,Amazing accomplishment with some frustrations on my last visit,4.0,,"Without a shadow of a doubt the Flower Dome is an amazing accomplishment. It's a beautiful place to meander and relax.

However it was frustrating at times to find there was no plaques to identify intriguing plants or trees. And no one around to ask. Or they gave us the wrong information.

I was delighted to come across an English Country Garden along a far wall with some of the most spectacular specimens of British roses, clematis, standard fuchsias, sweat peas to name but a few that I have ever seen. But devastated to see that it was so poorly maintained and arranged that it was impossible to see all the stunning , incredibly expensive flowers planted/arranged in ways they would not be in English gardens.

Beautiful standard fuchsia in lovely pots up against walls covered in ivy. These would be open places leading the eye to other elements of the garden.

The rest of the cottage wall garden was so crammed with absolute floral jewels of English flora, a gardeners and artist dream tangled in each other and ivy that all was mostly lost in an over grown chaos. This could have been so much better.

It was painful. I reconsidered renewing my membership this month ....

But the flower dome is overall an amazing achievement and the succulent garden is superb. The present Alice in Wonderland display is a work of art.

A must see at least once.... check out the quiet times."
,,Simply fantastic,5.0,,"The entire flower dome experience is pretty refreshing. The amazing array of beautifully decorated flowers and trees will dazzle your eyes. It is a place where you can sit and relax for hours, that is of course after doing some photography."
,,Beautiful and Instagrammable!!,5.0,,"Take your INSTAGRAM ADDICTED FRIENDS HERE haha

Such a beautiful and pretty place, crowded on a Friday afternoon though. :( Thankfully, it's airconditioned. I love the fat cacti, and there was one shaped like a man's organ (sorry immature but still)

Between the flower dome and the cloud forest, the dome is a bit better. With its marvellous floral display from all over the world. The whole place is air-conditioned and it's cool and comfortable to spend time in. The display is well deigned and so beautiful. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in it."
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,"The orchid extravaganza was on display and this was just so perfect. Orchids of all colours and varieties, there are also themed areas , like the Australian zone featuring Aussie plants and flowers. A must in Singapore."
,,One of a Kind....VERY IMPRESSIVE..!!!!,5.0,,"It is incomparable..I'd been to Miracle Garden in Dubai but nothing compares to Gardens by the Bay....especially because the flowers in Gardens by the Bay are being preserved in an air conditioned huge space. Can you imagine how the government is spending a lot just to preserve the beauty of nature...Kudos to Singapore...

I will definitely comeback there in my 3rd visit to Singapore...."
,,FlowerDome Spectacular,5.0,,"For a person who is normally has an average interest in gardening and flowers , this trip to the Flower Dome has inspired me.
Surprisingly , I had seen or knew a great deal of the plants growing within the dome , colours and bulk planting were spectular and ranged from thousands of Cacti through to some of the most delicate flowers I have seen.
Each corner revealed another surprise and before we knew it , we had passed 1 hour in the dome taking many photos and gazing in awe at the colourful displays
Definitely a place to visit weather a Gardner or not"
,,Garden in Heaven,5.0,,Amazing place. Lots of beautiful and colorful plants and flowers arranged in such a way that one could take beautiful photographs. Place is clean and fully air conditioned. So glad to have seennever before seen plants and flowers. Will recommend this to allmy friends.

,,Really interesting when you're in the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"This is another must do attraction in Singapore even if only for the air-conditioning!

We really enjoyed our hour in here and loved the opportunity to get away from the heat as well."
,,A wide range and large display of flowers...,5.0,,"Even if you're not a gardener or flora lover this dome is beautiful to visit I must admit. The layout, design and choice of flowers and arrangements makes it a very lovely visit.

Lots of eye candy, and the kids loved spotting little art pieces among the beautiful flower and plant arrangements. Amazing place, will remember for a long time!"
,,Great Gardens from around the world,4.0,,We arrived shortly before dusk. Not too many people around and the experience was at times magical especially from the nice lighting. Each garden is in its own area and the whole is wonderfully laid out.
,,Beautiful orchid show,4.0,,"The Dome was featuring orchids when we visited. Every colour, size and shape orchid you can imagine. The walk was lovely and cool and very well displayed"
,,Another amazing experience!!,4.0,,"First of all it is like two minute walk from the cloud forest they are at the same place. It was a great experience they have like small gardens from around the world something unique. The smell of the flowers its really nice, its a must of you are going to the cloud forest or gardens by the bay. Recommended 100% you would not have any other experience like this ill say takes about and hour and a half. In a really calm pace."
,,"FUTURE, BLOOD & SELFIES",5.0,,"This is a feat of human ingenuity on many levels. Don't miss it. If you are repatriating to SG, buy an annual pass.

Keep in mind that this futuristic structure is built on 'reclaimed land'. A city state short on land, big ups to SG for essentially creating a greenhouse in a park to offset the catastrophic monstrosity of MBS. These structures, one falling in the shadow of the other, are probably the most iconic symbols of SG (no, not the Merlion) and outside of Dubai, possibly the most iconic urban symbols of public futurism on this planet.

Even a child fighting with his parents when they asked him to take a picture of themselves - ""no, no selfie for you, I want a selfie*"" - and mid tantrum falling off the bench beside the orchid caterpillars and flower river, smashing his face open and leaking a pool of blood, could not spoil this outing.

SAMMY'S HOT TIP: you can always find cheaper tickets online, or book a meal at Pollen (the restaurant in the far corner of the garden) and get free entry.

*when did taking a photo become synonymous with the word 'selfie'?"
,,SO creative - and beautiful!,4.0,,"When I was there, they were doing a study in blue - which is a rare color for flowers - and there was one entire section with all kinds of beautiful blue flowers - rhododendrons the size of your head! And there are lots of beautiful and winsome sculptures all over the dome. Definitely worth the time to visit."
,,Lovely,5.0,,Beautiful gardens and very enjoyable to wander around with plenty places to sit and enjoy the surroundings. Air con environment very welcome on a hot humid Singapore day.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful.....so many different types of flowers and especially orchids you won't want to miss this attraction....
,,Heaven for gardeners,4.0,,"We visited both this and the Cloud Forest. Even if I preferred the Cloud Forest, this was certainly not a waste of time. If you're interested in gardening, this is a must on your Singapore tour. Lots of fantastic plants and trees from all over the world!"
,,Flower Dome,4.0,,Main attraction in gardens by the bay. the plant life is just fabulous. You must see this thing. Good place for photography.

,,Amazing!,5.0,,"If you love gardening then this is the place you need to visit when in Singapore. It is the largest greenhouse in the world and rightly so! There are so many different trees and gardens from different continents that each path you turn into leads into another beautiful area. The place is well maintained and although busy with tourists, you can take your time and spend as long as you like. Highly recommended !"
,,Another hidden gem - well worth the visit!,5.0,,"This is another dome in the Gardens By the Bay complex, and this is just as spectacular as the last (Cloud Dome). Inside is a beautifully cool dome filled with flowers/plants from all over the world. Each area is a particular country, and you can easily spend an hour or two exploring the dome.
There is a restaurant/cafe inside, and lots of places to sit and admire the beautiful plants and flowers!
Lots of picture opportunities, and clearly well looked after! Absolute perfection!"
,,Good but ...,3.0,,"I spent nearly 1 day here with my friends. Many plants is beautiful. It is worth to visit in a hot day.
I am working in hospitality and I see that the staffs here are not friendly. They are look unhappy, serious, no smile to guests. The staff that I mentioned here is at the gate, the driver of electric car. Terrible!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Not being a horticulturist I wasn't jumping for joy about visiting the flower dome but I was pleasantly surprised by it. The layout was easy to follow and the flowers were amazing.
,,A truly wonderful attraction,5.0,,This was my second visit which I shared with my husband and daughter. I was delighted once again by the way this attraction has been organised. There is a huge amount of effort that goes into maintaining the Gardens as well as the constant change of exhibits.
,,Flower bio dome,5.0,,Deceptively spacious and a vast array of flora on show. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit in this well conceived and designed facility
,,As lovely as it can get,5.0,,"The flower garden was a treat to ones eyes.. Its so beautiful that it would surprise you if paid a visit without reading up. Well, you'd still be in for a treat even if you read up and go.
The flowers are numerous. They are each one better than the other.
A must visit in every sense."
,,Plants are jailed in this place,2.0,,"Seriously, in this place you have a feeling that all plants and flowers are locked up against their will. The lines are just to perfect, that you don't see nature. It looks plastic even though it's not."
,,Not as stunning as the Cloud Forrest,3.0,,"The flower dome is not as stunning, amazing and didn’t give us that “wow” experience as Cloud Forrest. It’s nice and there is a extensive collection of flowers and plants, but living in Europe we are spoiled to have much better garden and flower expositions as this one."
,,Flower dome in GBTB,4.0,,Garden By the Bay got 2 Dome if I'm not mistaken where you can see lot of types of plants as well as flowers. They got some entry fees to get into the dome. quite affordable and there got lot many things inside to see. worth going here and paying for the same. Enjoy
,,Flowers and more flowers,4.0,,If you love flowers then you will love the flower dome. There are plants and flowers from all over the world. The colours and scents are amazing and the displays are cleverly and beautifully presented.
,,A Beautiful Place for Seeing all Kinds of Flowers,5.0,,The flower dome is a one stop place for all those who are flower enthusiasts. It is actually amazing that in this artificially controlled environment thousand of different varieties of plants and flowers are being grown. Definitely a must visit place in Singapore
,,Enjoy afternoon walk,4.0,,Beautiful flowers. They really took good care of this place. Recommend to go in afternoon as it is cooling.

,,Impressive greenhouse #2,4.0,,The Flower Dome and its orchid exhibition is beautiful but not quite as appealing to me and my teenagers as the Cloud Forest. Still it is a must see.
,,Awesome flower show,5.0,,Part of garden by the bay. It starts with some orchid display then to many regions of the world garden and finally has lots and lots of flowers especially Orchids !
,,A bucket list location,5.0,,"This was a sensory overload. I reckon the Flower Dome is four storeys of wonderful - ness. The displays are out of this world, I think I would need to go round a few times just to see everything.

The colours, the scents, the displays. I thought I would explode with such an overload. No photo will ever do this place justice.

The Gardens by the Bay were the reason I visited Singapore and it far exceeded my expectations."
,,Beautiful flowers ...,4.0,,... in a very nice setting and air conditioned. We were actually just happy to get out of the heat and soent about 30 minutes in the dome before moving on to the rainforest dome.
,,Loved this place,5.0,,Could have spent an eternity here admiring the creative work of the staff a real asset to the city and a lovely place to visit
,,Nothing to remember,3.0,,There is nothing to remember there.just many flowers and plants and I forgot what I saw after 30 minutes. Nothing special here. The cloud forest was better.
,,So pretty!!,4.0,,This is a must if you love flowers! There are so many different colors and varieties. It makes for great Instagram photos and portraits. I like that it is laid out in a very organized way. So pretty! $16 entrance fee for just the flower dome.
,,Orchid Extravaganza - The Butterfly Story,5.0,,"Orchid Extravaganza - The Butterfly Story at Gardens by the Bay - Flower Dome is till 20th August, 2017. Ticket price is 10% off. It is worth for nature lovers. But area is crowded and there are queues everywhere. The whole Flower Dome area is decorated according to 52nd National Day. There are 52 butterflies (sculpture) too."
,,Evening visit,5.0,,This is the most beautiful flower dome i have seen anywhere. Orchids are on display during this season. It is absolutely beautiful. So many different breeds of the orchids flower. It is a must visit place for anyone that likes flower. Highly recommended.
,,An uneasy feeling,3.0,,The uber mess of everything on steroids in a fake way is too much to take and yet tourists and locals alike seem to take it with gusto
,,Its amazing - and you dont have to be a plant lover!,5.0,,A must to visit. Great in the morning and great again in the evening when the place lights up! You cant go to the Bay Gardens without visiting the Domes.
,,Plenty of plants and flowers,4.0,,"Since we were spending the majority of our day at the Gardens, we visited the Flower Dome as well. Being from the South in the United States, we were familiar with all of the tropical plants and flowers already so there was nothing worth noting to us except maybe the black colored petunias! Those without a lot of exposure to tropical plants should definitely visit though!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,We loved this dome from the second we entered. Thousands of flower displays from around the world. Orchid display was gorgeous. Well done to all. Highly recommended. A great ess to spend an hour or two

,,A Pleasant Surprise,4.0,,We had not known of the Dome before visiting Singapore recently but were very pleased that we had allocated around 30 minutes for this eco extravaganza.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Bought the 2 exhibit pass to flower dome and cloud forest. The flower dome has different areas with plants around the world. Also has some neat trees and displays (my favourite was the dragon tree!) Was definitely worth checking out, highly recommend!"
,,Succulent Heaven,5.0,,"I am a collector of succulents and cacti and this was heaven for me. Of course there were many varieties that I could not dream of acquiring because this collection has been sourced from around the world and a lot of money has been spent on it. But what an experience - the weather was great the day we were here, there are so many exhibits and floral displays but there is room to sit down and have a break, so this was a visit we would urge you to make if you are in Singapore. You can oooh and aaah with all the other garden and plant enthusiasts. Great place to visit."
,,Must Visit and Enjoyable,5.0,,"the Place is awesome and Loved Gardens by the Bay. This had flowers collections from all over the earth, and the lay out was terrific and the many species of cacti was incredible, loved all the sculptures which were there made and stand beautifully."

,,Great display of plants from around the world,4.0,,"This was a very interesting lace to visit, we even saw a few plants from Australia as well.

When we went I was leading up to Christmas hence the theme of the display at the time.

Worth a look and included on the ticket to the Cloud Forrest which we though was much better."
,,Great collection of flowers,4.0,,"This is like a botanic garden. It is worth it to do both the flower and cloud dome as they are right next to each other. The cloud dome is way more impressive, in my opinion, but this is quite pleasant. Many examples of beauty."
,,A botanic marvel.,5.0,,"For anybody with a horticultural interest, this place is a must. The wonderful array of orchids is marvellous in itself, but the whole layout with various geographical sections of plant varieties, blended with sculptures, is truly great."
,,Tourist Holiday,4.0,,"The ""Other"" dome to the Cloud Forrest Dome - both had awesome ""Tree Root System Carvings"" that have to be seen....
$28 per adult entry to both Domes. 15 minute casual stroll from entry point. Option to walking is a $3 (one way) shuttle Golf-buggy ride."
,,Heaven for a flowers lover,5.0,,"I'm so lucky when I'm visit the Flower Dome, they have a Tulips Exhibition. I don't have to go to Netherlands to see a colorful tulips. Also you will know the specific flowers or tree by country or continent. Just pay the ticket around SGD 12, you will see a lot of beautiful flower."
,,Magnificient,5.0,,"Any plant lover would not be able to resist spending a few hours walking through this magnificent display of plant life - the ""green "" displays are just as impressive as the flower displays and a photographer's dream com true"
,,awesome,5.0,,"my daughter and I loved the cactus area was quite hilarious and had loads of tourists in there - everyone was in a great mood - the plants make everyone happy and chilled out - brilliant selection of trees and plants - mind boggling how they created this.. just awesome - well done Singapore
the olive trees are sooooo old.. great sculptures inside of the animals - stunning building.."

,,A Break from the Heat,4.0,,"If flowers are your thing and you are looking for a lazy recovery day then the Flower Dome might just be the place to recharge your batteries. A giant, cooled indoor greenhouse, the Flower Dome features... well... flowers, on a winding path that spirals throughout the Dome.

By coupling a visit with the adjacent ""Cloud Forest"" you can get a ticket for just S$28 for adults and S$15 for kids."
,,More to see than Cloud forest,4.0,,"I prefer this garden to Cloud forest as there are more varieties to see. From tiny plants to big cactus and trees, beautiful and colorful flowers, you will love it if you like flowers."
,,I love orchids,5.0,,I enjoyed taking pictures and I saw different flowers I remember when I was young I used to play all the flowers and now they preserve that kind of flowers and very clean.
,,Unbeleivable,5.0,,Take your own time to visit this one of a kind garden in singapore. Plan atleast half day to see this properly. inside there's the best part of it is Cloud Forest which is a man made forest which will give you actual feeling of being in a rain forest. It really took us minimum 4 hours to see and feel this. In the end the best part is that they show a small documentry on the ill effects of global warming and how the earth is on the verge of 6th extinction.
,,Looks good.,3.0,,"It looks good and feels like a forest full of plants and flowers but unfortunately for a person who has no interest in botany, this is plain boring. I did not feel it was worth the money spent simply because I dont take much interest in flowers."
,,Wonderful Selection of Flower,5.0,,"Loved Gardens by the Bay. This had flowers which we see often in our area of the world, California, but the lay out was terrific and the many species of cacti was incredible, loved all the sculptures"
,,Really wonderful,5.0,,"We visited the Flower dome on a 2 day stopover on our way to Europe, on the way back we were meeting our Daughter, her Husband and our Grand Daughter there, when we suggested we go they were a little ho hum, we were keen to go again.
They were totally Blown Away, it really is a Must See, I won't try and describe the Dome but let my photos try to give you an idea."
,,Plants from around the world,5.0,,"Where else can you find an assortment of plants form around the world in one place? Not quite as enjoyable as the Cloud Forest dome, but nonetheless a must do attraction. The range of plants on display is simply amazing and there is plenty of room to fit a large number of people. Certainly recommend taking your camera with you"
,,Exquisite,5.0,,Had a cool tour of the dome with exotic to exquisite flowers and plants.. very well maintained. Could have segregated it in a better wat nevertheless worth the visit. Considering the outside temperature is very cold( required for overall maintenance) so one needs to wear something warm. The coffee shop provides you excellent beverage though
,,good for nature lover,4.0,,very relaxing and informative. bring the whole family to enjoy and relax. don't miss going to the Gardens by the Bay.
,,Impressive selection of plants,4.0,,"My first visit to the Flower Dome last week, having recently taken advantage of the half price annual pass. A great selection of plants and flowers to be seen and quite remarkable that the whole place is air-conditioned under a large dome with views of the city in the background."
,,A nice place to visit.,4.0,,"We had decided before we even got to Singapore that we wanted to visit Gardens by the Bay and we were not disappointed. Upon arrival, you can choose if you want to do the Flower Dome and/or the Cloud Forrest. There's a handy shuttle (small fee incurred) which will take you from the entrance directly to the Flower Dome. Certainly worth a visit if in Singapore as the displays are wonderful and beautifully maintained."
,,Very impressive collection of plants,5.0,,"Singapore's flower dome really is a sight to behold. It's such a strange feeling to be standing in the middle of humid Singapore in a freezing cold dome.
They have a wonderful variety of flowers and plants from all over the world. It's set up in regions- African, Australian, Mediterranean and the like. It's totally wheelchair accessible and very easy to navigate.

I would recommend wearing walking shoes and bring a bottle of water because you can really lose yourself in there. I went at Christmas time and they brought out all the bells and whistles to recreate a white European Christmas, which was very impressive.
The Flower dome is really worth it, just to see the sheer variety of plants all put together a esthetically. Stunning sculptures too if you look hard enough."
,,The Flower Garden is Amazing,4.0,,This flower garden is very impressive and also amazing because the beautiful garden is so beautiful with ditabuei various kinds of flowers that are blooming and beautiful. The flowers adorn every corner and yard in the flower garden in this room. Flower Dome is very beautiful visited by day and night.
,,Perfect retreat from the heat.,5.0,,Air conditioned building with wonderful plants to see and explore. $16 for an adult but if you enjoy plants it's well worth a visit and escape the heat for a while.
,,Amaze You,5.0,,A must place to visit in Singapore and will chill you from the humid weather. You can find many spot to take selfie with ur family. Two thumbs up.
,,"Wanna stay longer, bring coats",5.0,,It is colder by time you stay long as it is indoor flower dome. And you won't regret even if you go twice or more as they always change their decoration day by day. Must go if you visit Singapore. Admission fee is also reasonable.
,,Lovely Gardens.,4.0,,"Nice colourful gardens that have changing themes as the seasons change. Blue was the theme when we went, so we saw hydrangeas and agapanthus aplenty."
,,Large Floral displays in Asia,4.0,,"Easily spent up to 3-4 hours for walk or so wandering around inside, enjoying cool air-environment, amazing flowers and wood carvings. Many varieties of plants, foggy, plants atmosphere which is created artificially beauty. Is it always so crowded here?

It's a great manmade & well-management horizontal florist attractions business"
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Loved the way the flowers are organised into regions of the world as you wander through. Lots of variety and stunningly laid out.

I have to say it made me realise how lucky we are in New Zealand as many of the flowers in the dome I have seen at home there. For this reason the Cloud Forest Dome was my favourite of the 2 - very different flowers and greenery to home so a more unique experience for me.

Having said that I still thoroughly enjoyed the Flower Dome and both are well worth a visit."

,,alice in flowerland?,3.0,,"tons of flower varieties, for flowers lover this place might be a magnet, don't touch or pick the flower let them bloom alone, good for macro photography, I got many there"
,,"Beautiful, a must see sight, and air-conditioned too!",5.0,,"You just have to go here, it is beautiful to walk around, lots of stunning plants/flowers to see, and sculptures too - look out for Alice in Wonderland and Winnie the Pooh hiding in the flower beds. It is separated into different gardens from around the world, so there is an Australian garden, a mediterenean garden, an English garden etc They have a central display which they change every few months, and my goodness it is impressive. I've seen it when it was orchid themed, and there were just so many orchids everywhere that is was stunning, the same thing when they had a tulip theme a different time that I went. You'll get some great photographs here. Also, it is air-conditioned, a great bonus, a reprieve from the Singapore humidity for a few hours. The admission fee is good value, really, don't miss this place."
,,Beauty at its best,5.0,,"This place is full of so many beautiful flowers ,plants and trees from around the world.It fills you with immense happiness.Its a huge done having plants arranged according to different areas like that from California,Africa,India so on and so forth.I saw the Baobab tree for the first time"

,,Must with cloud forest!,5.0,,The beauty and the collection of amazing variety really makes me envía. I wish I had as much of our fraction of the collection!
,,The wife was right again,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit. Catch the MRT to Bayfront and walk to Flower Dome. My wife and I loved it. It has air conditioning which is a relief from the heat. The gardens are amazing. Make sure that you include a visit to the Cloud Forest.
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,"Like the Cloud Dome, just do it! You won't be disappointed. It's an amazing achievement in man's ability to create and maintain such an amazing structure. Another must do and must see in Singapore."
,,Colour and beauty,5.0,,"What ever you do make time to visit gardens by the bay, this dome is really the number two but still worth your visit start here and you won't be let down and make sure you take a camera."
,,Man made green house. Amazing plants and garden structures.,4.0,,"Enjoy the dome, many different trees and plants. Nice to review them, if you willing to pay to get in."
,,Very good,5.0,,"This was the best part of Gardens by the bay . Huge green house, with gardens and ornaments representing different foliage around the world. Airconditioned too."
,,Great Blue Theme,5.0,,"My second time in 6 months. THis time, I enjoyed the blue flower theme with the blue and violet variety flowers. I also learned the environment friendly practice of this dome plus its energy saving engineering. The cold ness comed from the gloor where chilled water are circulated, so the coolness comes from the floor. Therefore the temperature here is 22 degree C with dry humidity. The glass is made for maximum coolness thru heat deflections."
,,Flower Dome is Very Interesting,4.0,,This is next to the Cloud Forest in the Gardens by the Bay and is worth the visit. It provides many different climatic areas with the flowers that are part of that climate. It is amazing that you can see all of this under one dome roof. They say it is the worlds largest green house and it surely must be. It is delightful walk with many beautiful flowers along the way. Very interesting place to visit.
,,Deservedly one of the top sites in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited here with our young family (8, 5, 3yr olds) and had a wonderful time! Such a cool design! The dome is air-conditioned which provides a very pleasant environment for a walk through these beautiful gardens. I can imagine it would be packed on weekends, so we visited on a Wednesday afternoon.

The kids enjoyed the wander for an hour or so and we broke up the stroll with a snack and a drink at Pollen restaurant (great, but not for the budget conscious!).

What was fun was to choose some flower varieties for each of the kids to spot/hunt out. This kept them entertained while we soaked in the spotless beauty."
,,It's a Must to Enter this Flower Dome,4.0,,"What you expect in this flower dome, a vast collection of flowers, combined with the neat and wonderful arrangement in the dome. It's a humongous garden you never see everywhere."
,,Good,4.0,,Very good place. Clean. Management was good. Nice best place to visit. Nice view from dome. It is cool from inside thats better
,,pretty,5.0,,very pretty place and the flowers are changed season to season. quite nice to go when they bring in tulips or sakura exhibitions.
,,No. 1 best place in the Gardens by theBay,5.0,,"If i was to choose which dome I would visit I would choose this one over Cloud Forest Dome. I love the flowers, the plant art and I can just see myself just sitting and staring all day :)"
,,Sister of cloud forest,3.0,,"This attraction is a sister of the cloud forest, same thing, they recreated another habitat inside Singapore to lure tourist."
,,Truly beautiful!!,5.0,,Gardens from all around the world (including and Australian garden) are all located under a glass dome in a controlled environment. Very well done but you must also allow time to stay after dark for the light show at the Supertree Grove.
,,Well worth the trip.,4.0,,A great experience for young and old to see the beauty of different countries under one roof. The experience is both educational and beautiful. Enjoy the outing.
,,Wow,5.0,,It is really beautiful... with loads and loads of flowers... itz like entering a fairy land. Must see.
,,Very Good,5.0,,"We paid S$28pp to enter both greenhouses. We visited in the late afternoon and then went to see the free lightshow at dusk. Lots of interesting flowers, trees and succulents. Well worth a visit and a must see place in Singapore."
,,Chilled out gardens,4.0,,"Nice place to spend an hour or so, split into a few different gardens, mostly planted with either cacti or in a Mediterranean style. More formal than the Cloud Forest and a bit less spectacular as a result, still very pleasant though. If you only have time for one I would say the cloud forest is the better experience."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Don't miss the flower Dome we visited when it was the blue theme - spent 3 hours in this dome alone - congratulations to the workers and volunteers.
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,"Just visited while their blue flower festival was on, truely amazing, it was beautifully presented and the settings were beautiful and colourful"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,One place I will go to whenever i am in Singapore. I loved everything about it and was amazed by the different kinds of beautiful flowers and succulents.
,,Amazing,5.0,,It seems that u visited all flowers around the world. It was wonderful. The smell of the flowers in the space was perfect. Nothing bad to say about this place.
,,Something special,5.0,,"Wonderful displays of gardens from many countries feature here, with many well crafted sculptures amongst them. A visual delight."
,,Flowers Flowere every where !,5.0,,"A must see attraction when in Singapore. Just don't miss it. A wide variety of flowers all around the dome makes this garden very unique.No words can describe the feeling one experiences while talking a walk inside the Dome.Plan atleast 3-4 hours to enjoy this garden.One can club the visit to Flower Dome , Cloud forest and Super Tree Grove together.The best would be to start after an early lunch and visit all 3 places as there are all next to each other."
,,Flowers and amazing art,4.0,,"The flower displays are fantastic, but what caught my eye was the vast array of art and the uniqueness of those pieces in the dome. Take you time, there are many easy to overlook. Compared to Singapore and the Cloud Forest, you may find it a bit cool, so have a light sweater so you don't feel the urge to leave too soon."
,,A walk through world's nature,4.0,,It was such a nice place to walk around and learn about the nature. There were a lot of different kinds of fauna and flora from all around the world. We loved the baobap from Africa and the Californian garden which was beautiful to us. There were also many nice spots to take pictures.
,,Not just for flower lovers,5.0,,Riot of colour but not just flowers in the ground. Set out in areas and themes so walking from one amazing area to another. I thoroughly enjoyed and I am not an gardener
,,Nice place to walk around and relax,4.0,,"Its a great place to get out of the heat during the day. Enjoy some of the spectacular vegetation from all over the world. Great place to take photos of flours and even for people who aren't interest by flowers it is still nice to walk around. There are a few great spot to take a nice couple photo.
Buy ticket online either on their official website or third-party to skip the queue at the ticket area."
,,Nighttime visit,5.0,,There has obviously been a huge amount of effort and skill gone into this flower done and it was very beautiful. There was some beautiful statues and adornments throughout the dome.
,,Pretty place,4.0,,"It is nicely designed garden inside a dome. One can easily spend couple of hours there, looking at all the fauna and flora."
,,Nice Greenhouse,5.0,,"This is one of the two greenhouse in Garden by the Bay, this greenhouse display flower the most. It makes the greenhouse colourful, tourists are relax in the house"
,,Great if You're into Flowers,3.0,,"We had comp passes for the two main exhibits at GBTB. This place has an amazing number of species, geographically grouped. I'll confess that I know precious little about flowers, so other than the overall beauty of the place and the great air con, a lot was lost on me.

If you're into flowers, by all means this should be high on your list, along with the National Orchid Garden at the Singapore Botanical Gardens. If you're not into flowers, then you ban probably safely skip here, although, as noted, the air con is heavenly."
,,We have Tulip Show,4.0,,"We have a great time there. My parents, unusually, taking pictures from their smartphones like young explorers."
,,A must to visit,5.0,,"As I mentioned earlier in my review Gardens of the Bay, this is a place to visit just to enjoy the atmosphere and every gardeners delight."
,,Don't diss / miss it,5.0,,"I dislike fake environments so I was ready to diss the supertrees, the cloud forest and the flower dome.

I have been the to the flowerdome 5-6 times in the last few years. Just when i thought I'd seen everything with the usual temperate spring flowers, I heard about the cherry blossom displays. Being a regular visitor to Tokyo's parks during cherryblossom season (at least once a year) I felt I didn't need to check out the cherry blossom displays at the flower dome. I mean-why bother?

This year I had to miss Tokyo in springtime and decided to get my cherry blossom fix in Singapore.

My goodness. It was impressive. The variety! The colours ! The sheer number of trees. I even pretended I was in Tokyo. The visitors loved it. I loved it.

I also visited in April when there was a tulip display. The varieties of tulips were amazing !

Come one, come all -don't miss the flower dome.

There are some lovely restaurants there-one within the dome and a chinese one just outside. They are not easy on the pocket but the food is fantastic.

If you rode on a little tram from the ticketing area (near bayfront subway) to the flower dome/cloud forest and paid for a return journey, please note that once the flower dome /cloud forest closes, there would be no trams travelling back to the original location. Best to leave the flower dome / cloud forest an hour before closing to ensure you get to ride on the tram.

Avoid heels, your feet will thank you."
,,nice,5.0,,"must visit place. its very beautiful, so many flowers, colourful flower. it takes 1hour to explore this place."
,,One of the reasons to visit the big garden,5.0,,The outside area is beautiful and cool but the real treat are the domes! You should really but tickets to both of them but my favourite is the cloud forest!
,,Flower dome - Stands to its name.,5.0,,A must visit place. Varieties of flowers are grown and maintained here. You could separately see the flowers of each country wise and the location offers multiple and good photographic places. Whole place is well Maintained with air conditioned structures. Offers a breathtaking view.
,,Amazing to see,5.0,,Bought the joint ticket for the flower dome and the rain forest. The rainforest is more breathtaking but the flower dome is great and very educational. The only down side is you have to pay extra for the tram from the entrance to the dome and i feel as a courtesy this should either be free or inbuilt into the ticket costs. Well worth a visit though
,,Beautiful Flowers...,5.0,,"Since it was just right beside the Cloud Forest and I missed visiting this during my first visit, I really planned to include this in my list during my second visit to Singapore. What more can you ask for when you are a flower lover! You have a take a look at this conservatory in order to appreciate how they have taken cared of these different kinds of species of flowers from other parts of the world!"
,,Nothing special,2.0,,Appreciating the efforts but coming from a place full of greenery the experience was disappointing. Better to visit botanical and orchid gardens unless you have nothing else to do or need air-conditioned garden experience.
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"The flower dome has an amazing range of gardens and flowers, it was very busy when we visited but we still enjoyed it. Worth visiting as a package combined with the Cloud Forest Dome"
,,Nice relaxing place.,4.0,,Visited here on a Sunday afternoon visit to both domes 28 sgn $ . Very busy but no big queues to get tickets. Lovely place with huge array of plants from all over the world. Great colour here so bring camera plenty of photos. Really relaxing no set plan explore at your leisure. Some fantastic obscure wooden sculptures here. Recommended for lazy afternoon.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,There's so much to look at here! Some parts were quite busy with people taking photos. It's worth getting a combined ticket to this and the Cloud Forest.
,,Unique architecture,4.0,,"Good destination for you with your love, your wife, your kids, n family! Beautiful Flowers and plants in a big dome.. there are so many flowers and plants but isn't complete yet.."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Such a beautiful place to walk around and see all the various flower displays sorted out in groups of countries .
,,It feels like spring,5.0,,"Bring your thin sweater because the temperature inside is a bit cold. Like 18 C I think, It really feels like spring because of the low temperature and beautiful flowers.
If you want to save money you can buy the ticket online by your local online vendors. I bought the ticket to both Flower Dome and Cloud Dome for $20 instead of $28 if you buy right there. And with this kind of ticket you dont have to queue, because the line is different. Mostly tour guides are on this line.
After seeing how well they maintain the flowers and objects surroundings, the ticket price is totally worth it. Even the flowers outside dome are nice."
,,An assortment of flowers,3.0,,The flower dome is an assortment of many different flowers from various countries but I guess you have to go there at the right time if year to see flowers blooming. It didn't seem to be that interesting when we went but for others it's probably okay so for this reason it's only worth a 3 for me.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Loved the flower dome. We went at night and the lights were so pretty. Air conditioning was good. I really enjoyed this. I preferred this over the cloud forest although that was also good.
,,There's A/C here! Yay,5.0,,"Beautiful place worth the admission. Plus when it's hot and muggy outside, what better place to spend your time amongst amazing flora.
Tip: 1. Cloud forest is a separate charge. You can buy 1 ticket for both.
2. There is a restaurant inside. Very classy.
3. Take your time here."

,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,What a amazing experience. Beautiful didplayed plants in a enclosed and controlled environment. Allow yourself a good 45 minutes to relaxing stroll thru with classical music in the background. If you have time stop at The Pollen for morning tea or lunch. Lovely spot.
,,Well worth seeing,4.0,,"Even if gardens are not your thing, the inside gardens here are quite fascinating to see. They also often have a changing and varied set of special displays. The dome next door is a bit more impressive, but this one is good to relax and wander in (also air conditioned so a nice escape from the outside as well!)."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is so beautiful! They change the theme and flowers every few months. I love going during easter because they have tulips. Go late in the afternoon and stay for the free light show at the man grove trees. The light show is also a must see!!
,,Cold atmosphere inside!,5.0,,"Super range of flowers including wide variety of roses, palms, orchids etc all inside the air conditioned enclosure. The temperature inside the dome is cold and very comforting away from the outside heat and humidity. Easily accessible from Bay Front MRT."
,,"Fantastic, beautiful flowers and plants",5.0,,This was great. The two main themes of Mediterranean Climates and Plants in different parts of the world and Van Gogh and his paintings depicted in flowers were brilliantly done.
,,Cool !,5.0,,Flower Dome in the Gardens by the Bay is the main attraction with all major variety of flowers including the Tulip in a conservatory. Beautiful concept & very well maintained place. Much better than expected.
,,Very interesting plant display.,5.0,,"Enjoyed walking around plant displays. They have an area for each continent of the world. Many rare and spectacular plants and trees. The dome is airconditioned, so very comfortable to walk around in."
,,A nice experience,3.0,,"Located within the 'Gardens by the bay', the Flower Dome is one of two domes in this garden. A cooling escape from Singapore's heat & humidity. It's a nice walk around and see the flowers, but definetely do this before visiting the Cloud Forest, as that dome is much more impressive."
,,Flower Power,4.0,,"THe coolness of the conservatory welcomes visitors as we entered the Flower Dome. There were large, interesting trees and statues that are pleasing to the eyes. The colorful flowers were a sight to see. It was easy to navigate the different areas in the dome."
,,"Too artificial, too clean, too nice: not my cup of tea.",2.0,,"Just like the Cloud Forest, possibly even more this was a disappointment. I love gardens don't get me wrong. This was a series of boring repetitive landscaping elements with many different flowers but with out any magic or charm. All too manicured, to pristine, without any imagination without anything braking the cookie cutter style of presentation. Poor plants, they were totally denatured in this absolutely artificial environment."
,,Gorgeous flowers,4.0,,"There is a huge range of stunning flowers. The flower dome was very busy at the time we went, so we had to weave in and out of large tour groups."
,,Colourful Flowers welcomes..,5.0,,Good place with lot of flowers. A mini botanical garden experience. Its the mix of the AC and the Sunlight which makes it a perfect destination.. Colourful flowers welcome you to the fantastic city of Singapore..
,,Wonderful plants and flowers,5.0,,"This is one of the two domes part of Gardens at the Bay. Flower Dome contains hundreds of different plants and flowers which I oddly found myself enjoying as I wondered around - I'm not a gardening type or anything. The dome is organised into different sections by continent / areas, and information boards explain some of the ecosystem. Add this place to your to do list!"
,,magnificent,5.0,,"a beautiful place cool , with plenty to see so many wonderful plants plenty of places to rest and enjoy the smells and sights"
,,"It's great, but the CLOUD DOME is MIND BLOWING",4.0,,"Listen, I know you want to go to both the cloud dome and the flower dome. Don't get me wrong, the flower dome is pretty. Calling it ""average"" would frankly be a sin. However, if the flower dome is a cupcake, the cloud dome would literally be compared to the best dessert you could have ever envisioned in your entire life. So pay for both if you like, but go to the flower dome first, so the cloud dome can blow you away later. Or, if you can only choose one, choose the cloud dome instead of the flower dome. The cloud dome had WAY more flowers than the flower dome did in my opinion."
,,Plants of the world,5.0,,"Relaxing and impressive. Beautiful music, can enjoy a coffee/drinks and even something to eat. Achieved an impressive effort to showcase plants from different areas across the globe as if in natural state."
,,Beautiful display of flowers from around the world,4.0,,This dome was full of flowers from all parts of the world and although I'm not massively into flowers it was well thought out and very picturesque
,,Recommend,5.0,,This was great value at $16sin and would recommend. The flowers were beautiful but the statues and details added to the experience
,,Skip it,3.0,,"Compared to the Cloud Forest, this was a bit of a disappointment. All too mumsy. Lots of flowers and plants from all over the world. Good, but if you have time or money for one, choose the Cloud Forest over this."
,,Tulip Festival,5.0,,"We are very fortunate that when we visit here it is there Tulip Festival. It is an amazing place to feature the flowers and plants around the world, amazing experience for us, it is a tiring walk around but worthed"
,,Amazing,5.0,,The display is gorgeous. We went two years ago and was amazed at how much everything has grown. A delight to see with flower displays changed regularly.
,,The World is Your Flower,5.0,,If you love flowers come here. An amazing display of living plants and flowers. It is cool in here so iut ius a good place to come on the hot day.
,,Beautiful in every way!,5.0,,"We had a lovely experience absorbing and relaxing in the flower dome. From the moment you walk into the dome you are greeted with cool, relaxing and sweet smelling air. Truly an amazing experience. I felt like this dome was more family friendly with the cafe/restaurant available and more areas to sit. Recommended to all!"
,,Very pretty!,4.0,,"There are Gardens from lots of different countries represented in the Flower Dome. When we were there the Tulips blooming in the lower section of the Dome were gorgeous. We enjoyed our visit to the Dome, and probably spent about 45 minutes in there."
,,Nice but boring,2.0,,"It was a very nice area but I was hoping for a colourful experience instead there was a lot of greenery, after going to the National Orchid garden this was a massive let down. It is a lot cooler looking place but is really all style over substance."
,,"FLOWER DOME - The Beautiful Garden In Central City, Singapore",5.0,,"There are 2 giant glass houses at The Gardens By The Bay (Singapore), one is located next to the other. Both facades are of irregular hyperbolic shape. One glass house is higher than the other. If the higher one is a mountain, then the other one is a hill. You can also say that they look like giant ocean waves.

The lower glass house is FLOWER DOME & the higher one is CLOUD FOREST. Together with the SUPER TREE GROVE they form the famous award winning THE GARDENS BY THE BAY.

The FLOWER DOME occupies 1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) of land & is a 38-metre (125 ft) high glass house. If that is not impressive enough, then you must also know that the construction has NO supporting column at all.

Once you step into it, you are at a constant 23 °C to 25 °C environment throughout.

The Flower Dome has a great collection of flowers & plants displayed in 7 different gardens (cactus garden, etc.) & a central changing display field for flower shows, all under one no-column glass-house roof.

So comfortable that for me, half a day is too short to be in FLOWER DOME alone. You will need another day to visit CLOUD FOREST which is just opposite."
,,Not worth the hype,3.0,,"The flower dom is nice if you are not European,the flowers they show are mainly our gardens flowers or some thing you see in our free parks every where"
,,Superb floral display,5.0,,"This attraction at Gardens by the Bay is truly breathtaking. The designs and layout of the magnificent ""gardens"" is to be commended. A ""feast"" of colours and varieties of flowers from many countries is spectacular. The air conditioned Dome is home to the world's largest glass greenhouse! A superb attraction."
,,Definitely worth visiting the Flower Dome - what a treat for your eyes!,5.0,,"When I arrived in Singapore I didn't know what the Flower Dome was but there was a deal at the airport so I got it. I was not disappointed. This place is supreme in terms of design and arrangement. You walk through various garden types, including an Australian Garden. I loved it and would highly recommend this along with the Cloud Forest."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The flowers were beautiful, and it was a nice place to take a walk. However, it wasn't nearly as exciting after walking through the Cloud Forest first. Still worth a visit. Bring a light sweater, these places have very cold A/C!"
,,Always change time to time,5.0,,Its always different flower every time I visit the garden. Last time if Im not mistaken is the Tulip garden. Now the sun flower garden and the style of the garden is the Chinese New Year style.
,,One of Singapore's special attractions.,5.0,,These relatively new exhibits in the Gardens by the Bay area are very well done. A very interesting display.
,,Great for walks and sight seeing,4.0,,Nice to see all these greeneries and take a walk with your loved ones. Look out for certain seasonal changes.
,,Fantastic way to escape the Sinagpore heat,5.0,,"The flower dome is one of the three ‘big’ attractions of Singapores iconic ‘gardens by the bay’. Located in a fully enclosed and airconditioned greenhouse the flower dome displays plants from the worlds five 'microclimates', as well as a large and everychanging flower display on the bottom floor. When we visited we were lucky enough to see the Tulip display which was inspired by Van Goughs work.

Here are a few things you might find helpful if you are planning on visiting here
1) As mentioned above the flowerdome is located in a airconditioned glass greenhouse with temperatures in the low 20’s. This means it not only provides a cool reprieve from singapores often unrelenting heat but can also be visited during a rainy day.
(2) Open 0900 to 2100 so can be visited day or night.
(3) Although entry to gardens by the bay is free, it costs 28 dollars for entry into both the flower dome and the cloudforest. If you are a tourist I would suggest visiting both.
(4) To get here via the MRT go to bayfront. You can connect to this on the yellow line or switch to it from Marina Bay on the red line.

It takes around 1.5 hours to visit this attraction. If is worth combining with the other attractions of the gardens by the bay (cloudforest and supertree groove). The later has an impressive light show at 1945 so coming here late afternoon and sticking around into the early evening is definitely an option."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"It looks surreal. We can't get enough, I already went there 2012, but last March 2017 I went there 2 more times. I love the place very enchanting."
,,Get tickets before you leave for Singapore.,5.0,,Go early to miss the crowd & make it a full day outing if you wish to see it all. Plenty of places to have a sit down as you venture through the dome.
,,Great TOURIST experience,5.0,,If you are a 1st timer in Singapore this is a must see. I love the flower dome and how it has different theme each time. My husband loved the cloud forest the most. It would be better to visit during the weekdays.
,,The flowers are devine,5.0,,"If you love flowers, or even like them this is a must visit.It is simply beautiful. Even my kids enjoyed the walk thoroughly."
,,A must go,5.0,,"Enjoy the flower dome, but get ready a jacket cause it is quite cold in there. The fine dining is not bad. If you dine in the fine dining restaurant, then you will get a complimentary ticket to visit the flower dome, otherwise it is chargeable."
,,A must see!,5.0,,"The flower dome is done beautifully.
It's definitely a must see and worth every penny.
It's so well looked after and the flowers are just stunning. The added bits round the flowers (ornaments etc) are such a lovely touch.
We had a great day out seeing this. Puts the Eden project in the UK to shame. They are incomparable."
,,A beautiful place,5.0,,"I went there last summer. There are two beautiful domes next to each other on a re-claimed land. Both domes are worth a visit. If you are a local, you can visit one dome at a time (at a lower fee). If you are not a local, you must buy the tickets for both domes, even you do not have time/money to visit both at the same time."
,,One of the best flower garden,5.0,,Excellent Tulips. My wife love flowers and she was in awe of it. She loved in totally and me too. Must visit
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"Worth every penny we pay. The place is so clean and very well maintained. The atmosphere was exactly like walking in a fairy land(Night time) in the mist and flowers everywhere. The beautifully decorated shrubs and creepers are amazing. The statues in the garden is amazing and a photo spot. Romantic, peaceful and enchanting with those rare flowers and plants. A must visit place when in Singapore. It takes just 45 minutes to walk through and take pics. Kids especially will love this place."
,,Gardens Galore,4.0,,This is another great place to hit at the Gardens on the Bay. Get tickets to all the attractions you won't be sorry.
,,Totally Stunning!,5.0,,"This is a ""must see"" if at Gardens by the Bay. It is the largest glass greenhouse in the world, with flowers from all over world. The variation of tulips is amazing, and this is an attraction that all ages would enjoy. The way they have displayed all the different flower/plant areas is very well done."
,,A must see along with nearby cloud forest,5.0,,The plants are from all over the world and are laid out in an imaginative and attractive fashion with beautiful sculptures scattered throughout. Wonderful experience
,,Well-laid out displays of plants from different regions of the world,3.0,,"The plants were extremely diverse, some were clearly extremely old. There was re-organisation going on when we visited which was a restriction. Our main disappointment was that very few of the individual plants were labelled which was a shame when they had gone to so much effort."
,,A lovely place to visit.,5.0,,"With a reasonable entrance fee, this was a lovely place to visit. The displays of plants and flowers were geographically themed and visually very impressive and very interesting."
,,Best of the best,5.0,,Was lucky to go in May and got to see their tulips. This is the best part of the gardens by the bay and truly worht every penny.
,,Amazing,5.0,,So glad I went. We had to choose between this or the Cloud Forest. This place is just beautiful. Went while they were having Tulip Festival. Tulips were just beautiful and aroma was wonderful. Had tulips around Van Gough art.
,,ever evolving like the country itself,5.0,,went during the sakura season in April. it was amazing to see sakuras after sakuras. flowers were all well displayed. i must say the management behind made a lot of effort in all the logistics of these flowers.
,,unique outing arrangement,5.0,,"i brought my date there, on our first outing date! its was cooling!! no need to worry about the humidity that u'll be facing."
,,Tulipmania was on...,5.0,,Such a wide variety of plants and beautiful sculptures all over. Very calm and beautiful place to visit. Tulipmania was on and the colours were just awesome.
,,Beauiful,5.0,,I wen the when the Vincent Van Gogh tulip exhibition was on. It was amazing. They have different exhibitions and themes during the year. This is a must go.
,,Overrated garden,2.0,,"For the cost of the experience, its disappointing. They charge seperately for the audio tour. this should be included in the ticket price .I have seen better displays of flowers for free. Its just a glorified green house that you will see in any country. If it were not for the cloud forest, i would have called it a rip off!"
,,Delightful walk amongst the plants,5.0,,"This dome is part of the Gardens by the Bay. We took the train here to save our feet (aching hugely from two days of walking) and saw this in the afternoon.

Lots of different areas to walk around in - Mediterranean, Australian, South African etc. Loved it all. Has been beautifully done with lots of ""pictures"" formed from works of art and sculpture surrounded by plants. My camera went wild.

We saw the tulip festival while we were there, but by the time you read this, they'll no doubt have something else as equally amazing. I'm jealous!

Go and enjoy, it's worth every second and cent."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The flowers are wonderful. They have tulip form all colors that you can imamgine. The have plants and tree from Africa and onter part of the contry. There is a history of Van Gogh very intersting. He sculptures are fantastic.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A part of Garden by The Bay, full of flowers from 5 continents of the earth. Chilled inside and very good for family time spending. You can enjoy good view of Merina Bay from there."
,,Flower in Tulip Season,5.0,,We were extremely lucky to visit the Flower Dome during their recent Tulip display. What an amazing display it was with so many varieties and colours to dazzle the eyes. Some done in Rembrandt type of displays were magnificent. There were also displays of native plants from many continents and countries. The care and presentation of the displays was an art unto itself. If future displays are as half as good as this then it is worth a visit for sure. Note the 10% discount available to Singapore Airline boarding pass holders.
,,Beautiful and cooling,5.0,,Now is the season of the tulips and it's really beautiful. Photographers will have a good time taking photos here. Anyone would enjoy seeing the different flowers that are so rare and not grown in this part of the world.
,,So many beautiful flowers...if a little crowded,4.0,,"Crowded, refreshing with pretty flowers and harbour views. I also enjoyed the sculptures of animals and mythical creatures made from tree vines that decorated the gardens. Gardens looked great and were well organised.

They helped us to take a picture.

We suggest you to bring jacket, the temperature is set just like early spring."
,,Cool,4.0,,They had a tulip exhibit linked with Van Gough which was cool but actually the rest of it is also stunning. There are beautiful flowers and statues everywhere. The only think that I could mark down was it is just so busy.... I went later in the day before the light show and I think everyone else had the same idea. It was too busy for me to properly enjoy but I still did see how beautiful it was.
,,Impressive beds of flowers,4.0,,The amount of effort needed to maintain the climate and the upkeep of the flowers is mind boggling. Great to visit at least once in your life.

,,Good for Photo Op,4.0,,"If you are looking to get great photographs of beautiful flowers, then you must visit this place. When we went, there was a tulipmania inspired setting, with many different colored tulips and it looked great. If you are also interested in learning about the plants in different parts of the world, there are signs and details around which give you good information. Can be given a miss, if you are strapped for time though."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"We were here during the tulip showing. It was quite beautiful and the place smelled amazing. Plan your time here when you want to cool down from the outside.

,,Enjoyed every moment in the Flower Dome,5.0,,"What a place! The Flower dome exceeded my expectations with such great display and diversity of plants; from the peculiar Baobabs to cute succulents, stunning sakura and wise old olive trees, complete with gigantic wooden sculptures and modern art. The air conditioned dome makes for such a temperate 'weather' for walking. Plants are all kept in fantastic conditions with interesting snippets of facts. Look out for their special display - for the month of April was a tribute to Van Gogh with beds of tulips lovely hues. Fantastic attraction for the family and half day out."
,,Vincent Van Gough Tulips Tribute,4.0,,"The colours are truly amazing with so many beautiful varieties on show. Try not to get caught with the crowd that starts taking pictures at the start of the entrance, move further into the dome and it just so pretty.

,,The collection of plants is incredible,5.0,,"The Flower Dome, a very large glasshouse with multiple gardens, had just installed the Christmas decoration, complete with fake snow, giant snow globe and Christmas music... rather kitschy. The collection of plants is incredible. I was amazed by the size of the saguaros and baobabs. It also houses a lovely restaurant."
,,Outstanding attraction,5.0,,This is an outstanding attraction as part of the Gardens by the Bay complex. You can buy a ticket for this attraction along with its companion the Cloud Forest. You can also buy a ticket to get a shuttle to the Flower dome and this only costs a few dollars more and is worth it given the frequency of rain in Singapore
,,lucky to witness the TULIPS,5.0,,we were lucky that the special display of Tulips were on the display during our visit ..amazing varieties ..nicely maintained...sections dedicated to different gardens/ floral species all over the world...buy ticket in advance thru ur hotel or the tourist info centre and avail discount than standing in the que s

,,Beautifully presented modern and elegant,5.0,,"A one stop shop that took us through the Flower Dome, Water Cloud and outside gardens. Truly amazing. I can't explain any more about how beautiful they were. Even hubby was impressed! We took our time as it is a big site going from one to the other, allow minimum 2 hours to see most of the gardens. I had a back problem but managed to get around very well, lots if nice places to rest and take in the sights. Definitely recommend finishing off outside at night to see the stunning tree gardens. Restaurants, transport is all there. A bit of a wait for a taxi when leaving but that's expected if you go at peak times."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,We visited when the tulips were on slow. Very impressive. Singapore really does these attractions well. Clean well planted and great variety of plants and sculptures. Well worth combining with Cloud dome.

,,Nice place for a nice date - expensive 16SGD each,5.0,,You can bring your girl or boy friend on this dome and just talk about anything under the sun. It is airconditioned and there is a nice view everywhere you look. This is expensive though so only if you have a budget.
,,Fantastic Flora,5.0,,"Truly impressive collection of flowers, plants and trees from around the world.
We were lucky to have seen the exhibit of tulips which were flown in from Holland.

I couldn't pick one favorite flower, as there were many beautiful varieties to see. Simply breathtaking to see them all at one time.

The baobab trees were memorable. Short, extremely round trunks. Cute trees from Africa.

I recommend staying in this attraction for 1-1.5 hrs. Don't rush from one area to another. Take your time walking around, while enjoying the beautiful arrangements of flora. Guaranteed to remove your stress."
,,Spectacular and a must-see,5.0,,"Singapore has many must see attractions but this is also a definite in that category. The beauty of the entire experience and the way it is organized is fantastic. We were ""ooing and ahing"" ( not a word but an expression) throughout and all of the family enjoyed it.
Dont forget to visit!"
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"We recently visited the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay as a way to escape the heat/ humidity. What a wonderful place to cool down! They have magnificent displays of gardens and plants from different countries. When we visited, their feature was Holland so of course there were just about every colour tulip you could imagine. Quite stunning. We enjoyed tea and cake at ""Pollen"" which was lovely but expensive (around SG$25 for 1 piece of cake and 1 pot of tea)
Glad we went for a look!"
,,Beautiful display of plants and flowers,4.0,,"A very nice indoor display of various plants and flowers from various parts of the world. When I was there, there was a tulip display arranged to be part of a Van Gogh painting. My only complaint is the descriptions of the plants could have been more thorough and complete. Personally, I liked the Cloud Forest next door better, but both are worth the visit."
,,Did Not See,4.0,,Going by what others have told me is a great place too go and see and experience so would be worth going too
,,Riot of Colours,5.0,,Its an unique experience and a visual delight to walk around the flower dome and the sheer diversity of the flora from all around the world will enthrall you.
,,Best display of more than just flowers,5.0,,"Wondered through this magical place that took you to all different lands within one space. We were taken back by how many succulents there were, the many and varied species which ranged from the huge Boab trees down to ones that looked like rocks. Then you went for a journey from the familiar Australian gardens, to South America over to the Mediterranean and on to the magnificent Tulip display. Feature works of garden art by some of the Master of the Arts."
,,Wow Wow Wow,5.0,,"Never seen anything like this. Absolutely gorgeous. The dome is a superb building filled with a variety of trees, plants and flowers.

Tip: the dome is air conditioned, so end your trip here to cool down after a long walk around the Gardens."
,,Nice plants and art work,4.0,,"The flower dome is host to plants from all over the globe. During my visit they were highlighting tulip season with gorgeous displays of them. There is a restuarant inside the dome. Check to see if you need reservations. There are some stairs to climb, so be aware of that if you have any mobility issues."
,,Surprise. Surprise.,5.0,,"I initially visited the Flower Dome to see if I could get some photos for my parents who are into plants.Once there I think I got some idea of why people become avid gardeners. The design of the Dome, the presentations, the gardens from around the world, the variety of flowers and plants and the willingness of the workers there to share and help made this the one place I am so glad I got to see while in Singapore. I honestly didn’t expect to see anything like what I saw. Very professional yet down to Earth attraction."
,,Garden Lovers Worth visiting Singapore for this attraction alone,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is truly extraordinary and Singapore should be very proud of what they have achieved. It is really a marvel ! and I did not even know it existed. My only complaint is that we didn't have enough time to see and enjoy all it. How did they get the fully grown trees in here? What a masterful engineering feat also. The number and varieties of plants on show are endless. Wonderful displays also provide a knowledge of information. There are unique sculptures everywhere you turn. Be sure not to miss is if you are a garden, nature or art lover."
,,Tulip at its Best,5.0,,Try to go in afternoon hours when outside is hot. This fully air-conditioned. Will take around 1.5 to 2 hours to take a round. Awesome place and nicely designed. Previous week tulips were at its full bloom when I visited. Great place to hand around.
,,Alright,2.0,,It was alright. Doesn't worth Singapore $16 which is entry fee. Take shuttle to reach this place coz lots of walking.
,,So many flowers you begin to feel like one!,5.0,,"The Flower Dome was beautiful and very nice to walk around during the rain shower we experienced in Singapore! The Dome is basically one big space but split into separate ‘gardens’ from around the world e.g Japanese style area with cherry Blossoms, and Mexican area with Cacti etc. It was very clean inside, all plants and flowers were labelled very well, and staff were very helpful.
Try and buy a combo ticket with the Cloud Forest and OCBC Skywalk to keep costs down if you want to do all 3 experiences."
,,wonderfully built,5.0,,"always come here when visited Singapore. the last time I came, there's Dahlia Festival. there's a lot different color of dahlia flowers that I can see. But, even there's no festival, you still can see a lot of beautiful flowers. I just so love it!"

,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is breathtaking as you walk in. A massive dome filled with areas of displays from around the world. A fascinating way of seeing what grows in different countries. If you're in Singapore, and have a few hours spare, go to the Bay Gardens, and visit the domes."
,,Good place to visit for an hour,5.0,,Great to visit both this and the cloud dome (tickets can include both for better value). Extremely well kept gardens. Must see
,,A great journey through notable flowers and plants from around the world.,4.0,,"A lovely and cool display which is not particularly well laid out but also not hard to figure out.

Went there during the tulip display and was very disappointed by the number of dead and dying tulips. I was advised of their short life spans for such interesting colour varieties and the impact of so many tourists who likely get quite hands-on, but I would have expected a display of this price and calibre to have accommodated for this with suitable barriers etc as necessary.

Despite this, there were wonderful displays and great information on the different plants and flowers on display.

A well spent afternoon exploring this and the other nearby gardens and displays."
,,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,5.0,,"This is a must see, the flowers are just beautiful and there is a waterfall with flowers and other plants cascading down this waterfall. At night it is lit up and they have a light show, so do go"

There are also lots of cool wood sculptures in the gardens as well as information about the plants and ecological area they grow in.
I found it cold inside and wished I had brought a scarf or sweater. It was also very busy, but worth going."
,,Worth going in,4.0,,The tulip festival was on and really made it. After seeing the cloud dome with its lush plants it is a little disappointing as the focus is more on succulents and drier climates.

,,Fabulous place,5.0,,"Visit to the Gardens by the bay cannot be complete without visiting the 2 Air conditioned domes. There is a good collection of flowers which can be a photographers delight. The Air conditioning also provides a welcome respite from the sultry Singapore heat outside. There were a lot of Christmas related decorations during our visit.

Nice place to visit"
,,Stunning but overcrowded,4.0,,"We really wish we went when it was not so busy. This conservatory was stunning, Tulipmania at the moment, but we were put off by how many people wanted photos in with the flowers or selfies more than just admiring the flowers themselves."
,,"Man made ""natural"" paradise",5.0,,This place offers stunning flora for viewing pleasure. We were lucky enough to experience the Tulip Festival over here. There were loads of Tulips and my my! What lovely creations they are. Was amazed at the engineering of the dome as the temperature was low and it was cool for some of the plants to survive coming from a hot area.
,,A refreshing visit! Must-see!,5.0,,"Visited in August with my sister. We got our tickets from busonlinetickets (portal) and paid only $22 per person for entry to Cloud Forest & Flower Dome (which was cheaper than booking from the official website or buying at the entrance). Getting there was pretty easy, its 100-200m walk from the MRT at Marina Bay. The walking track to the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome is easy and busy, so you don't have to worry about safety, just make sure you wear comfortable shoes. At the time when we visited, there was an Orchid festival so there were various types and species of Orchids; they were colourful and simply stunning. There were many flower arches in the dome (refer to my photos), so don't miss taking photos under the arches; they're lovely. The dome is wheelchair-friendly. However, the amount of walking can be tiring, so wear good, comfortable shoes. There are many benches and places to sit in the dome, so you can always rest for abit while enjoying the view. Don't forget to look up and admire the structure!"

The climate inside will refresh your mind and soul I guess with the plentiful supply of oxygen and the pleasant aroma of flowers. The vast glass dome leaves you spellbound, it is indeed an engineering wonder."
,,Plants from all round the world !!,5.0,,"I first visited this when new and the difference in a couple of years is incredible. Even the Australian corner attracted thousands of visitors but the highlight was of course the Japanese teahouse down in the middle, with all the beautiful cherry blossoms. Look out for all the carved creatures inside and out."
,,Lovely flora. Tulips were beautiful.,5.0,,We allocated a evening for GBTB and we dont regret spending the time. Kids learnt a lot about various plants and vegetation. Dont miss the sound and light show.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Did this before we did the cloud forest dome. Just beautiful. So much to see and all in a giant and I mean giant air conditioned dome. Huge variety of plants and fully grown trees. A must see
,,Amazing display of beautiful flowers,5.0,,We came here as a mixed family group - the children had enjoyed the children's water park - difficult to tear them away but we all enjoyed the magnificent setting of these gardens.
,,Unbelievable concept,5.0,,Too good a concept to convince and then deliver . Plants collection is super -super . Like it has super views at night too . It's fully air conditioned . Can go any time during the day but ideally should go in evening to enjoy the light and sound program too .
,,An oversize plant nursery,4.0,,"I find the rare plants exhibit very fascinating. The cherry blossoms are the visitor favorite for photo shoots so there's a lot of waiting. If you do not tell anyone, I swear they will say it is in Japan. If you love gardening and flowers, you will love the Flower Dome."
,,Not that great,2.0,,The cloud forest was much better. This wasnt impressive at all. Kind of boring actually. Tried to leave after a few minures but you have to walk through all of it to leave
,,Good,4.0,,"There will be special exhibits at different points of the year. The information provided is sufficient. It's very cold inside, so do bring a jacket with you if possible. There are audio tours provided in different languages."
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,"Imagine you are in Japan and its blossom season, well why imagine, this was happening right here, when we were there, so beautiful. It really is a special place, one we were glad we went, really enjoyable and quite something.

Such a lovely experience, loved it!"
,,Excellent Flower Garden-Pleasing,5.0,,"One of the best gardens in singapore.All over this country many gardens...thanks to authority but this flower dome is unique in nature
Beatiful flowers in almost many tiers(floors) with amazing colours too
You can take as many pictures as possible here
Peaceful to mind which provide not only relax but mind blowing view all over these dome areas"
,,Amazing flower display,5.0,,Highlight was area with Vincent Van Gogh paintings displayed and tulips arranged to mimic paintings. Many exotic varieties. Excellent park.
,,Where were the flowers?!,3.0,,"I felt this dome was a bit boring. If you go into a flower dome, you expect to see lots of flowers and there were hardly any. Lots of plants but no flowers. I wasn't impressed with this at all. The cloud forest dome was much better."
,,Experience nature up close,4.0,,Nice place to hang out and experience nature....one can find varieties of cactus and other plants and tree's.... Must visit for nature lovers
,,Best Part of Gardens By the Bay,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is the best part of Gardens by the Bay. Each month they change the middle part to fit a theme from around the world. When we visited we could get to see the Cherry Blossoms and next up were the Tulips. It is nicely air conditioned so you get respite from the heat. Anyone going to Gardens by the Bay should visit the flower dome as that is the main attraction.
It can get crowded so be patient and take your time before clicking the beauties.Not too much to walk as well so old people and young children in pram too can visit."
,,Incredible sculptures - preferred it to cloud forest,4.0,,"Yes, there are fabulous flowers here, but there is also some fabulous sculpture as well.
There are magnificent beasts in weathered wood which are fascinating. There are also sculptures of ""average"" people but mysteriously only parts are visible and the result is really compelling.
Somehow the cloud forest dome was a little unfulfilling but I really loved here. I'm not a big sculpture specialist - I think everyone would love them.
Obviously if you love flowers you will get much more from that aspect, but it is visually beautiful even to the non-believers!"
,,Just WOW,5.0,,"I came here during Chinese New Year so the decor was awesome. Definitely add this to your list. It's nice and cool in the dome so you can spend at least a good 2 hours exploring this venue. If you love taking pictures, great photo opportunities here."
,,It's beautiful!,5.0,,"What a beautiful garden! Worth a visit. Do purchase the ticket on line to save your time of line up to get the ticket. If you are lucky, you are able to get a discount too."
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,"Very interesting and full of a wide range of plants, but nothing like the Cloud Forest. This is a place that is worth visiting at least once."
,,Expensive for tourist and included rude staff,3.0,,"I have been to many gardens on my travels and these were over priced and for me did not set the world on fire. There are some interesting garden art and the transplanted olive trees are impressive but on the whole these gardens weren't anywhere near as good as the Botanical Gardens which were free.

I was disappointed in the selection of Australian natives given the range of plants they had to choose from. It was as if they wanted to give the impression Australian landscape is dull - which it most certainly is not!

Staff were rude - particularly a girl who told my husband off for sitting on a step. She could see he was
Going to sit down - waited for him to sit them told him to move on.

Would not return!"
,,All the flowers,5.0,,It´s a very nice place to just walk around and enjoy all the flowers from different parts of the world.
,,Amazing collection of worlds most interesting plants and flowers,5.0,,"They are two most important attractions in the Botanical Gardens by Marina. Cloud forrest with the longest indoor waterfall and this Flower Dome. You can find there beautifuly arranged plant and flowers from all around the world. Do not miss the collections from Australia, Mediterranean, Africa or South America. The glass house is air-conditioned."
,,Flowers are all around the place,4.0,,Its having lots of flowers around and you need to take time to explore the entire place. Sometimes it could be very confusing without a proper sign of direction
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A visit to gardens by the bay is nott complete without viewing this amazing dome.
We took a cab from raffles city for only $7 and journey time was around 10 mins .
There are little themed areas from around the world each one so different.
One of the displays was being replanted and it gave you an insight into the amount of work required to maintain this amazing space
Unfortunately we visited late afternoon so didn't have much time to linger.you could quite easily spend most of the day here between both the domes and the outside space"
,,Wow. Colourful place,5.0,,A must visit place in singapore. U will really enjoy the colourful flowers and it's really a good photographic place. The dome is fully closed cool place. We really enjoyed this place.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,It's amazing how beautiful it is inside the dome full of flowers and plants. Educational at the same time.
,,Various Season,5.0,,"Flower Dome is a place of various season where you can enjoy the flowers theme by different timing, you may visit this venue more than twice a year as this place offer you different theme by different season from the world."
,,Beautiful Blossom,5.0,,We were fortunate to be in Singapore for the plum blossom extravaganza in the Flower Dome it was magnificent.
,,just opposite to cloud forest,4.0,,"if people like to see the trees and flowers in different varities they can go and enjoy since it is just infront of cloud forest and near to super tree,all 3 spot can be covered very well after lunch"
,,Feast of flowers -- tropical cornucopia with interesting nooks and crannies,4.0,,"Even if your not a passionate flower enthusiast, chances are you will enjoy a visit to this dome. Yes, it's all about the flowers, with a riot of colour spilling down the walls and walkways in every direction. But it's also a lovely stroll with interesting things to look at in various nooks and crannies. If you are a floral fan, then definitely don't miss this one. And remember your camera -- who knew there could be so man6y different types of orchard in the one place?"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,I loved the fact that I visited in the night. It was beautifully lit up and the different themes were magical. Loved it
,,A breath of fresh air ...,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens, themed areas from around the world and while we were there the theme was tulip inspirations! Access is easy, you can easily spend half a day here, but combined with the Cloud Forest and Gardens by the Bay you could spend the whole day admiring (man made) nature. Besides, it's inside so a good way to escape the heat and/or rain. $28 (Singapore $$) for both conservatories. Easy access from MRT (Harbour Front) and also walking distance from Marina Bay for dining and shopping. There's a shuttle in the gardens if needed, the auto drive shuttle was fun to see!"
,,Flower Wonderland!,5.0,,This place is magical.... So many different varieties of flowers and plants to look at and learn about. Lovely to wonder around and take lots of pictures. Would recommend doing both the flower and cloud domes whist there. Easy to access via the MRT. A must do when visiting Singapore.
,,Awesome Flower Dome,5.0,,This place is so beautiful. They have different flowers for different months. We love the colours and the place is so well maintained.
,,Flower power at it greatest,5.0,,What a tropical delight for all on natures beauty. The dome has been set up to showcase all different flower arrangements displaying gardens all over the world . A must for all as u don't even have to be a flower lover to enjoy this
,,Always something different to see.,5.0,,Was lucky to be in Singapore last week and caught the Blossom Festival at the Flower Dome. Every time I've visited there has been a different display to compliment the permanent plantings.Great place to visit with the family.
,,Interesting,5.0,,You will need a lot of time and a good camera to visit this place. Bring also a jacket to keep you warm.
,,Indoor Pretty Garden,5.0,,Impressive indoor garden for great photo. Lots of cherry trees. Worth to visit just at the garden by the bay. Better to buy combo tickets from online like ( flower dome and cloud forest) as better deal.
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"It is part of garden by the bay only. If you are a nature lover then this whole setup of garden by the bay waterfall and flower dome is a must visit for you. My recommendation would be to not take it as part of city tour but go here separately for an entire day and enjoy the place. It is beautiful, peaceful and gives you a sense of freshness. The variety of Flora and fauna is very good and they have maintained it very Nicely. It is a must visit place."
,,gardens in the mist are better,3.0,,"If you are here, make sure you visit gardens in the mist, as they are way better then these gardens."
,,Could be more flowers...,2.0,,"The Flower Dome is huge and has some quite interesting plants. However, I can only give at most 2 stars for the following reasons:

- The ticket price of 28 SGD for both the conservatories is pretty overpriced for what you get. Especially, compared to the bay south gardens outside which are free accessible.

- It was freaking cold in there, you cannot stay any longer than like half an hour. Definitely bring a jacket, if you plan to stay any longer.

- It is called ""Flower Dome"", however, the ratio of actual flowers compared to other green plants. Expecting masses of flowers, the whole ""Flower Dome"" looked pretty colorless. Most of the few colorful flowers were pretty ""usual"" flowers that anyone could purchase for home decoration, nothing too particular."
,,A favorite sport,5.0,,"I go to Singapore 2 to 3 times a year and everytime I try to visit this place and everytime there is a different exhibit. I've been to the Tulip, Orchid and just recently the Spring/Cherry Blossoms exhibits. All were beautiful and exciting for a photography enthusiast like me.

Book your ticket online to avoid long queues esp if you plan to visit during weekends."
,,Unless you have a deep craving to touch Harmony,5.0,,"I would recommend to those that truly seek Harmony through a visual experience. Humongous in size the flower dome adores the skyline of the Marina Bay Gardens. On payment for a ticket one finds access to this man and nature made effort. The air conditioned dome is housed with flora and fauna from distant lands. The flora and fauna is such that mandates cool temperatures for survival.

I would prefer to visit such place when it has less visitors inside. Although that we visited in evenings when the crowd was big. Every nook and corner mandates a click. The serenity has been sculptured through great effort to accommodate beautiful plants and flowers.

Any amount of words shall not suffice to express the true experience that we gathered inside. But; let me say it again with a premonition that this place is for those that want to connect with Harmony through a visual sighting. I give this experience full marks."
,,Wonderfu collection and presentation of flowers and trees.,5.0,,"You don't have to love flowers to appreciate the flower dome although it helps! The dome is set out by continent with flowering species of flowers and trees from the different locations set out imaginatively which is well worth a visit. The Boabab tress are outstanding as were the cherry blossom trees, cactuses and flowers -whilst the sculptures and dragon, horses and deer made out out of pieces of wood are well worth seeing If wanting to visit please check whether open as the flower dome and waterfall dome are closed one day a month for maintenance.

This is an visit that is well worth your time and funds. The only bit that saddened ne was the number of adults who should have known better touching flowers and leaves even though there are plenty of signs asking you not o do this! You may also want to consider bringing a Cardigan or jumper as the dome is maintained at a fixed temperature which was definitely cooler than the outside temperature when I visited!"
,,Nice,4.0,,"Not as impressive as the cloud forest, but still a special serene place. Especially appreciated the background music making you part of the moment."
,,Wouldn't bother unless you love flowers or have double ticket - Cloud Forest far better,3.0,,"It's nice enough although we only spent 25 minutes here. It was set up or rather being set up for Christmas displays. Some nice art and gardens, but not for me

We came in as got a double ticket with cloud forest which was great - look for vouchers online for cheaper entry."
,,Great way to spend a morning.,5.0,,Get there when doors first open to beat the crowds. Well worth at least an hour or two visit. When in Singapore next I would definitely visit again.
,,Treetops and gardens,5.0,,"This is a must if you are at all interested in landscape and gardens, we walked for 5 hours just soaking it all in as we are very interested in these things. The maintenance of these areas are fantastic. Thankyou.."
,,Oversized green house,4.0,,Very contrived but spectacular . Lots of flowering plants of all kind. Some plants looked almost fake
,,Always a sight to behold,5.0,,"This is my 2nd trip to the flower dome and once again it does not disappoint.
Gardens by the bay will always have a special display and it would be good to read up from their webpage about the on-going events. If you are planning to visit the domes, do read up on their maintenance days as well as that would mean the dome will be closed and non accessible. The closure will be one day out of every month.

The dome is maintained at a constant temperature and is great place to escape the heat of the outside. Photographers will especially love the varieties of flowers available for photo taking.

The only disappointing sight was the blatant disregard for the plants by one or two of the visitors when I was there. Although signs were prominent requesting visitors to not touch the flowers or displays, some visitors still chose to climb over the barricades, step on the grass and pulled the leaves on the trees just so that they can pose with the tree. Due to language barrier it was difficult to ask the visitor to not cross into the restricted zone.

Being able to view the plants and flowers closely without barricades was truly one of best features of the dome. I came away from the dome easily with 100 over varieties of flowers in bloom.

Keep a lookout for some art pieces on display amongst the plants as the artwork on display also pertains to the region that the plant is from."
,,Strange gardening experience,2.0,,"Anywhere in the world this would not be possible - how can flowers from all over the world exist under one dome, in controlled temperatures environment? When you walk down the paths of the Flower Dome, you really feel strange. But then again, it's done well and it is exciting to see all that variety of coexistence.."
,,Disneyland atmosphere in a flowerdome,3.0,,"Nice to see different kind of flowers and plant in the dome. Several area's with nice sculptures, very crowded during the weekends. Nevertheless it is all too artificial and sometimes it feels like walking in a kind of green Disneylamnd"
,,Beautiful to Behold,5.0,,"We were truly inspired by the beautiful Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay. We visited during the Blossom Bliss event and were transported to Japan during the cherry blossom season with over 20 different types of blossoms on display located in a Japanese landscape. Amazing ! There were many other beautiful sights to behold including the wooden sculptures strategically located throughout the dome.
This is one of the most beautiful displays I have ever seen and everything on display is absolutely pristine."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,If in Singapore its a must to see. This place is something you have to see when in Singapore. Cheap to enter and overall great
,,Flowers from all over the world.,4.0,,"Beautiful displays of flowers from South Africa, Japan, New Zeeland. Orchids are amazingly beautiful!!!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"If you would like the opportunity to see how diverse the flora and fauna around the world is, go. Beautiful place and very educational."
,,Amazing Display of Flora,5.0,,I absolutely loved my experience at Flower Dome. I went there as it was Sakura season and they included sakura. It features tens of kinds of flora and you can take wonderful pictures there. The place can be very cold so do bring along a jacket.
,,Wonderful indoor garden,5.0,,"If it is hot outside, it will be cool and peaceful in the Flower Dome. Plants from around the world are grown here. It was the Lunar New Year when we visited, so the theme was Chinese red and yellow."
,,Wonderful cool oasis near the cbd,5.0,,"Truely amazing place. Well looked after, great variety and seasonal displays. Must go to kind of place."
,,Not as impressive as the adjacent Cloud Forest,3.0,,"Nice gardens and some impressive sculptures, but I found it was not as engaging as the cloud forest next door."
,,They have really improved,5.0,,"My second time here. First was average, but this time, the dome was splendid! They are exhibiting cherry blossoms now. Its definitely worth to pay a visit for that."
,,excellent flower collection,4.0,,"Side by side of the cloud dome, this dome consists of the collection of flowers from all over the world."
,,Excellent,5.0,,This place is wonderful. It's definitely worth a visit. Flowers in the one Dome have displays mixed in depending on the season or festival. Both buildings are worth the visit.
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,I visited this place so many times. Every season they change the set up. I never get bored with it. It's a must visit when you visit Singapore.
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"Incorporated in with The gardens by the Bay the Flower Dome is beautiful, They change the arrangements every so often but is just magic walking around the beautiful exhibits, and to sit and just look at the beauiful gardens is so very peasefull. It is suitable for strollers and wheelchairs."
,,Stunning Flower Displays,5.0,,"So many well thought out Displays, a joy to walk around and see so many plants from many countries all thriving."
,,beauty in dome,5.0,,"where its a top on my list had a good views for the flower and plants from all over biome its a wonderful must visit place ,dont miss it ,good to go in morning"
,,This was the high light of my stay in Singapore.The complex is just magnificent.,5.0,,"I have many years of trading with Singapore buying Orchids and importing them. So flowers are my love in life. The Flower Dome is exotic and beautifully laid out. Allow time to spend ,much to see."
,,Colourful and nice,4.0,,"I think it is a great place to visit, the only but being that nobody tells you how cold it is inside. You need to wear something warm. As for the plants, it is very interesting to see plant from all over the world and getting to know how they adapt to harsh condiitons."
,,small botanical garden,2.0,,"This was essentially a waste of money on a small botanical garden under a nice roof! tickets for this attraction are sold as combo with the cloud forest(28$) for non-locals, otherwise would have advised against visiting the flower dome..."
,,Heaven On Earth,5.0,,"Went to Flower Dome & Flower Field for the 1st time during the Blossom Bliss period and was amazed with what I saw! The flowers are beautiful, the blossom are gorgeous. I have seen sakura live when I was in Tokyo 3yrs ago and never expect to see the blossom again in my own country.

The flowers are all well maintained as we are not allowed to touch it. Love the every moment I was in there!"
,,Incredible Experience!,5.0,,"Well worth the required ticket purchase. The flower dome is refreshingly cool on a hot day in the Gardens. With a variety of plantlife from a variety of ecosystems, it is easy to spend several hours walking through the dome. Though it is busy it is easy to lose yourself in the beauty of some of the world's best plantlife and to walk through at your own pace. Wonderful way to spend your time!"
,,Impressive,4.0,,Such a wonderful display of beautiful tress and flowers so many that I have never seen before. The spring blossom display was really beautiful.
,,Beautiful but very cold,5.0,,"Been here recently,a lot of sakura flower,very beautiful
And very informative but mind u,do wear a coat it's very cold inside,we are a group of 7 person and all of us are cold,we want to enjoy the flower one of a time but can't because it's soo cold eventough we use long shirt and jacket so we can't wait to get out from the flower dome and drink a warm drink and warm food in the stall nearbay.From where we seat in the outside,a lot of people suffer from cold too,but not too cold in the cloud dome though."
,,A display not to be missed,5.0,,A visit to the flower dome is not to be missed by keen gardeners and anyone who loves flowers. There are numerous displays in the dome eg there was a display of gardens from around the world and in March of this year. the dome was filled with magnificent blossom trees in full bloom and the way they were displayed literally took my breath away.
,,Went at the right time of year,5.0,,We visited during the Blossom festival. As you can guess all the blossom trees were out as well and a huge array of other flowers.
,,Spellbinding!,5.0,,"I was immediately in awe, as i walked inside the flower dome. Magnificent display of different flowers, plants and trees iv never seen before. The Japanese garden in particular, was very enchanting with the various cherry blossoms in full bloom!

A visit to the flower dome is a refreshing break from the heat of the sun in Singapore, as the entire dome is fully airconditioned. There are strategically located benches inside where you could rest your weary feet, while at the same time being surrounded by colorful blooms.

Visit in the afternoon and alot about 1-2 hours, afterwhich you can witness the wonderful light and sound show of the supergrove trees.

Definitely worth including in your itinerary when visiting Singapore."
,,Twadry tourist oriented attraction,2.0,,Go the botanic gardens instead. They are much more worth your time. Obviously designed to cater to the cruise boat passengers with limited time.
,,Don't go on busy days,3.0,,"Went here for the cherry blossoms display. It wasn't fun because the guides kept telling us to move along, so there wasn't really much time to enjoy the flowers. Also, the information displayed wasn't sufficient, in my opinion -- it's more like a ""look and see"" than ""look and know more about"" place. It was nice that they have desert plants though, because it wouldn't be comfortable going to the desert just to see cactuses.

The Cloud Forest is more interesting for me."
,,Fantastic Dome for flower lovers and camera clicker...,5.0,,"Flower Dome is also an part of Garden By the Bay... and its one of the most fantastic place to visit if you are flower lover and want to have beautiful selfies with original flowery backgrounds.

Flower Dome is having a wide varieties of various flower from all over the world which one can see at one place. the ambience of the place is so positive that one can relax for hours at the location.

Chinese flower area was one of the best area i found in the dome."
,,Gardens from all corners of the globe,5.0,,Masses of gardens from all over the globe feature here giving amazing perspective of how plants grow. The Japanese garden best viewed in Spring (when we were there in March) as the blossom trees make a spectular sight.
,,Really nicely done,4.0,,"Nicely done, to see all kinds of vegetation (at the time of writing: Japanese blossoms as it's the season for it). For those that have seen things like tulips or blossoms ""live"", it may be perceived a bit artificial. But it's interesting nonetheless. Try to avoid weekends / peak daytime: the walkways are limited and if groups come in (especially when there are special exhibitions), it may get rather crowded which makes it difficult to see anything). For those that get cold easily, take a jacket - the temperature is quite comfortable but if you're only used to subtropical temperatures, it may be perceived as cold."
,,"Premier attraction, day or night",5.0,,"I expected the Cloud Forest to be more stunning. But I was wrong. The Flower Dome is the highlight of the two enclosures. This is an amazing building, the gardens are stunning and the variety of plants amazing. The atmosphere is cool and inviting and there are enough seats to stop and relax between sections. Great for all ages."
,,Must to do!,4.0,,"This is, for me, the thin to do in SG/ I'm horticulturist, so It was for me on my bucket list!
I prefer the cloud dome, but syill. Don't go on Saturday and Sunday! to many people! I did this one at day time, I(ve no idea what it looks like at night time."
,,Flowers and lots of cameras.,5.0,,After the Cloud forest head into the flower dome to see some impressive displays. Being there in March we saw all the cherry blossoms. If you want to take photos it's a little difficult with everyone else trying to do the same.
,,Breathtakingly beautiful.,5.0,,"How beautiful is the Flower Dome, so well thought of in its planning. Not only is it a wonderful environment of sculptures, gardens, with so many picture perfect moments it's a wonderful escape from the heat as the air-conditioning is a pleasant welcome from the outside heat. So many happy faces and reactions to the gardens within and we were very lucky to be there during the Cherry Blossom season and they were just beautiful! Loved everything about the Flower Dome. 10/10"
,,Good but more information on the plants would help,4.0,,This is the second of the two Bio Domes on site and whilst being very good the Clouds is better. Really good Japanese garden as the main attraction and thus is thought provoking and well done but is extremely busy
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,A short walk from Supertrees and opposite Cloud Forest. One of the must attractions to see.Very reasonable price to get in.
,,Well planned attraction.,4.0,,Adjacent to the cloud forest and shows gardens from around the world. Most of the gardens are very interesting and in good conditionbut it doesnt have the wow factor of the cloud forest and is more commercialised.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,The flower dome is full of amazing plants and gardens from all over the world. It has also many carvings from old tree stumps which are spectacular. This place is not to be misses and is inexpensive to visit
,,Excellant place to view world of Flowers!,5.0,,Best Place to spend your evening time. Lots of Beautiful flowers and I think its a huge collections of Worldwide flowers in world!
,,Flowers Flowers and more Flowers,5.0,,Simply amazing place so many flowers and plants and the setting is very relaxing and informative no matter how old you are.
,,Good if you're a keen gardener,3.0,,This is nice for a walk round in the air conditioning but not as impressive as the Cloud Forest next door. Some sculptures and a wide variety of plants from all over the world on display.
,,Very well done!,5.0,,"A unique experience, well worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare. Very well designed and spectacularly set out. Even for people like me, who have no interest in flowers and shrubs and trees, this was very good!"
,,not worth the money,2.0,,"I visited SIngapore before this attraction has been built. I waited some years for
good conditions to go here (sunny weather). I did it during this february I have seen
many botanical garden over the world. This has nothing to do with it - its just commerce
for tourist. Furthermore the hall is supercool (max 20 degrees) and overcrowded."
,,Gorgeous place!,5.0,,"I loved this place. So many things to see. If we weren't on a schedule, I would've loved to hang out here and just chill and read. It's interesting to see all the different trees and plants from around the world. There are also several nice tree sculptures. Do bring at least a light jacket when you visit since it can get a bit chilly inside."
,,Not like any other botanical garden.,3.0,,The flower dome is absolutely stunning if you love visiting botanical gardens or things similar. I went during Christmas time so it was lovely decorated. Such a great place for families to go visit.
,,A great garden with lots of plants from around the world,5.0,,This is a great place to be on a hot Singapore day. Great plants from all over the world set out well.
,,Very well put together - a little chilly,4.0,,"This is a fascinating place, very comprehensive in the way it has been designed and a lot of fascination plants, shrubs, trees as well as animals carved out of rough wood. It is chilly - so have something to put on while you are there."
,,Beauty and nature combined,5.0,,We travelled there by MRT and then took the shuttle across the park. The gardens are beautifully paid out and the smells and colours are sensational.
,,A good walk,4.0,,"This is not my first time to flower dome. But I just love how there's different themes in a year for both locals and tourists to visit. It is especially good for locals as in Singapore, we do not have a lot of flowers that other countries have because of our climate. It's always an enjoyable time here. Walking, strolling and taking pictures of and with the beautiful flowers. It's also a therapeutic place for me to relieve some stress too :))"
,,Three night stay in Singapore,5.0,,Really enjoyed seeing how they have created gardens from around the world. Some interesting looking Cactus to look out for as well as some amazing wood creations from pieces of bark
,,The least appealing of the domes,2.0,,"The Flower Dome fades in comparison with the Cloud Forest Dome. I strongly suggest taking the Flower Dome first before entering the Cloud Forest Dome. It does show an impressive array of flowers, cactuses, palms and so on. If you ask me, you might as well save some money by choosing the Cloud Forest Dome only."
,,Even for people whom are not into flowers,5.0,,"My significant other is into flowers. Not my cup of tea. HOWEVER, the flower dome is an amazing visit even for non-botanical persons such as myself. The architecture and sheer size is worth a trip. Lots of colors and beautiful smells."
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,"Been here on several occasions. Everytime it was decorated differently and we enjoyed it a lot.
This place was the largest green house in the world dated 2015. Opened daily 9Am - 9Pm. Indoor temperature is between 23 to 25 °C.
This place is suitable for everybody."
,,Amazing,5.0,,My husband truly enjoyed this place as he is fond of flowers and any kind of plants. Will definitely be coming back again.
,,"fascination, such variety",5.0,,"well worth a visit, this is a great example of what a country that respects and encourages tourists can do. Huge variety of plants of all shapes and sizes from across the globe. Easy walk."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Absolutely worth the 8 dollars I paid to get in!

You can easily spend 2 hours in here, wandering around and taking in all the beautiful flowers. It smells amazing and there is also a good deal of information on the plants you can spend some time reading. Make sure you don't miss the other conservatory too - Cloud Forest!"
,,Awesome display,5.0,,"Well worth watching, fantastic display at around 8;30pm. Kids them was really good, we will be back again."
,,"Beautiful, well maintained gardens with lush greenery and lots of colour. The giant metal trees were amazing as were the",5.0,,The dome featured a variety of lovely flowers and masses of colour. I particularly liked the Japanese gardens and the wooden animal sculptures. There was a lot of useful information about the plant adaptations.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Really amazing place been to others like this too but this was the best so far. Flowers, colours, displays and arrangements were really great. For the price we paid fully satisfied. Spent a lot of time and didn't get bored in the least."
,,Japanese Sakura in Singapore,5.0,,I was amazed by the beauty of Sakura trees in Flower Dome. Is really a paradise thats how beautiful it looks like . Thats the right place to spend few hours alone or with ur family far from stress and busy life of singapore.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"If you're even remotely interested in plants, biology, design or architecture, you have to see the cloud forest and the flower dome."
,,A very clever well kept display,5.0,,"THis dome is a bit like the TARDIS. Fair enough, it does look big from outside, but when you get in, you marvel not only at the amount of different platings they have but also the size and age of some of the individual trees. Make sure you get the multi dome ticket so you can visit the cloud dome too."
,,"Great carvings, nice variety of plant life",4.0,,"The dome contains more trees, palms, cactus, etc. than flowering plants. It has a nice variety. What really surprised me were the quality of the art and especially the root carvings, many were spectacular. The dragon and horses are superb."
,,Flower dome,4.0,,Went on a weekday .... spent some time exploring the garden and decided to go inside the domes as well... interestingly the dome was booked for a wedding so got to see a Singaporean wedding as well ...Half of the dome was sealed because of a wedding and half of it was filled with the wedding guests in gowns and suits getting their pictures taken ... overall it was a well maintained place with so many flowers and plants exhibited from across the world... I enjoyed the cloud forest (the other dome in the garden) more
,,Re visit,5.0,,Second visit to the Flower Dome and the difference in the displays was exceptional. So very well laid out and organised with many different species of flowers and trees. A lovely time was had!
,,ATTRACTION IN GARDENS BY THE BAY,5.0,,The flower dome is one of the major attractions at the Gardens by the Bay. The flower dome is a large botanical conservancy with multiple temperature zones within the dome. The cactus and succulent area is world class with beautiful specimens of many plants. Recommend. Hope this helps.
,,Superb,5.0,,Super collection from across the globe . Cool environment inside the huge dome .. dream place for flower lovers .
,,Loved Everything!,5.0,,"Garden by the bay is itself a nice place to visit. But one should not miss the chance of roaming around in flower dome. One can find different trees/flowers of different parts of the World. Nice atmosphere with colorful flowers could refresh anyone!
I attended a dinner program inside flower dome. Night view of Flower Dome really enchanted me!"
,,Great,4.0,,"Don't miss it a photographers dream, lovely plants from all over the world. Don't forget your camera"
,,If you like flowers ...,4.0,,"Basically this is an indoor botanical garden. The climate is artificially controlled to create a perpetual spring. Depending on the level of your love of nature, you could do the attraction in 20 minutes to several hours. To fully get an education, get the audio guide. For kids there is a free app with educational games helping them to enjoy the area and not get bored. Wifi is free in all the area. Tips : using your Singapore airlines stub, gets you a discount and if you are going to do the cloud forest, do the flower dome first."
,,Impressive,5.0,,Just loved what theyve done here creating special conditions for these plants to grow and thrive. These domes are a must for all plant lovers! Just watchout for all the selfie lovers and their selfie sticks! Theyre everywhere!
,,Nothing like this,5.0,,"Be prepared for it to be cool inside. Lots to see, as it was the Chinese New Year then special floral displays around. Amazing place but be prepared to walk."
,,"While away the hours, conversing with the flowers",5.0,,"A great place to while away the hours even if you are not a fan of flowers or plants. Being fully air-conditioned, the Flower Dome makes a great place to escape the Singapore humidity and heat while also offering a tranquil and relaxing time walking among the flowers. You will find yourself taking more photos of flowers than you have ever taken before!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Spent hours here just wondering around. Some truly beautiful displays. Another case of where do i start and what do i look at first.
,,Surprised and 'wow-ed',5.0,,"We visited Singapore in February, apparently being the hottest month in Malaysia!! Took the MRT to visit the Singapore Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. We decided to pay $3 to take a shuttle bus from MRT station to the entrance as we knew we were going to be walking a fair bit afterwards. The entrance to the two attractions by foot is around 15 minutes. But being so hot, I thought the $3 was worth it, my opinion.

It was such a unique experience. At first when you enter the flower dome, it’s pitch dark with big digital monitors showing different stages of blooming. At first my husband thought that it was going to be just that, a digital monitor exhibit… but he was blown away when he really entered the dome…. It was amazing landscape and any gardening fanatics can probably stay a full day there!!

Be prepare to bring a cardigan or a light jacket as it will get cold in there. Depending on how fast you walk and whether you want to take a lot of pictures, we spent around 2 hours per attraction – it was mostly waiting in line to take a picture since it was quite crowded in there.

The cloud forest was yet another amazing experience… we were inside in time for the misting so it did feel like we were walking in the cloud… again, it was a bit chilly in there….

A must see !"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,From the moment you walk through the door it's time to start taking photographs. Selfie sticks a must for the best shots. Beautifully maintained. Nice cafe for a coffee. Very enjoyable hour or so .
,,Absolutely Wonderful - A Must See,5.0,,"We visited today. The Blossom Bliss displays were so beautiful. There is a rich variety of plants and trees on display here and there are clear signs so you learn so much. 1,000 year old olive tree. Gardens from all over the world. Gorgeous flowers. Fabulous stone sculptures and drift wood carvings are dotted around the exhibits. The Bruno Catalano sculpture is great. It is cool and comfortable in here. You book a timed ticket online. You can buy tickets at the office too but if you can - book ahead. It was quite busy but so well organised by the lovely helpful staff. I can't recommend this attraction enough. We loved it."
,,Amazing creation !,4.0,,A treat for gardening & horticulture enthusiasts. Magnificent collection of plants and trees from all over the world. Admission fee is rather high but this state of the art facility is worth the expense.
,,Cool sculptures embedded in the greenery,5.0,,"During our 10 day business trip from Houston to Singapore, we had one weekend to visit some of the Singapore landmarks. This one is definitely worth the visit. The flower dome is part of the Gardens on the Bay attraction. We bought one combined ticket which allowed us to see both the Cloud Forest Dome and the Flower Dome. Of the two, we preferred the Cloud Forest Dome, but the Flower Dome was also quite beautiful as well. My favorite was the unique ""sculptures"". One other nice item about the domes is that since they're indoors it doesn't matter what the weather is like when you visit."
,,amazing,5.0,,An amazing place. it feels like a dreamland with the number of flowers they have there. You could spend many hours there.
,,A fascinating place to visit.,5.0,,"I was here in Feb 2017, and am sorry I missed this attraction of previous visits. The place is huge with examples of horticulture from all over the world. If you are visiting Gardens by the Bay, be sure to include the Flower Dome on your visit but give yourself time to take it all in."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"This was another surprise. I hadn't expected the variety, and the explanations were great. It's easily accessible and we spent much longer than expected here."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"You must see these amazing flower domes, they are wonderful. Great views all round to from the walkway, really quite high up!"
,,Amazing Technology,4.0,,We were in awe of this spectacle and enjoyed the beauty and collection of so much plant life a must see if ever you are in Singapore
,,Amazing,5.0,,"amazing place to visit. Sections of flowers from all over the world, including Australia, inside a big air conditioned dome. Again, well done Singapore"
,,A good collection of flowers,4.0,,"You can find many flower species in one place. A collection of common flowers from many countries, climate, continents can be found there. This is definitely a must see place for families with childrens. To an adult like me, the cool temperature under the dome is the minus point."
,,A Must see,5.0,,Great place to visit... So many beautiful plants... the atmosphere is awesome. So many different and unique things to see...
,,Piece of heaven,1.0,,"Just visited Flower Done, truly exceptional indoor gardens. Temperature surprisingly cool, but not chilly. Understand it can be crowded at weekends, went Thursday afternoon, not crowded. The scent of the place, the fliers, the sculptures, unsurpassable. Truly memorable experience."
,,Lovely flowers and surprise statues,5.0,,Great place to visit. Surprises around every corner. Plants from all over the world and statues placed in amongst them. A beautiful place - very well done.
,,Love nature... be here,5.0,,"If you love being in nature and appreciate its beauty, then this is a must visit place. The amazing variety of flowers will bold you over..."
,,Pretty,3.0,,"We went to the cloud forest first and then walked through the flower dome... I would probably recommend doing it in the reverse order as I found the flower dome to be much less impressive.
It's very pretty and well put together and we went during Chinese New Year so they had an extra display which had great decorations, but I just found it underwhelming.
If you're super into flowers then I'm sure you'll love it, but there are much better things to see if you don't want to fork out the money for entry."
,,Amazing Flower Dome,5.0,,Beautiful place for pictures and plants/flowers lovers.Takes at least 2 hours to go around.Close to the subway station.You can purchases tickets there or online sometime purchasing online you save about 3 dollars.Perfect for a rainy day.Recommended
,,"Been here twice, both times they had great exhibits.",5.0,,"When we visited the second time, they have an orchid exhibits. The flowers and all the flower art were beautiful. It was crowded."
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,I have already reviewed the Gardens by the Bay and the dome is the highest point inside this fabulous place
,,Fabulous Flower Dome oasis in the Garden City,5.0,,"I have been to the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay numerous times as I had an annual pass.
Now, we brought our overseas guests.
Currently, they are changing over their exhibits from the Chinese New Year floral displays with pagoda-like structures, so it is not so spectacular.
But in March there should be new special seasonal floral displays.
I like this attraction which appeals to both overseas visitors and locals alike.
During Christmas they have lovely stuffed toy / teddy bear and many festive Seasons displays and props.
Previous years, they also have beautiful tulip festivals during spring time.
Repeat visits are also enjoyable since they change their seasonal exhibits regularly.
I particularly enjoy this large greenhouse attraction since it is a great escape for either inclement rainy or sunny weather.
But do bring a sweather or light jacket if one is inclined to feel chilly, since the temperature is kept cool at around 23 to 25 degrees celcius.
This conservatory replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like California, South Africa, South America etc.
This is a wonderful place for capturing beautiful shots admist myraid of georgeous and colourful flora and plant displays, which can be enjoyed by young and old.
The best part is that the entry fees are so affordable.
For overseas guests, it is SGD28 for both conservatories.
For locals, the senior citizens prices are lower at SGD15 only.
Check for certain credit card discounts, when purchasing tickets.
Most definitely not-to-be-missed attraction in Sunny Singapore please."
,,Lots of flowers and green,5.0,,This is surrounded by lots of green and flowers every where. I love the place. Very beautiful and nice walk.
,,I'm not much of a flower person...,3.0,,"I would imagine that if you're really into flowers, this would be a highlight. I am not much of a flower person; therefore this was less interesting. Sure it was pretty to walk around and see everything, but honestly for me, it was a quick walk around and I was done. Personally, I wouldn't do it again. And definitely, if given the choice, I would take the cloud forest over the flower dome."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited this on a four night stop over in Singapore. Well worth it the cactus and succulents was my favourite, plus the Australian garden. Not really into flowers so glad it wasn't all flowers."
,,Resplendent!,4.0,,"We spent hours inside this beautiful “garden”, enjoying chilly air (comparing to hot and humid condition outside), appreciating the charming, stunning, exotic plants and flowers. It’s indeed an unforgettable experience. The garden even displayed a Chinese New Year Theme decoration."
,,Fabulous Flower Dome,4.0,,It would be another interesting place to visit for those garden lovers like us. We always find something new to appreciate.
,,beautiful,5.0,,A lovely place for a stroll both in daylight and after dark. The theme when we were there was the Chinese new year so lots of Roosters about
,,"Great place if you""re loving fowers",5.0,,"Quite impressive, but a lot of people in there. For me, I preferred the Cloud garden next to it. But if you're there, just have a look inside."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Garden by the Bay in Singapore is one of a kind in the world. A great place to visit when you're in Singapore.
,,OK for a short visit,4.0,,Nice companion attraction to the Cloud Garden but not as engaging. The only food outlet was closed for a private function on a weekend Saturday. That was disappointing.
,,Highlight of my trip,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is the largest greenhouse in the world built without columns. Wait till you step into it- the displays are almost overpowering in their variety. This dome houses plants from Australia, semi arid regions and the Mediterranean. The displays are ever changing and are accompanied by imaginative sculptures and statues."
,,Plants galore,5.0,,A great selection of plants from all over the world. I was surprised it was kept so cool inside yet all the xerophytes are growing so well.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Think Eden Project then magnify it a million times!!!! Beautiful flowers - we saw the Dahlia exhibition but it changes .Photographer's dream. Cool in heat of day or dry if raining.
,,A great place to visit when you're in Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"It's one of the two cooled conservatories in Gardens by the Bay, with both having an admission fee. I liked the cloud forest better, but that's because I like waterfalls more. This place has so many flowers and fauna, and it's a great sight to see. I was lucky enough that there was a Lunar New Year celebration, and there were lots of activities like egg painting and calligraphy, but otherwise, it's a nice stroll on a hot day."
,,waaaw!!!,5.0,,beautiful natural setting under one roof. It's like a walk through the garden of Eden. make sure you visit this amazing garden.
,,COOL PLACE,4.0,,"We have seen many Gardens, this is one of a kind. We went during Christmas time, so the garden was decorated for the year end festival. It was very nice, Ticket is for Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. So it is OK to see the flowers and plants here too.
Garden set up entirely different.
It is not a must see garden, but if your visiting Singapore, should go. COOL PLACE."
,,Good to see but not a Must Place to Visit.,3.0,,"Visited the Flower Dome recently and although we enjoyed it, it wasn't a highlight for us. It was nice to see and walk around and a place to get out of the sun but wouldn't re-visit again."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,Spent a while walking round taking in all the amazing flowers and plants here. There are also some really good sculptures too. We would come back to visit again .
,,Amazing indoor garden,4.0,,We liked it with the colorful different kind of flowers and trees from all over the world for me it was a good choice to visit this place specially it was raining outside .
,,Very satisfied,5.0,,"i was able to appreciate the flower dome since I'm a flower lover. During our visit theirs a variety of flowers ,shrubs and fruit trees.aside from that the dome is airconditioned so it's very comfy"
,,Love the cactus,4.0,,I really enjoy walking inside the flower dome. The area is huge and there's so many plants here. I love the cactus!
,,Definatley worth a visit,5.0,,This was my second visit and the gardens have grown up since the first 4 1/2 years ago. Plenty of different gardens to see with the benefit of being indoors when the thunderstorm hits.
,,Good place to spend with family during weekends,4.0,,"It would be a good experience if you have not been there before. Take a short break with families or friends to Flower Dome and enjoy the scenery of different types of flowers and plants. To avoid crowd, you might wanna go on weekdays instead or public holiday or weekend. :)"
,,Place with lots of flower,4.0,,"This flower dome has lots of flower to see. Not only flower, but different type of garden and plantation from all over the worlds. I am impress with the cactus. Its huge but beautiful. This dome show me how beautiful our earth. Good place to bring children for their knowledge.
I think the staff must encourage more and guide the tourist to get better information. Otherwise we will just go there for picture without have knowledge of plantation or flower we saw. Its good to have audio explanation about each flower or trees there.
It will be more exciting to hear and see."
,,Large collection of plants.,4.0,,"For me this was the less impressive of the two domes. It is still worth visiting and has a large and collection of plants and, as the name suggest, flowers. Located in the gardens by the bay and has an entrance fee. Although we went on a weekday and over all it was not crowded some areas in the flower dome where crowded due to layout of the planting."
,,Great collection of cacti and plants from around the world,5.0,,"A very well designed conservatory with collections from around the world. The range and size of cacti is amazing as is the boabab trees. The display to celebrate the Chinese New Year of the Rooster was very colourful. Like the Cloud Forest, there is also a sunning collection of carvings and sculptures. An amazing place."
,,Impressive!,5.0,,Beautiful plants and flowers from all over the world. Well laid out and easy to get around. Perfect for a hot day as all under the glass dome and air-conditioned.
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,"I loved everything about the gardens at the bay including both domes. You pay about £25 and get a ticket to both domes, little bit expensive but definitely worth it.

Very beautiful flowers here plus different areas for different flowers from all over the world. really nicely laid out and good themes. When we visited it was just after Chinese new year so they had a whole section dedicated to Chinese new year which was very beautiful.

Great for people with green fingers.

I would recommend going here about 3pm, walking around both domes and then seeing the supertree light show around 7pm. If Singapore is particularly hot then the domes are a good way to escape the heat as well."
,,A collection of ancient olive trees amongst the best colourful display of flowers .,5.0,,We were lucky to be there during Chinese New Year celebrations an added bonus of colours. Just loved the ancient olive trees !
,,More of a tree and plant dome,4.0,,"Very nice experience. Expect to spend quite some time just walking through and seeing everything, Its incredible how many different types of trees they have brought into this place."
,,Fascinating flora!,5.0,,"There are so many flowers, plants and cacti to see there. A lot of nice made sculptures by wood to be seen too!"
,,"Beautiful, simply beautiful",5.0,,"This is a must visit when in Singapore. The flowers are simply beautiful and the landscaping is incredibly beautiful. Lovely arrangement of flowers against backgrounds of trees, shrubs and other foliage. This visit was a while ago and I forgot to upload but nothing has changed. Don't forget the beautiful gorgeous baobabs at the far end which are simply impressive."
,,Beautiful and nice laid out place,5.0,,"My school brought us there for our BCL 2 trip. The Flower Dome is a beautiful place. There are flowers from all over the world, with in-depth descriptions of a specific group type. There are also many different types of gardens which group the plants. The gardens are pretty, with shelters decorated with flowers, and a small pond. Can be called a indoor garden."
,,unforgettable experience,5.0,,an unforgettable experience can visit the flower dome Singapore. truly an amazing sight. one day I will make a garden like this in my city. because of the trees and flowers can restore a person's bad mood. with the city so I can be a beautiful and peaceful place.
,,Heaven in Singapore,5.0,,Flower dome has classic edition range of flowers the ambience is so cool and romantic that people come for the special photoshoot also. the view around 360 degrees is mesmerising and you can click beautiful pictures
,,one of the domes - do not miss them!,4.0,,"Do not miss to go there - Garden by the Bay a nice for a walkaround, but the highlights are the domes!"
,,Interesting attraction,4.0,,"We enjoyed the flowers and wood sculptures throughout the dome, and it was nice to spend time in the air conditioned environment on a hot day. But we thought the nearby Cloud Forest Dome was more imaginative."
,,Beautifully well laid out,5.0,,"The Flower Dome, like the Cloud Dome, is situated right in the middle of the Gardens In The Bay. A magnificent display of flowers (and of course lots of Orchids), all set in themed gardens. Make sure you do not miss all the birds, animals etc made entirely out of wood. Recommended"
,,Very beautiful way to spend an afternoon,5.0,,Fantastic way to spend an afternoon - so well laid out and the sculptures are especially great...allow a good two hours to get around the whole dome.
,,Beautiful structure and impressive variety of plants,5.0,,"Spent five hours in the park and domes. Only left because we are not used to walking this much and are still tired from our flight half way around the world. Otherwise, we could have stayed there the whole day. It is wonderful to see the importance that Singapore has placed on creating a world class district of arts and cultural venues."
,,"You want to de-stress yourself, go to this place!",5.0,,"This is my 2nd time to visit the flower dome. I can say that this place is well maintained. I like nature, so i like really the flowers and the trees that i saw from the different parts of the world. For me you have not gone to singapore, if you don't visit this place. It is something different and the memories of it will last a lifetime."
,,Look out for the wooden sculptures,4.0,,"There is a particularly amazing sculpture of a dragon on the upper level which is stunning. Dotted around are all sorts of interesting scultures including 2 hares fighting and a swan as well as horses. The flowers are good too. Oh wait.... its a Flower Dome, they should be good."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"The visit at the Flower Dome was a wonderful experience. Well organized, beutifully maintained, with detailed and interesting explanations. If you need to chose between the two domes - chose this one, and prepare your cameras!"
,,We preferred the cloud forest,3.0,,We preferred the cloud forest. The flower dome felt a little like visiting a florist - the flowers were standing in pots.
,,large variety of plants,4.0,,"Very large enclosed Greenhouse full of plans from different regions of the globe, however I found the name tags lacking on many of the plants. the guides who I waited for the guided tour did not know either, she only knew her little tour section which was just the seasonal display flowers, so was disappointed in that more species weren't labeled. If you are interested in the plants then you must get the audio tour for $4 and do the self-guided tour with that. It is very cool in there, and by that i mean you will get cold after awhile."
,,Dome delights,5.0,,Visited flower dome and adjoining rainforest dome. Both spectacular and educational. Both well laid out and informative.
,,Good activity,4.0,,A good place to visit specially for flower lovers and photographers. Air conditioned. It was slightly difficult to navigate.
,,Beautiful place meeting expectations,4.0,,"I'm not really a flower / flora person, but I did enjoy going to the place as it really showcases a variety of plant species. It's more than just a garden; it's literally a dome with lots and lots of kinds of plants. You'll not only get to see the plants but have a feel of the environment where these plants can be found, as they are sectioned depending on the place where they usually grow.

Plus side is the air-conditioning is amazing; just the right amount of cool, perfect indoor location for a humid afternoon in Singapore. They actually allow guests to take a nap on the benches, and some are conveniently located under towering trees so you would feel like you are just chilling outdoors :)

Place is perfect for photo-ops, too. They style the plants and if you're not into plants like I am, you can still maximize the place by taking photos wherever you like :)

They do have a restaurant inside but we weren't able to try it as we were still quite full then.

Down side is that when we went, it was a Monday and of all days, they were doing maintenance on the Cloud Forest! They do it once a month on a Monday, on separate Mondays for the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, respectively. I suggest make advance reservations if possible to make sure the trip to that area is worth it."
,,Interesting attraction,4.0,,"Situated in the gardens by the bay, the flower dome is one of two conservatories admission to which is about $$28 to enter both. There are displays of cacti, succulents and garden plants. Easy access, probably not of much interest to young children."
,,Impressive piece of architecture,5.0,,"While I did enjoy the different biozones in the Flower Dome, and the native plant life for each, for me the structure itself was what impressed. What a piece of engineering, both it and the adjacent Cloud Forest. Amazing."
,,Beautiful dome!,5.0,,"This was my second visit and I love the way the decorations reflect whatever festive season it is in. The first time I went was Christmas a few years ago and this time, it was Chinese New Year. The added bonus is the cool air especially on a hot and humid day. Love this place!"
,,Family outing,5.0,,"It is a very nice place to visit. Fully aircondition, so you don't need to worry about the rain and hot scotching sun."
,,A good place to visit on a hot day,5.0,,"We visited the Flower Dome during Christmas season. It was Christmas theme decorated. As always, the weather was hot, but the dome was cool and pleasant for a walk."
,,Amazing Experience...,4.0,,"I visited the Flower Dome with a local friend, who suggested the visit. I was not disappointed! This place is huge! Many plants and trees are life size! Plan on a few hours. Great photo opportunities! Well worth a visit!"
,,Absolutely stunning......,5.0,,"Loved this dome, so beautifully arranged and maintained, an absolute treat to walk around and so much to see."
,,Simply beautiful!,5.0,,"This dome hosted hordes of different flowers.. it was a photographer's deligh! This place is so well maintained.

The flowers kept vary depending on the season and showcase. Wren I went there were different types of orchids and likes. There was also a showcase of The as other flowers."
,,Disappointing display,2.0,,Not really worth the time or the money. Display and variety is not impressive. Makes a nice escape from the heat though.... but will not recommend it.
,,Another Stunning Garden,5.0,,"As were were her during the Chinese New Year period, there was a strong focus on CNY decorative plants and decorations. All the same, these Gardens were amazing as you walked through. Different sections displaying different Flora and Trees from around the word, Australia, Asia, Europe, Mediterranean, American, Desert and more. You have to pay to walk through but worth it."
,,Pretty boring,2.0,,"I've been to a flower market and the wide choice together with the buzz of buying and selling is infinitely more dynamic and engrossing than here. Yes, a nice enough selection of plants, but many were plants that you can easily see wild in Asia or Europe. I was looking forward to a degustation of fauna, instead, a rather tame display of plants and flowers."
,,Totally unexpected when you get inside.,5.0,,I have been to many botanical Domes etc but none as entertaining and as interesting as this Dome. A must see for all ages - and yes the children will not get bored. There is even a restaurant in there! A completely different concept for such an attraction ... not going to spoil it ... go see yourself ... you won't regret it.
,,Botanic Gardens light,3.0,,We spent around 30 minutes here and it was an ok experience but I liked the Botanic Gardens a lot more. So if you only have time for one of them I would recommend Botanic Gardens. I wonder why they play music in there and not nature sounds or just no sounds at all. Remember a shirt it's cold in here.
,,So many different plants.,4.0,,A perfect twin to the cloud forest display. So many types and variety of plants. The succulent display is fantastic.
,,must see,5.0,,"This dome is also must see along with cloud dome. Huge variety of flowers. there is also a cactus garden, which is very interesting. but personally I enjoyed cloud dome more. This is also in garden by the bay and can be combined tour."
,,Interesting and relaxing for the whole family,5.0,,"Visited Gardens by the Bay from around 4pm starting with the Flower Dome. Had a teen with me and we both really enjoyed walking around seeing the plants and trees from around the globe all in an easy indoor walk. Have to be patient if taking photos if it is busy. One highlight in particular was the complex animal sculptures made of driftwood.
Well worth a visit and the whole gardens by the Bay area was by far our Singapore destination."
,,Glad we went,5.0,,No wonder this is touted as Singapore's No. 1 attraction. The Dome itself showed so many beautiful flowers but also the walk to it was very enjoyable with so many lovely things to see. Without doubt a must see attraction.
,,Cactus garden,5.0,,I'm a cactus/succulent lover. This place is heaven. Hundreds of varieties there. Really love it. And the place to run away from the hot humid outside.
,,Boababs,4.0,,"These amazing trees punctuate this dome, and they have many from all over the world. Many other worldwide plants"
,,Not very exciting!,3.0,,This dome is nothing in comparison to the cloud dome. Rather dull and very average. One should visit this dome before the cloud dome or else the expectations would be set wrong.
,,Very Innovative Flower Exhibits,5.0,,Well worth a visit anytime of the year since they continously change their flower exhibits. Make sure you go early since there are a lot of photo opportunities for anyone who love flowers.
,,Beautiful indoor garden,4.0,,Currently they are having the Dahlia Dreams exhibition. Really beautiful flowers bring showcased. Both my parents were mesmerized by some of the flowers that we don't get to see in Singapore. Many nice spots to take family portraits.
,,Dahlia,3.0,,"Went specially to see the Dahlia theme for CNY this year. Was disappointed compared to the Tulip, Christmas and Cherry Blossom theme that I have visited in the pass. Not enough lighting in the dome thus the pictures are not as bright as during the day."
,,Air conditioned beauty,5.0,,You can really enjoy the plantings which were wonderful and the sculptures because this whole thing is air conditioned!
,,simply beautiful,5.0,,"The Flower dome is one of the most beautiful collection of flowers and sculptures, different themes throughout including and outback Australia,wonderful"
,,Gardens by the Bay Compulsory visit,5.0,,"We went to Singapore specifically for the Sept 2016 Flower Festival. Worth every cent and will do again and again. We took 3 days to pace ourselves and see everything. The beauty, the creativity and variety is unmatched by anything I have seen. Did I mention the 2 domes are airconditions. Yeah. Finish a day at Gardens by the Bay, with a quick taxi ride to Raffles for the classic Singapore Sling."
,,Flowers all through,5.0,,"Blooming flowers of varying colours made our day. beyond words. the trees, the flowers all together made a must visit. can't remember seeing so many varieties of flower in sch a compact space."
,,Flowers and trees from around the world.,4.0,,We spent almost a full day here in the huge Flower Dome so much to see. So well laid out and displayed for the enjoyment of the people.
,,everything natural and beautiful,5.0,,one of many Singapore attractions if you are a lover of botany and flowers. a wide variety of plants and flowers which end up as a feast for the eye.
,,Interesting,4.0,,A nice place to look around taking pictures with flowers. Quite fancy too and obviously intended to educate people about ecosystem.
,,Treat for Flower lovers,5.0,,Yes. Flower lovers should not miss this. It's a treat for them. You can see flowers from all over the world. Bit expensive but worth even if you don't like flowers much.
,,What a surprise!,5.0,,"Just a filler on our Singapore activity list during a recent visit, but wow! I'm not really the garden type but found this most enjoyable and well worthwhile. How do they do it??!! Really impressive and not to be missed"
,,"Awesome attraction, don't miss this !!",5.0,,"Six of us took the MRT to Garden by the Bay and toured entire site. The flower dome is spectacular and very unique. We al thoroughly enjoyed the place and thought it was well worth the entrance fees. It's also nice to enter the dome and enjoy the air conditioning in between long walks in open park areas. This is an outstanding exhibit, takes about an hour to tour it properly but more time could be used . Don't miss this place, it's well worth the visit. !!!"
,,Must Visit in Singapore!,5.0,,"This place is definitely a must visit when you are in Singapore. It's a bit pricey at 28$ per person, but it's totally worth it. So beautiful. When i walked in, first thing that crossed my mind was how surprisingly cold the place is. Well, not cold, but quite chilly, because they keep the temperature low for the flowers so they could last long. The flowers they have there are seasonal. When i was there, it was season for lilies and oh boy, they have all colours of lilies you can imagine. Everything is picture-taking-worthy there, so make sure you bring your camera or charge your phone well before you go there so you can take a lot of pics.

One of highlight of this place is their waterfall thing, so be prepared to get a bit stuck before entering the area with waterfall since everyone take picture in front of it. Try to walk up around the waterfall and you'll see amazing view of marina bay sands thru that giant windows and view of the greeneries. Oh! and i found flowers made of Lego! it was cool, you won't notice that those are legos from a far. And there's also nice restaurant somewhere inside the dome, but i heard the food is soso and it's kind of overpriced."
,,BEAUTIFUL,5.0,,This is one of the Domes you pay an entrance fee for but is well worth seeing. It's beautifully landscaped and wonderful way to enjoy the day.
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,"My first impression after several meters walk is,i should bring my mom here! You can find may variation of flower that you can not find in South east Asia,the place is really family friendly, and accesible for passengers with disabilities and for grandparent, the display is unique and beautifull.Though you can not say a cheap ticket price but it is really worth it and i definitely will go back there someday."
,,Plants of unusual size,4.0,,"The arrangement here is another incredible feat by the folks running the dome - and the groupings is mainly by region (so you can see the american southwest, the Mediterranean, etc).

What amazed me the most was the size of so many of the specimens. My wife and I regularly looked at each other with the phrase ""I didn't know those got that big"" on our lips."
,,Amazing place for flowers,5.0,,This place is amazing for flower picture taking. I'm not sure how many different types of flowers are here but there are plenty. Make sure to take your phone.
,,A global presence!,5.0,,Really well presented seasonal displays also in this viewing arena. Australian plants were displayed as were many other countries. Who would have thought that cactus could come in so many varieties and be so dam interesting and beautiful. The festival of flowers was colour and fragrance abundant. Still liked the Cloud better but these two and the sky walk are a must people!
,,Our favourite of the two...,5.0,,"After seeing photos and perusing some reviews from other travelers, I was keen to see both domes, but most keen on Cloud Forest. I'm not afraid to say that Flower Dome totally blew me away and was my favourite of the two.

There were so many displays - and it really is a photographers dream. Being able to photograph the flowers, displays and assorted wooden carvings. My iPhone did struggle a little I will admit with the glare but my husbands camera snapped some gorgeous photos.

We lost ourselves in this Dome for around 2 hours.

The temperature is cooler in this Dome so it's an escape from the Singaporean heat as well as a beautifully created and maintained attraction.

I have to give a special shout out to the cafe inside... it does have a lunch menu (but was booked out so if you'd like to dine there book early), but we actually got a pass out and came back for the CAKE. They had a selection and they were totally mind blowing. It was pricy (the cake) but worth every cent!

We purchased the combined ticket for both domes which was around 35$S when we visited. There was a small discount to buy the combined ticket.

If your only going to do one Dome, my advice is do Flower Dome, particularly if your into photography.

We walked across the Double Helix bridge to get to the gardens, but there is a train stop inside the Shops and Marina Bay which gets you far closer, from there it's a short walk out of the centre and out the back of Marina Bay Sands."
,,I enjoyed this dome the best of the two.,4.0,,I liked the cactus plants and the wood sculptures. There were other character sculptures as well. Lots of blooming flowers.
,,A nice display of various types of gardens,4.0,,"A good place to be if you love flowers and gardens, variety of different gardens based on different countries."
,,Colourful extravaganza,5.0,,Well worth additional charge to visit this beautiful flower dome depicting growing conditions of various situations throughout the world. Go early to avoid big crowds
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"Love this place. It's amazing how the area is air conditioned controlled/ climate controlled. Love the cool air which made the exploring of the dome so enjoyable and relaxing.

We came here during the week leading up to Chinese New Year and the decorations were tremendous.

Strongly recommend a visit."
,,Botanical diversity meets modern architecture,5.0,,"The dome itself is an imposing structure of glass and steel. Inside, the whole place is climate-controlled, so the plants are healthy and plentiful. The gardeners must be very meticulous. The Chirstmas display was beautiful; they had a large assortment of poinsettias, and decorated the whole dome with festive decorations. Best to bring a light jacket if you get cold easily."
,,need to revisit again!,5.0,,I came when there's a tulip festival and the collection is super! I really love how they design and the color is so pretty. The temperature is really cozy makes you want to stay there for a long time. There will be another collection displayed and I think I need to visit it again!
,,Super view,5.0,,Best part of flower dome is the everchanging theme depending on which time of the year you visit. Every part of flower dome is a must visit especially if you love flower and fauna. The collection of flowers is mindblowing. Highly recommended.
,,Awesome visit especially if you love flowers,5.0,,"Brought our Japanese visitor in late November when the Christmas decorations were up.

It was beautiful, with colourful flowers everywhere you turn. Plus the Christmas decorations made it all the more festive.

The Flower Dome, one of the two conservatories in Gardens by the Bay, is a great place to visit especially if you love nature, parks and gardens, especially flowers.

Lots of picture opportunities for the shutterbugs.

There is also a food and beverage outlet inside the Flower Dome if you wish to spend more time inside."
,,Wonders of nature,5.0,,"An absolute must do! Make sure you visit both this and the Cloud tower as they are both impressive! In this one, you will be marvelled by all the gorgeous varieties of flowers."
,,Not a must-see compared to cloud forest but still interesting,4.0,,"Well designed with plants and species from all over the world, sorted into different continents/climates, if you are planning to spend a whole day at Gardens by the Bay, you might as well purchase the combo ticket which includes access to both domes."
,,"Beautiful and wide varieties of flowers, wonderfully maintained",5.0,,"The Flower Dome features seven different ""gardens"" as well as an olive grove with a bistro and a central changing display field has also been incorporated to enable flower shows and displays to be held within the conservatory.

We usually visit flower dome atleast once in a year. The cherry blossom and tulips are our favorite. The garden is maintained very well and it's beautiful. Sometimes it's very cold inside and it's better to have a jacket.

For photographers especially macro photographer, this flower dome offers a lot and you can always see many of them inside."
,,Beautifully kept!,5.0,,Huge variety of plants and flowers all artfully arranged and well marked with identity tags. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy the surroundings.
,,"A gentle explosion of colours, softness and beauty!",5.0,,"A magnificent creation of flower garden of many regions of the world in an air-conditioned glass dome. There are flowers, plants and orchids from Malaya, Indian sub-continent, mediterranean areas and beyond. One feels exhilarated by the profusion of colours, the variety and sometimes inviting scents of flowers and citrus fruits. It is so meticulously maintained that it looks like new, fresh and created just NOW. Seeing is believing!"
,,"Very good if you have children, not so if you are adult only",4.0,,"A wide array of display of flowers from different corners of the world. Very nicely displayed and maintained. On the mezzanine floor, there are some cacti as well as some large plants. Must go if you are a family, think twice if you are adult only."
,,Flower from all continent,5.0,,"Just to get a idea of the flower in this dome, there are from all over the world ! Bring your jacket, it is a bit cold inside"
,,"Considering the competition, only average and very cold inside",3.0,,"This is another part of Gardens by the Bay, which costs an entrance fee. This time, we found the extra charge not worth it - perhaps due to the high competition all around! And - the place was VERY cold! Even with the light jacket we both had taken along."
,,Really Great Christmas Displays,5.0,,"We went to the Flower Dome as part of a visit to Gardens by the Bay. We went at sunset and since the domes are artificially lit they can still be enjoyed after the sun sets. The dome is air conditioned so it provides relief to Singapore's high temperatures.

When we went this Dome was set up for Christmas. It looked like a Christmas wonderland in the central part of the dome. From talking to the guys that work here, this is where they set up their seasonal displays.

There are also other garden displays in the dome covering gardens from around the world such as Mediterranean, desert, South America etc.

We really enjoyed walking around this dome and would highly recommend it to others."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Walk into the Flower Dome into a large air-conditioned Atrium which is a welcome relief from the Singapore heat. The Flower Dome has an extensive range of plants and flowers from all over the globe which are set out for you to wander through and enjoy the surroundings. Whilst we were there the Christmas display was set up and was truly magnificent to have this display, together with Christmas music and animated figures doing different things among the plants and flowers. The display of cyclamen, azaleas and poinsettias was magnificent"
,,Very pretty and relaxing place!,5.0,,"This place is full of colors, it looks awesome in pictures but is really beautiful when seen for real! The cool interior is relaxing and a good break from the heat of walking around SG. Aside from the flowers though, the other artworks like sculptures displayed here are note-worthy!"
,,Variety of flowers,4.0,,There are two levels being that of tress with lots of varieties of cactus plans and the other level being that of flowers. Lots of them.
,,Colorful!,5.0,,This is great for nature lovers! I was at awe with the beauty and colours of the flowers in the Flower Dome. I can spend the entire day just admiring them in here. :)
,,Nice cold place on a hot day,4.0,,"Different sections are allocated to the plants from different countries. It was interesting for a while, but got boring real quick."
,,For nature and Arts Lovers,4.0,,"We bought the combo pass into the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. You really have to be a nature lover to enjoy the flower dome otherwise it will bore you. Luckily for me, I was quite intrigued by the many sculptures found within the grounds."
,,Nice,4.0,,We saw some really nice flowers and plants. All the family will like it. There is a nice cafe restaurant inside.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Who ever designed this did an amazing job. Totally blown away and the variety of plants is staggering. How they have managed to get 600 year old Olive trees to grow & prosper has taken a lot of thought & care.

You don't know where to look."
,,If you have only 1 hour for the 2 domes choose this one!,5.0,,While according to Tripadvisore people prefer the Cloud Forest our favourite was Flower Dome. It has flowers and plants from all over the world and with changing decorations we found so much art inside that it really made it one of our favourites in Singapore...
,,Enjoy the flowers from around the world,5.0,,Excellent collection and amazing range of Cactii. Needs time as there is a lot see and admire. What colors!
,,Large Garden in air condition dome,4.0,,Singapore is a tropical country and the weather is hot all year round. This is the attraction that you can enjoy flower viewing in a nice cool temperature. The selection of flowers and plants is huge. I personally prefer Singapore Botanic Garden over the flower dome. It is too man-make for me.
,,Beautiful flowers,4.0,,We were amazed to see the flowers display and collections. Some of them we have never even heard of before and kids loved to see the different variety.
,,beautiful,4.0,,the indoor garden is very well maintained the place is very clean and comfortable for visitor it even has air contioner inside.
,,"Lovely Flowers, but gets crowded",3.0,,"For some reason I really wasn’t as impressed with this place as I was with the Forest Dome. Maybe it is because it was basically just a heap of flowers and that the flowers at the Botanic Gardens (especially the ones in the Orchard Gardens) were just so much better. The other thing was that there was a flower show on here at the time, which meant that the place was literally packed. Okay, it was also a Sunday, which probably had something to do with it as well. It is still definitely worth a visit, and you do get a double ticket when you visit the Forest Dome as well, however a part of me just felt that the forest dome was much, much better."
,,Go during events,5.0,,Make sure to check the Flower Dome out during the time they have events. (E.g. Christmas Theme). During these times they decorate everything inside to make it much nicer!
,,Nice and cool place to visit from the heat,4.0,,"A nice dome with good variety of trees, plants and flowers. Cool and relaxing. There are different displays on that make it interesting. Not cold temperature as some people told me."
,,"Avoid winter wonderland, otherwise good for garden lovers",4.0,,"Enjoyed seeing flowers from the world, it is arranged into continents . Some slopes, and steps . More foliage than flowers."
,,quite a unique attraction. tad pricey,4.0,,A lovely attraction that is a sight too behold. the only letdown for me is its a bit pricey like all things in singapore. the free botanic gardens are better but if you cant get out that way check out the flower dome
,,"Beautiful as there are Xmas decos. If normal days, I'm not so sure.",3.0,,"I must say Flower Dome is really beautiful for Xmas season. I am not sure how does the decorations would be if without the Xmas decos. If you would like to visit, probably best time will be when the Xmas decos are up."
,,Lovely Place,5.0,,"I must recommend to visit there if you have plan to go Singapore , Nice decoration inside , variety flowers and perfect combination with little things , must have at least 2-3 picture clicked , The kids will be more enjoy with this dome"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"All kinds of real temperate flowers and trees could be found. They were properly cared for. There were staff around the dome to ensure nobody touched the flowers! Since I love real flowers, the visit was worth it. I could see more flowers in one morning than I could in my entire life!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Very well laid out. A great way to introduce kids to botany Walks are easy, great photo opportunities"
,,Not sure why it is called Flower Dome as there aren't that many flowers inside,3.0,,Decided to go here as we were visiting the cloud forest which is next to it. My suggestion is to skip the flower dome and just go for the cloud forest. The place is freezing cold for some reason. It is relatively small. There aren't that many flowers around. There are different sections and most of the plants were shrubs-like. Quite big selection of Cacti though. There is cafe inside which serves overly priced drink and food.
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,not as impressive after the Cloud Dome BUT still worth the visit to stroll round and admire all the different flowers from round the world
,,so many gardens,5.0,,Loved the views across the city. the individual garden areas were superb . Still had their Christmas theme
,,Amazing,5.0,,Never experienced anything so wonderful. This is a credit to Singapore and the staff at Gardens by the Bay. Stunning.
,,Amazing beauty,5.0,,"What better way to experience the flora of the world than under one roof. We were lucky enough to see the Christmas display as well. Amazing, beautiful, well organised."
,,Another world...,5.0,,"walk thru the door to heaven, like a lost world that you have just found... am i really saying this about a bunch of plants etc; its like the world cup of plants with lots of countries represented with there own little areas..... beaut place, crikey with this amount of people tho , they need a bigger cafe tho impossible to get in there... must see for all"
,,Highly enjoyable,5.0,,And I couldn't care less about flowers. But I caught myself becoming more and more fascinated by the flowers. Very colourful and a huge amount of flowers inside a massive dome. A definite must see when in Singapore.
,,A great collection of flowers...,5.0,,This is an amazing place. The variety of flowers on display was incredible. The place was lively with the Christmas celebrations in place during our visit. It also has a large variety of cactuses. Its a must visit place in Singapore.
,,Excellent,5.0,,A huge variety of plants laid in an easy to follow and understandable route. plenty of staff on hand to help with any questions.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,We went here and combined it with a visit to the cloud done. It is a superb setting and contains flower gardens and plants from different places around the world. It is a world of colour and is very impressive. Well worth a visit and the Mary we paid to go in.
,,Christmas deco overload but pretty,5.0,,"They went all out to make this place Christmassy so we were both impressed and overwhelmed, but all good, we loved the displays and enjoyed our walk through. Avoid crowded days (school holidays)"
,,Flower dome,5.0,,When you enter this dome you feel as if you are in heaven as you are surrounded by flowers and so much of light adds to its beauty.
,,Pleasant Activity but not exciting,3.0,,Can be very crowded. Building was beautiful but gardens did not feel unique. Good activity if humidity is high outside as dome has A/C.
,,Standard,3.0,,"This is a pretty dull exhibition to be honest, the flowers outside the dome are more interesting than those inside. If your into flowers you'll like it, wouldn't say it's really worth paying for"
,,Too much Christmas feeling,3.0,,We went here to see nice and rare flowers but the Christmas decorations were far too much and took over the experience of the Flower Dome. The Cloud Forest was therefore much better.
,,"Nice, but...",3.0,,"Nice place. But not a ""must see"" place. If you have a combine ticket with cloud forest, enter to visit. Not really outstanding."
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,"Not just flowers; there are so many different types of plants growing here it is amazing, everything from succulents to fruit trees and almost everything in between. Even if you aren't a flower buff, it's worth a visit."
,,Enjoyable exhibit,4.0,,"The flower dome is definitely worth going to see. The glass house construction is impressive, not to mention the great flower and plant displays. You will need a good hour or so to appreciate all the exhibits.."
,,See this before the Cloud Forest,4.0,,"Of the two domes here, this one (while really good) pales compared to the cloud forest in the neighboring Dome. Plants from different parts of the world with sculptures dotted in amongst the installations. Great for photographs. When we visited the Christmas display was still up and looked incredible."
,,Amazed by the flora and fauna!,5.0,,"This places possess so many photogenic spots, it's as if every corners and exhibits were planned for a photoshoot. And it's ever changing, from christmas to garden festival to easter and chinese new year, Singapore plans their customer retention very well!"
,,Not as exciting as the Cloud Dome!,3.0,,"Basically just a large collection of flowers and plants, while it is a lovely dome with many lovely displays, our mistake was we went to the waterfall dome first, so this one was a let down."
,,Eclipsed by its sibling,4.0,,"Enjoyable look at a variety of world gardens but greatly eclipsed by the cloud Forrest, however worth a visit."
,,Was way more than I expected,5.0,,Our driver went and bought us tickets to see this attractions and th price was around $25.00 each so thought that a bit much but did not realize the immense size of the gardens and that it also included the Cloud Forest as well. It was all decorated for Christmas so it was an extra treat. Absoutely worth every penny there were so many beautiful types of plants and flowers. Only complaint is that it was rather cool inside and my 85 year old friend was freezing as it had been so warm outside that we had not brought anything to put on our shoulders.
,,Not as great as the Cloud dome,3.0,,"To be honest, I felt that this was overpriced when compared to the other dome. Whilst impressive in its own right, I don't feel I got value for the price."
,,plants from around the world,5.0,,Admission to both domes: 28 S$. A nice get away from the outside heat. It's cool inside.Take a light jacket. There are plants from around the world. It is really amazing. Be prepared for lots of tourist. I mean a lot!
,,Great Opportunity,5.0,,"It is great opportunity to show all different flowers, fauna to your kids. Baobap tree is the star. Wonderland."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"We love all the unique plants in the Flower Dome, some we have never heard before. The themed setup was creative and makes us want to go back to check out other seasonal themed garden."
,,Speechless,5.0,,Exotic flowers everywhere u see....no words to describe the beauty of this place... flowers and plants specific to any country or region in any part of this world can be found in this flower dome...
,,Loads of flowers,5.0,,"I prefer the Cloud Forest, but the Flower Dome is equally as nice. Thousands of flowers that are well maintained. Can't beat the fact that it has AC."
,,A lovely indoor garden to recreate in and enjoy,4.0,,We enjoyed visiting flower dome and also the unusual statues of animals placed throughout the gardens. Nice place to visit on a hot day.
,,Beautiful! Worth the visit,5.0,,Loved seeing all the flowers from around the world! If you have an iPhone 7plus use the portrait option - beautiful pics!
,,Nothing remarkable,3.0,,"If you're visiting from a country with a temperate climate, this would just be like a normal walk in a park. Some parts of the dome are interesting, like the cacti and succulent area, but overall not as exciting as the cloud forest.

Come here if you'd like a relaxing and peaceful walk, and if you don't mind the price."
,,Interesting sculptures. Not a lot of flowers,3.0,,"I think we were expecting a giant hot house of amazing tropical plants and flowers, but were a little disappointed to discover a Christmas theme with fake snow and mostly desert tundra type plants. However the sculptures were amazing and worth a look. We were more impressed with the Cloud Forest."
,,Amazing venue,5.0,,Incredibly creative building and art work through Botanica. Nice descriptions to help those new to plants like myself. I'd say it's worth 80% of the price of admission.
,,Varied Display of Flora,3.0,,"For plant-lovers, this place is a haven. It showcases a wide variety of flowers and they've set up themes for each section to entertain the guests. It provides a very good backdrop for picture taking too."
,,Contemporary Greenhouse,4.0,,Contemporary air conditioned greenhouse with exhibits from all over the world. There are also interesting sculptures of animals made from wood. When we were there they had Christmas exhibits on display. Regrettably the Cloud Forest was closed which I suspect would have been the better of the two for those on a time line or budget.
,,Both Domes are a must see,5.0,,"Another cooled dome in Gardens by the Bay. Discounted entry if you do both domes (which is a no brainer). Huge variety of plants and the layout is excellent. There's an educational aspect to these domes if thats your thing or, like me, you can just relax and enjoy the thought and effort that's gone into creating such a brilliant space."
,,Just stunning !,5.0,,We saw these being built during our last trip to Singapore in 2013 and couldn't wait to see them this trip. We where not disappointed and arrived at 4pm allowing at least an hour for each the Cloud Forest & Flower Garden domes.You do have to experience these to appreciate how amazing they both are. I also think it was extra special going on the 2nd week of December as they where dressed for Christmas. We also booked dinner at IndoChine which is a restaurant positioned at the top of teh nlargest Super Tree in the Super Tree Grove. This was our best highlight during this visit and I would suggest it to any one. You can also have a couple of evening drinks on the roof top bar 1st and watch the sun set with the Marina Bay Sands and city as your back drop ! Again there was a special light show in the Super Tree Grove each evening for Christmas and it was a spectacle in itself - Definitely a MUST DO when in Singapore !
,,Must See for Adults - Flower Dome,5.0,,"A visit to Gardens by the Bay isn't complete without entering the Flower Dome.
But first, let me remind you to bring your jacket because it's freezing cold inside.
I brought my 5 yr. old daughter and she enjoyed some parts of the dome but got bored after a while.
It's overwhelming to see the different kinds of flowers from all parts of the world and various tree sculptures in one dome. When we visited, they had the Christmas theme and my cousins told me that they change themes from time to time.
I recommend this place for adults because there's not much to do for kids."
,,Christmas Time Delight!,5.0,,I am sure that the Flower Dome is wonderful any day of the year. But the Christmas display was outstanding. This is great for the entire family.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Very nice and some great animal sculptures around. Think it would be nicer without the Christmas display as this took up a large area. Apparently different exhibits in this space at different times of year.
,,Superb dome,5.0,,"You can visit this place for hours..it has thousands variety of flowers and plants..
They change the decoration often depends on the month you visit..so there'll be a lot of places to have selfies or wefies..
You can buy the entrance ticket for about SGD 20 from online travel agent or queueing there for more expensive ticket price..
You can reach here by MRT 1 stop before Marina Bay Sand or at MBS..they have shuttle to the dome for SGD 3 round trip or you simply can walk to the dome for about 250 meters..
Note: you should dress you baby or toddler with long sleeves because it's rather cold inside.."
,,A must see,5.0,,The Gardens by the Bay are spectacular with many amazing areas including the flower dome. Spend a day if you can in the gardens.
,,"No big deal, it's just a conservatory",3.0,,"Its a very wet waterfall inside, so be prepared to get very wet, and humid. It's not that great, the waterfall is lit up, so it looks pretty but i honestly didn't really like it.

Great for a few photos but I would recommend super grove over this."
,,Nothing like it in the world,5.0,,"We have seen ""national"" gardens in many counties but have never come across one like this. It is a ginormous bio-sphere filled with plants cactus, flowers and trees from around the world. Throw in some whimsical wood carvings throughout the foliage and it is a great experience.

We were here while the xmas holiday decorations were still up and it was great.

Please allow at least 2 hours to wonder through.

Hope this review was helpful."
,,For plant and flower lovers,3.0,,Can see variety of plants and flowers. Had to go up and walk afew hours. We avoided stairs as had to go with old age parent and kid.
,,fantastic place!,5.0,,"a ""Must see"" in Singapore, cloud forest and the sky walk gives you an amazing experience..exhibition of nature was great"
,,One for the plant lovers.,4.0,,Flowers and garden displays from all corners of the globe. Immaculately manicured and easy to get around.
,,Flowers Everywhere,5.0,,Huge collection of beautiful flowers. We very much enjoyed this. Not too crowded. Spent a couple of hours here. A bit of a walk from the nearest Metro Station under Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall. Look forward to visiting again next year.
,,Very average,2.0,,"This is meant to be one of the ""must sees"" in Singapore, personally feel that it wasn't really worth the entrance fee. Nicely crafted gardens inside showing plants and flowers from around the world, but basically no better than the free admission gardens which are outside"
,,Absolutely Fabulous,4.0,,This exhibition of nature was fabulous. It exceeded my expectations and is well worth the visit. My teenage children were also interested in the dome and that's saying something
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is so beautifully presented in every detail. The plants and artwork are delightful and the journey through the flora examples from different corners of the world make for a very interesting visit!
,,If flowers and plants are your thing,2.0,,"Only good if you are looking to kill time (nice way of saying it was utterly boring). If you purchase tickets online, make sure you save it as PDF and not a screenshot since gate keeper will not let you in (at least on the particular day we went). Since there is no wifi for you to access your email and McDonald's requires you to enter your phone number to use their wifi (which is a problem if you are not from Singapore) you will have to forcefully convince the ticket booth to honor your online ticket purchase; they will stamp your hand if successful."
,,Spend a day !!,5.0,,Book a evening for the Gardens by the bay ....will leave you refreshed and rejuvinated ....Lots of photo shopot opprtunites !!
,,Nice,4.0,,It was quite boring at the first but after that it was nice the attraction of flowers and many kind of flowers 👍🏻
,,trip during the day,5.0,,"We spent an afternoon at the gardens- fascinating with lots to see. take a pick up trolly to take to to the site from the bus stop.
Special note; Local taxi's well worth taking. Very clean and about a 1/3 of the cost of a Taxi hire in Australia - even to the airport. The local bus services are very good. We found the hop on- hop off buses started to look a bit tired, not all that clean and definitely not up to the standard we found in Paris, Amsterdam or Italy."
,,Christmas a must see.,5.0,,The flower dome is located within the Gardens by the Bay and was a must see on our christmas visit. The dome houses plants from throughout the world and was decorated in beautiful xmas themes.
,,Changing Displays,4.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay. Good cactus collection. Has changing displays according to the season. When we went, it is all Christmas displays with snow globes , Santa Clauses and poinsettias."
,,Amazing place to visit,5.0,,"Hours well spent if you visit. It is so beautiful and you can admire a large collection of flowers, plants and more I was really impressed by the beauty and the variety. A place you must visit. Prices are very affordable. Good airco specially agreeable since outside is very hot and humid"
,,The Christmas decoration is really charming,4.0,,"Pros:
- a must visit place if you like: photography, flower or you simply need place to relax
- the air is very fresh here
- wide range of flower and plants.
- during our visit they made a very good Christmas decoration together with flower and plants that related to festive season ( of course they are real not the plastic one! )
- a good place to bring kids. They can learn and see nature
- also a good place for elder people. They do have a lot of place to seat. So they can walk and seat to enjoy the place.
- fully air conditioned room. Its a bit cold here. If you cant stand cold its good idea to bring light jacket here.
- dont forget to bring camera to take up close flowers and plants here
- they do have cafe inside the flower dome

Cons:
- the area is not big. It took around 45 minutes to walk in normal pace
- you need to pay 11sgd for kids, 16sgd adult
- the place can easily packed with people. Try come earlier in the morning to avoid the crowd especially during holiday season
- they only display flowers and plants. There are no butterfly, birds or another animals."
,,Plants from around the world!,5.0,,"Very nicely laid out with plants from around the world with sections such as South Africa, middle east etc. We went during christmas and the place was well decorated to mix and match with the flora!"
,,Fun and lots to see if you like plants,4.0,,Wonderful variety of plants and well displayed in an amazing setting. The Christmas display was special. It was wonderful to smell the roses in the middle of winter.
,,Watch out for swinging selfie sticks!,3.0,,"Seriously.... !
In the Flower Dome there are many... flowers. Beautiful flowers. Beautiful arrangements. Interesting facts on placards around the place.
Therefore, almost everyone is taking photos. And Selfie sticks get swung out in front of you, behind you, and on top of your head, wherever you go. It's hard to actually stroll along and enjoy the flowers. if you can't beat them join them... bring the biggest, nastiest selfie stick you can manage and hold it in front of you so that you can cut a swathe through the other photographers!"
,,"If love flower, must enter this place",5.0,,"Flower dome is not only to see flower or plants but Entertaiment education for children. They put signage name and country of plants.

We spend two hours inside. All families member happy and read the signage.

For Christmas celebration , they decorates all area with spectacular ornaments.

They designed amazing place for people who love flower and plant"
,,Delightful Floral Displays,5.0,,"This was our first visit to Gardens by the Bay. We were told not to miss the Flower Dome, and we are glad we didn’t. Wandering through this clean, air-conditioned arena was a delightful way to spend our last afternoon in Singapore. We viewed an amazing variety of tropical flora species and enjoyed the very creative Christmas displays. We were especially delighted by the imaginative wooden sculptures of horses, monkeys, mountain goats, eagle, and dragon. The whole layout is beautifully organized and well worth a visit. We will be back!"
,,Family Visit,5.0,,"I had been with my family in the summer or 2016 , Its really a beautiful place. There are 2 domes with flowers .
During our visit it was the TULIP special . I have never seen such wide rangeof tulips in my life. So colourful they were."
,,Amazing,5.0,,wondering through different ecosystems and seeing the gardens representing the different continents is just amazing considering the humid heat of Singapore. the gardens are well designed and extremely well maintained. Beautiful - with gorgeous views of the marina bay hotel!
,,Flower fanatic and you must visit this place else skip,3.0,,"if you are not crazy about plants , would suggest to skip the place altogether. This place is usually crowded in weekends requiring detours and long walks. This can be avoided by paying a fee for tram 3$ each. You might watch pictures / videos of people who have visited earlier to get glimpse if its worth the visit."
,,Excellent . . . . U can't ignore,5.0,,Cool & natural but human made. Nice colours & scenic designs developed. Just a natural engineering. Hats off.
,,Floral Splendour and Festive Mood,5.0,,"This dome is by far the more interesting of the two at the Gardens by the Bay.

The are areas displaying different flora from all continents. Its extremely well laid out and is a photographers delight. One could spend 2 to 3 hours looking around and enjoying this pavilion. There is a display in the main display area with wooden nutcrackers celebrating Christmas. Twirling dolls in snowfall in air-filled balloons add to the intrigue. Stroll around quietly - enjoy - take lots of photos and have lots of memories afterwards.

The flowing fucia reminded me of the Garden of the King of the Belgians at his Palace in Brussels - he has so many trellised training fucia in true magnificence, which can be seen here to. Pollen coffee shop make a good stop off half way along for some refreshment. Makes a great day out, and unusually there are lots of place to rest and admire.

I had a wonderful afternoon here. Even bought an annual ticket so I could return."
,,Christmas fantasy,5.0,,The flowers change with the seasons. As I visited Christmas it was flowers that thrive in cooler temperatures. Also dressed with Christmas trees and Christmas themed structures. Really lovely for all ages.
,,Best one in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Stands true to its name, Flower done has much to offer. The best time to visit would be during Xmas and that too in the evening. The place is packed to the feet. What colors and variety of flowers available, simply outstanding.

A must visit when you are in Singapore."
,,Love this place,5.0,,"We went in November and it was like a Christmas fairy land loved, loved, it wonderful decorations many animated stunning gardens, flowers etc."
,,Paradise,5.0,,"Unbelievably spectacular. You will be lost in it's beauty. Can't be really expressed in words. Need to be there to feel it. Have more time in hand and if you are a flower lover, a full day will be required. A photographer's Paradise."
,,Christmas set up at its best,5.0,,"Lots of flowers , lots of colour

The whole place is full of flowers and that too enchanting flowers . When I went the dome had a Christmas setup with beautiful miniatures and statues from the dreamland .

Big Christmas tress surrounded by flowers and smoothing music.

I could see visitors enjoying the flowers as well as the Christmas setup . One will enjoy the different kind of flowers if you like them"
,,awesome,5.0,,cannot find anything like this it's superb awesome nothing can beat the beauty of this place. fully awesome. so many different kinds of flower. love that
,,Tourist Magnet,3.0,,"On both occasions I went, it was a dizzying flood of people. The over the top decor is indeed something to look forward to, and made sense for people to take selfies with flowers on every step and turn. Nice and cool inside the dome."
,,good for a visit,4.0,,not the biggest selection of flowers and this could be because it was Xmas time and it was themed as such. layout somewhat confusing but it is still nice.
,,Great assortment of flowers,5.0,,Spent about an hour walking through the dome. They have different types of flowers and plants from throughout the world. During Christmas they have a Christmas theme.
,,I would call it Tree Dome,5.0,,"I was a little surprised that there were not that many flowres. Big and interesting collection of trees from around the world. Very nicely done. Make sure to look for beautiful wooden sculptures with big dragon the best of all of them ( but I liked all of them).
If you are not fun of Christmas displays you may not like the one that takes central space in the dome now - big attraction for small kids ."
,,FLOWER Power!!,5.0,,"A wonderful way to celebrate my spouse birthday with three young adult children. Fabulous selection of the wonders of mother earth with all its fantastic flora species - Orchids! A million kinds at least to satisfy your curiosity and love for these exotic blooms. Amazing and awesome to see the patience and effortsbehind each prized bloom that won accolades and top awards due to its rarity and colour. Grandeur is expressed as nature's best through the delicate,carefully orchid-hybrid cultivators hand✋ and labor of love."
,,Nice Collection of Flowers,5.0,,"My wife, two children and I visited the Flower Dome as part of a visit to the Gardens by the Bay. There is a wide assortment of flowers from all over the world. Nearby is the Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are the two key things to see at the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"I loved this place so much! The whole place is filled with the smell of flower and the best thing is that it is air-conditioned, which makes it a good place to avoid the hot weather outside. The place is clean and beautifully organised. Remember to charge fully your phone to take pictures of all the lovely flowers! If you are into flower and plants, this place definitely is a MUST-GO! I'm not sure about the price for the entrance ticket as I got mine for free."
,,Too crowded and the flowers were dying,3.0,,"The place was really crowded and it was decorated for Christmas so there were fake snow and christmas decoration. Regardless the decoration, there're not so many flowers even it's called a 'Flower dome'. The plants looked like they were dying."
,,A relaxing diversion,5.0,,"We did this on our first day, and we loved it. The dome is air conditioned, and the plant displays are creative and unique."
,,Lyn,4.0,,"A wonderful Christmas feeling as the Garden transforms more like Christmas . Love to watch the big Globe, angels & toy soldiers displaying beautifully among the fresh flowers of all colours that makes it more amazing to enjoy. It's also cooler in the aircon dome & there's a Pollen cafe where you can relax & have coffee ☕️ Or their afternoon sets with friends or just by yourself"
,,The BEST place I've been,5.0,,I guess the title says it. I cannot think of any more words to describe how beautiful it is. Dont leave this out on your itinerary. 😊
,,OBc skywalk was good,4.0,,"it is good place to hang around with kids and family, various options of restaurants are there to keep your stomach full."
,,Christmas at Flower Dome,5.0,,A perfect setting at the Flower Dome during Christmas makes it magical and out of this world specially for the kids. A great place to have some nice click...so don't forget to take your camera.
,,Worth a Look,4.0,,"You purchase a single ticket for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The Cloud Forest is the better of the two attractions, but the Flower dome has some very unusual plant collections from Africa and Madagascar."
,,Not a plant enthusiasts haven,3.0,,"Perhaps we were unfortunate in visiting in December since there seemed to be more space dedicated to artificial snow, Nutcraker models, ballerinas and poinsettias that anything else. The dome is divided into biomes with regard to plant types, so an Australian area, a S.American one and so on, but it wasn't very dynamic. For me this was a disappointment.."
,,Normal huge garden,3.0,,"If we need make choice again, probably will buy just ticket to the cloud forest. This kind of gardens like The Flower Dome should be for free or improve the program there. Benefits are the Christmas decorations and succulents."
,,Beautiful!,3.0,,Largest glass greenhouse in the world. Great view of beautiful floral. A so so visit just for the nicely grown plants.
,,must see,5.0,,"a unique concept, another must visit place in singapore a restaurant at the top of one of the domes is amazing."
,,Stunning at night!!!,5.0,,We had this included in the Singapore pass and glad we did visit... there are different sections dedicated to countries and the light displays for Christmas are amazing. They even have some fake snow and restaurants to eat. Would have loved to have had some more time here and we will definitely be back.
,,it's heaven!,5.0,,"go around this building then you can see how beautiful they are! I was visiting this gig this december, and there's some event inside about christmas event, all christmas decoration was made by some and many kinds of flower...

also, you can see some plants, tree and of course, flower from each cities around the world, which is, you never see before.. it's trully knowledgeable tour... I love to stau a lil bit longer, because, all the flowers here are so amazing and love to learn and see every flowers here..."
,,colorful flowers very uplifting,5.0,,"The baubabs, cactus and especially the flowers are a sight to see. The colorful flowers together with the Christmas decor are uplifting and worth the walk."
,,Beautiful atheistics. The walking route needs a little work,3.0,,"What an amazing idea , create an environment that can grow plants that otherwise would not exist in Singapore.

The succulent garden is a must see !

The walking route could do with a bit more organisation , often you have to double back a few times to cover off all the side paths. It is easy to miss things so make sure you keep note of what paths you have walked down.

Great escape from the heat of Singapore"
,,Giant Collection of Flowers and Plants,4.0,,One of very beautiful things that make your eyes relax and enjoy in each corner discovering new flowers and plants from different country Very clean place arranged very well and sure you will have many many photo My family enjoyed too much
,,Awesome,5.0,,We visited in xmas time. So decoration was plus point for us. Superb collection of different species of plants and flowers. Must visit.
,,for Flower lovers!,5.0,,"if you love plants and flowers, this is the place you should go!
the temperature in flower dome is around 20 degree celsius which is cool. There are many species of flowers including from Africa, Mediterranean and tropical region.
One very nice thing is about you can see how Singapore people maintain this whole thing. Very impressive!"
,,Interesting assortment of flowers and plants,4.0,,"A very comfortable garden to explore, due to the cooler and less humid conditions within the glass dome as compared to the other open-air gardens (free for all).
As a local, I would recommend to visit this place if you are at GBTB - once might be enough, but certainly worth checking out. Leisurely strolling through the park, it took us about 1h to explore the various regions within the dome."
,,Crowded,3.0,,Too many people stop and take pictures of essentially anything and everything making a walk through this otherwise global buffet of flowers a little too long for what it is. Worth it at night b/c the lights are pretty but there are better places to spend your money.
,,Remarkable building,3.0,,"The dome is remarkable and if you are a gardener or a botanist, I'm sure it is fascinating. Unffortunately we were a little disappointed. From the name, we were expecting a riot of colour but in practice, most of the plants were not flowering."
,,A different experience,4.0,,This is a huge closed dome where plants from different parts of the world are grown in a controlled environment. You can see different species of plants inside this dome. We felt somewhat suffocating as it was closed. The whole dome is air-conditioned and optimal temperature is maintained for the survival of plants. It is a different experience as we have not seen such a thing in our life.
,,Interesting,5.0,,"I walked these streets today for over a couple of hours, I found it very interesting. Full of culture, full of scenery, great for my first day in Singapore. Awesome local foods. If you love your photography some great shots here."
,,Loved the Flower dome,4.0,,Such beautiful and interesting plantings. The dome can be difficult to negotiate if you have a wheelchair or disability as ramps turn to steps.
,,Flower Dome,4.0,,Many types of flowers. Very well organized and convenient place for visitors. Suitable for all ages to visit.
,,You could have been in Copenhagen's Tivoli gardens with the Nutcracker themed Cristmas deco,5.0,,"Stunning to look at , great Christmas trees and large sized snow globes and fields of colour. A mix of themed gardens as you would find at a botanic garden in zones like Australia, south America...Plenty of seating to wander around stop and enjoy, air conditioned so that the ambient temp was no more than low 20's"
,,Lovely place to see whilst on holiday,5.0,,We went to the Flower Dome and were very pleased that we did it is a nice leisurely place to visit you can just wander around at your own pace taking it all in.
,,"Flower Dome during Christmas, wow!!!",5.0,,"We had the opportunity to visit the flower dome in Gardens by the Bay during Christmas and it was beautifully laid out with lights, Christmas themed villages, poinsettias throughout and a magnificent selection of winter flowers on display. We had young children with us and they really enjoyed all the decor."
,,flower garden dome,5.0,,It is one of the best flower dome available in garden . Flowers are placed according to their regionwise . You will love this. One time watch.
,,Disappointing for me,3.0,,Only a few words here I am afraid. No special wonder unless there is a flower show on. So save it for later if you need to. Unless you are a foreign visitor and do not mind the lacklustre compared to another garden around te world. Only conform is the respite from the heat on a humid day.
,,World class,5.0,,Buy the ticket for both domes and the tree top walk. Do the Flower dome before lunch and come back in the evening before the laser show. Do the rain forrest dome and finish at the tree top for the light show.
,,Bloomin Heck,5.0,,Wow-what an amazing place. The architecture for one and then all that's inside. The huge trees and incredible wood carvings and statues. We went there and were very fortunate to see all the Christmas displays as well. Loved every part of it all.
,,Fantastic Xmas Show,5.0,,This was the perfect place to spend a hot and humid couple of hours. The Xmas display was spectacular. The whole area was well worth a visit but this dome was special at this time of the year.
,,Full of colors,5.0,,its so refreshing to be in the flower dome. Different species of flowers. Soothing to the eyes. u can spend good 30-40 minutes in this dome. there was some superb christmas decoration
,,More plants than flowers,4.0,,Very lush and beautiful. The conifers and grevillias are amazing. Worth a walk through. Sit and relax above the main area in the Mediterranean garden.
,,Flower Kingdom,5.0,,Beautiful flowers.will require long walks. Ideal for families. Ideal for all ages. Offers nice scenic views and relaxing temperature inside. An indoor activity and a must see when in Singapore
,,Nice,4.0,,"If you are visiting cloud forest, don´t miss out to see the flower dome. Though as European, I was hoping to see more exotic flowers, as this dome is hosting a large collection of meditaerenian plants."
,,Absolutely beautiful!!!,5.0,,"Magnificent display of plants and flowers from all over the world. The work that has gone into this attraction is unbelievable. A beautiful waterfall runs all the way down in the centre. Even if you are not into plants, you will still find this amazing."
,,"Pretty, but not worth the price if you're from Aus",3.0,,"While it was beautiful and we loved the wooden sculptures, many of the plants can be seen in Australia, which made the experience less spectacular. We also thought the Christmas display was a little tacky, though it may have made the experience more enjoyable for those with children. In our view, save your money and just go to the Cloud Dome - that was truly spectacular!"
,,Always impressive!,5.0,,Always worth a visit as the seasonal displays are outstanding. How they manage to have so many flowers in bloom at once is amazing. The dome is so huge that it never seems crowded and is also nice and cool in contrast to outside. Nice views too.
,,"stunning, Breath taking, mesmerising",5.0,,stunning place. been there with friends and we enjoyed every minute of it. the place is cool and interesting and close to many different attractions.
,,bountiful flora species,3.0,,"plenty of flowers and different species of plants cramped inside this dome, a lot of tourist enjoying the view of different plants presented in the garden. the plants looked stressed due to the atmosphere. caretakers regularly replaced the dying/malnourished plants with the same size."
,,worth the walking,5.0,,"Lots of walking involved attractive displays broken down into country sections .fully wheelchair accessible for the mobility challenged ,"
,,A another MUST SEE,5.0,,Buy a ticket combining the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest - great value for money and both are spectacular. There was so much more to see than we thought - Make sure you give yourself plenty of time - its worth it
,,Discover the flora of every corners of the world under one roof,5.0,,This botanical garden contains samples of the most representative plants and flower of the five continents presented in their natural habitat.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Just like my review on the Cloud dome, the flower dome is the first display. Amazing gardens, driftwood sculptures and art pieces. The range of plants is amazing and especially great if you love succulents!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,Beautiful so many things that I have never seen . good collection. Enjoyed so much.they have one area where volunteers are giving info about flowers
,,Fantastic,5.0,,A must see for the flower fanatics among us. Had a huge Christmas display in centre when we were there.
,,Nature loves,5.0,,What an amazing place. So many different types of plants. You can take some really cool photos here. Lots to see. A must.
,,Impressive planting!!,4.0,,The planting is beautiful . So are the sculpture made from drift wood. Did not like the chritmas decoration . It looked out of place but this is only seasonal . Do do not let this put you of visiting .
,,Picturesque attractions,4.0,,"One of the best attractions that we should pay a visit in Singapore. The dome is as huge as a stadium. The flower is grown inside with many kinds of species. If you haven't visit Keukenhof garden in Netherlands, we can take a trip to flower dome. In some specific month, the garden is covered with tulip gardens.
Should prepare maps and water.."
,,Beautiful and Wonderful,5.0,,"My wife picked this attraction as one of several places to visit in Singapore in 4 days. The dome is beautifully designed and landscaped with different beautiful flowers, shrubs, and trees amid some animal sculptures to make the place look like a safari. It is a relaxing and comforable tour of the dome in about 2 hours."
,,Three day visit Singapore,5.0,,We did this at the night time and it was great but it would be better to see it by the day to see all the colours clearly because the lightning wasn't so good. But that might be because my eyes were tired from walking all day.
,,Beautiful dome but shadowed by it's big brother.,4.0,,Out of the two this is the little brother. Easy to walk around and you can see everything quite quickly. Definitely worth the extra to see.
,,Nice enough if you have a combined ticket,3.0,,"We visited this dome after the cloud dome. It was relatively uninteresting, and we completed our visit quickly. The flowers and plants are nice enough, but nothing unusually impressive for a garden of this type. The Christmas theme was over the top and distracting. If I could do it again, I'd visit the cloud dome and skip this one (although I believe they only sell combo tickets to both?)."
,,Why did they call it flower dome?????,3.0,,"We bought a ticket to both domes and after visiting this one, we instantly regretted it. After visited Kew Gardens in London and Orchid Garden in Singapore, this place doesn't stand up to expectations at all. Most of the space was taken by a restaurant and Xmas decorations. I didn't see a huge variety of flowers here. We saw more in the Cloud Forest dome for example. The space is very small and I think it's definitely not worth the price they asking for. I would like to see this dome included in the same ticket you buy to visit Cloud forest. They should not charge extra for it at all"
,,You have to visit this place,5.0,,"Wonderful flowers and trees, big area - so beautiful. We visited in December so the Christmas decoration made it fantastic."
,,My preference was the other dome but this was good,3.0,,"Lots of flowers and very very large trees from all over the world, informative and not too crowded. Easy access for people of all ages and abilities"
,,Global floral arrangenents,4.0,,"A huge dome set out with floral arrangement and plants set out by region. It's nice and cool in here so a great way to escape the humidity.

There was also a Christmas set up while we weee there which was nice. Probably not as good as the cloud dome, spent around 45 mins in here."
,,Where are the flowers?,3.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay parklands, the entrance ticket to the Flower Done is $28/adult but it provides a combined entrance to the Cloud Forest Dome.
Whilst interesting it doesn't have the same impact as the Cloud Forest Dome. The paths and walkways here lead you through a series of different gardens representing different regions around the world. Was disappointed that there wasn't as many flowers blooming as I had expected. Maybe it was the time of the year.
The Christmas centrepiece with enormous snow globe, giant nutcrackers, oversized Xmas tree and carols was a little at odds with the cacti, boat trees, and Mediterranean garden beds."
,,Gorgeous - Christmas decorations to boot!,5.0,,Must see when at the gardens - have to buy separate ticket for the domes - if only wanting to do one - the Cloud Dome is more impressive
,,A wide variety of flowers and plants in one place,4.0,,"Although not as breathtaking as the Cloud Forest next door, the Flower Dome is still worth a visit. There is a huge variety of plants to see, all arranged based on either type (eg cactus) or climate (eg Australia or Mediterranean.) It is well laid out with plenty of signposts describing the plants you can see.
We visited at sundown and the dome is well lit at night, very atmospheric. We loved the driftwood sculptures dotted around the dome too. After dark it did begin to get chilly in the dome as the environment is obviously controlled for the various plants inside.
There are plenty of benches to sit & rest, as well as toilet facilities."
,,Indoor garden in Singapore,3.0,,I visited this place yesterday. I buy the ticket to this place together with the Cloud Forest. I think this place ok only but the good think is because I visited in the end of November so the place have been change to Christmas theme which make it looks beautiful and it's a good place to avoid Singapore heat.
,,Flowers everywhere,4.0,,Cool place but not as cool as Cloud Forest Pretty much smelly since there're a lot of flowers here Two hours should be enough to get around
,,Every time is different,5.0,,"The theme (Africa)was different from the last time (India)and it was stunning.When I first got in I was not sure what i would see, but as I walked around it got better. The displays were so interesting with a range of plants. Lots of information about the plants.Really interesting"
,,Wide variety of flowers,5.0,,"This attractions gives you various variety of flowers from across the globe , where flowers from 7 continents can be seen."
,,Take time to enjoy,5.0,,"In complete comparison to the cloud forest, this dome is more Mediterranean in feel with the planting and sculptures within the dome. Lots of quiet areas to sit to admire the foliage and do some people watching."
,,Flowers around,4.0,,This is a nice place or dome I should say. You need to pay an entrance fee to get inside. It was great to see these flowers around.
,,Special Flower Dome,5.0,,Singapore always like summer day and temperature is always high. Flower Dome with many kind of different flowers and trees. Some of them are not easy to see in Asia. But we can from this Dome to see it. Also we can comfortable to walk here and not feel hot.It's a great place.
,,Okay,4.0,,Many varieties from flowers to cactus . But after visiting cloud forest and being blown away this dint ammuse me as much
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"You can find all kinds of flowers beautifully displayed in the flower dome. There are terraces for flowers of various continents too. It has huge variety of trees & flowers and its a treat to the eyes. If covered in leisure, one can easily spend 3-4 hrs here."
,,Form cactus to flowers.....and ...,4.0,,"Well if you enjoy flowers, trees, plants and some amazing wooden animal sculptures, this is the place for you. Great size with a Xmas display at this time. Nice place to walk, relax and enjoy living greenery from all over the world"
,,The worlds largest greenhouse with unique displays,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is located at the northern end of the Gardens by the Bay.

It is the world’s largest greenhouse and houses a range of unique plants and spectacular displays from five continents.

A walk around within this huge structure incorporates gardens scenes from South Africa, Australian, South American, Mediterranean and includes huge trees such as Palms, Bottle trees, Baobabs and Olive groves.

There is also a large inclusion of succulents and a changing flower display, which happened to be a celebration of Chrysanthemums during our visit.

There were also some wooden sculptures on display with an intriguing and detailed dragon perched on a tree, being a highlight."
,,Flower Dome fantastic,5.0,,"The Flower Dome in November 2016 is themed Xmas. The displays are wonderful with Xmas Trees, fairies, nutcracker soldiers decorations and artificial snow. The normal displays are there as well, stunning with plants from around the world on display. We were thrilled to see the Australian display extremely well done. Highly recommend going there."
,,A Wonderlan Visit,5.0,,"The Dome was filled with Christmas exhibits as well as colourful flowers and bushes. It is great for children at this time of year seeing Santa, Fairies and Christmas Toys as working models"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"A lot of flower from almost all country, a very beautiful place, indoor activity but the air is so fresh"
,,Great place to spend a couple of hours.,5.0,,The floral displays are excellent. I especially liked the succulent displays. You can definitely see the time and effort that has been put in to provide such a wonderful display.
,,a must visit place,4.0,,a place where flowers from all across the world grow. A must see place as the concept is great and you see nature but all of it controlled and orderly not wild growing but all organised
,,"Flower Dome , part of Gardens by the Bay.",5.0,,Gardens by the Bay can really be divided into three activities of which the flower dome is one. It proved to be a lovely experience. It is set out in areas of the world with plants and trees and supported by carvings and models of animals that derive from that region. It took us about 90 minutes to walk around at a slow pace. If you are very interested in plants there is a free walk/talk around the dome so it would be worth checking out the times to coincide with your visit. Our tickets were purchased from a tourist centre beforehand for the whole Gardens which meant we did not have to queue for tickets and they were slightly cheaper than if purchased there.
,,Amazing array of world plants.,4.0,,Great display of plants from around the world in a very well put together exibit. Included in the ticket for the Cloud Forrest which is a must visit destination.
,,Loved the trees,5.0,,"The flower dome was awesome I saw plants,trees,flowers I never seen in my life. The desert section was beautiful. Would highly recommend going. Plus a lovely restaurant located inside with good food."
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,"This is a huge exotic exhibit of flowers, shrubs and trees of around the world. There were many unique sculptures of wood and various other accessories to the exhibit. This is a must see!!"
,,"Boring, not worth the money",1.0,,"In light of the big deal that is made of this attraction, and given the size of the dome, I expected a fantastic exhibit. It was very unimpressive and I walked through very quickly."
,,flower phobia......,5.0,,I visited the place....when there was lilytophia celebration.....full of lilies wide spread.....feast for eyes.....there are a lot of points where you can click memories.......since the place is inside the gardens by the bay....its easy to have peek.....
,,Beautiful presentation under a dome,5.0,,"You may see flowers from your area that you do not consider unusual but to others they have never seen those plants, Well organized and printed. Time to enjoy nature's beauty."
,,Worth a look,5.0,,Very beautiful place to visit with kids or couples you can take your time to look around no rush.You could spend a day loking around all the grounds.
,,Great experience,4.0,,Experience was great but thought that the $18 is a bit too expensive. Try to book only when there's promotions!
,,A good way to spend a few hours seeing plants from around the world,4.0,,"I'll start by saying that as a non Singaporean, you have no choice but to buy a SD$28 ticket that allows you to visit both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome (Singaporeans can choose to buy tickets for one or other or both at a discounted price).

The Flower dome houses a collection of plants from around the world from desert areas (e.g. cacti) through to mediteranean areas (e.g. olive trees), arid plants (e.g. baobab tress) and more. It even has an Australian section (pines, kangaroo paws, birds of paradise plants). Lots of interesting sculptures as well - dragons, goats, eagles and more.

As it was late November, they had started displays of Christmas snow angels etc so it sort of spoilt the atmosphere a bit as I didn't think that was what the Flower Dome should be displaying but that's just my personal opinion. Still lots of nice flowers to see.

Definitely worth the visit."
,,Beautiful Gardens.,3.0,,"It wasn't what I expected. Lovely plants from all over the world. I expected a little more, however it was calming and relaxing and I am pleased we visited the flower dome."
,,Beautiful and Cold,5.0,,Beautiful garden and totally worth the visit. Greatly decorated and with many different species it is a pleasant visit. Be mindful to have a coat with you. The air conditioning is extrememely cold.
,,Beautifully done,5.0,,"We went just after Christmas and the decorations were still up. This is my sons favorite place, he can't wait to go back next year!"
,,Beautiful flowers,3.0,,Beautiful flowers and cold.. might not be a good place for little ones but great for nature lovers and to see the different plants from different areas of the world
,,variety of flowers and photostop,4.0,,"It has colorful flowers, trees arranged on 2 floors, good location to take photos, it has olive plants, structures made by trees and flowers"
,,"Technology, combined with flair, imagination and horiculture.",5.0,,I have seen some great gardens around the world and would put this up there with the best. Allow at least half a day for each of the domes to get a real good idea.
,,Just Ok,2.0,,"Needed more flowers. I could see what the theme was supposed to be; however, to be a flower dome you need more flowers. The best exhibit was the Christmas displace. After Christmas, I would be curious as to how it is advertised."
,,Just a green house,3.0,,"It's ok, nothing special. Just another green house. They already have x'mas decorations now though, which is quite beautiful and festive."
,,Interesting features,4.0,,Large area of planting sectioned into different continents with many larger than life statues off animals. A very interesting and lovely place to walk around.
,,Not worth the money,3.0,,Quite an ordinary array of flowers mostly from the Mediterranean. We found it to be quite unexciting. There are a few nice sculptures but definitely not worth the $28 it cost to go in.
,,A must see sight for Flower Lovers,5.0,,This large dome has a mix of different plants from different areas of the world. Intersperced beween the cleverly displayed flora are quirky exhibits made from all sorts of materials
,,always worth visiting - especially the baobabs,5.0,,"An amazing garden from all around the world. I love the baobabs area. I also like that the displays change over time. Last time I visited, the central area was very different to this trip. Absolutely beautiful."
,,So many beautiful flowers .,5.0,,Everyone going to Singapore should not miss going to the Flower dome . We were amazed at all the different varieties of flowers . The tulips were out and the colors were amazing. You can spend many hours . There are just so many displays
,,Good displays,5.0,,"A well laid out set of displays of plants from across the world. Sometimes it was missing the wow factor and some of the displays were ok but not outstanding as one would expect.

Follow the paths and it takes you on a journey across the globe and the different environments. Interesting sculptures throughout."

,,Fabulous array of plants,5.0,,Fabulous array of plants and flowers from all over the world in one place. Excellent sculptures there also enhance the experience. A worthwhile visit.
,,A cool relief from the heat,4.0,,"To be honest escaping from the heat was the best thing for me about this attraction.
There were lots of interesting sculptures but if I was to do it again I would skip the two domes and just enjoy the outdoor gardens and the super tree grove light show (this would also have saved me $$$).
Out of the two domes I did enjoy this one the best though."
,,Nice Place,5.0,,Its a beautiful place inside The Gardens By Bay. 1000s of variety of flowers maintained very nicely inside the doom. To watched during the day as well as night. Sundiip sundiip@kitetourism.net
,,All the world's beauty in one place..,4.0,,The place is simply marvellous. A man made Noah's arc. The entire dome is divided into 7 zones of gardens from different parts of the world. And each is better than the previous one. Not to be missed.
,,flowers flowers,4.0,,everything flowers!!!!!!! well laid out flower dome with variety of species to excite tourists. very relaxing
,,Must See,4.0,,Recommended in one of your visits in Singapore. You can appreciate more the wonder of God's creation.
,,Interesting,4.0,,Interesting concept and during the Chinese New Year is a great time to visit because flowers are shaped into their zodiacs.
,,"beautiful, must visit",5.0,,"beautiful, must visit . . . Its absolutely astonishing and such huge variety of all kinds of flora and fauna. not an easy job maintaining the same. perfect for pictures and exploring all the greenery from across the world"
,,Flower fantastic,5.0,,"The variety of plant groupings was very informative and the varieties within groups was an education to those who are not ""green thumbs"". The use of structures covered in plantings was a good way of highlighting varieties - particularly the Mini. Our guide was very knowledgeable as to the varieties that were in all areas. On completion of the tour he recommended areas that we should explore further to gain a better understanding of the Dome."
,,Excellent centre for plants,5.0,,Very accessible to all with displays of plants and flowers from all over the world. Well worth a visit if plants and flowers are your thing.

,,It was okay,4.0,,I went to this dome after visiting the cloud forest and being blown away and this just didn't wow me as much. it is well set out. The cacti and succulents were a highlight for me.
,,Not as enjoyable as Cloud Dome,3.0,,We went here after the Cloud Dome and were a little disappointed. There must have been a great display before we arrived as the flowers were all tired or dead. So we just quickly looked and went out to wander around the gardens and see the SupaTrees. But we are happy we have visited. We are sure that the Flower Dome would be amazing in full bloom.
,,Absolutely Stunning Setup of Flora,5.0,,An amazing setup with a large variety of greenery developed indoor. Awesome for taking good photographs and seeing amazing Plants
,,Amazing driftwood sculptures!,5.0,,"+ great area to visit for people who like plants and gardens
+ loved the driftwood sculptures
+ great way to pass the time while waiting for the 7:30 super tree light show (and avoid the heat and humidity!)

- a bit of a walk from Marina Bay Sands"
,,Not as good as cloud forrest,3.0,,"As the title says, it's not as good as the cloud Forrest, I would probably say next door has more flowers on display as this was pretty poor, more trees than anything elsd. It was also very busy"
,,This is one to put on your must see list while in Singapor,5.0,,When you visit start at the top and work your way down so turn right to visit the desert gardens and the work you way down throught all the diffrent types of gardens and plants at the end you finish up in the gift shop dont stop go into the Cloud gardens and work your way through it you could spend 2 hours or a whole day you will finish up in the gift shop at the end
,,Lots of Flowers!,5.0,,"Even if you're not a garden or a plant person, this attraction is still a must-see as all the flowers are very pretty to look at"
,,Informative,4.0,,"The flower dome is one of the paid conservatories in the Gardens by the Bay, and it is worth the entry fee. Has a very large collection of flora from across the world, segregated by region, and nicely labelled. We found the African and South American areas particularly interesting.

Being mercifully air conditioned it is also a relief from the heat and has plenty of places to sit as you walk along. It is a sort of compact indoor botanical gardens. Its much larger than you initially think it is, and it actually takes about 2 hours if you were to look at the plants and flowers in some detail.

Recommended."
,,Another exceptional Garden in Singapore.,5.0,,Singapore does gardens SO well! This is yet another example of the beautiful design and architecture on offer. The gardens are separated into different gardens from different countries. Worth a visit to escape the heat during the middle of the day. Spend as long or as short a tie as you like. We loved it.
,,Best indoor park,4.0,,When i go to garden by the bay there is 2 indoor park..and flower dome was one of it.many collection of flower from all around the world especially from asia. We can learn and see with our eye all flower that was very very good. Please use jacket..
,,Impressive collection of flowers,4.0,,A nice place to take a leisurely walk away from the Singapore heat. It is definitely worth a visit..
,,"Novel, much better at night with lighting",4.0,,"During the day, it's just a garden of flowers or small plants from different countries. And walking round it only takes 15 minutes. But at night, it looks much better with the lighting they have setup."
,,Good. Optional,4.0,,This Conservatory can be Optional in the Gardens By The Bay. Still if taken quite a good collection of flowers and trees.
,,Crowded but worth it,4.0,,"Not sure If we were just unlucky or its normally like this but there was at least 10000 people in this dome and it made for some vary interesting moments.

The dome itself is worth looking at because of its incredible design alone though and it is well worth the look."
,,A great family distenation,4.0,,"eye pleasing sight ! Beautiful flowers and art, It doesn't need a lot of time to check out the whole place, after you're done you can check the cloud forest or just enjoy the outdoor free gardens .
We went on a Thursday, there were a lot of people put not in an annoying way, better to go early ."
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,"Many kinds of flower from many areas. They separate to 3 part and each one has different flower: Africa, Australia,..."
,,Fantastic surprise!,5.0,,"This isn't the type of venue I typically would visit, but I had heard that it was good and my spouse wished to see it, so I went along.

Wow! Amazing... the gardens were beautiful, well-planned, and peaceful. We had a lovely lunch in the restaurant here. Would absolutely visit again in the future."
,,A cool place to spend few hours.,4.0,,The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions and houses a collection of plants from deserts all over the world. A cool place to spend few hours when outside is hot and humid. Nature lovers will love it.
,,Visit in the daytime,4.0,,Visited the flower dome more as a check the box item...was about 8 pm and very tired when we visited. Did not enjoy it too much although the displays looked incredible. Should be visited in the daytime to enjoy fully.
,,Must See,5.0,,"Beautiful indoor flower, garden, landscaped facility. INDOOR. Away from the heat. I need more characters."
,,Just loved this place,5.0,,If you are in Singapore you should not miss this one. Keep sufficient time with you so that you can enjoy the garden.
,,A great place to spend a few hours,4.0,,This was quite a surprise. Air conditioned. Comfort. Really great. Take a slow meander around a large area ( feels like acres/hectares of enclosed space. Perfectly manicured. Just so !!!! What a country. The assortment of vegetation was wonderful. Allows one to get out of the outside world. A suggestion is to get your favourite music and headphones and go for a walk in your own peaceful world in beautiful peaceful surrounding. Must do especially in late afternoon so you can find the 7:45PM and/or 8:45PM evening light show closeby in the outdoor garden. With a little bit of planning a wondrous adventure.
,,One of the best...,5.0,,"The Marina Gardens is one of the best excursions that I've ever taken, I absolutely loved going, and I was a tourist that went alone. It's perfectly safe and you would definitely enjoy the experience!"
,,nice go at night too,5.0,,very interesting and note that at night they have a visual colorfull lights show with music . very nice . for those staying at the Marina Bay Sands with garden view you will be able to see it too

,,Beautiful and well maintained,4.0,,"The flower dome, combined with the cloud forest are both well worth visiting.

It is a nice snapshot of flora and fauna from around the world with displays representing five continents."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Don't miss it , beautiful. Tropical and very well organized. Take your time , take photos. There are flowers here you won't see any where else."
,,Love it,4.0,,Not really fond of cactus but the trees from different countries were amazing. We left the flowers to the last. Not all flowers were featured but the different colours of Callas were so pretty. Caught live static & babybreath first time in my life. Was disappointed that ther isn't any Hydrangea. The roses smell really nice. Would love to go again
,,Cool and so many flowers to see.,4.0,,"If you are flowers lover, please visit this place. It is a must. This place is well organize and the dome is cool from the hot weather outside. You can see some flowers which never see before."
,,Awesome!!!,5.0,,"A must see. We came twice. At night and then in the day. Better in the day time. A remarkable experience. I would go again next time in Singapore. For anything who appreciates the diversity of flora on earth, this place is a remarkable experience. I was speechless from the moment I entered the dome to the moment I left."
,,Quite disappointed,3.0,,"I expect the dome has full of flowers. I went there last week Oct 21, 2016. I only appreciate the dome is air conditioned room. Coz it is so hot outside. They should improve the dome put a lot of flowers"
,,Smashingly beautiful. Not to miss in Singapore,5.0,,"Thousands of species of flower and plants are housed under this air conditionned dome. Walkpaths meander between patches of plants grouped by similariries or by regions. The upper part contains succulent and other kinds of shrubs while the lower part is home of flowers of the earth. Numrous interesting sculptures dotted different parterres, alligators, monkeys, gazelles, hippos, lions, wapiti...
Very interesting for the youngs and lesser youngs."
,,Not to atractive,3.0,,It is a regular flower dome not more then similar in the all world.... If you don't have what to do you can make a.. V on this location
,,World class arboretum,5.0,,This is a world class arboretum. we have traveled extensively and can become bored with plant collections. But this place is one of the best in the world. the plants and the layout is terrific.
,,Great for Gardeners,4.0,,There are so many varieties of plants and they are set within there own geographical areas and it work really well.
,,"Eyecatching, detail in every garden just waiting to be seen!!!!",5.0,,Simply stunning. If you love gardens this is the est place to see so many plants cohabiting under a man made dome ... how they manage to control temperatures to ensure growth of these plants from different areas around the world is a credit to technology and to the imaginations and visions of the creators of these gardens. An absolute must do in Singapore . The quirky nature of the details in the gardens are captivating. But you must look !!!!
,,A must see!,5.0,,"Yes you must see this! This is next to the Cloud park. You can buy a joint ticket and if you are tired, you can get a shuttle (for a small fee)"
,,Amazing view of world plants and flowers,5.0,,"Amazing view of world plants (asia, Africa, Europe, America and flowers Have to pay entrance fee to go in"
,,Plants from.around the World,5.0,,Enjoyed the flower dome with its plants from around the World and it's explanations of all the exhibits. Very colourful and also staff very good and helpful.
,,Cool Stroll,5.0,,Pleasantly cool while getting to see different plants. The plants are clearly labeled and arranged in sections that allow even young children to understand and take interest. Very well done and despite many people you do not feel as if you are being herded like cattle like you do at most attractions. Very well laid out and close to the other attractions. Nice size gift store. If you are coming back at night for the light/music show make sure a staff member at the exit stamps your hand. Once you leave you can not reenter the dome so take your time and enjoy!
,,Not for person who is not botanically too inclined,1.0,,It is a very well built landscape of plants . However honestly speaking was not too impressed by it . there should be more saring of knowledge about these othersie its just see and keep moving
,,Excellent,5.0,,One of the must visit place whenever you visit Singapore. It is quite an experience to understand and appreciate such a development
,,"Plenty to see, good escape from the heat",4.0,,There are a lot of flowers to see and they were broken up into regions which was nice but after the Cloud Forrest where I spent 2 hours this was a quick walk around and admiring the flowers in less than an hour. If there was some food places where we could sit and have an actual meal right outside it would have been a great way for us to recharge and stay longer but the main food places were just too far away in the heat.
,,Fragrant,5.0,,A perfect example of how creative human beings can be. Lovely flowers and they keep changing the themes with seasons. Beautiful flowers and tulips when we visited
,,Take a break from shopping,4.0,,"This beautifully landscaped garden display is well worth a visit. Check out the Australian garden, interesting to see how other countries see us."
,,Huge variety of plants and lovely sculptures,4.0,,"Firstly, we aren't really flower people. However I still found the flower dome interesting with a large variety of plants from many different countries. If you love plants, flowers and nature this would be a great pick for you. I really enjoyed the sculptures scattered around in the displays. We visited during the theme 'tribal tempo' so there was African inspired sculptures like lions etc."
,,Great gardens,5.0,,What a great spot to visit and get some exercise of just enjoy the peaceful surrounds. So green and lush
,,Indoor garden attraction,5.0,,"Always a good place to go when you are looking for something to do in SIngapore. Nice and cooling atmosphere, easy to walk about and check out the new flowers in 'season' or in 'theme'. Christmas is a cool time to go down as the decor changes to fit the christmas season!"
,,Good to see,4.0,,It'd in Gardens by the Bay & Near Marina Sands By the Bay.You can go there by taxi or MRT . The taxi from Downtown to there is about 7 to 10 Singapore dollar and depend on the kind of taxi.
,,One of the most massive gardens in a cool environment,5.0,,Lots of special species of flowers that you do not get to see on the local roads of Singapore. Many exotic flowers and all set in a cool environment that allow you to enjoy long walks
,,Always a delight to visit Flower Dome,5.0,,"Been there on several occasions and seen different flower setups like Orchard theme, Christmas etc. Always well done. Also the walk outside and the Laser show are worth going for."
,,Relaxed & Laid Back,5.0,,"The moment you enter the dome, you are greeted with a sense of relaxation. The cool air and accompanying music along with the different species of flowers, plants and shrubs will make you want to make that place your own bedroom. Its like an escape from reality. Go visit there sometime and im sure you'll enjoy it. Dont forget to check out the other exhibits!"
,,Like a Botanical Garden,5.0,,"Bought the ticket for both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest from Changi Airport tourist information stall for S$29.
Visited the Flower dome around 3.00pm on Saturday.
There are many flowers and trees to see.

Flower dome is next to the Cloud forest (just the next building)"
,,A great display of seasonal flowers,3.0,,"This dome is full of flowers depending on the season. Like Last February, they will decorate it with Cherry Blossoms and you can witness it from buds to full bloom, the whole month of February to March and few days of April. Then from April to May it will b a display of tulips. And so on and so forth. The garden is cold because they have to maintain a temperature suitable for the flowers and orchids inside. Aside from the display of flowers in the middle, this dome has all year round cactus, wild orchids and unusual flowers.

no restaurants inside the dome but just outside the main door, there are few selections of snacks."
,,amazing,5.0,,"have heard so much about the gardens...it is a must do while in SG.beautiful,amazing,colourfull.what a great place.spent a couple of hours exploring all the different gardens and displays.sooo good. ken"
,,the gardens lovers,5.0,,this place is so beautiful and incredible was here 2 times and never get bord always new things to see ans explore
,,Indoor garden,4.0,,This is one of the rarest type of gardens I have seen. Very well maintained and has got variety of flora and fauna from across the world.
,,Not worth the money,1.0,,This place.is not worth the money. Also why will I want to see plants in a AC environment. It's a garden in a garden . I wonder how the plants survive the cold given that there are some plants from the hotter region.
,,Too many people,4.0,,"Admittedly I visited the Flower Dome after seeing the Cloud Dome and I was tired from a full day of walking, so by this stage I wanted a quiet place to sit ... and this is definitely not the case in the Flower Dome. People everyone which kind of distracted from exploring the beauty of the plants. Interesting sculptures throughout. And as an Aussie, I really enjoyed the Australian Garden."
,,Better to go in the evening,3.0,,"This was not as good as last time we went, 3 years ago, however it is probably best seen in the early evening, as they light it up. Lovely and cool inside the dome."
,,So Cool inside,5.0,,"Great place to visit. Loved the varied gardens. Beautifully done, so very cleverly designed. If you love flowers/gardens this is a great place to visit"
,,Simple but fascinating,4.0,,"There's not much to do in the dome beyond walking from plant to plant, but the AC'ed environment and wonderful scale/quality of flora is a real treat for anyone interested in nature. I wouldn't say I was absolutely amazed by any one thing about the dome (expect maybe the Baobab collection), but I did walk away happy for having visited and seen this impressive collection and its containing architecture."
,,Must Go,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is certainly mesmerising! It is a cool idea to stay indoors (Singapore being so hot these days) and visit both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest! Go in the evening as you can stay till 9pm. What's more the lights come on and it is a different feel. However, there were some flowers that were 'sleeping' by 5-6pm. It was amazing to see the Ghost Tree and Baobao trees and the cactus family. So much to see! You don't even have to travel all over the world to see the unusual fauna and trees! One stop right here at the Flower Dome! It was a pleasant walkthrough and wheelchair/stroller friendly. Lots of photos to take! Bring selfie stick! One of the most affordable sights to see in Singapore!"
,,Beautifull,4.0,,"I have liked this place a lot, but unfortunately my 5 year old was hungry so we kind of rushed through it. I would visit again next time."
,,"Amazing , Hanging Gardens Of Singapore",4.0,,"Well worth the cost of admission , it about 4 stories up , lots of levels and plants from everywhere. Wind yuor way down from the top , cross little walkway and water falls, very humid as you expect , but some cooling sprays for the plants and patrons"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The flowers and plants that are presented here are from all over the world. There is a wonderful cactus section, the bigger cactuses are superb. You can also walk up above the garden on a platform, as long as your not scared of heights!"
,,well design setting flowers,4.0,,"like other designed flower show, but there're some good idea to represent the flower and plants from around the world in compact space. special theme from african scene look not bad."
,,Flower Dome itself: perfect: But POLLEN Coffee shop: strange experience,5.0,,"The flower dome itself is worth while to visit: the building itself is a genious construction,the Arrangement of plants and trees is made with a lot of character.
Low light: there is a coffee shop called POLLEN. At entrance you get a voucher to get a coffee and a Muffin for reduced Price between 9 am and 3 pm. But already at 12: no Muffins anymore available. And: there is an electrcal plug socket laying on the ground with plug inserted with broken case. Metallic oarts are accessible. If children start to play with it..."
,,good,4.0,,it was comparatively small. not much time taken as we are not aware much about plants and flowers. it took less than 2 hours for us to go through.
,,Calming and beautiful,5.0,,"An incredible display of flowers and trees in a stunning bio-dome.

There are so many categories of flowers and trees in this dome, along with lanterns, artworks and artefacts.

Ensure you allow time to casually stroll around all the different levels and areas of the Flower Dome you wont be disappointed.

Even if you are not gardening fanatics you will love this place.

There are guides who can assist you with any queries you may have in regards to any of the flowers etc"
,,Function,5.0,,"Attended a function held within the Flower Dome. It was indeed excellent, the only down side is the air conditioning was way too cold!"
,,Wonderdulful and relaxing,5.0,,"Travelling with family including two grandchildren,one, nearly 11 months old and the other approching 4 years of age was always going to be a challenge.However all was put aside after having emabarked from the taxi ( which may I add is the easiest and most convient way of transport for a family with kids). An adult ticket costs $28 which includes entry into the Cloud Forest as well. Kids over 3 is $15. Inside the dome the whole place is a controlled temperature of about 20 to 23 desgrees which is comfortable enough.
Coming from Australia it reinforces how lucky we are to have alot of these overseas plants,trees etc which are on display here also are grown in Oz.
The whole place is beautifully manicured and clean,creating a wonderful relaxing atmosphere whilst out side of the dome,one can still see in the background the outlines of the Singapore skyline"
,,Very nice attraction,5.0,,"This is a very nice attraction. Isolated from outside atmosphere. There is a cafe or restaurant in the place. Unfortunately, it was reserved when I visit. Plants and trees from every where."
,,Amazing array of flowers on display.,4.0,,Fantastic selection of flowers from so many different regions of the world. Well labelled and each display was perfection.
,,Where else will you find a centur-old olive tree in Asia?,5.0,,A welcome respite from the biting cold in the cloud forest. It is impressive how Singapore can literally create a different climate on a tropical island. Check out the cactuses (stone plants?) and the regular feature in the centre of the dome!
,,Gardens!,4.0,,"My mom would have loved it here. My mom loved flowers and this place is a good showcase of flowers. Though the theme when we were there, they said, was not too ""flowery"", it was a good view for us (since it's our first time there)."
,,How stunning this is,5.0,,"Well I did it and was worth it and every dollar
This is based on the new reclaimed land from Marina square and ten years later comes Marina land
I had the best day ever and very affordable and in air conditioning
So what are you waiting for"
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"this Flower dome is part of Gardens by the bay, also called Supertree Grove its all within walking distance and a must to visit when your in Singapore"
,,Visit in daylight only!,3.0,,"We had entered the park at around 5:30 pm and by the time we finished the cloud forest and entered the Flower Dome it was already dark and they had turned on artificial lighting. Now seeing flowers in non-natural lighting is no fun and doesn't please your eyes that much.
Another thing that put us off was that foreigners have to buy a combined ticket for the cloud forest and flower dome. You can't just buy ticket for one of these individually. So kind of felt that the money we paid for the flower dome was totally wasted."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"A must see for everyone! The display shows a vast array of various plants from all over the world, and awesome statues made out of driftwood. Worth seeing along with the Cloud Forest next door."
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"When we went into the flower dome, I was surprised to see how much greenery it had. Ranging from an Australian garden, to an African garden to a Meditterean garden, it was beautiful. You pay to go in, but you can get a ticket to see this dome as well as the Cloud Forest dome. You could walk above a few of the gardens and enjoy them from a different view. Recommend to all"
,,A Nice Garden (not so secret),3.0,,"A nice garden with of course a variety of plants and flowers... nothing to mused that much.

Include this with your Cloud Forsst ticket to get a discount.

Went here around 4:30pm almost sunset. It would take you 1 1/2 to 2 hrs for both attractions."
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,"Had an enjoyable time here. Exhibits are often refreshed. I came specially for the Sakura while I believe in Oct they are featuring African Tribal plants. Relaxing, comfortable but do be prepared to walk and smell the flowers. Literally."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is impressive and well worth a visit as a complement to the Cloud Forrest Dome (which was my favorite). Great range of exhibits from all over the world, including a representation of Aussie flora."
,,Make sure you see this,5.0,,"I was in ore when i walked yhrough the door to this place, it is truly beautiful, just loved it, no ques and g8 value for money, remember to use your singapore airlines boading pass to get a discount for this and the cloud forest"
,,Always wonderful flower exhibits,3.0,,"The Flower dome is spacious and can accommodate lots of visitors. There are always interesting flower exhibits and shows going on and it is kept cool so it is comfortable to be inside when it is hot and humid outside. Only problem is when it gets busy, the line to get in gets very crazy and it snakes around for at least 30 minutes in the hot hot sun which is not great when you have elderly or children in line."
,,Great engineering and interesting exhibits,4.0,,"Quite a feat of engineering! It's a glasshouse on the equator and is cool inside.

Well laid out.

Interesting exhibits. A gardeners dream (or nightmare when you consider maintenance).

This exhibition is inside so sheltered from the rain once inside. However there is a 10 minute walk in the open through a park to get to it from MRT."
,,"Flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers .......",5.0,,"We both love flowers although the better half's thumb is much greener than mine (I hope she hasn't got gangrene ... just joking) .. so we decided to see this place.

This is the largest column-less greenhouse in the world.

We went to the Orchid Gardens yesterday and if we would have known about the boundless variety of orchids here, we wouldn't have bothered.

Not only orchids but plants from different parts of the world are grown here .. from beautiful Mexican cactus gardens to Australian outback flowers to flowers from the African savanna.

The temperature in the dome is similar to the cool dry temperatures of the Mediterranean so it's very comfortable to walk around in.

I couldn't believe the olive trees here, they are over 1000 years old and they still produce olives.

The flowers on display are always being changed as different varieties flower at different times of the year.

After you are finished with the flower dome, do yourself a favour and visit the Cloud Forest."
,,Plants from around the world,5.0,,This is a great place to relax and marvel at the engineering to build this amazing structure. Make sure you see the Orchids!
,,Another amazing place to visit. Be early,5.0,,A must see place in singapore and be early as after noon it gets busy. Take the blue line to Bayfront. 5 min walk to the gardens. Ok to buy tickets at the entrance. Credits cards ok.
,,Beautiful Snapshots of colours,5.0,,Just lovely to wonder through the different gardens. It would be amazing to visit each season when they change the arrangements.
,,Evening walk,5.0,,"Beautiful & cool inside the dome.
Great display of flowering plants , shrubs and trees. Display changes periodically based on various themes; last show was the Autumn Lantern Festival and now the African wild and cultivated flowering plants. Always worth a visit every now and then; hence it's cheaper to join as a member with unlimited access to the two domes and the skywalk."
,,Enjoy beautiful flowers and plants,4.0,,The exhibits are well curated and thoroughly enjoyable. You can visit in all types of weather because this is an indoor attraction.
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"the garden is manage well. Dreamy flower bed around. Suggest to go at least 3 hours before sunset, so you may take your time to walk around without rush and take pictures around. Air-conditioning is available and also it is protected from strong sun/wind/rain, so no worry to walk around inside whether it is morning/afternoon/sunny day/rainy day."
,,Lovely Garden Walk,5.0,,"This dome is located in the Gardens By The Bay and does cost S$28 for an adult and S$15 child to enter though this entry free does also include entry into the Cloud Forrest. The garden are set out into different countries. There is an Australian, South African and Meditterian to name a few. All though the displays are amazing wood sculptures they are amazing. Plenty of seats to sit and take it all in and you will take many photos."
,,Beautiful and serene,5.0,,"This is one of the two domes in the new Garden by the Bay, while the other one centred around a single waterfall, this dome has numerous spots in side, each with a theme from some parts of the world. It also had its own cafe.

Extremely relaxing, I could spent hours here.. Cool.. If you are not cool weather friendly, bring scarf or cardigans. Plenty of bench to sit and relax, breath the lovely flower smell. Enjoy the vivid colours all around you. It's probably very close to what Eden could has been.

They meticulously care the garden very well. If you are a photography enthusiast, bring your camera stands and lenses, there are plenty of extremely beautiful spots here."
,,Beautiful display,5.0,,This is a pricey place to visit - $28 - but it was included in our Singapore Stopover package and I'm very glad we visited. It is a visually beautiful display of flowers (which are changed at regular intervals). Please be prepared for the change in temperature in here compared to the outside environment. It was extremely cold and I was very glad to have my cardigan with me to put on.
,,Wonderful display,5.0,,We spent a whole day in the flower dome! what an experience! the domes are airconditioned so the weather doesnt matter. Child and adult friendly!
,,Awesome display,5.0,,"Awesome display of different types of plants from all over the world (from a vast cacti collection, to baobab trees!). Gorgeous center display of plants and flowers in a safari theme."
,,Delightful Visit,4.0,,"My teenage daughter and I walked around the Flower Dome before we flew out of Singapore.

It was a very enjoyable visit. Seeing all different themed gardens, and just perfectly manicured as you expect to see in the beautiful Singapore.

We had tickets to this off the Singapore Pass we had purchased. We missed seeing it the night before, so we went back the next morning. Glad we did."
,,Pretty and cold :),4.0,,"They change their flower displays every 6 months I think. When we went, they were featuring African plants and shrubs so it was mostly cacti and succulents. I would've loved to come here during tulips or rose seasons though! Oh, and bring a jacket because it's cold :)"
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"Plants from all iver the world. Extensive array of different orchids and some really, really old trees. I have no idea how they managed to successfully transplanted them"
,,Must See!,5.0,,"We spent many hours in there, too much to see and very special. Must check this out even if you do not have a lot of time in Singapore!"
,,The flora was so serene,5.0,,"This was an amazing experience. I really did not know what to expect, but this met and exceeded any possible expectations. This is part of gardens by the bay and unfortunately there is a 28 Singapore dollar charge to get into this and the cloud forrest (1 ticket for both attractions). It costs, fine, but it is worth it. We wandered through for several hours looking at the different plants and flowers. They also had art made from trees/wood, the dragon perched up high was rather spectacular. Unlike the cloud forrest, there are no heights to worry about, your feet are firmly on the ground the entire time."
,,Beautiful scenery in an environment at 25'c all day - visit during daylight,5.0,,"With so many different flowers, this is not just a visit to a 'big flower shop', the walkways take you through exhibits of beautiful flowers growing naturally in this temperature controlled climate.

We visited in the evening when it was twilight outside, timing it before the light show in the Supertree grove, but I would strong recommend that you do this during the daylight as it's difficult to see the magnificence of the flowers in the dark. A re-entry stamp at the end gives you unlimited entry all through the day, so take advantage of that.

To get here, you can catch a SG$3 shuttle bus from Bayside MRT, it can be ridden all day also.

It is linked underground to the Cloud garden dome so that you don't have to go outside again!"
,,Poor,1.0,,"Poor sighting, short tour, no guidelines, overpriced. Not interesting. Please go to a nature reserve and enjoy real nature."
,,Beautiful but not suitable for elderly,4.0,,It is beautifully maintain with all fresh flowers and plants. Yet for those elderly who unable to walk such a long distance will need more support.
,,Flower dome is worth a visit,4.0,,"Lovely flowers and trees from around the world - arranged by country or continent. Next to Cloud dome. Good information about al the plants and many that I had never seen before. Café, shops, toilets available. Inside the Gardens on the Bay."
,,Took our breath away,5.0,,"Gorgeous place paired with the cloud forest dome as well. Well well worth the visit, please don't miss this!"
,,"Nice, but not the best",3.0,,"I personally preferred the Cloud Forest dome, but this place is nice, with a very impressive succulent garden and typical wild west cacti. If you have time to visit, you might as well, I'm sure kids will like this one, but its more sedate than the cloud forest with its loud waterfall and sky walkways"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This area is part of the 'Gardens by the Bay'. It is well worth a walk around to see all the different plants from different countries. Enjoyed immensely
,,Fantastic Collection,5.0,,Enjoy the plants from various countries. Climate controlled due to plants are from different location. You would definitely enjoy if you are a nature lover
,,""" Fantastic""",4.0,,"A place that must be visited, the flowers are just so beautiful and it also has the most beautiful arrangements, statues, buildings carvings we have never seen anything like it, it's a must see."
,,Like flowers? You are going to love this!,5.0,,"This dome is all about flowers. All colors, shapes, sizes and smells. all parts of the world is represented. One thing to remember: If you have problems with strong smells, you should think twice before going in. Otherwise: Open for senses and enjoy!!!"
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"The flowers, trees and shurbs in this dome are absolutely beautiful. Lots of wonderful carvings too - a lovely place to walk around and learn about different plantlife in various countries."
,,A MUST DO experience,5.0,,See my review under Marina Bay gardens - this is a MUST DO experience and is in my view the most impressive garden experience I have ever had
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"All the plants all in one place! Each month, there is a special feature display. Nice and cooling, a great escape from the heat outside. The flowers and plants- amazing especially with the smart landscape designs. Went 4 times!"
,,Visit Before the Cloud Forest,3.0,,I bought a combo-ticket and visited the Cloud Forest first. The flower dome simply does not have the drama or dynamics of the forest. On my next visit I will see the Cloud Forest but give the Flower Dome a pass.
,,A Must See,5.0,,"A beautiful undercover tropical rainforest, lots of different levels and walkways, well provided lifts and escalators."
,,tour of gardens around the world,5.0,,We had fun and informative stroll inside the flower dome. There are many beautiful plants which we do not normally see outside. :)
,,Calm (and cool) oasis in an otherwise bustling city,3.0,,"Architecturally very cool. Great views across Singapore and good selection of plants and flowers from across different climate zones. Particularly enjoyed the different types of orchids - which is a Singapore specialty.

More interesting than I thought it was going to be and a calm (and cool) oasis in an otherwise bustling city. Worth visiting, but not sure I need to go a second time"
,,Welcome to the Flower Dome,5.0,,Nicely structured garden displays covering plants from most parts of the world. Many colorful flower displays and there were some very interesting wood carvings positioned around the dome. Parts of the dome have upper decks and plenty of spots to take a few good photos.
,,romantic,5.0,,"every season they provide different type of flower if you like flower this i a must go place the place cold, so prepare some cardigan if you usually leaving in tropical country"
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,Loved spending time at the flower dome. Air conditioned and great way to spend some time out of the Singapore heat. Enjoyed the experience.
,,Currently Featuring Different Plants from Different Continents,4.0,,"This is one of the paid conservatory which is located within the Garden by the Bay. It is beside another conservatory called the Cloud Forest.

The dome covering the conservatory is kept cool with very cold running water that is hidden underneath.

Visitors are given ample time to walk within the dome to appreciate the different plants from different continents.

Worth a visit at least once while in Singapore."
,,Not just for plant nuts,4.0,,"We purchased tickets from the Chinatown Visitors Centre for S$25 per adult which gave entry to both domes (Cloud Forest which is next door).
They change the themes of this garden regularly. We were at the end of the orchid extravaganza and the beginning of tribal tempo, so got to see a bit of both. Amazing artworks spread among the displays. So many plants, so lush and green and vibrant colours. Lovely and cool, a great way to spend an hour. Lots of photo opportunities."
,,The dragon and the tulips,3.0,,"The place basic, it's clean, cool (since it's air-conditioned), but basic. Waste of money if you ask me. The wooden dragon sculpture is nice though and the tulips are beautiful."
,,Great,5.0,,"No need a lot of words - it is something different and unique, i really liked it. We was couple and friends and some with children and everybody liked it"
,,Would recommend the cloud forest,4.0,,Cloud forest was excellent. Fantastic views from on top of the tree. May get a little wet so just a heads up. Was a little disappointed with the flower done which was nice but not spectacular.
,,Amazing variety of plants,5.0,,"Get the MRT to Bayfront station, walk across the little bridge and get the shuttle to the ticket office. A ticket for the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome is $28. Plants from all over the world are beautifully displayed in this temperature controlled domed building. A great way to spend a hot afternoon."
,,Exquisite,5.0,,Lovely place. Lots of different flower species in each corner and if your lucky one of the locals will give you a quick reading as you walk.
,,Stunning.,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to visit during the Orchid display which was stunning. Wandering through the gardens from the different continents and climates was very interesting. Worth the visit even if plants are not your thing, it only takes about 30mins."
,,Singapore Odyssey.,5.0,,Another part of the gardens.These are special especially if you are interested in plants.Dozens of meters of lush vertical gardens plus all sorts of displays at lower levels.Allow 45mins to 1 hour here.
,,"This is OK, not amazing",3.0,,"If you've been to Kew Gardens or Wisley, then this is along the same lines as those. Lots of foreign flowers which are all very nice but not an absolute wow"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I was overwhelmed when I stepped into the flower dome,I could not believe the enormity of it.loved the unusual interesting plants & trees. Boab trees from different parts of the world,old olive trees with gnarly trunk and wonderful sculptures."
,,Magnificent!,5.0,,Beautifully presented plants from around the globe!!! Awesome displays ranging from succulents and giant cacti through to 1000 year old olive trees. If you never travel anywhere else but view this immense collection you will have experience plantings from all corners of the world
,,Sunday Dome day! Yay!!,5.0,,"Flower dome showcased lots and lots of variation of flowers,trees,cacti and loads more!! It is advisable to bring a scarf as it is very cold inside. Each type of plant was properly labeled and seats and water fountains were very accessible if you get tired and need a quick rest for your feet. Place was nice and structured well."
,,If you are choosing between this and the Cloud forest,4.0,,"the Cloud forest is better. More to see and do. Also, do check the website as both undergo maintenance you might find one or the other is closed."
,,An amazing giant glass house,5.0,,A truly amazing display of flowering plants and trees from around the world. No wonder it rates as one of the top tourist attractions in Singapore
,,A must see and do.,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is inside the Gardens by the Bay and an outstanding display of flowers and plants, it is inside the largest glasshouse i have ever seen and well laid out.it cost to get in but you can buy a cover all ticket, so that you can get in here and the other domed garden.
A must see."
,,Visit it before the Cloud Dome,5.0,,"As per the Cloud Dome this place is cool and if you feel the cold then take a jersey. The place displays gardens of many different places around the world which range from cacti through to Boab trees and a lot in between. Easy to get around, look out for the stone plants, pleasant way to spend a wet day in Singapore. Food onsite"
,,"Superb,well planned,must see.",5.0,,"1----- Indoor garden, 2-----well planned & well maintained dome. 3----- Capture more images, 4----- different shapes/ size/colour/ & countries Varieties of plants & flowers displayed Nicely. 5-----That is maintained in air-condition,"
,,Nice selection of botanicals,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is great as a visitor attraction, with well-planned paths and signposted routes to organise large numbers of visitors through a confined space. There is an impressive collection of succulents upon entry, and there are samples of plants from around the world throughout the dome (including some dwarf baobabs). There is clearly botanical input, but this is not Kew Gardens or Kirstenbosch by any means (and I don't think it aims to be).

The centrepiece to the Flower Dome is their seasonal themed displays. I visited during their Tribal Tempo display, which is African-themed and had lots of King proteas in beautiful bouquets which reminded me a lot of my Cape Town home. There was also carpets of begonias and gerberas, with wire renditions of the Big Five (including a fake lion on a manmade klip, which clearly harked to the Lion King version of Africa). It was a beautiful display, but about as authentic to Africa as the Night Safari is to a drive in Kruger Park."
,,Spectacular Garden for Plants lovers,4.0,,"It has just awarded as the world largest glass greenhouse by Guinness World Record recently. The guide available whom can share and explain all the plants in the place very well and friendly people. A place that worth to go although you gonna visit it once, because at the lower ground garden, there will organize the flowers and plants accordingly to a theme in different season. but gentle reminder must bring a jacket with you because the air cond over there is kinda cold to ensure freshness for the plants and flowers."
,,day trip,5.0,,The best in the world. A must for all tourists and singaporeans who love plants and flowers. Kids will learn alot from viewing the real plants that are from text books.
,,Well planned and attractive,3.0,,"Not nearly as impressive as the cloud forest but if you buy a combo ticket then worth having a look. If buying tickets separately then maybe give this one a miss, it's not that special"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Although I'd recommend the Cloud Dome slightly more highly to anyone short on time or funds, the Flower Dome is also incredibly beautiful and well worth the visit and entry fee.
Go during the day for the best lighting.
One of the most impressive floral displays I've seen."
,,So well done even if you aren't a plant person,5.0,,"Worth the look and buy the double pass to include the cloud dome. Eye opening exhibition on global warming, must see."
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,Great that it was airconditioned so we could really appreciate the amazing flowers in comfort. Worth every cent.
,,Worth a visit.,4.0,,"An indoor garden with a wide variety of trees and flowering plants from across the globe. It has an indian garden, Mediterranean garden, african garden etc. It is an excellent site, but as it is situated right next to Cloud Forest, comparison is inevitable, which of course is better. Still worth a dekho."
,,Beautifully made and awesome to behold.,5.0,,"It is part of the Garden by the Bay in Singapore. The variety of flowers, cactus, and trees overwhelm you. Very colourful and enjoyable. You may take a lot of selfies and photos for relishing it later."
,,Mesmerizing,4.0,,I went there in August 16 and really had a wonderful time .They have gathered quite a large amount of flowers from all over the world. the art work is really amazing which is done on trees. Well worth a tour if you are a true nature lover.
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"We were expecting to see a display of Singaporean flowers but apparently it was not the right time of the year which was disappointing. Not an orchid in sight.
The displays from various other parts of the world were interesting and extremely well presented. They were also in the process of changing some displays so it was a bit disorganised.
There were several errors in the Australian garden with the photos having the wrong descriptions and/or not being in the correct part of the country.
There's a discount for buying tickets to the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest together and a further discount if you have a boarding pass or etickets from certain airlines ... in our case it was Scoot."
,,A riot of colour,5.0,,"Singapore is famous for its botanics, quite rightly, but the flower dome at Gardens by the Bay is also a must see. With displays of flowers and shrubs from across the world this is a very beautiful and satisfying place in which to linger and relax. Don't miss it."
,,Worth the money!,5.0,,"A chance to see trees and flowers from all over the world - we went to the Flower Dome instead of the Orchid Garden at the Botanical Garden and we got to see orchids, and many other beautiful flowers!"
,,A cool retreat fabulous,5.0,,"A wonderful cool retreat for my granddaughter on a hot day. Wonderful plants laid out by regions of the world. Colourful, wonderful design, beautiful sculptures. A great time with a pushchair, ramps and lifts. An amazing place."
,,Incredible range of plants,5.0,,"As part of the 2 dome experience I would say that this is the better of the two (but not by much, they are both great)."
,,beautiful gardens,5.0,,gardens are amazing and themed very well. It was such a hot day out side it was refreshing to in the dome about 20 deg.
,,Don't miss it if you love flowers,5.0,,This dome is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex. Couple this visit with the Cloud Dome as they are both very good. The vast array of flowers from all over the world is mind blowing. I didn't realise there were so many flower species and couldn't stop taking photos of them. A visit is very worthwhile and make sure you take your time to absorb all that is on offer. If you time is correctly you will be able to stay and watch the light show in the evening which is amazing and very pretty.
,,Good not essential,4.0,,"We visited the flower dome on a joint ticket with the cloud forest. I don,t think the flower dome is worth a trip on its own as I found it a bit boring. It is beautifully presented with displays from all over the world, just not my thing. I know some people really enjoy it and there are a lot of good photo opportunities. Worth a visit if you are nearby"
,,Simply heaven,5.0,,"A must visit attraction in Garden by the Bay. You can spend a whole day admiring each and every flowers from across the world. Moreover it's air conditioned, so you can appreciate the heavenly beauty without any hassle."
,,fresh air and cool,5.0,,"A break from the heat of Singapore! A huge, air conditioned garden inside a dome with separated areas from sub-saharan zone to mediterranean and cooler zones. Exhibits change every 2-3 months in the main zone, one level down. Not sure how they manage it, but there were no insects or ants in sight. Very well maintained and clean. You can smell the freshness in the air!"
,,Romantic Aromatherapy Journey,4.0,,"Flora lovers and the Romantics will enjoy the beautiful colours, and endless selfies, whilst igniting your smelling senses.
There's is a cute but lush restaurant 'Pollen' inside, to enjoy Modern European Cuisines.
A cool and memorable place to pop the question to your loved one *hint *hint"
,,Very good! worth the visit!,5.0,,"This place is close to Cloud Forest Dome, you can do both in 2-3 hours, very beautiful and well maintained gardens with flowers and plants from all across the planet!"
,,"Beautiful, colorful flowers!",5.0,,"I recommend buying the combo tickets as you get to go to the Cloud Forest Dome as well. It is very beautiful, with a wide variety of flowers to enjoy. They have two levels, and I think the first level has many beautiful, colorful flowers! I think it's definitely worth a visit at least once and it's great for friends and families."
,,beautiful Place!,4.0,,"This was a beautiful, cool place to spend a hot afternoon in Singapore! I particularly enjoyed the skywalk through the rainforest dome, though the tulips and sculptures were also lovely :)"
,,Day out,4.0,,Wonderful gardens lovely and clean winnie the pooh figures a little worn but hey the gardeners were working hard and the heat is unbearable well done the flowers look beautiful
,,Scientific,5.0,,We walked through millions of plants and flowers around the world. With all sorts sculptures. It's all air conditioned in this massive large dome.
,,Excellent refresh!,5.0,,Very very good place! Great infusion of oxygen into everyone who are enjoying nature! Great experience!
,,Nice,5.0,,This is definitely a nice place to visit. Good to go back a 2nd time if one likes flowers and likes walking.
,,-pandmobeirne,5.0,,Wonderful experience when visiting Gardens by the Bay. Enjoyed the variety and the cloud dome is amazing
,,World's Largest Glass Greenhouse,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is one of two huge glass biodomes in Singapore's Gardens by the Bay.

According to the 2015 Guiness Book of Records it is the largest glass greenhouse in the world.

It features flowering gardens with plants from around the world, including wattles, Banksias, kangaroo paws and grass trees from my own Australia.

The entire dome is maintained at a constant temperature and humidity to suit the various floral displays.

A double ticket, allowing admission to the other biodomes - Cloud Dome - is S$33 for foreigners."
,,I wish,3.0,,"I wish it was not crowded so I get to enjoy my space. And the illusion of my own garden at some highlands. I suggest to visit early to avoid the crowd. I was there around 5pm, it was scenic outside but there's the flow of guests."
,,Colorful and Interesting,5.0,,The Flower Dome was a bit crowded when I visited (Saturday afternoon) but there was enough space to go around. Watch out for poster announcements of the free tours. I was able to join one which was a tour of the special orchid exhibit.
,,'Cool' way to see exotic plants....,4.0,,"Not sure how they get tropical plants to thrive in air conditioned coolness, but all credit to them. Really nice displays if you're into flora and fauna. Clean, tidy, well maintained and helpful staff. Only a few dollars to get in. Enjoyable hour."
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"You can get a ticket for 28 SIN$ that will include the flower dome and the cloud forest (discount for children).

More than just flowers, I've been impressed by the variety of plants from all around the world and beautiful decorations that had been made to create thematic areas. From cactus to baobabs, hundreds of different species can be observed.

Covered by a glass dome, the temperature is regulated and is perfect for a rainy or hot day."
,,"Real ""cool"" place",5.0,,"We were surprised at the scale of this place, and as an added bonus its air conditioned - amazing amount of different plants and trees well worth a visit"
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,"Gosh, it's really a dome with very beautiful garden inside. Stunning! I was so impressed by their collections. Suddenly I felt so relax came in to this place. All i can see was beautiful, beautiful and beautiful. So in love with this place."
,,Spectacular indoor garden,5.0,,The flowers are simply gorgeous at the Flower Dome. And the best part of it all is that it's nice and cool inside so it's a nice escape from the hot and humid weather outside. You don't need to love gardens to love this one!
,,Around the world with plants,5.0,,Different plants and flowers from around the world make this a stunning place to visit. Make sure you have plenty of room in your camera.
,,Rainy Sunday morning,5.0,,"Great place to visit, even out 10 year old was impressed. Take the escalator to the roof of the Marina Bay mall and enjoy the walk to the domes."
,,Relish in the beauty!,5.0,,"Oh my gosh, what a beautiful indoor garden. Plants and flowers from around the world are well displayed and identified. The colors of nature and the wood scupultures are just outstanding. Soothing classical music plays in the background. As a break from the hot, steamy city, this was a piece of heaven."
,,"Omg, again!",5.0,,"Another entrance fee but another 100% brilliant adventure! The smaller of the 2 conservatories but crammed with flowers and exhibits from around the world. Give yourself a good hour at least to view. Like the cloud forest, there's a very good shop in it."
,,Simply Stunning.,5.0,,They say the simple things in life are the best and you can't go past the Flower Dome. From the beautiful flowers and trees to the random artwork it was awesome. A must see.
,,A must for any gardener,4.0,,"This man made dome is spectacular more so when themed eg. christmas or orchid festival times, if you are an avid flower lover you can be lost is the wonderland for hours, its perfect on a rainy day, if it rains look up and watch the water fall from the glass dome."
,,Lilytopia (June 2016),5.0,,"On 18 Jun2016, visited the Flower Dome @ Garden by The Bay. An aircon nursery which showcase many flowers theme and different landscaping. It happened to be the Lily theme and was named ""Lilytopia"". Was really an eye opening experience to see the many different species of lilies set in various landscaping within the indoor nursery. It was a Saturday and the garden was packed with visitors. There were long queue at the ticket booth too.

The entire touring took about 90 minutes. Can smell the fragrance of the flowers. Sweet and refreshing and worth the visit.

There's always something new every one to two months it's never bored coming here. This month happened to be national day (9 Aug) it's the national flower theme - Orchids"
,,Orchid Show Last Day,5.0,,Was in the dome on the last day of a spectacular orchid show. Amazing diversity of orchids. Well organized layout with good facilities. Well worth the effort and price.
,,Orchid Show was spectacular,5.0,,"nice visit. the orchid show was fantastic. however, was a little annoyed that you have to pay to go to the flower dome AND pay a separate fee to go into the cloud forrest. Like can it not be the same ticket? Made the place inconvenient to access."
,,It's an indoor garden,2.0,,Whilst nice and well laid out and its air conditioned it is just a botanical garden. For free you can visit the Outdoor botanical gardens in the heart of Singapore. These are great and the orchids magnificent.
,,Flowers flowers,4.0,,"Flowers paradise, a lot of plants, flowers and trees under one roof. They are classified in different themes according to the regions they originate from. Flower lovers would die there."
,,Lovely,5.0,,We were there during the Orchid Festival and it was amazing! Keep an eye out for the sculptues they are everywhere and are simply stunning!
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"The Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay was amazing. Everywhere you look, there are more little surprises you notice. It's not just about all the beautiful flowers and plants....there are great little sculpture pieces hidden everywhere! A must visit."

,,Flower dome at night,5.0,,We went into the flower dome at night and it was magical. It was loke being inside a huge secret garden with subtle lighting that helped to led you into magnificent displays. Considering how busy Singapore is the flower dome is immaculate.
,,Truly amazing,4.0,,"It is impressive how they have done this with flowers from all over the world, with beautiful themed gardens, if you have a few hours to spare visit and you will be amazed."
,,Stunning - Christmas 2015,3.0,,"The Christmas themed displays were brilliant, trees, snowmen, candy canes and poinsettias everywhere. So pretty."
,,Best Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Gardens by the bay is award winning garden in Singapore. There are two domes here. One is flower dome and other one is cloud forest.
If you are naturr, flower, beauty lover you must visit this attraction.
Flower dome has almost all kind of flower species around globe either Australian, South American or Indian, South African etc. You will see every major type of flower found i that region."
,,A great half day activity,5.0,,This was amazing. We were there for Singapores 51st anniversary and they had an orchid display which was excellent.
,,Divine!,5.0,,It's a paradise on its own. Beautiful flowers kept in an artistic fashion. I went there in Chrysthanthemums festival and was amazed with the collection. Must visit!
,,A lot of trees!,4.0,,"This dome was impressive - what a collection of trees from around the world! We also were there during the orchard fest.. Impressive!! We rushed through a bit, I'd be sure to give yourself some time here! We were there at dusk and it was kinda magical with the lighting."
,,OMG it can't get any better,5.0,,"And this is from someone that's not interested in gardens. Absolutely wonderful, a must, if there is only enough time for one thing in Singapore, DO THIS."

,,Fantastic display,5.0,,"This is in the Gardens by the Bay area. There is a charge to enter here but not the Gardens by the Bay Area.
The displays are wonderful with lots of sculptures all around. The flowers are from all over the world and divided into the countries areas. It took over an hour to just wonder around in here looking at everything."
,,a definite yes to visit,5.0,,most beautiful exhibition of plants from all over the world in an air-airconditined enviroment where you can spend a lot of time admiring the works of art that nature and man can produce. do not miss it if you are in Singapore
,,Really Good Attraction,5.0,,This must be one of Singapore's most visited attractions and it shows the floral world in one place. It is well organised and staff are willing to talk.
,,Excellent display,4.0,,This relatively new facility presents a semi permanent display of a large variety of plants and trees from different areas of the world interspersed with shorter term seasonal displays. The Dutch bulb fiesta earlier this year - February - May - was spectacular. It is not the cheapest of tourist attractions - cheaper for residents - but well worth the combined ticket to view both this dome and the adjacent Cloud Dome. There is a very good water play area within the complex suitable for young children - free.
,,Great destination for nature lovers,5.0,,"This is a lively garden with different varieties of plants, flowers, and trees--one big paradise composed of lovely arrangements that create a burst of colors.

Inside the dome are several mini arrangements-orchids, roses, and various other types of flowers-that provide the perfect nature experience. You can just sit amidst the flowers for a few minutes (or hours--I saw someone just sitting in one shaded spot, reading a book) or walk around to explore the place."
,,Surprisingly impressive,5.0,,We did this dome after the cloud dome and we went to the right. Initially we were disappointed but once we went left our whole impression changed. The colours and the variety were the equal of the cloud dome just differently presented. Will do this dome again.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,It was a great experience to spent time in flower dome. Took adequate photos. However the price is little higher side.
,,do not miss this,5.0,,If you are a flower lover do not miss this. the Orchids are fantastic and so are the other flowers. They are presented in such a fun and artistic way. you will need at least 1 1/2 hrs to really enjoy the beauty of the Flower Dome. Tickets are $28 for both the Cloud and Flower Domes. they are a must see and so are the rest of Gardens by the Bay.
,,"Great Collection of Plants, Including Irises",5.0,,Must see. Really well done. Iris after iris and more. All special. Have not taken so many pics in a long time.
,,Orchid Extravaganza,5.0,,"Located at the Gardens by the Bay, my children i were amazed by the stunning display of orchids of different colors and variety. My first time to see a huge variety of orchids set amidst an enchanting forest, it was really magical. The orchid extravaganza runs from July 22 to August 28, 2016 at the Flower Dome, Gardens by the Bay. A must see, undeniably beautiful."
,,Best flower garden I have seen,5.0,,"Do not miss this if you are in Singapore.

Best time to visit - During daylight. The real beauty of flowers were visible during daylight. In the evening, I felt the flowers went dull and the lighting was not really highlighting the beauty of the flowers."
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit for children, adults or senior citizens. Be impressed by the types of plants availablr there. Imagine walking in the park during autumn or spring (minus the falling leaves or empty branches). Recommended to go and enjoy the nature in air cond environment"
,,An unique experience worth coming for....,4.0,,"This place & Cloud Forest are a must see when visiting Gardens By the Bay.

Both are man made but very unique, very different from the usual attractions ,pretty awesome & very interesting. Its an experience definitely worth paying for & worth experiencing.

Best of all, its all in a cool environment. Don't miss this.
Easiest way to come here is to take the MRT to Bayfront Station."
,,To an orchid fan a super place,5.0,,"We vited the Orchid expo, naturally enjoyed it a lot. Also the kitchen garden was nice to see, specially to my singapore friends who did not before know how starberry plants look like! Roses, Fuchsias, hippeastums and many many more flowers to enjoy!"
,,Make sure to have a good well charged camera,5.0,,"Memorable visit and value for money. There won't be many places like this. Beautiful and well maintained plants. The tulip gardens must easily be the best ever. Might be a bit difficult to get there on foot. It's possible but it's a long long walk from the MRT stations. Been there during the day and would consider going back on a next visit.
It is slightly cooler inside since I believe it is a controlled environment. Might be a bit pricey but if you want to visit high level stuff, it tends to come at a price."
,,Oh my god. I had gone bonkers,5.0,,Spectacularly done with variety of flowers from world over and kept in an air conditioned man made dome with great care. Litterally l had gone bonkers looking at vivid colours and shapes and types and sizes and what not.
,,An impressive ecosystem,5.0,,"The Flower Dome has it all! Plants ranging from the desert to the forest, they're all under one roof! And don't think simple little plants and flowers. It includes large tress, like a beautiful baobab. Another Singapore masterpiece!"
,,Great plant and flower display,4.0,,"This is an interesting place to visit....it holds plants, trees and flowers from various areas around the world. We enjoyed wandering around here....however we preferred the spectacle of the Cloud Forest more. Both are definitely worth doing."
,,A flower spectacular,5.0,,"It is a must to visit this dome as the flowers from all over the world are amazing, while we were there they had a orchid extravaganza"
,,well maintained,4.0,,"Climate controlled space, neatly maintained. Paid attraction. Different plants from different continents from all over the world."
,,Flowers In Full Bloom,4.0,,Very beautiful place. lots of flowers. Place is based on different themes. Very creative and very well maintained. overwhelming views.
,,Beautiful!!!!,5.0,,"The flower dome is situated in the Gardens by the Bay.
It is a beautiful place with exotic flowers and plants from all over the world.
The environment is enclosed and controlled. The variety of flowers is astounding and like never seen before.
It is a must visit place for all the nature lovers."
,,Nice place to visit in Marina Bay area,5.0,,Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are very close to each other. I was far from to be impressed by the Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is a different story. It is landscaped with different levels. Relatively small area can accommodate a lot of plants that way. Take a camera with you and go ahead. You'll have fun and good time in there.
,,fantastic sculptures,5.0,,"We bought a joint ticket for the rain forest and flower dome and it was quite expensive but definitely worth it. A full day is needed to visit both, the plants and sculptures in the flower dome are amazing, if can get very, very busy so allow plenty of time to wander."
,,Botanic Paradise!,5.0,,I used to visit here by once in every year...last time i went on march 2016..its really awesome to see the beauty of the flowers...I felt that its one of the man made wonder in this millennium.
,,Glass house flower,4.0,,I am less impressed with this dome like I does with the Clouds Forest so next time visit the flower dome first then visit the Cloud Forest before go to the Garden by the Bay. It is all in one ticket and location and accessible by walking. Though I still impressed how the Singapore manage to build such thing in their limited land. The flower dome is best visit when they held and event like the tulip festival or during Christmas. The extra decorate the dome into some fairly land. Most of the plant is a cactus but it still can be the one to visit while in Singapore.
,,Interesting Theme for special occasions,4.0,,"Great place for pre-wedding photoshoot. In addition, theme garden setting are created and set out for chinese new year, easter day, halloween, xmas just to name some, all these will have different themes to suit the holidays."
,,Occasion Flower Exibition,4.0,,LOVE THE NATURE ...LOVE THE FLOWER... quarterly have different flower exhibition. personally join the tulip /sakura .... worth its and no need to flight over by exe flight.. but need to check trough the website for the latest flower exhibition.
,,Great beauty,5.0,,"What a fantastic place, the floral arrangements are stunning, I really appreciated the hard work and efforts of the maintenance crew to constantly keep this dome to an exceptionally high standard. I’m not normally into flowers but thought it would be a great place to visit and I was not wrong, the different garden displays from around the world were spectacular but there’s no doubt the centre piece was the beauty and the colours of the huge range of flowers, great place for families and it’s air-conditioned too."
,,Under the Dome!,4.0,,"Visited just the flower dome and not the cloud forest; though it's an amazing concept. A better timing would be during August during the Tulip festival. Nonetheless, a beautiful attraction for photoholics especially! Souvenir shops are tad too expensive; don't bother."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Amazing to think this is inside a huge glasshouse with massive trees and plants. Would definitely recommend a visit here.
,,Excellent part of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,To any Flower lovers this is a must see when visiting Singapore. One can easily spend several hours enjoying this cool respite from the heat and humidity of Singapore. I have never before seen so many different colour and variety of orchid. Brilliant!
,,"Spectacular, amazing & beautiful",5.0,,"Breathtaking orchards displayed in a gorgeous setting. Gardens from around the world also impressive but I couldn't go past the so many species of orchards. From the garden beds to the arches, each & every one prettier than the other. Perfect photo opportunities every few steps, clean, comfortable & tranquil. Combine entry into the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest well worth the few hours spent meandering."
,,Visit before the cloud forest otherwise you'll be disappointed,3.0,,I liked this but after visiting the cloud forest I thought it was a bit meh! It was very crowded and too many people taking photos & holding others up. I don't think I'd visit again although it was very pretty.
,,Beauty of dome,5.0,,Kudos to the ppl managing it. So many variants of flowers from different countries all under one roof must must see
,,Beautiful flowers!!,5.0,,"So beautiful!!! Only once in a year. So lucky to visit Singapore on the moment of Flower Dome - Tulip Festival. As the picture attached, they're so colorful and pretty."
,,modern flower garden,5.0,,this is all you ask for a garden. various flower and trees inside. every corner is perfect for a photo spot. place is comfy and clean. so worth.
,,Not as exciting as Cloud Forest.,3.0,,"Unfortunately Flower Dome wasn't as interesting or exciting as the Cloud Forest. I would suggest visiting the Flower Dome first and the Cloud Forest so that you are not left underwhelmed.

Pros:
The succulent garden was my favourite part

Cons:
Did not feel as spacious as the Cloud Forest"
,,Loophole through Pollen,4.0,,"Not really a loophole, but if you make a reservation to dine at the upper floor of Pollen, the upscale restaurant within the Dome, you are allowed to walk out through its entrance and straight into the flower dome (without waterfall). If you're feelin cheap you can just get a pot of tea for $9 (last i checked).

Bring a jacket along as it's really cold inside. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is the incredible amount of energy that must be expended in order to sustain this artificial ecosystem."
,,Brilliant! Well worth the entry fee.,5.0,,"See my review of The Gardens By The Bay for more details, but I loved this place. Well worth the entry fee. Amazing feat of engineering, architecture, design and botany. There was a special exhibition of orchids in the Flower Dome when I was there in August 2016, which were just spectacular."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,A wonderful experience. Tons of flowers. Well decoration and clean. I will definitely be back here next time.
,,When to see cherry blossom in March 2016!!,5.0,,"It was the season of ""Sakura"" in Japan, so we went to see the cherry blossom in here which was only event helding on March.

Honestly speaking, the ""Sakura"" what we saw were so far away cheap comparing with those in Japan.

However, if you have never seen the cherry blossom, and difficult to go to Japan, you could feel the sense of beautiful flower at least.

Moreover, there are many kinds of plants here, so surely you could have fun staying in the Flower Dome to see them!!"
,,Lovely dome,4.0,,The flower dome in Marina Bay Barrage is very lovely because once you enter the dome you would definitely wouldn't want to get out of there
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay, this dome showcases many plants from different climate and regions in the world. The centrepiece of the dome changes according to the flowers in bloom. Beautiful oasis in a garden city."
,,Photographers dream,5.0,,"Wow, this place is spectacular. We spent about 90 minutes there because we were in a rush to finish before sunset. I recommend starting earlier and spending 3 hours. It has amazing plant life. It's Air conditioned which is lovely on a hot day.
We spent S$71 for 2 adults and a 9 year old kid to visit 2 conservatories, this and the cloud forest (also highly recommended). Also spent S$9 to catch the shuttle bus from the main gate and S$32 on lunch at McDonald's.
Our plan was the 2 conservatories, then gardens by the bay lightshow at sunset for about half an hour, then walk over to marina bay sands for the 9:30 lightshow. It worked perfectly and I recommend this itinerary. Allow at least 90 minutes per clouds/flowers conservatory, preferably more.
Tips:
1. If it's hot invest in the bus trip from the front gate, $3 per person. If not it's a long walk and you'll melt.
2. There's a great McDonald's restaurant right near the cloud forest, highly recommended and clean.
3. great on a hot day as its really cool inside (same as cloud forest)
4. Do the 2 conservatory trip as the cloud forest is great also
5. Go to the gardens by the bay light show after that.
6. Charge those camera batteries, you'll want to take hundreds of photos here!
ENJOY!
PS my nine year olds son kept saying its one of the best days he's ever had. Kids love this."
,,Overshadowed by the Cloud Forest next door,4.0,,"We purchased tickets for both domes and were advised by friends to complete the flower dome first.Whilst full to the brim of new and unusual flowers - all presented in the most fantastic setting - I must say the dome is overshadowed by the cloud forest. That said, whilst it is possible to buy a ticket for just one dome (not advertised for foreigners but still available) - I would still recommend buying both tickets as the experience is very different in both (and the flower dome is warmer!!)."
,,Great!!!1,5.0,,If you visit the forest you must visit this as well expect to be busy for hours in fact at least five hours to do both attractions. You wont be disappointed if you love plants.
,,Orchid Time,4.0,,This was part of my visit to the Gardens by the Bay. This would be a nice side trip while visiting Singapore. It was orchid time when I visited and there were thousands of orchids along with the many other permanent floral displays. The Cloud Forest is right next to the Flower Dome and most people seem to buy a double ticket for both attractions.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Very beautiful although somewhat small dome with very picturesque flowers. Fun to visit and family friendly. Its about S$28 each ticket (for both attractions) if you're not a resident for both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest which isn't too too bad. Very well air conditioned and many spots for pictures.
,,Botanical treats and wonderful statues,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is the one of the two large domes in the Gardens by the Bay, and definitely the one with more content to it. There is a wide variety of plantlife on display, some of it set quite naturally while some is worked into whimsical displays.

Along with the plants there is also art on display, the majority of it crafted to look like it has sprung out of living wood. These especially capture the imagination, and are no doubt a treat for the younger visitors.

Like its sibling, this dome is an architectural work of art, and a treat in itself. It is worth visiting on many levels, although for its apparent size, it won't keep you for long."
,,Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Another stunning attraction in the Gardens by the Bay Botanic Garden complex, well worth a visit to this display."
,,Visit Along With Cloud Forest,3.0,,"We visited this place along with the Cloud forest. This place consists of more than 25000 plant species. It is just a flower garden exhibition. It is of a vast area.

As i am not a great lover of flowers, I skipped exploring way too much. But it is a escape from the rain or heat."
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,"Amazing to see a wide variety of plants from all over the world under one roof. Set in an air-conditioned environment, it is a great platform for families and kids to learn about flowers, plants and ecosystem. Give yourself atleast 2 hours to explore this attraction."
,,Nice to visit once only unless there is flower change,3.0,,"Basically a small dome that contains the variety of flowers...

Maintenance of the flowers are not too good as some of them withered.

It is worth it to go back if there is a change of flowers. Other wise not so worth to pay the admission fee for it."
,,Can stay here all day long :D,5.0,,gigantic cactus and lots of flower on this huge area will surely refresh your mind! people who like plant most will surely like this place
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,We went to the flower dome before the Cloud dome and I am glad we did. It was great to see flowers that we had in our garden at home scattered in parts of the gardens. A lot of work by the gardening team goes into keeping the flowers beautiful and the garden looking fresh. Orchids were featured when we were there and some of were pretty amazing to see. We enjoyed our time here and recommed you do set aside the time to visit the domes.
,,Another fabulous asset of Singapore,5.0,,"We visited here together with Cloud Forest - so different from each other. It is Orchid festival time and so many varieties, with different blooms are on display. Nice to see gardens from different countries - even Kangaroo Paws and Grass Trees from Australia! UK naturally had some beautiful ivy geraniums and roses. Very relaxing walkway through the complex. Good to see no drinks or eats permitted in this area. They are available outside. So well done initially and impeccably maintained. Congratulations Singapore."
,,Must visit if you like flowers,5.0,,"Visited in the evening. So happen it is close to National Day, where they have a Orchard Fantasy event. Overall very nice flowers inside the dome. It is air conditioned. Suggest to spare at least half an hour for this."
,,Escape from heat and rain,4.0,,"A flower lover must visit place. And if you are a tourist trying to escape from heat and rain, here is the place. You'll enter a great house of 30000 plants. I would say it is an enormous gardens exhibition."
,,Picture perfect,5.0,,"Thousands of flowers of all known colours bloomed all around, take some lovely photos, though a little crowded but dont miss."
,,Amazing and beautiful place!,5.0,,"I've been there and it's such a great, beautiful place! many flower from other countries. I liked all flower in flower dome.if you enter the flower dome and cloud forest, for me the price it's soo expensive! yeah I am Indonesian"
,,The largest glass greenhouse in the world,5.0,,"With an event of space of 1.2 hectares, the Flower Dome has been designated the largest glass greenhouse in the world. Set in a cool air-conditioned environment, it is home to many mediterranean and semi-arid subtropical regions. Changing displays to reflect the seasons make this a destination that is a perennial favourite among locals and tourists alike.

The changing displays are placed all over the event space, with the centrepiece being at the Flower Field located near the exit.

Capable of housing 1000 guests at any one time, the Flower Dome is popular among tourists especially during weekdays. And these come armed with cameras and selfie sticks. It is quite crowded during the weekends. It would take at least two hours to visit this attraction. It would not pose a problem on rainy days, except for the 5 to 10 minute walk from the Visitor Centre (where you will alight when you come by taxi)."
,,Pristine,5.0,,"I would say that my favorite part of Singapore was visiting this flower dome. Don't get me wrong, I come from a tropical country with the widest variety of species in the world for such a small country and have traveled a fair share.

This place really impressed me. It wasn't just the flora it was also their sculptures that just seamlessly merged with the landscape such as the dragon sculpture. This place takes you to a whole different world considering you are in a concrete jungle.

Worth visiting along with the Cloud Forest and Gardens By The Bay.

They're all near each other so what are you waiting for?"
,,You could do it once,3.0,,If you are a tourist who wants to escape the heat this could be a good option for an hour or so. Flora and fauna from around the globe. A Christmas display was up on our visit.
,,lovely,5.0,,if you like gardening then you need to go here. it is amazing full of plants and colours. Statues everywhere and amazing sculptures.
,,wonderful,5.0,,I have never seen such a big 'tree' before. I love the pretty flowers and plants on the supertrees. One word: wonderful.
,,Beautiful but busy,4.0,,"We visited around 5pm after a big downpour so I think everybody had the same idea to get inside, there was a big queue but it went in 10 minutes and they were very efficient at moving everyone, it was beautiful inside and the orchid collection was lovely but probably too many flowers for anyone who isn't into gardening/flowers and that sort of thing"
,,world of flowers,5.0,,i havent seen so many beautiful flowers together. could spend hours at this place. really fascinating place if you like flowers.
,,Very pretty,4.0,,"Found my feet were a bit sore by the time we saw it, but what we saw was stunning, if you like your flowers you will love it."
,,must visit for tourists,5.0,,This is an amazing botanical garden fully air conditioned and great collections of plants and flowers....it takes around an hour to complete the visit but u can stay as long as you want....
,,Flower Lovers - Must go and see !!!,4.0,,"We went during the orchard festival so the flower dome was full of different displays, was very busy, not sure what is there when the festival isn't on but this is a must see of you are a garden or flower lover, great views also across to singapore"
,,Excellent!,5.0,,this is the flatter of the two domes and the drier also. Terrific variety of cactus and so clean and tidy. Spent hours in here with my travel companions and there are plenty of places to sit and rest to enjoy the views. Travel January 2015
,,Lovely plants,4.0,,This is a lovely well organised garden with flowers from around the world. You will appreciate it if you live in a tropical urban concrete jungle. Otherwise you may it umimpressive.
,,"Beautiful, but i preferred the cloud dome",4.0,,"I came here with my 4yo daughter, and while the orchard displays were impressive, I preferred the cloud dome. So if you've only got time for one, go their."
,,Very impressive for those who like flowers,4.0,,"If you are a flower enthusiast you will love this place else you may tend to get bored. Full of people taking photos of flowers, they had an impressive collection of orchids when we went."
,,Could use some work,3.0,,The flower dome isn't as laid out as well as the rest of the gardens and the cloud forest. Could use some de clutter and a tidy
,,Beautiful air-con place with beautiful flowers,4.0,,"It is 1 of the 2 places which is required to pay in garden by bay. The other is cloud forest. However, it is worth the payment as it is air-conditioned. Further, there are a lot of different flowers to look at and it is beautiful. The path is good for strollers and wheelchair and there are also seats available for tired tourists to take a rest.
Worth the trip there!"
,,Spectacular flower display,5.0,,Excellence among excellent. World's largest man made crystal flower dome with floral display of around the world plant life. Be ready to spend at least 1 hour wandering around an A/A cooled giant dome conservatory. Price for admission is $28 for two conservatories (Flower dome and cloud forest). Don't miss it!
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,Give yourself a chance to experiment the place. It's a pleasant opportunity to see how many beautiful things the mankind is able to do.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The Orchid exhibition curated by the park was such a treat for the eyes and the colours were so striking.
,,Great visit with family!,5.0,,"This was so lovely, when we came, there was a tulip exhibition. The air conditioned dome was a welcome break from the heat and humidity outside. Lots to see and it was really well maintained. Worth a visit."
,,MUST see,5.0,,"This was our 3rd trip to Singapore, and to Gardens by the Bay, and we still feel we haven't seen it all.
Our first trip to the Flower Dome; we spent 3 hours wandering around, and it was MAGICAL.
Even my husband, who can't tell a carnation from a poppy, loved it. My kids were entranced, and my mother-in-law and I tried very hard to photograph everything in there.
As with pretty much every attraction in Singapore, the place is superbly presented. It's all so clean, and safe, and it was really cool and pleasant inside, on a VERY hot and sticky day.
We will definitely be back next time."
,,It for me,2.0,,A huge effort has been done to present so many orchids here and they are all gorgeous but after the cloud garden I found it a bit sterile.
,,"If you love the flower, here you go",5.0,,"Collection of flowers in one place. Sometimes you will see the Tulips, and Sakura as well. If you love the nature, you will need to spend more than half of the day in this dome."
,,Garden delight,4.0,,We ventured into the flower dome as part of the garden festival. Was a nice way to spend some time. Different displays and exhibitions from all over the world. Was a good way to stay cool and out of the heat. If your in the area its definitely worth a visit.
,,Must see place!,4.0,,Have been a couple of times but each time there are something different. Good place to chill and take plenty of photos as the flowers are great. Avoid special occasions as it was pretty horrendous waiting in line.
,,nice place.. Very colorful,4.0,,Lovely place .. very colorful.. Great to visit if you love flowers and great to visit even if you are not... Loved the tulips during the tulip mania festival...
,,It was ok,3.0,,"This is more a personal thing, but I found this quite ordinary. Like walking through a very well presented gardening shop. The plants of course were beautiful, the trees and settings were great to behold. But it was just a walk among a garden."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Wow these two places you must see. The flower dome and cloud dome. They are absolutely stunning. Meticulously maintained and the best displays i have seen. A true credit to Singapore and the staff of these places.
,,Orchid bonanza,5.0,,"Orchid lovers should be aware the flower dome is home to ""orchid extravaganza"" until August 28th. Being there on a weekday it was possible to learn everything about orchids and enjoy the gorgeous selection of orchid varieties throughout the air conditioned dome without the crowd. The display is really impressive, absolutely worth the $28 entry fee. This includes entry to the cloud forest as well, a bit less impressive but still entertaining."
,,Lovley place to take pictures!,5.0,,If you want to take pictures or you are a photographer Enthusiast this is the place for you!!! Very popular among tourists and singaporeans it is a wonderful place to just explore and see the cool flowers they have on display it's also very well maintained; easily accessed and very easy to walk around and the signs are very simple and very easy to follow
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"I really loved it. I had never seen so many orchids, so many different flowers in the same place. Everything is so beautiful and there are many wooden sculptures as well. Real worth going."
,,Nice view while staying cool,4.0,,"The whole selling point of the flower dome is the air cond they provide. If there is no air cond, you won't enjoy anything due to the heat. Anyway, all the flowers are very nice and beautiful. Personally, I like the cactus display towards the right side when entering the dome. It's worth it."
,,Interesting again and again,4.0,,"Thousands of flowers and with the changing decoration all over the year, definitely a place to visit more than once."
,,A green thumbs dream...,5.0,,"Absolutely fell in love with the Flower dome!! The first spectacular garden is Australia, and wow have they done us proud! Gob smacking as you walk around this place with all the orchids on display, the wood carvings, statues and all the greenery is fantastic. Definitely worth visiting."
,,Excellent is the only word,5.0,,Hey try this flower dome. Must visit in Singapore scenic photography and you will definitely love that!!!
,,Worth the Money,4.0,,"Went during the Singapore Flower Festival and they had an Orchid Festival as well. 10,000 orchids that I guess are not part of the normal attraction. Very crowded, so bring your patience along with your camera."
,,Food for the senses,5.0,,"To be honest, I am not a flower guy. However, I think no man can stay immune to true natural beauties. If I told you that when I entered this dome I was taken by its beauty and heavenly smell, when you know how beautiful Singapore's surroundings already are, I think you get the picture. When I was there, the Orchid Extravaganza was on show, so if you can, go there when there is a flower event. If you are staying longer or plan on returning, I recommend that you buy a yearly ticket."
,,A rather large greenhouse!,5.0,,This is quite a spectacular attraction and has to be seen to be fully appreciated.lots of amazing species and incredible sculptures.Yet another must see!
,,Flower dome experience,4.0,,Nothing much during night time. Flower in the night looks normal. Air are fresh in both day and night. Slightly warmer. Recommend to visit in the daytime because is beautiful view then night time .
,,Beautiful flowers but not the highlight of the gardens,3.0,,"Worth paying the money to visit the dome, unfortunately we went during the Orchid Festival so it was crazy busy in there!"
,,Weekend is too crowded,4.0,,We went on a Sunday and the crowd was really bad...but the place in itself was really beautiful...better to visit on a week day.
,,Art and flowers,4.0,,A well laid out walk through a diverse collection of flora and their habitats. the inclusion of artworks scattered throughout the gardens added interest and brought a different perspective to a lovely garden walk
,,Stunning,5.0,,"These domes are amazing, if you are thinking of not going in, then you would be wrong, it is amazing inside, like stepping into another world, it is so well done"
,,Botanical Garden in a dome,4.0,,"Nice place to visit if you are at the Gardens by the bay, and they have a combination ticket with Cloud Forrest."
,,Excellent! Pay the money!,5.0,,"Don't be tempted to miss out on these glass houses just because they cost a fair amount of money. They're the highlight of the gardens, and they're air-conditioned!"
,,Must see!,5.0,,Very exciting place for nature lovers! There are floral and plants from all over the world. The array of colorful orchids was fabulous.
,,Visual delight!,4.0,,For a nature lover like me the flower dome is a visual delight. You can spent a peaceful day at this air conditioned greenhouse having various different zones of flora. It is pretty crowded most of the times but still definitely worth a visit.
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"Ensure you take the time to visit the flower dome. Fabulous display, beautifully presented and well worth a visit."
,,Colourful visual treat,4.0,,"A visual treat and astonishing colourful collection under single roof, especially tulips and cactus. Continuous flashes, not the lightening but from the camera's will be evident all over."
,,Great weather-neutral attraction but can be quite crowded at times,3.0,,"We finally made it to the Flower Dome last weekend. Although we tried to go early on the Sunday morning to avoid the crowds, we saw many tour groups who thought the same too.

The flowers were nice and I appreciated having the mini write-ups that were easy on the eyes. The air-conditioning was great, especially since we spend a large part of the year enjoying 30+degrees heat.

I'm not sure about the crowds though so I'm going to say if you prefer to visit places that are not overcrowded, the Flower Dome is not for you.

However the air-conditioning and shelter is a plus point since you can visit the place regardless of how hot or how wet it is outside. We took a taxi in and it was sheltered all the way from the drop off point until the Flower Dome itself.

If you only have time for one attraction, the Cloud Forest would be a better use of your time."
,,Not worth money,3.0,,Boring and not really worth it. But u need to buy entrance here to get to cloud forest which is awesome.
,,Thousand Years Old Olive Tree!,5.0,,"Do you know one of the olive trees in Flower Dome is a thousand years old? Can you spot it? Try finding it during your visit!

The Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world as listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records! There are no column pillars inside because this blocks out sunlight. The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like South Africa, California and parts of Spain and Italy. There are numerous varieties of plants and flowers inside, not forgetting the cacti (cactus) that is famous from the desert.

A less known fact here. The air in the Flower Dome is actually cooled at the lower occupied zones through chilled water pipes in ground slabs, while warm air is vented out at the top through automated windows that adjust themselves accordingly."
,,Lots of flowers and trees,5.0,,"My fiancée and visited the Flower Dome straight after visiting the adjacent Cloud Forest (admission fee for both domes is 33 SGD per person for adults).

Albeit this dome is not as impressive as the Cloud Forest dome, it is still very much worth a visit.

There are lots of various flowers from all corners of the world to be seen here, cacti, trees et cetera. For most of the plants you will find a small plaque with the name of the plant and in some cases some additional information.

If you find yourself feeling a bit peckish, the Pollen restaurant can be located at the easternmost end of the dome.

When you enter the dome, you are advised to keep to the right hand side and start at the ""top"" within the dome and from there work your way down. This way you shouldn't miss any of the flowers, tree or exhibits."
,,Love It,5.0,,Came for Singapore Garden Festival and bought tickets along with Flower Dome. Air conditioned indoor and very spacious. Toilets were available. Seats were found easily. Love it.
,,ohanami in singapore,5.0,,visited the flower dome in march and was surprised to see cherry blossoms in bloom. in tropical country. unbelievable.
,,Must for NATURE EXPLORERs,5.0,,"Thats an artificial flower dome, so beautifully designed, made and most importantly managed.
A true Piece of Excellence and proof that says its never difficult to execute what you feel about to create.

Number of flowers, planter, bushes and variety of them are from rare region of planet but they made them grow and especially beautiful.
Dont think on it, just go and enjoy :)"
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is the best place to relax. You don't only see different varieties of flowers but trees and cacti as well. It is just a beautiful place, perfect to spend your afternoon in."
,,Nice way to kill a Sunday,4.0,,"It's quite nice and organized, as well as air conditioned. I wouldn't say it blew my mind away, nor would I say it's a ""must-see"" necessarily if you're only in Singapore for a few days. But, if you have a longer extended stay, it's a nice and easy way to spend a Saturday or Sunday."
,,Variety of flowers,5.0,,A wide range of trees n flowers are there... but natural beauty wise Botanic N Orchid garden r better..
,,Happy place,4.0,,"I will highly recommend any overseas guests. I love the special theme events. It's a place I go to when I want to relax and be happy. April Tulip event was great. I brought my parents to Lilytopia in June 2016. The variety of flowers, trees esp olive trees are great. Really proud of this place in Singapore."
,,A stunning experience,5.0,,This is so much more than flowers. While the flowers are phenomenal there is so much more to take in.
,,Millions of Flowers,5.0,,"Inside the Gardens by the Bay, this place has millions of flowers with plenty of themes and 100s of flower species...flower lovers will love it and others will start liking flowers..."
,,Wonderful.,5.0,,"There are so many kinds of flower here. You just go and walk, you'll see some flowers from any country. The place is really comfy and make you wanna stay there til the end of the day."
,,Orchids galore,4.0,,"A wide variety of planting including gardens of various countries e.g. Australia, South Africa. The orchids were incredible"
,,An average for me,3.0,,"It was nice to see ample collections of flowers around the globe. My sister and I was kinda bored indeed, but, quite enjoyed taking pictures with the landscapes and good we had the opportunity to see those flowers that we haven't encountered in our entire life."
,,One of a kind flower garden,4.0,,You can finish the whole area for 30 mins. You can see different plants and flowers. The garden is indoor so it's fine to go there even raining. Come here with still day light so you can appreciate the view.
,,Wow,5.0,,There are flowers from many countries around the world here and many of the displays are changed regularly. It's a great place to wonder around to escape the heat as its all air conditioned.This is a wonderful experience for everyone even if you are not an avid gardener you can't help being amazed and inspired.Not really a place to bring children.
,,For Flowers Lover,4.0,,"I am not a plant or flower person i just went there out of curiosity also because i have a visitor in town at the time. The following are my likes about this place:

My likes:
1-like the temperature within the dome so it was very comfortable and nice to stroll around

2- There were water fountains near the toilet for one to fill up one's water bottle

3-appreciate the architectural dome

Tips: we bought our tickets from Cebu Travel which comes with tickets for a Singapore River Boat tour, which we feel was better value than buying the tickets onsite.

When you arrive, you would see Garden By The Bay offers its Shuttle service for $3 which was unlimited ;to and back,personally, if you are mobile, you would not need it. If you took this ride you would find yourself missing out the opportunity to take great pictures along your way to the Dome.You might also find yourself using this service ones only even though it offers unlimited rides. We bought this service only because we had a senior citizen with us at the time."
,,Nice Flower,4.0,,"Flower dome is located in Garden by the bay. Nice cooling place and the flowers in Dome frequently change. You may surprise if you come here every years can see different kind of flowers and decoration. This is a nice place to visit especially with air-condition, (Singapore weather is very hot). Near by have food centre (Satay by the bay)"
,,Flowers from the world over,5.0,,My wife and I were thrilled by the flower garden. I was constantly taking photos. Plants and flowers from all over the world. Singapore has done it again.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I've seen many people saying this was not worth their time. But I can assure you it is really great. Maybe not as spectacular as the rain forest, but still worth a visit in my books. The gardens are constantly being changed to make way for new displays."
,,beautiful flowers that smell so good!,5.0,,"Greeted by cool air and lovely scent from the colourful orchids that are currently on display til end August, the flower dome is decorated with beautiful flowers all over. nice place to stop by and smell the flowers as life gets hectic on us!"
,,Valley of flowers,4.0,,"Flower dome is a conservatory within garden of bay south which as the name suggests is a showcase for some rare flowers and aesthetically created indoor garden. Some of the flowers are so beautiful that you will be forced to take individual pictures and jostle with the crowd. It is a unique initiatives be to grow all the exotic flowers under controlled environment and is very beautiful.
A must spend day with family and crowds on weekend can be handful so book online and enjoy. Plenty of food options for a day long activity combined with super tree grove and cloud forest"
,,Visit both!,4.0,,"We got tickets for both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest...had a wonderful time. Both very different but good and relaxing. Great for photo lovers!
I'm personally a bigger fan of the Cloud Forest between the two just because I'm not big on flowers...but the Flower Dome was interesting since they created many 'animals' or sculptures while using natural products and they are all over the place i the dome. Finding them while walking through was much fun!"
,,More Desert than flowers,4.0,,"This was enjoyable and worth our time. There are multiple walking paths that have very beautiful desert plants in unique arrangements including awesome wooden sculptures. The exhibit when we were there was Lillies it was okay, and sort of themed to classic rock? Still enjoyable, but if you only have time or money for one dome, do the cloud forest."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,We went to see the flower dome. It was ok. Beautiful. Nice to walk through. Cloud forest is better though
,,My favorite part of the entire Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Now several folks prefer the Cloud Dome and if your are not afraid of heights then ok I see your point but if you are happier with your feet on solid ground this place is an air conditioned dream! My daughter who is 8 and just starting to love picture taking happily spent 2 hours here just taking pictures. This Dome has flowers from all over the world and its all broken up into zones. The colors are vibrant and the smell is intoxicating! Even my husband was enamored with the dome and wants to visit again on our next visit. You simply must go!!!
,,Stunning,5.0,,"a beautiful experience. if you love flowers & photography, bring you macro & spend a few hours here. Great value a high light for our trip to Singapore"
,,nice collection of flowers,5.0,,those interested in flowers/ trees much visit this place. it has a collection of varieties and there are information regarding each of them. a nice place to roam around and take pictures.
,,Ok but the Cloud Dome is better,3.0,,Interesting to visit once but will not be visiting frequently as it's not as impressive as the Cloud Dome.
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,A must...part of gardens by the bay...stunning display and architecture and air conditioned...wonderful
,,A must see attraction at the Garden by the Bay,5.0,,"was here with my family last July 12, 2016. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the gigantic greenhouse housing the whole attraction was air-conditioned! was also pleased to see a wide variety of plant species including huge baobab trees from Africa which i think they re-planted whole! This is a must-see attraction for all tourists in Singapore!"
,,A relaxing way to sightsee,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is a wonderful way to spend some time strolling amidst the temperature controlled atmosphere and marvel at the plant variety from around the world. Even for someone who doesn't enjoy gardening and isn't ""into"" flowers, I really liked this and found it a peaceful and serene change to the other sightseeing activities we had undertaken. They were changing up the displays but this didn't disrupt the experience at all. The wooden statues and carvings were amazing."
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"The floral displays inside the dome are absolutely beautiful. There are also fantastic wooden sculptures placed throughout the dome. The dome is also quite cool, and a welcome relief from Singapore's heat."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,This was just a 'must-see'. So many glorious displays. The colours and variety of plants were amazing. I could have spent ages in there just swooning over the beautiful plants. The way everything has been put together is a marvel in itself.
,,A very nice dome with plants around the world - top!,5.0,,The Flower dome is absolutly recommandable. You find thousand of plants from tulip (Nederlands) to Baobab (Africa) and cactus (America) as soon as plants from Australia. Very nice! And climate in the dome is very pleasant ... 23°Celsius
,,Incredible,5.0,,I am amazed at what Singapore has produced with this tourist attraction. The foresight to create this masterpiece is top notch.
,,Tranquil and Picturesque,5.0,,"Make sure you buy tickets to both conservatoriums. This one is absolutely lovely, so many twists an turns offering more and more beautiful flowers and garden surprises."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Stunning and so worth the cost of entry. Arrive early but stay for dark! Lots to look at and easy access.
,,Simply Beautiful !,5.0,,"The place is so soothing to the eyes once you see the array of exotic and beautiful plants. The flowers arrangements are so nice you wouldn't stop taking photos to show to everyone. Simply put, the amazing beauty of nature comes to reality once you are there."
,,Fabulous Gardening,5.0,,"As soon as you arrive in Singapore, you can't help but notice the lush greenery in The Garden City. You will also have felt the heat & humidity and noticed how you tire much quicker than usual. Being in the Flower Dome gives you the opportunity to take your time to look at & admire (close-up) the nicely-labeled plants in a climate-controlled environment. It is a photographer's paradise! Video-ing is a little difficult with people in the way, but do-able. If you check the website first, you can find out ahead of time, what the current or upcoming Theme will be, because the gardens will be decorated accordingly. Since the theme changes every few months, repeat visits are never the same! Plan on walking/strolling a lot - there is some seating but not much. Strollers & wheelchairs accessible almost everywhere"
,,"It is OK but not to my expectation, judged by its external form and shape",3.0,,"For whoever visiting the Gardens by the Bay, it's really not necessary to visit the flower dome, if you don't have enough time or not prepared to spend that much money.
It's more for educational purpose for the kids, in my opinion.
The roof structure is rather bulky and disappointing. But apart from designer like me, who cares?"
,,Nice,4.0,,"Nice experience.

But everyone said the cloud Forrest was better.

Very pretty, very pleasant - make a day of it but don't take the kids as they will get bored.

Had coffee at cafe inside and this took 25 mins to get 2 coffees and cost $15 sgd - won't be back.

Make sure you pay $3sgd and get the unlimited transport.

This is a must for a green thumbs at heart."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"1 of 2 domes in the gardens by the bay; flower dome, cool interior (temp wise) and with a massive selection of plants and flowers on display, wonderful scents! Very well done and some flowers are grouped into themes i.e. the ones that like music! Expect this to take circa 30-60 minutes depends on how nuts you are about flowers!"
,,Beyond the flower dome!,5.0,,"Along with the Marina Bay Gardens and Cloud Forest the Flower dome makes up a me of the finest visitor attractions in the world. The dome is air conditioned to a comfortable level and is a a spacious light filled space to escape the some times stifling heat and humidity of Singapore. The gardens themselves cover several different regions of the world from Africa to Australia. The size of the dome allows full size Palm and baobab trees alongside some impressive cacti and ancient olive trees. Dotted throughout the dome is some very impressive wooden sculptures of different animals. When we visited the rotating theme/exhibition was the 1960's complete with floral mini, Volkswagen bus and 60s music. We visited during the day and returned at night to see the dramatic lighting effects. We went in for the last entry at 8.30pm and there were probably only ten people in there at that time."
,,MUST VISIT!!!,5.0,,"I visited the flower dome during Lilitopia exhibition. It took me about 3 hours to walk around the dome, over 3 or 4 times just to make sure I didn’t miss out one single petal. The show was fantastic. It was such a pleasure visit and worth the price! Go to this flower dome by MRT, stop at Bayfront Station. From Bayfront MRT Station take Exit-B. From exit B, take elevator or staircase up, then follow the path to take the shuttle to go to the dome. The shuttle price is only 3$ per person for round trip. The shuttle will drop you at the ticket counter for the two domes. Normal price for adult is 28$ (for 1 dome). But for Singaporeans, PR holders and working pass holders price is 12$. And if you have either watsons or passion card, there will be additional 10% discount. In the end I paid only 10.80$ for this wonderful visit! Thank you GBTB!!! ╰(*´︶`*)╯"
,,A delightful place for a stroll,5.0,,Beautiful flowers and so well laid out. So relaxing for a quiet walk out of the rain. Well worth a visit for the variety of flowers
,,Not as amazing as Cloud Forest,4.0,,But it's really nice as well. It's basically a huge garden with flowers and plants from around the world. It's nicely designed with different areas representing different parts of the globe. If you like flowers you will give it 5 stars. If you don't like flowers then enjoy the engineering of the dome. It's really interesting. But do yourself a favour and visit this before Cloud Forest otherwise you won't be that amazed by the Flower Dome.
,,"Good collection of flowers, But not as expected",4.0,,"The flower dome has some good collection of flowers and other plants, but it was not as expected. The reviews and other pictures of the flower dome is beautifully shown in different sites. But we did did not find it as we imagined.

Anyway, you should visit once along with the cloud forest adjacent to it. Fully air conditioned, so at least you will get rid of the humid weather.

Easily connected with SMRT, you can also visit the Merlion park near the SMRT station"
,,Flowers galore.,5.0,,This is a must see for the flower enthusiast. The display is well labelled and the walkways makes for easy strolling around the garden.
,,Flowers Galore!,4.0,,Flowers & plants from all over the world are exhibited here... There are also seasonal flower shows with different flower themes. It was the Lilies flowers on show when I visited & a good ovation to the gardening & landscaping staff for such a well done job.
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,"This part of ""Gardens by the Bay"" has a small admission charge, and it it worth it. Thousands and Thousands of floral displays along with sculpture a music playing -- and its nice and COOL. A perfect break from Singapore in the summer. We also got to shake hands with the Prime Minister of Singapore who happened to be visiting on the same day! Wow!"
,,Interesting,3.0,,"This is part of the Gardens by the Bay and this has an entry fee. There were many plants to view and very few of them are labeled. I go to many botanic gardens and this is not in that category. It is a place to walk around with crowds of people and admire masses of plantings. That sad, it was enjoyable and a nice visit. There are areas that are geographic focused and somewhat education if you desire."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"This dome is air conditioned which alone makes it worth a look! However, the sheer size of it, and the variety of plant life within is truly impressive. You need to pay to get in; this can be achieved by buying a ticket or grabbing a meal at the Pollen restaurant."
,,Just Okay,3.0,,The pictures on Google are very beautiful but I found this place average. You can avoid if you have limited time
,,"If you like flowers and don't want to melt in the sun, go here!",4.0,,"My parents and I went here around 1pm, it's VERY HOT outside so we're glad that it feels very comfortable inside. We spent time here before going up the observation deck at MBS.

Good:
We were quite impressed with this greenhouse's structure, it's huge
Place smells great, and lots of photo opportunities
I did write it feels cool, even in the middle of the day :)
Staff is ready to take a family picture!

Opportunity:
I was hoping to see more orchids, but the theme in July is retro music
I couldn't imagine you walking from the entrance of Garden's by the Bay to the Flower Dome, so you'll likely pay the 3SGD shuttle fee"
,,Nice for some cool air,3.0,,"It was nice to walk around in the cool air but i thought it was a little expensive to see the flowers as i felt i paid to see what i have at home in my garden.
The orchid garden gave me more value for money.
It was busy but not overly crowded.
Didn't understand the centerpiece with the music, bicycles and motors."
,,Beautiful attraction,5.0,,"What an amazing display, the whole dome is a riot of colour & perfumes. The lilies were so beautiful, every colour imaginable. Everything so precisely planted. Some awesome statues dotted through the gardens. Nice & cool inside"
,,1960s theme,5.0,,The scent was amazing Every variety of Lillies set to 1960s theme with relevant music If you like Lillies this is a must The theme changes
,,Underwhelming,2.0,,"This was pretty underwhelming to be honest - after experiencing some amazing attractions in Singapore (including the fantastic botanical gardens), overall this felt a bit of a let-down even though they have obviously tried very hard to make it a success."
,,Good place to visit,5.0,,Went in to this dome and it was interesting. It is a place to visit and see a great display of flowers
,,Flowers from Beginning to End,5.0,,"the flower dome gives a feel of the gardens of heaven. If you are a flower lover and garden person, flower dome is not be missed on your visit."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"A Must visit when you are in Singapore. It's a mini heaven created on earth. It's beautiful, refreshing, rather very soothing I would say."
,,Amazing View of forever spring,5.0,,"Flowers are everywhere, such beautiful and well placed, the office in duty was also very nice, she offered us group photOs taking. So worthed to visit although pricey"
,,Seasonal Flowers -Tulips,5.0,,"After visiting Cloud Forest Flower Dome was a little bit disappointing. Still a grand structure, with plants from around the World, it did not have that same effect on us, especially that the featured flowers were tulips, which looked a little bit tired in few places. It was still worth a visit."
,,Not as amazing as the Cloud Dome,3.0,,"The Flower Dome was nice, and we enjoyed the lilies that were being shown in the seasonal exhibit, but otherwise, we didn't find the Flower Dome to has much of a ""wow"" factor like the Supertrees and the Cloud Dome both have. It was good for a quick trip, and might be a great option for a rainy day."
,,Amazing plants.,5.0,,"The Flower Dome feature all kinds of plants from all around the world, from Australian cacti to African palms. There is also a flower road in which many flowers of different colors are featured. The entire place is kept cool and smells like flowers. Perfect for the botany enthusiast or the normal family to spend an hour walking amongst the plants of the world."
,,A nice large greenhouse,3.0,,Went to the place with my family. It has a huge collection of flowering plants and succulents. The size of some of the cactus was really huge.
,,A Must See.,5.0,,An air-conditioned garden! What more can you ask for whilst staying in Singapore. The place is very grand and amazing. It should take around an hour for you to see everything.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Another amazing place for the MUST visit list. The smell of the plants or trees in certain areas is so beautiful. The carvings of the animals in each area is simply amazing. So worth a visit.
,,Unforgettable experience,5.0,,"Before I came here, I really didn't know what to expect. It turns out that I really like it! The flowers are so beautiful and smell really nice. The place is air conditioned, so comfortable. Really recommended!!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Loved this. the short walk from the MRT to the Dome, past the Supertrees is excellent in its own right, but the flower dome is something special. The sculptures are a particularl stand out."
,,Indoor flower garden,4.0,,"Visited prior my flight back home.

Strolled around and took so many pictures. Great for educational field trips and tourists.

For tourists, it's best to purchase tickets at the airport for tax free and discounted rates plus tickets bought are open dated: SGD90++ for flower dome + cloud forest + universal studios."
,,Nice family stroll,4.0,,"Lots of nice flowers inside the Dome for photo taking, remember to bring along your camera. It is rather cold inside (compare to outside which can be burning), bring along extra clothing if you are sensitive to cold.

You will probably take 45min to an hour to complete the walk around inside the Flower Dome. There is a restaurant inside, unfortunately on the day of my visit it was closed for private party. Recommend you eat outside, there are MacDonald and food center at the Super tree location (which is 5 to 10min walk).

Overall, not a bad place to visit for couples and recommended for folks who loves flower."
,,Nice side stop,3.0,,"There was a larger crowd here than in the Cloud Forest as there is fewer stairs. It was not as cool either. Still the gardens were nice making for plenty of photo ops. Is everyone carrying selfie sticks now?

It shares the gift shop with the cloud forest and there is both a refreshment stand (locals were gobbling American style hotdogs) along with a dine in restuarant."
,,Ok,3.0,,Compared to the wild personal of the Cloud Forest conservatory this is rather sedate. A lovely collection of cacti and agave is about it. There was a spectacular display of lilies on but only temporary.
,,Flower Dome Gardens.,5.0,,"Another great Singapore attraction part of The Gardens in The Bay. A vast display of flowers and plants from around the world with many incredible pieces of Art tucked in among the plants as you walk around the glass enclosed garden, There is a Restaurant within the Dome. Another must see within the Bay Gardens."
,,Ultimate man-mad flower garden,5.0,,"Garden by the bay has 2 domes - Flower dome & Cloud forest. Both domes are A/C Flower dome: It has lots of flowers, bushes & cactus. Good for nature lovers, kids & elderly people."
,,Bit weird,3.0,,"Have to admit I'm not that much into flowers. But the whole place had a strange aura. Very cold inside especially if you come from outside, it's like entering a fridge full of flowers and plants. Pop Music played not related to what you can see. Compared to the other dome this one rather had a uninspired touch and bored me."
,,Beautiful and COOL!,5.0,,Great display of plants from around the world with a backdrop of US oldies music in the background. My favorite display were the Baobab trees and bottle trees! Great place to cool off after a warm humid stroll through the Gardens.
,,Lilytopia,4.0,,"Visited on 4thJul'16 w colleagues as some of them have never been here before. We took Circle Line-orange, alight at Bayfront MRT station, walked through under link w whole lanes of beautiful mirrors. Then we walked through different theme of small gardens-Indian(elephant, lion status), Chinese garden, etc...You can take the buggy ride, $2 to reach the ticketing.

There r 2 conservatory, Flower Dome n Cloud Forest, big man made waterfall but we choose Flower Dome as there r different themes of floral display along the whole year. For tis Lilytopia theme is from June till 10thJuly.

Tickets pricing consists of local n tourist. Local just shows IC n foreign workers shows their work permit n if we r a Passion card or plus member will entitled to get a 10% off out of the admissions of $12 for 1 single conservatory.

Once we step in, the entire dome is full of floral fragrance-lily, it's pleasant. The entire dome is very cooling by the strong aircon despite from the hot weather. Have visited tis dome for different theme of floral display but only tis Lilytopia theme has tis lovely fragrance mist in e air. There r different colour of lilies n all r big. We have a wonderful afternoon n we took many photos."
,,Not what we have expected,3.0,,"We bought the standard ticket priced 28 dollar per adult for two conservatories. We were rather disappointed with Flower Dome. Perhaps we first entered Cloud Forest, and we still amazed with the scenery there. Hence, when we saw this Flower Dome, it was not really up to our expectation.

The theme for this month is Lilytopia, a retro-styled floral display. I was not impressed by the Lilies displayed. We thought the Dome will have various flowers from different region/country. But, what we found were trees instead of flowers. In our opinion, the admission fee was not worth for this conservatory."
,,Loved it!!!,5.0,,We were too lucky to visit Flower Dome on the last day if our trip and fortunately enough on the last day of the Tulip Mania festival! The most beautiful tulips which we saw for the first time were under the same roof and they were such a amazing scene!
,,Totally not worth the admission fee,1.0,,"Went there with my mom for the Sakura (cherry blossoms) festival in March. We were sorely disappointed. The flowers looked uninspiring and like they were nearing their wilting stage. Not to mention, it was unbelievably crowded on a weekend and what was supposed to be a nice treat for my mom became a jostle with the huge selfie-taking crowds and long snaking queues. If you want to view flowers, best to view them in their native land where they grew from the soil, in their suitable climate. Uprooting plants from their native land and displaying them somewhere else is always a bad idea. I've learnt my lesson. :("
,,"colour, vibrancy, variety, creative",5.0,,"What a creative exhibition of flowers, structures, lilies galore oh they were so beautiful, Trilliums, and cacti. The way they were displayed caught the imagination, gumboots, bike, old van. The varieties were many, and the mixture of colours made it even more overwhelming. It is very easy to walk around, and you have a choice of pace, to stop and admire, photograph. We took our time, didn't want to miss anything."
,,So many lilies !,5.0,,"It is like an everlasting Spring in there. Citrus trees bearing fruits, geraniums, roses, camelias, orchids and litteraly hundreds and hundreds of lillies. Enchanting for the eyes and the the nose !"
,,Lillys were on display,3.0,,"These were flowers we get in our garden in Melbourne all the time. There was nothing really special about this garden, but I'm sure that for people from the tropics it would be lovely. I did think that the sculptures were amazing though."
,,SPECTACULAR,5.0,,Must see - educational - excellent for families with children - reccomanded a guided tour (only at 11 am and 3 pm)
,,Good presentation,4.0,,"Go around the world and experience the flora of each country, Nice and cool in the dome. Allow reasonable time to look and explore at all exhibits"
,,Flower Dome - Attraction,4.0,,Very nice display of various kinds of flowers and what a expression of the flowers and plants. It sounds almost like talking to the nature. One of the Best
,,Colourful and pretty,4.0,,"Depending time of year, shows off the flowers to their very best. Worth a visit and make sure you do not rush the visit, as often walk one way and then come back a different path gives you even more beautiful flowers"
,,Quirky style and gorgeous layout.,5.0,,"A brilliant indoor garden within the Gardens By The Sea precinct.

Lots of gardens from different environments around the world. What i loved the most? Hmmm....the quirky, slightly ridiculous sense of style and the fact that it was air conditioned so that the arid and temperate client plants could survive in the extreme tropical heat and humidity.

Well worth a visit!"
,,Not as good as expected,3.0,,"When we visited Gardens by the Bay we went to the Cloud Forest first before visiting the Flower dome. This did set up a high level of expectation and we expected the Flower Dome to be as good.

We were a bit underwhelmed as (a) a lot of the flowers were European and so were rather ordinary given we come form Europe (b) we really did not like the fact there was piped music which we thought spoilt things

It was OK coming here the once, not sure if we'd visit this dome again."
,,"Beautiful array of flowers, and foliage. nice walk around the dome.",5.0,,"Lovely walk around the beautifully laid out gardens , and a huge variety of flowers and plant material. Enjoyed this place on 2 occasions . Shall go again, if time permits next time."
,,gardeners delight,5.0,,The flower dome had a lily display on while we were there . It was really beautiful . We loved the statues too .
,,Gorgeous!!,5.0,,"I could have spent an entire day in the Flower Dome. The Lilytopia section was gorgeous and smelled wonderful! There is much to see and to learn. Give this destination plenty of time. We were in the Flower Dome for one hour, which was much too short!!!"
,,cool aircon place,5.0,,"Lots to see, No problems to find the washrooms. Just note that pushing a wheelchair up from the vehicle drop point to flower dome is an uphill slope. You need to be strong to push it all the way."
,,A MUST SEE! Escape the heat!,5.0,,"One of two domes on the ground of the Gardens by the Bay complex. My advice before you buy a tickets, see if the Cloud Forest is open the same day. We had to see them on two different days because the close on alternating days, once a week, for maintenance. If you take the Hop on Hop Off bus you can use that as transportation down there. Once inside you will be delighted by the flowers!"
,,okay place but you'll love it if you're into gardening,3.0,,the variety of flowers and plants are way too many. it'll take you a good couple of hours to completely see the whole place properly. even though i am not into flowers i have to admit that the place is beautiful.
,,The coolest place in gardens by the bay,5.0,,"After walking into the flower dome, one will appreciate the coldness in the flower dome. There are a great variety of flowers, and I just happen to visit when it was the tulip festival."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The array of different flowers is mesmerizing. If you are a flower lover, this is the place for you. If not, its still a good watch. The tickets are not very expensive."
,,Tiring but serene,3.0,,"Our group of 4 (my husband and 2 kids ) enjoyed the flower display at the Flower Dome. The kids got tired though as we walked a lot. After alighting from the bus at the Marina Square area, we walked thru the Marina Bay Sands, then rode a shuttle cart to the Flower Dome. The air conditioned dome relieved us from the heat . And the scene and smell of colorful lilies removed the tiredness somehow."
,,Great for a stroll,4.0,,This is great for a chilled walk among the plants! Great variety of vegetation and some really interesting species.
,,All weather viewing,5.0,,"Flower Dome can be found in the Gardens by the Bay, this flower dome is paid entry but purchase a ticket which entitles you to also enter Cloud forest. Over two levels with top level representing plants from various countries. Lower area has special display of Lilliums at present. The theme is changed periodically. Quite a few sculptures throughout garden. Wheelchair friendly."
,,Paradise!,5.0,,Absolutely stunning gardens contained within a huge hothouse! Flowers from international destinations grown and nurtured in this oasis.
,,This is a beautiful way to see a variety of tropical plants in a climate controlled space.,5.0,,"This is a wonderful display of all sorts of tropical plants and flowers. A person can get ""up close"" to numerous types of flowers, trees and plants. If times permits, there is a lovely restaurant where one can enjoy a glass of wine and a small plate amid the trees and flowers."
,,Do not miss this when in Singapore!,5.0,,"The building itself is a destination. Once inside, you'll see an incredible collection of flowers, plants and trees, many segregated by region. A truly magnificent sight (not to mention a great place to duck out of the heat for an hour or two!)."
,,beautiful place to unwind from the heat.,4.0,,"An excellent location to escape the heat and relax surrounds by beautiful flowers and plants. They change the theme and reflect the flower exhibitions with background music, its a fun and relaxing place to visit."
,,A home from home,5.0,,If you are from Europe and feeling home sick a great place to go to feel back at home. Cool off in the cooler temperature and see those familiar plants. There are plants from all over the world but there will be a section you can relate to from home. Its constantly changing and always amazing!
,,Beautiful & mesmerizing,5.0,,You would be mesmerized in this place. They have wide variety of flower collection wherein you would end up having one of your best clicks of singapore
,,"Again, part of Gardens by the Bay",4.0,,This is 1 of 2 large scale extremely unusual looking buildings with the precinct and definitely worthwhile visiting
,,Amazing smell,4.0,,"I did prefer the Cloud Forest dome but, this was still very lovely. The smell from all the blooms as you walk in is really gorgeous."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,It was amazingly big and beautiful and wonderfully scented with all the fresh flowers - lovely windy paths to follow and a good thing to do on a rainy day - and also sunny.
,,Imaginative indoor gardens,4.0,,Some nice background music was played as we walked around the various zonal floral themes. Located right beside the Cloud Forrest. Spent about and hour here in total.
,,Nice but don't forget to take a jacket!,4.0,,It's a beautiful indoor garden but it's super cold inside. To make it a more pleasant attraction carry a jacket or a pullover with you.
,,It has lots of flowers that are unique and I have not seen before,5.0,,"Flower Dome is best for green thumbs! There was a tree that was carved like a dragon. In here, you will see A LOT of flowers. It is overwhelming how a simple flower that you see almost everyday can change the way you look at it. I recommend this not just for kids but for all ages. Its never too late to appreciate all the looks of trees and flowers."
,,"Great place to relax, enjoying the flower and soothing music with cool climate",5.0,,"Excellent place for flower lovers. Ideal place to spend time with family or friends. They will change the flower theme for every 1.5 month. If you already there before, you will able to enjoying in the next visit. They will artificially arrange a new theme to enjoy.

These flower theme mostly for cool climate plants and flower. The difference each theme was arrange beautifully for maximum enjoyment.

The best time to visit is weekday for less crowded, except when children school holiday for locals."
,,Watch out for the selfie sticks,3.0,,"It's definitely worth visiting and is a welcome retreat from the heat. The dome itself is an interesting structure to go inside -- impressive architecture. The plant collection is nice, but lacks clear signposting to explain what you're looking at. Is it organized by biome? By geographic region? By plant type? The central exhibit when we visited was a lily exhibit that was somehow integrated with oldies music. I didn't quite get it. It was pretty to look at, but you have to dodge the selfie sticks that everybody is constantly waving around."
,,Astounding achievement,5.0,,"The dome is an astounding achievement. It's big and, with such a large variety of plants, you'll want to pace yourself. Being a fan of succulent plants, I thoroughly enjoyed that section. I think even non-gardeners would have appreciated the beautiful display of thousands of flowering chrysanthemums, apparently put on as part of the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration.

The Flower Dome is air-conditioned. It was a welcomed relief from the heat initially but, after an hour-and-a-half inside, I was beginning to feel cold. If you intend to return on the same day, ensure to get a handstamp on exiting.

I got a discounted ticket from Changi Recommends at the airport."
,,Best place to cooling your body down......,5.0,,"If you have passion for flowers and plants, yes this is a good place to stay for few hours. Just chill and relax and enjoy what it have to offer every alternative month."
,,For year round flowers and trees,3.0,,"Love the fact there is a different theme and flora and fauna at different times of the year. Kids found the Cloud Forest more interesting in comparison. The Flower Dome is nice to just view flowers, but not as much engaging activities."
,,What an amazing presentation of international proportions,5.0,,This has to be seen to be believed. Flowers/ gardens from all over the globe. Even one from Australia. yes!!! The colours are stunning and vibrant. A fantastic walk through well worth the trip to Singapore just to see these gardens.
,,Will visit again,5.0,,"Visited during the lily season. with the variety of species and flowers, it was a very enjoyable visit. When the next flower season rolls around, will try to visit again.
It got quite cold after some time in the Dome. So best to bring a sweater.."
,,Must Visit for flower lovers!,5.0,,There was a wedding on the day we went to this dome..so some portion of the garden was closed...its nice..
,,Very Enjoyable,4.0,,"Despite many reviews, I think we enjoyed this more than the Cloud Dome. Cool, and inviting with many different types of flora to see."
,,Can get monotonous if you are not into plants,4.0,,"The Flower dome attraction within Gardens By the Bay is actually a great exhibit - it houses numerous plant species from all over the world, and its a marvel they have managed to grow all these plants / trees within that dome in Singapore. They also have special themed-exhibits that keep changing(e.g Nursery Rhymes, Sakura, Tulip bloom, Lilies etc). However for people not interested in nature/plants/botany, it can get a bit boring after 10 minutes."
,,Amazing Structures,5.0,,"It's worth going to see for the glass house structures alone, an internal 'Botanical Garden', it's easy to wander around and smells delightful"
,,So beautiful,5.0,,Flowers from wold over grown under one roof.What a experience. A photographers delight . Avail Singapore airlines discount before buying tickets
,,The smell is captavating,5.0,,"A beautiful display of lilies this visit. 60's music playing. All is great with the world. Was a little more crowded than other times I have been, but school holidays had started in Singapore. Wonderful displays."
,,Gardens by The Bay,5.0,,Enjoyed both the Flower and the Cloud Dome as part of our day exploring the gardens. Make sure to also check out the supertrees and to leave enough time to do it at a leisurly pace.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Definitively worth a visit. The flower dome is simply stunning.

Few hints:
- in the domes (flower and rainforest) it is a bit fresh. Bring something with long sleeves. I found the flower dome much more interesting. Bring also a book. You have plenty of time.
- To rent a trolley for the kids you need an ID card (e.g. passport). The rent costs you 2 SGD.
- There is the Children Garden close by, which you can in any case enter for free. That is basically a big water play area. Bring a towel and some clothes for the kids AND for you. It's fun!
- Outside tour (to be paid extra) is not worth it. Better to stay longer in the flower dome and/or children garden."
,,Just Beatiful,5.0,,"Again I am not a garden nut, but totally enjoyed this experience. the range and extent of different plants is just amazing."
,,a magical display of colour,5.0,,"the day we visited was busy with lots of photo taking so we didn't linger long. worth a view. we gained access via a restaurant so didn't pay, not sure I would tbh!"
,,Plants from all over the world,3.0,,"This places comes as part of the two attraction ticket, not as good as the cloud garden but worth seeing. Has a large array of plants and flowers from across the world and a great place for those photography buffs who like to take photo of nature."
,,Very impressive flowers,5.0,,"Watching flowers is not my cup of tea, but this place really made my day. Watching a lot of flowers is really cheerful. If you are lucky you will see the Tulips. I really enjoyed my time here."
,,Repeat visit,5.0,,"Cloud Forest and Flower Dome were just as good second time around. It was nice to stroll around the Flower Dome and listen to 60s music. Yes it does get crowded so going early is a good idea. The crowds did not bother me as I enjoy watching people and their reactions to the displays.

If you get tired there are plenty of places to sit. Don't be in a rush to get through everything. Appreciate the effort that has gone into making sonething special."
,,Great planting,4.0,,Enjoyed being in here although felt some of the planting overlapped some but overall a god trip on a cloudy at day. Love all the sculptures hidden in the beds.
,,Great,4.0,,The tulip festival was going on when we went there in May. There were lots and lots of tulips different colours etc..Its was awesome..
,,Worth the effort,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning display of beautiful flowers. Just amazing. Take your time and don't rush, you will love it."
,,Not special to Asian,3.0,,"The Dome is quite small and the flowers are not special to Asians. For us, it doesn't worth to pay money to get inside, but Western flower lovers may find the flowers special."
,,Beautiful Singapore - another section of the Bay Gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful plant and flower displays divided into world climate regions. Also some amazing sculptures made of of wood. A bit of humour here too, find the Kombi, Mini and Vespa"
,,Stunning flowers,5.0,,A great place to visit when in singapore. Brilliant variety of flowers. Stunning layout. Very busy inside with tourists taking selfies in front of everything!
,,Do before entering the cloud forest dome.,5.0,,"A must do in Singapore. The variety and quantity of flora is stunning. Spend a whole afternoon here and explore all of the nooks and crannies. So much to see! After viewing this, go to the cloud forest dome."
,,Amazing flower garden,4.0,,"If yiu are a plant or garden lover you will love this! The maintrnance and design of the attraction is superb.

Note that not all plants have flowers even though the name suggests it.

The only criticism i have is that it is not intuitive in terms of path to take so we ended up going back and forth the attraction."
,,Very cool cacti,5.0,,"See plants you've never heard of from around the globe in the flower dome. I found this to be a really cool educational experience for my two boys, because they could see up close some cool, creepy and bizarre plants that they may never see again in person."
,,My favourite part of the Gardens,5.0,,This dome is just lovely. We really enjoyed spending a few (cool) hours looking at the displays and discovering this place. Just lovely and so we made and kept.
,,Pretty and interesting,5.0,,Not as majestic as the Cloud Forest but still beautiful and worth a visit. The kids loved reading about the different flora varieties from around the world.
,,Changes with the seasons,5.0,,"The exhibits in the flower dome change periodically, and this keeps it fresh and interesting. The last time I went, they were having a Christmas Toyland exhibit which was rather elaborate. Recently, they had a Tulipmania exhibit. A lot of effort goes into perfecting these exhibits and I would recommend visitors to visit the flower dome as opposed to the cloud forest, if they had to choose one."
,,Beautiful flowers everywhere,4.0,,"Better visit the place during afternoon. Go to the upper floor. The view is nice. I prefer the cloud dome, but if you're a big fan of flowers like my friends, then this place is a must-visit."
,,Another milestone of Singaopre,4.0,,"This dome is full of trees, plants & flowers available round the world. It's amazing how they are able to make them grow in an indoor environment. This dome has so much to see & observe. It's really entertaining & educating for children. One can spend 30-45 minutes here without getting bored. We saw it evening so I will recommend that but I'm sure it will be equally entertaining in day time as well."
,,cooling place to look at flowers,4.0,,We went here just before Christmas in 2015 with my mom and elder sister who were just visiting Singapore. The place is good as there are seating places to rest and just take in the flowers around you. It is actually cold inside and you wouldn't even sweat walking around.. the next thing you know is that you have gone around and is nearing the exit.
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,Loved it. Took hundreds of photos. Amazing displays that are just works of art. Not a dead bloom in sight and a fragrance like your favourite lilies pervades the entire space. Worth every single cent in my opinion.
,,Singapore Trip 2016,5.0,,"Very good they change the theme from time to time, get there early (10am) and you will be able to take your time and get great photos as there are very few people there at that time."
,,Amazing flowers and atmosphere,5.0,,Wonderful experience. Very well Organised in various zones. Enjoyed the unusual sculptures placed in the garden. A special lily festival is on at the moment. Especially good to visit if it's a hot or wet day.
,,family visit,5.0,,This was really nice and would be a good thing to do if it is raining as it is all under a dome. They have a wonderful selection of plants especially the cactus and succulents. The art work and statues etc are well done as well. There is a restaurant bar inside which looks nice although we did not eat there.
,,Flowery Flower....,5.0,,"I feel like go inside the fairy tale story that has a many kind of flower.. When i go here at my honeymoon trip, there was a Tulipmania Event so there are many kind of beautiful tulip...!! Amazing!!"
,,Plant enthusiast heaven,5.0,,"As a collector of rare and unusual Cactus and succulents , visiting the Flower dome had been a dream and it didn't disappoint , even if your not an enthusiast you will still be amazed by the weird and diverse plants housed here , this is an absolute must do in Singapore"
,,"A feast for eyes. If you love nature , you got to visit this",5.0,,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I entered this dome. There are flowers all around. It looks so beautiful that one needs to remind again and again that it's not a dream.

Wonderfully landscaped, by habitats , the riot of colours is presented very artistically.

Must visit this marvel of modern environmental engineering installation"
,,"Educational, interesting",4.0,,This is one of the major attractions at the Gardens by the Bay. Dome is air-conditioned so you can go here any day even with the searing temperature of Singapore. We were lucky to get a glimpse of the remnants of the recent Tulip Festival. Fantastic blooms all around and interesting flora and all sorts of plants/trees. I hope they can bring in more interesting varieties.
,,A fantastic escape to magical gardens from around the world.,5.0,,Like with the Cloud Forest the Flower Dome is a MUST SEE. We never went the first time in Singapore but so glad we did the second time we were in town. Such a vast range of plants and flowers from all corners of the world.
,,Well planned,5.0,,"The second dome in the Marina Bay Gardens, we purchased a package entry along with Cloud Mountain. Totally different to Cloud Mountain, it had exhibits of typical gardens from regions around the world. Each region contained very impressive samples of the native plants and trees. There were many school children visiting while we were there, it would be a great learning environment for them."
,,This is what you call a greenhouse,5.0,,This is an amazing place and the exhibits are laid out in a very attractive way to give an idea of gardens around the globe. When we went the cherry blossom was in full bloom and the main attraction but there were many equally good or better displays.
,,Not to be missed ....,5.0,,"The Flower dome is fantastic, filled with beautiful flowers and excellent art sculpture. The air is cool and scented from the flowers. It is a comfortable walk around the exhibits and great for flower photography. We spent over an hour enjoying the flowers and art work."
,,Flower lover pqrqdise,3.0,,This wasn't something really that I took particular interest in and skimmed through it quite quickly. The dome has many gorgeous flowers and I am positive that flower lovers would have really enjoyed the experience
,,The World's Best Plants in One Place,5.0,,"This Dome is the better of the two enclosed ecosystems at the Gardens, and so should be visited first to ensure that you can give it the time it deserves. It has opportunities to see plants from many different climates all in one place, with themed displays according to the time of year. I am sure that even those who are not really plant lovers will find something to enjoy, even if it is to marvel at the extraordinary architectural and engineering skill that lies behind the building of the dome."
,,Amazing creation,5.0,,"The flower dome is the most amazing creation I have ever seen. Your finger will not move away from the camera shutter and you will not be able to move forward or away from the enchanting array of flowers, particularly the tulips."
,,"Wow, wow, wow",5.0,,"The dome is filled with the sounds of 60s hits, which makes you feel good from the minute you step through the doors. The number and variety of plants this dome contains is gob-smacking. Walking through the well-planned space takes you on a floral journey around the world. The sculptures dotted throughout the displays provide a clever relief from the plants. As a side note, even visiting the toilets is a pleasure - they are hygienically clean and fresh"
,,Okay,4.0,,"Was okay, but not great. If you like flowers, orchids in particular, you will love this! Sometimes the smell of the orchids was a bit overwhelming."
,,Flower Lovers Paradise,4.0,,"If you love flower, you must visit here. The day we went was the last day of Orchid Fair. Huge varieties of colorful Orchids. Loved the place"
,,Decided to get a Membership,5.0,,"I love this place. There are new displays every 6 weeks or so. I decided to get a membership. If you're only visiting once, I recommend getting the audio tour. It gives some interesting details about plants that I didn't even notice on my first 2 visits. I have a membership and I've since enjoyed the cherry blossoms and tulips. I've heard the Lilytopia display is good and look forward to seeing that soon. We always have our visitors go to the flower dome and cloud forest and they love it."
,,Tulips!,5.0,,Was lucky enough to be at the Flower Dome for the Tulip display (runs mid April-mid May I think) and they were amazing so very very beautiful. The dome is set out wonderfully you just follow the paths and venture into flora from another country. They have done an amazing job creating this city oasis.
,,Didn't have the wow factor vs cloud or gardens by the bay,3.0,,"It was quite pleasant but having just been around the gardens and the cloud forest it was a bit bland. There were a lot of plants and flowers that Europeans or those of us from the UK find around our gardens at home, cherry, geraniums, daisies etc. However this probably makes it quite interesting for those from hotter climates. For me, flower wise, it was a bit like b&q or haskins garden centers,just much better presented of course."
,,Very nice flowers!,5.0,,"In the garden there are many kinds of flowers and plants ，some I never konw before. The flowers all so beautiful, but if you want to go there ,you must wear more clothes, it's very cold inside."
,,Nice and spiky,4.0,,"The Cloud was closed for maintenance so we went to the Flower Dome instead... Which is lovely and surprisingly cool, but most of the plants are not from Asia. The collection of water-storing trees was fascinating, as was the mixture of sculpture placed within the various themed areas. The café was a nice respite as well, with a special for a coffee and muffin for 10SD, which is rather a bargain in the area."
,,Beautiful and Interesting,5.0,,I travel a lot. I love flowers. I have NEVER seen a greenhouse like this one. Plants and flowers from literally all over the world. It was beautiful in there.
,,Smells are amazing,5.0,,"The smells are amazing and every month the flower dome has another theme. This month is music and the smell of Lillian's, lilies and orchids are truly imagine. Displays are a work of art. Families and kids most welcome and there is something for everyone."
,,Flower Paradise,5.0,,"Highly recommend visiting if you are in Singapore. Absolutely beautiful - so many colours and flower varieties. The dome is so well maintained. The dome is also air conditioned and a great way to get out of the Singapore heat. This is a must! You could spend a whole afternoon visiting the flower dome, forest dome and also skywalk."
,,Tulipmania,4.0,,I walked through the dome and was amazed at the thousands of tulips on display. It was stunning. Although there were many other plants and flowers on display from all over the globe the tulips were the stars. The whole dome smelt amazing. I jumped on a free tulip walking tour which had some great information. Definitely worth a visit!
,,The best part of Garden by the Bay,5.0,,You can see all varieties of plants and flowers from all over the world. All under one roof. You cant imagine the variety of tulips and cactus. One can actually spend more than half a day in the dome. You should buy the combo tickets for Flower dome and Cloud forest.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Lots of plants from different parts of the world in a single area. Good for a rainy day activiy. Dont miss the light show in the evening outside the dome.
,,For Flower Lovers,5.0,,"The svents, colors and variety of flowers inside the dome are awesome. It's worthwhile to spend a whole morning or afternoon just exploring every nook and cranny of the Flower dome. The tulip blooms are worth rhe ticket."
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,I would say me and my husband got shocked when we go there for our honeymoon . This place is simply awesome. Haven't Sean such a beautiful place before. Who ever who visit Singapore I must say this is a must place to visit.
,,tulip..,4.0,,"it seems to be a basket full of tulip flowers, as we rarely see in rashtrapati bhavan and in jammu kashmir in india. fertility of the plants is amazing carefully maintained,"
,,Amazing place!,5.0,,Worth it of the entrance fee. Very beautiful and jaw dropping of its beauty. When you go to the Singapore never miss to visit this place.
,,Intersting walk,5.0,,"I liked this dome but not as much as the cloud forest. It has less dimension to it, but has lots of interesting fauna. It's well laid out and you can get a decent walk in."
,,Favorite Thing to Do in Singapore,5.0,,"I wasnt expecting too much from this attraction, as it does not look too impressive from the outside. However, upon entering I was pleasantly surprised. It is well worth spending time here. We planned to stay for 30 mins but ended up staying 1.30 minutes. It is lovely and cool inside which is nice to get out of the Singapore heat. Would be good to visit both night and daytime."
,,most liked place in the gardens,4.0,,"It houses my treasured memories on beautiful time with parents. Brought my old parents there every time they visit, take a leisure walk and watch flowers."
,,Big Greenhouse! Spring Forever!,5.0,,"The flower dome will make you wish that spring is forever. I was awed.

The plants and flowers in the dome are amazing. You can stroll around the flower dome and take millions of photos

Eventhough it is a greenhouse, the flower dome is cooler. Based on the info in the flower dome entrance, it is between 23 to 25 degrees celcius."
,,Very well done & set out.,5.0,,"Beautiful plants from each continent. The wooden carved statues as well as resin ones were just beautiful. amazing to walk through. I visited when all the tulips were in abundance, never seen anything like it, just amazing. Highly recommend."
,,Beautiful,3.0,,"It was a pleasant experience, with a cool environment thanks to fully air conditioned facility. Although there is nothing much, just an expensive garden $$, it gave good photo zones and history of how they named some of the MRT stations in Singapore (This was quite interesting for me). But as you can expect, famous tourism spot=LOTS of people, it's quite hard to get a nice photo of ""YOURSELF"" only in the given frame. But, it's good to roam around and enjoy exotic flowers. I'd suggest for both family & couple. It may worth the price for the ones who LOVE to take photos since you can get to go for both Flower Dome and Cloud Dome."
,,Beautiful Tulips,4.0,,"We visited during the TulipMania. Had a great time with our toddler and baby. The area is child friendly with easy access for strollers. The tulips are really beautiful, and the whole place is so well maintained. They change the flower display frequently so check before you go."
,,Orchids Orchids Orchids!!,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to be in the flower dome during the orchid festival. I still haven't really gotten over it. It was absolutely beautiful. Even without the orchids its well worth a visit. I saw a Stur'ts Desert Pea in the Australian Section, I have a stained glass window of one at home - never seen a live one before!!"
,,Most unique and amazing experience,5.0,,The collection is nothing short of stupendous! Even the idea of having a zoo for plants is amazing and one so well maintained with a collection so large and diverse is commendable. One really needs to spend time here. A great place to learn and understand. Keep in mind that there is a lot of walking around.
,,the botanic garden of the future,5.0,,"An amazing display of colour cleverly worked into a relatively small area, well worth a visit if a little pricey"
,,Not as good as cloud forest.,3.0,,"Very busy, just a lot of plants from all over the world. Nice concept but there was so structure or designated path to follow."
,,It's ok,4.0,,I visited the flower dome during the 3000 orchid exposition but thought the place was bigger. The flower dome gives you a break from the unbearable heat outside. If you can't walk too much or have young kids or elders take the shuttle bus.
,,"Nice, But I like the Cloud Forest Better",4.0,,"The flowers are pretty and there are free tours at 11:00 and 3:00. They should probably make them hourly. Since I missed the 11:00 be 5 minutes, there was no tour for us. It may have helped. The flowers are nice, but if you have time at SIN airport the gardens are almost as nice and FREE. That being said, you can get discount tickets though a HANDY cell phone provided at some hotels. With the discount you can get both the Flower and Cloud Forest for SGD$20. The best part is the Flower Dome is inside and air conditioned!"
,,"Good, natural setup, inside a dome structure",4.0,,"Adjacent to the great Cloud Forest Dome within the Gardens by the bay, the flower dome offers great array of Tulips, roses and other exotic flowers. Great photo ops"
,,nice flower show,4.0,,"Im lucky that I went there where is tulip everywhere inside the garden. Its really makes me feel so relax. And inside also cool, not hot as outside.."
,,Rainbow of Colours,5.0,,"When we visited this place on April 15th 2016, there was a Tulipmania going on.An array of colorful tulips were kept on display & the spectacle was just unbelievable.Tulips of all possible colors knows to humans lined up the entire place spreading its magnificent charm & aura, just an awesome sight.
Throughly enjoyed this place"
,,Forever changing,5.0,,Every time you go to Singapore this is a must with the ever changing display - this year tulips. How do they grow them and keep them in such a climate. The permanent display is also wonderful with lots of plants from a variety of plant habitats around the world. So well maintained. Plenty of interest for kids and adults. Generally busy but don't go on a weekend! Again allow time to wander and look.
,,Weird and wonderful,5.0,,One of the more interesting things to visit. Beautifully laid out and accessible. Somewhat expensive but worth it.
,,Great excursion,5.0,,Together with its sister The Cloud Forest this is a must visit excursion for a stopover in Singapore Singapore is expensive but these represent good value as I have not seen anything like them in the world and are world class
,,Wonderful space filled with all the colours of the rainbow!,5.0,,"We visited the Flower Dome after watching the show in the Supertree Grove and it was very quiet and empty, lovely! The dome is wonderful, filled with lovely smells from all the flowers and set out as if going on a journey around the world.

We particularly loved the Cherry Tree blossom, so pretty!

Definitely add to your list in Singapore."
,,Awesome Dome & Excellent staffs!!!,5.0,,A place where u feel totally calm n stress free!!! Cooling n great place to see!!! Observant enough to see smiling faces from the staffs right from the entrance till the exit!!!!! Awesome and 👍👍👍👍
,,a wonderful location to explore,4.0,,"A stunning view to explore with many species of plants to see and enjoy. It has ramps for those disabled or old, and the views are also stunning!"
,,Amazing arrangement,5.0,,Its an indoor marvel! We saw tulips this time and it was amazing. Not to mention the wooden carved structures all across. Lots of walking to do and lots of selfies to be taken!
,,Indoor Splenda,5.0,,"Marina Gardens in Singapore is a great place, but then you can go in to 2 domes we chose the Flower Dome absolutely takes your breath away. If you love a garden this will amaze you. We spent ages walking around taking photos of this wonderful dome."
,,Loved the flower dome!,5.0,,Go into the domes...Much cooler and so much to see. They had a tulip show going on when we were there.
,,tulips and sculptures,5.0,,You forget that you are in Singapore when you are in the flower dome. The sculptures hand crafted from wood are another delight. Thank you for the experience.
,,Dazzling Displays,4.0,,"Visited here on a Saturday afternoon to see the Tulip extravaganza. Yes it was busy, but there was no shoving or pushing, just families enjoying the display. The dome is an amazing structure and to keep all those flowers in peak condition takes some doing. It was amazing."
,,Flower Dome,4.0,,"Very well done. Various countries of the world well represented. TulipMania still on, absolutely stunning display."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"WOW! What a splendid venue. There are so many pants from all around the world in this fantastic place. Don't miss it. If you can prove you travelled with Singapore Airlines, you will get a 10% discount."
,,Tulips in May!!!,4.0,,How to see Tulips in Singapore? Go visit the Flower Dome. The air condition is set to the temperature that the different types of Tulip can be seen :)
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Having been through the gardens by the bay, and the cloud forest I was a little concerned this would pale in comparison. I need not have worried. If you can appreciate enormous boab trees from Australia, or 140 year old olive trees from Italy,then this is the place for you. At the time of my visit there was a tulip exhibition on. Sadly it was at the end of the exhibition and some of the tulips were not at their best and some looked like they had been trampled. This didn't spoil my enjoyment and I would be happy to visit again"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"what a beautiful place to be in, among the flowers from all over, i didnot even know this many and different kinds of flowers exist."
,,Impressive,4.0,,Another must see in Singapore tho many of the flowers we saw we are familiar with. The size layout and environment amazing. We didnt go with a guide and no issues.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,We spent two hours in here and would have stayed longer but we wanted to get to the supertrees for the light show. It was amazing the variety of plants and sculptures on display. Definitely a highlight. Don't miss.
,,Bring a camera and cardigan!,5.0,,Lots to be photographed in the cooling dome. Despite the hot and humid weather out there it's quite cold in the dome! Remember to bring a jacket!
,,Wonderful Covered Garden,5.0,,"Well worth the entrance fee. The dome has a great variety of plants interspersed with some amazing and unusual wood carvings. The views from the upper levels help appreciate the colour and planting schemes. Do spend time studying the various displays and you will spot even more innovative elements to the plantings and sculptures. Good access throughout and not hot as I anticipated. My favourite of the two domes, well worth a few hours visit"
,,"Absolutely beautiful, must see while in Singapore.",5.0,,"Outstanding attraction. The building itself is an engineering marvel, and the air-conditioning was very welcomed on a hot, humid day a touring the Gardens by the Bay. When I visited, they had Tulipmania going on, and the tulips and other flowers were simply amazing. The arrangements of the flower displays were very well done with plenty of informative information available to those interested in it.

One note, I visited on a weekend and the Flower Dome was very crowded with visitors which took away from the experience. I would definitely recommend that one visit on a week day vice the weekend if possible."
,,A Huge Green House,5.0,,Filled with variety of plants from all regions in the world with descriptions for each of them. Came here during a special Tulips event and there were heaps of them with different colours. Totally worth a visit!
,,A bloomin' marvel!,5.0,,"Thousands of blooms, easy flow around the attraction, a great respite from the heat make this a must on your visit to Singapore. Liked the way the displays were divided into regions showing the different flora."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful bright flowers, absolutely stunning. Also indoors and nice and cool. Although lovely, I would say if you had to pick one between this and Cloud Forest, I'd say go with Cloud Forest. That was a more unique experience for me, but I loved Flower Dome too."
,,Beautiful and Interesting,5.0,,This is part of the Gardens by the Bay and there is a charge to visit but well worth it. It can get rather crowded in parts and could do with a few more seats.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"A definite must to visit. During the visit my son was getting bored sitting on the stroller all day, so we decided to let him crawl around at one of the big seat inside the place. Even though the marble was so cold, my son really enjoyed his time and really like his time roaming around the place."
,,Cloud Forest v Flower Dome,4.0,,"If you only have time to visit one of the two sites my suggestion is pick the Flower Dome. The cloud forest is spectacular but flower dome is spectacular, stunningly beautiful and very diverse with at least six gardens in one site including a lovely olive grove. Plus an interesting restaurant although I did not have time to sample it."
,,Heavenly,5.0,,Do not miss it by any chance. Its a must visit. We had a great time here. Beat the afternoon sun and spend time in this dome and the adjoining cloud forest. There is a 3$ shuttle available from the Bayfront MRT. Indeed heavenly.
,,Tulipmania_great evening,4.0,,"Had great evening at flower dome..its cool inside..amazing tulips flower bulb of various colors/shape display.. flower, trees and plants from various part of world can be viewed including olive tree, cherry blossom & etc..non tiresome and great place of attraction for all age group .."
,,Beautiful flower dome,5.0,,"The flower dome is constantly having new exhibits of various seasonal flowers, usually timed to coincide with their blossoming in their traditional native lands. Many people in Singapore flocked to see the hanami when it was blooming in flower dome and it was followed by the tulips which were coming into season in Holland.

Get a season pass of you love flowers and would like to come several times a year for the cool, scented air full of beautiful treats for your eyes!"
,,A great day.,5.0,,"What an amazing display this really is. Flower lover or not, be prepared to be amazed at the proliferation of colours here. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, be prepared to be that person."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,It's absolutely worth seeing. But it's not as impressive as the dome next to it! I'd say go to the flower dome first and the cloud Forrest second! Definitely worth going to see
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Flower Dome is definitely a must-visit when being in Singapore. In Addition, it's a very welcome escape & refreshement from Singapore's humidity & heat."
,,Best part of the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"The flower dome was an unexpected delight in Singapore. While we were anticipating enjoying our visit, we were blown away by the variety of plants included in the displays. It was also deliciously cool, so it made a perfect midday stop. The only downside was the dreadful meal we got at Pollen - eat elsewhere."
,,Colorful plants everywhere,5.0,,"We were so looking forward to visiting the flower-dome and we were not disappointed. This has to be one of Singapore's most beautiful attractions. We strolled around in air-conditioned comfort enjoying the special attraction of Tulips in all their beauty & colour.
As well as the tulips, there were flowers of almost every shape, colour and variety. A visit to the Flower Dome is not to be missed whilst in Singapore."
,,Amazing displays of plants from all over the world,4.0,,We enjoyed walking around in here & as it was near Easter there was a concert on which we enjoyed. Look out for all the little sculptures & some not so little that are hiding in the gardens. Easy to walk around with well constructed walkways dividing the areas..
,,Blossom Beats,4.0,,"I visited the flower done with my wife and child as part of our wedding anniversary this March. Both of us have always wanted to visit Japan and view the Cherry Blossoms in full but never had the opportunity to do so. Kudos to the team at Gardens by the Bay for bringing such a wonderful display of cherry blossoms to a tropical country like Singapore.

The flower dome is a family friendly attraction and allows for parents with babies and toddlers to freely view the exhibits without having to worry about finding a spot to sit for your tired legs, or even a changing station. Do note that the restroom for the attraction is at the of the trail though so you would have to backtrack if you do need to stop by the restroom. The place is sheltered with underground cooling so it makes a good attraction to visit on a rainy day or when you need an activity from the sweltering sun. No stairs are found in this attraction so persons with disabilities can freely move about.

Definitely a great place to visit for a family outing."
,,Airconditioned Nature at it's best,4.0,,"Made it to the the flower dome the name of which rang a little too close to a Mad Max movie. Instead of flowers battling to the death you are greeted with a vast enclosed climate controlled area housing all manner of plants and sculpture. I particularly enjoyed the wide variety of exotic succulents. There was also a tulip show going on the time we went. The whole experience was impressive from the architecture of the structure, to the emasculate manicured beds of plans I would recommend this experience even to the most tepid plant enthusiast. It's a nice break from the equatorial heat and humidity if nothing else."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Just love the Flower Dome. We have visited three times when transiting through Singapore. The ground floor display changes. We have seen a Christmas Display, a Halloween Display and this time a display of the most magnificent tulips. The Flower Dome is a photographer's paradise although I wish some of the photographers and their huge telephoto lenses were not there when I was. That said, I have enjoyed my view of the tulips and have taken some wonderful photos with my small digital camera. For great views of the display go up past the cacti area. Don't forget to look at the cacti on the way. They are remarkable. While the ground floor display is what draws people in remember to visit the rest of the displays to see plants from different parts of the world. Also love the statues in this dome. Because the displays change, the Flower Dome is one that you can visit at different times of the year. Look up to admire the structure of this building and look out for views of parts of Singapore. Tickets can be purchased at the entrance near the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and at ticket offices near the Dome itself."
,,Gorgeous spring flower displays!!,5.0,,"The day we visited they had the daffodil and tulip displays, divine colors and varieties apart from all the other types of flowers from around the world, worth a visit!!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"You don't need to be a plant/flower lover to appreciate the beauty of this massive greenhouse. They had sections for gardens across the world with the plant life from the respective regions. Beautiful sculptures and artwork interspersed among the plants.
We got the combined ticket with the Cloud forest, so this proves to be a good morning or afternoon out combining these 2 attractions with the Skywalk and Gardens at The Bay.
Also it has air conditioning. So on a hot day this offers welcome relief from the heat"
,,Amazing amount of plants,5.0,,We spent hours looking at the many plants and sculptures hidden throughout the dome. The staff were very knowledgeable about the plants and very helpful
,,beautiful,5.0,,not quite as impressive as the cloud dome but full of colour and some fantastic art works - worth spending a long time with frequent breaks.
,,Tulipmania (8 April - 22 May 2016),5.0,,"On 24 Apr 2016, visited the Flower Dome @ Garden by The Bay. An aircon nursery which showcase many different landscaping. This month it happened to be the Tulip & Ottoman theme and was named ""Tulipmania"". Was really an eye opening experience to see the many different species of tulips set in Turkish landscaping in the park. It was a Sunday and the garden was packed with visitors. There were long queue at the ticket booth too.

The entire touring took about 90 minutes. Really refreshing and worth the visit."
,,Get there for the tulip display,4.0,,"The flower dome is always good, but the tulip show this time is a real treat for the eyes. Can get a bit crowded as it seems to be on every tour bus itinerary. Watch out for the noisy indians."
,,Depends on your interests,3.0,,"Found the cloud forest more interesting, but if you are into flowers/plants then the flower dome may be of interest."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"We were amazed at how some of these trees, thousands of years old, were transplanted and transported from around the world. This is so much more than just a dome showcasing flowers and plants. It has different areas from arid desert to rich, luscious Mediterranean landscapes. We were lucky enough to visit whilst the Tulip exhibition was on. Absolutely beautiful. Well worth a visit."
,,Stunning addition to Bay Gardens,5.0,,"Air conditioned glass dome, home to a glorious display of plants from around the globe. Perfume permeates, colourful displays surround to delight visitors. The blooms are graced with some fabulous statuary & metalwork, the art as glorious as the blooms ! Entering from the heat of outside, the cool is welcome, but what awaits the eyes is truly a vision not to be missed. Whilst tulips stole the show with their mass planting & colours, there was so much more to see. If your time is limited, then this should be your top choice, it's heaven Singapore style !"
,,Flowers everywhere!,5.0,,Wonderful garden and a display of all sort of flowers across the world. Very pretty! It could get really cold inside so better be prepared!
,,very pretty,4.0,,"beautiful flowers, neat and clean, riotous colours. I preferred the Forest dome though, that was more unusual"
,,conservatory with the best display of flowers!,4.0,,"the flower dome is among the two conservatories located within gardens by the bay. this one displays a wide variety of flowers grown in a climate controlled enclosure. when we went in april this year, they had a tulip festival going on. consequently there were large varieties, types and colours, of tulips on display. they also had cherry blossom trees - seeing these was very exciting as i saw one for the first time. other than these, there were many other types of flowers. all flowers are clearly marked. best time to visit the dome is at about 5:30 in the eve. entrance fee is SGD 16 just for the flower dome, coupled with forest dome it is about SGD 28"
,,Tulipmania,5.0,,"Were lucky enough to visit here during ""Tuplipmania"" which was a great experience. The volume and variety of tulips on display was fantastic, the range of colors made for some stunning pictures. Well worth the visit."
,,Flowers! Flowers! Flowers!,4.0,,"If you are a flower lover like I am, this place is for you! I am not sure how they categorized flowers like by country or region, or states!! For example, they had an area that was Australian Garden and it had amazing plans. Yet they had California Garden, instead of U.S.A. Garden, which was disappointing compared to the rest!"
,,Must see!,5.0,,"Amazing gardens a must see! Smells amazing as you walk in, check it out at night for a little bit of romance or just for the pretty lights!"
,,Very nice garden,5.0,,"It took a time to get tickets, but it was worth it. You get to see a big variety of plants and flowers from many different parts of the world. The Japanese cherry trees were bloom in and that was something to see!"
,,Tulips,4.0,,We come here as we want to see the tulips! They are beautiful & smells really sweet. Wheelchair accesible.
,,Beautiful Tulips!,5.0,,Well worth the visit if you love flowers. Be close to nature with lovely flower scent without the murderous humidity. There are seasonal events such as the Tulip season in early April to late May (Happening now as I write). Entry is chargeable. Do refer to the rates published on the Gardensbythebay Website as there are different rates and promotion packages.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Flowers,sculptures and cool after the heat of Singapore. A must see. Tulips were on show at this time and i had no idea there were so many types and colours."
,,So much to see. Give yourself plenty of time.,5.0,,"The flower dome is massive and we were there when they were hosting a tulip festival which was truly lovely. As expected on a bank holiday weekend, it was very very busy and almost everyone is trying to take selfies so actually getting a chance to look at some of the plants and flowers can be challenging, checking them out us definitely worth it. They have zones such as Mediterranean garden, American garden as well as lots of plants from other places in the world. The flower dome also has signs beside most plants to help you understand what each is.
It took us a few hours to get around and we still didn't see everything. We thought the entry price was steep before we entered the flower dome but after visiting, my husband and I both feel the ticket price is worth it!"
,,Beautiful garden dome (not gnome!),5.0,,We enjoyed a lovely few hours wandering around this gorgeous biome with spectacular flora and fauna.
,,A slap in the face for tourists and a waste of money,2.0,,"If you've spent $100s or even $1000s to visit Singapore, you are charged an extra 40% to visit the flower domes at Gardens by the Bay - $28 compared with $20 for locals. With that insult, you are treated to a very ordinary display of plants and flowers. Having seen 100s of plant and floral displays around the world, many of them free, this would have to be one of the least inspiring. This in spite of the inclusion of ""Tulipmania"" which features a display of tulips in April and May.
Most of the plants are common Australian garden plants and better displays are seen at garden shows such as the Melbourne Flower and Garden Show. You see even less if visiting after sunset as inadequate lighting prevents you from seeing all the detail.
The Cloud Forest dome adds little to the experience.
I'd recommend a visit to the Gardens by the Bay in the late afternoon, staying long enough to view the 7.45pm light show."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Talk about a lot of unique flowers, plants and sculptures all literally under one roof! Also a great place to get out of the weather, either hot or rainy."
,,Well thought out undercover garden complex.,4.0,,"I had inadvertently bought tickets for both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome so felt obviously compelled to visit this second attraction. I was surprised to see how many apparently local family groups were slowly walking around the little paths between the flower beds. The flora was arranged In various country/climate groups which was quite informative.

On the day I visited there seemed to be a huge interest in the Dutch KLM sponsored exhibition of tulips with the main floor of the “pavilion” decked out with beds of tulips in various stages of maturity. The local families seemed to love them. I liked the way that there were numerous security guards dotted about the place to do their best to prevent the visitors from plucking the odd flower head. I don’t think that I have seen so many amateur photographers in one place snapping close up photographs of flower heads and floral displays.

I walked quickly around the many paths, glanced quickly at the displays before heading off out to find the Supertree Grove."
,,Cool n beautiful.,4.0,,"A cool nice place to spend your time. So many types of plants and flowers.

It was Tulipmania when we visited. Rows of colourful tulips, some buds were just opening. Cherry blossoms, roses, orchids and many others.
There is a Mediterranean garden too.

After all that walking, relax and have a bite and refreshments at the garden cafe.

A great cool place surrounded with pretty blooms and trees to spend your morning or afternoon.

Entrance fee was reasonable."
,,Another dome worth visiting,4.0,,"Flower flowers everywhere. The display on April was Tulips, and they come in beautiful colours. The tulips smell great. There were lots of other flowers too that we've never seen before, yet nevertheless beautiful. Unlike the Cloud Forest, this dome is colder (so parents with young children would need to bring along the jackets). There are Mediterranean plants, as well as cactus, odd looking flowers, roses, and tonnes of tulips. Simply beautiful and amazing. I would have spent at least 2 to 3 hours enjoying the different plants and flowers if not for the children crying out that it's just too cold for them."
,,Stunning,5.0,,These Gardens were so beautiful there are two big Domes and so many different types of plants and sculptures was well worth the visit you can spend hours there and dont forget your camera
,,Wonderful array of flowers in one place,5.0,,"Singapore has made the best of its limited space and worked hard on building tourist attractions ... The flower dome is surely one of the places tourists visit when they are in singapore ...
I had gone there during the Sakura Cherry Blossom festival and it was a beautiful sight to behold ...
The variety of flowers they have from all over the world is quite impressive ..."
,,Beautiful Dome,4.0,,"many claimed its man-made garden, but i enjoyed the many different kinds of flowers displayed from all over the world. Signed up for the annual pass, it is really well worth the money!!"
,,The Tulip Festival,5.0,,"When you were inside of the flower dome, you could smell a very fragrant flower. It smells so good in the flower dome. When we went there, there was tulip festival. It was beautiful."
,,Brilliantly build.,4.0,,"Definitely a worth visit, entire dome is air conditioned. Very good collection of flowers they have inside. Tulips were really amazing with lot of varieties in it. I found this place interesting, good for photography and relaxing."
,,Flowers you don't see on the streets,5.0,,"At different times of the year, Gardens by the Bay will bring on different exhibitions of flowers on display for the public to marvel at. From now till 22 May 2016, tulips will embrace a vast area of the Flower Dome! It would have been nice to go in the morning-afternoon when you can actually capture the colourful sights of the different tulips better. I went at night but it was an equally marvellous experience as well, seeing how the display lights play an important role in highlighting the features of the flowers we don't often see during the day. There are also permanent species of flowers/plants decorating the dome and they are available all year round. Might have a hard time taking photos there because there will be many others doing the same thing as well. Amazing that the Dome is very clean, and is capable of housing many beautiful species of flora and fauna that are well-maintained and taken care of!"
,,Flower Dome,4.0,,"My family of 4 adults and 2 young kids visited the Flower Dome located 18 Marina Gardens Drive, Singapore.

The Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world as listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records. It is one of the 2 Cooled Conservatories - the other is the Cloud Forest, at Gardens by the Bay. The changing display of flowers and plants at the Flower Dome is the reason for repeated visits by Flower lovers all over the world as every visit is different and refreshing.

Visitors to the Flower Dome can spend hours browsing through the many Flower and plant exhibits at the indoor temperature of 23 to 25 degrees Celsius. The Flower Dome is an ideal place to spend the day during the current hot spell in Singapore where the daily temperature is around 35 degrees Celsius. My family enjoyed our visit to the Flower Dome and it was a day well spent."
,,The biggest greenhouse in the world,5.0,,"When you visit Garden by the Bay, there are two “must see” attractions, the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome.
The later one is not only the biggest, but probably one of the most interesting, more versatile greenhouses in the world. The same dome is housing so many different plants with so many different needs, that it’s hard to imagine, how could they provide all of them with the right environment.
We were just walking and walking adoring the divine flowers, and hardly were able to tear away ourselves from them. To visit the Flower Dome was an unforgettable experience."
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,God manifested His love for the world through flowers. Beautiful. I just love that the Flower Dome is air-conditioned. Makes for a pleasant tour.
,,Morning,5.0,,There's lots of people but pray people who smell won't be bad on your visit. The flowers are pretty same as some of the botanical gardens in other countries.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Next to the Cloud Dome. A great experience. I'm no gardener but was well impressed with it. So many types of Tulip.
,,It is a true breathtaking place!,5.0,,"It is a true breathtaking place! the atmosphere, and the flowers are so fascinating, we don't feel like leaving there. it was tulips season when I was there, those tulips are so well maintained & cute!"
,,Visit here for flower species that are rare in Singapore,4.0,,"From the moment I stepped into the building, i can feel the cold, breezy environment inside the flower dome. In here, there's a variety of flowers/plants that can't be grown in Singapore itself (they only survive in cold countries).

Great place to bring children while they can explore more nature stuffs!"
,,Tulips Tulips and Tulips,5.0,,"Awesome, Fantastic very beautifully made flower dome, Its a wonder with different plants, trees and flowers, all from different parts of the world gathered under one roof. You will be speechless."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,How do they do it? Felt so cool in there yet they had plants from all over the world all looking their best. Would have loved to be a week later when the tulips were in full bloom. So airy and felt like you were on your own but yet there were hundreds of people around a wonderful place
,,MUST VISIT !!!,5.0,,You must visit flower dome when you go to Garden by the bay. So many variety of flower over there and they keep changing every 3 or 4 month. Its so beautiful and refreshing. I love Garden by the bay.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Just to walk through and see all the different plant and trees from different area of the world. Even no gardeners would be in 7th heaven
,,Fantastic,4.0,,"The flower dome is an amazing sight, a stunning piece of architecture housing a collection of plants and flowers from around the world. The main tulip display was impressive, but to be honest the cloud dome far surpasses the flower dome."
,,amazing spot,5.0,,"Great display, easy to get to and easy to get around. Definitely worth a visit. Would be good for kids or parents. Give yourself an hour or two but no longer than that."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Definitely worth the entrance fee, a beautiful display of many different gardens from around the world with a wonderful Australian garden featured."
,,Pretty,4.0,,A very pretty place to visit. I enjoyed looking at the tulip display. If you are not into flowers than probably not worth your while. If you are then you will love this dome!
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"I visited with my husband in April, although we are not teally nature lovers. We wanted to experience everything there was to see in Singapore.
We got a ticket that covers entry into the Flower Dome and the cloud forest cost S$28 per adult.
The Flower Dome is a cooled conservatory that houses different plants and flowers from all over the world. It was a beautiful sight.
Aftet going around we just saw down by the tulips and relaxed for 30 minutes or so. Was a lovelly experience.
Nature lovers will totally enjoy this experience."
,,Awesome place for nature lovers,4.0,,This place is awesome for nature lovers. So many types of flowers. The place is very clean. You will find the description for each flower here. Very informative.
,,very pretty tulip exhibition now till may 16,5.0,,a very enjoyable time to see lot of tulips and pretty colours and so cooling and romantic to be there. great to take photos and also to see all the tulips for this period of time
,,For flower lovers,3.0,,This one is normal flower show but a large one. There was tulips show during our visit which was excellent. Recommended one for flower photographers
,,Cool Conservatory Flower Dome,5.0,,"he view is amazing greenish colourful and well maintained . The Flower doom captivated our eyes in air-conditioned controlled environment Dome with 
rare varieties of plants , flowers , shrubs
cactus, bonsai, and a lot more. After enjoying the beauty of Flower doom i headed to Cloud forest , when I just entered inside i was amazed to see a 
high water fall puring down.. its like entering into a tropical forest and a huge mountain with misty cloud ..i walked around the conservatory and 
wondered at the species
 of plants that is nurtured and protected and grown in such a cool environment. The top level can be reached by the elevator and can ve a stunning 
look at the garden in a birds eye view of the scenic garden . Mist is being produced at regular intervals with timings and we could feel that we are in a terrain mountain area. I could say Gardens by the Bay is really an amazing place to spend a whole day "
,,Eye catching flowers,5.0,,"Lots and lots of flowers all around the dome... Exiting experience. Good place to learn photography.

When we went the the am of flowers is sunflowers of all Colours and many different types of flowers all over the world.

Felt like eye festival by seeing all kinds of flowers at one place.

It's worth full place to visit in singapore.

Girls love it more.

The Thiam of flowers change from season to season.

We can take infinite number of pictures for Instagram and all other social networks to post in."
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,"If you are ""flower"" person, this is your paradise. You can smell, feel, enjoy with lots of colors, make tons of pictures and simply enjoy the place. You can easy spend 2-3 hours and still have a filling that it was not enough."
,,Beautiful and must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,I have so far never seen such a beautiful display of flowers in many countries that I visited. Must visit place for all and especially for people who love photography.
,,The tulip festival was beautiful!,5.0,,"We visited in April when they were holding ""Tulipmania"" and it was beautiful. I loved watching the families interacting almost as much as the lovely flowers and international foliage. How did they get olive trees here from Israel??? As a plus, the air conditioning was a welcome retreat from the 90 plus degree weather outside. If you visit Gardens by the Bay, definitely pay the money to do this and the Cloud Forest."
,,Wonderful Tulips and Cherry Blossoms on display,5.0,,"The smell of the Cherry Blossoms were over powering and just amazing.
The vibrant colors of the Tulips just a spectacle to admire...especially the 2 toned ones.

I enjoyed the colour contrast of purple next to bright yellow and orange and now the tulips were arrange.
Will definately come back."
,,A very cleverly engineered structure,5.0,,"This is one of our favourite places to visit every time we come to Singapore. There is always a new theme in the Flower Dome each time we come. There are many beautiful plants, trees and flowers and even fruit trees from all around the world. A must see!"
,,"Lovely flowers, a great way to cool off in the Gardens",5.0,,"You can easily spend several hours here. Be sure to bring your camera and a sweater! (I was definitely a bit chilled!) The different ""zones"" were interesting (although I do think they may want to rethink their ""Californian Garden -- we do have more than just grape vines and lemons and gardenias!). A lovely way to cool off after spending a couple of hours in the Gardens. And a fantastic display of unusual plants (the African Baobob!)."
,,A Must,5.0,,"Tulip exhibition was amazing, certainly a must see. The different displays were breath taking just couldn't stop taking photo's, so many unusual things to see, could have spend hours just walking. Who ever thought up the displays is a very very clever person."
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"What an amazing place! Not at all what I expected, I thought there was just going to be a large garden with lots of flowers and that would be it. No, it is enormous, with lots of different areas devoted to different parts of the world and different types of plants. We were there just before the opening of the tulips which were being planted, so never actually saw any flowers but this didnt matter, there were so many other things to look at. The wooden carvings which were all over the dome were just incredible!"
,,Flowers flowers and flowers,5.0,,"Everything blooming flowers inside the dome..
It's an heaven for the flower lover!
They have tulip attraction on April when we visited.
They set up the dome climate with the country of the plant come from.
The smell of blooming flower is very good.
Bring your sweater/jacket if you could not used to stay long in the cold area unless you will freezing.."
,,Wowza,4.0,,Again this is an attraction I would definitely recommend. The displays are wonderful with a huge variety of plant life and lots of unusual displays. I could have spent ages here however we were unfortunate to come on a bank holiday and were squashed in like sardines so we left before seeing it all which was shame. I would definitely not recommend to come on any bank holidays in Singapore but otherwise it's another must do.
,,Go with Loved Ones,5.0,,"Go with loved ones and take as many photos as you possibly can. Later, you will love how colorful the photos are, and how happy everyone looks. But not for those who suffer from pollen allergies!"
,,Indoor Garden,4.0,,"Variety of flowers... that is what flower garden is all about.. There are multiple sections in the garden and each section displays the flowers from those continents.
There is a cactus garden too..
Flower garden along with the cloud forest has an entry fee of S$28, which actually is on the higher side. However the place is well maintained and gives a good feeling at the end of visit."
,,A bit of Japan in the Flower Dome,4.0,,"Our family took the opportunity to visit the Flower Dome during the Sakura Festival in the later part of March 2016. The place was packed, but the lovely airconditioning somehow made the venue more pleasant. The highlight was of course the cherry blossoms which I was told were air-transported from Japan, just for the festival. There must be at least a few hundred cherry blossom trees there, all in perfect bloom. It was magical and our camaras were over-worked!

The other plants in the dome were also beautiful, but of course they paled in comparison to the cherry blossoms.

Certainly worth a visit next year."
,,Mmm boring,2.0,,"I will be back at gardens by the bay, but I won't visit flower dome next time.. The flowers were a bit boring, rather common flowers, nothing I hadn't seen before just being a normal person with no extensive flower knowledge.. Go to Cloud Forest, it's much more of an experience and a beautiful set up, seeming natural!
If you are in shortage of time if money, safe it and visit just Cloud Forest and sky walk."
,,Not many flowers and too many people,3.0,,it was really crowded when we visited and everyone was so busy taking selfies next to the plants that one couldn't really appreciate them. there weren't too many flower varieties.
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,Not as great as it was hyped to be but definitely worth a visit. You would not regret going to this place but definitely not the best of the places you could go to.
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,A great place to visit. Nice collection of exotic flowers all around the world. Requires about 3 hrs to cover.
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,"The sheer size of this conservatory is almost overwhelming! There are plants and trees from various parts of the world and the ever-changing themes for the major displays keep people coming back time and again. Coming from Australia I saw some of our native plants that I hadn't seen ""in the flesh"" at home and this was interesting. There are stunning views from the various raised areas around the conservatory and, although I haven't been there yet, the restaurant in this dome is apparently very nice. I was lucky enough to visit in March which was a quiet time crowd-wise except for the many school groups who were there. Well worth the entry fee and visit!"
,,Gorgeous gardens!! Marvelous seasonal flowers,5.0,,"Gorgeous area. Temperature is lower inside so it is very nice after walking in warm humid gardens. There are different areas with a nice variety of plants and trees.
And of course the best of it is the seasonal flowers. It was cherry blossom time and it was absolutely stunning. Given that I was not travelling to Japan it was a great opportunity.
Definitely recommended to visit the dome."
,,Love for flowers & colors,5.0,,Great variety of flowers.Very huge. Lots of walking.Good place to take some good selfies with the colorful flowers.
,,Beautiful but crowded,3.0,,It is cool and there are many varieties of plants inside. If you want to really enjoy this place do not go during weekends or holidays. It is very crowded when we went on a Saturday so could not enjoy it completely.
,,Cherry Blossom Time,4.0,,"I always enjoy visiting this Dome, along with the Cloud Dome, when I'm in Singapore. This time the theme was ""Cherry Blossom time in Japan"" and unless I get to visit Japan when the cherry trees are in bloom, it will possibly be the only display of cherry blossoms that I get to see.

It was lovely to see a lot of Japanese people, many of them elderly with younger family members assisting them, enjoying the sight of the blooms. I can imagine that it would have been a very nostalgic experience for them."
,,Cherry Blossoms in full bloom,5.0,,"My wife and I visited this place a few weeks ago, when the cherry blossoms display was taking place. It had a Japanese theme. The cool air conditioning in this dome provided relief from the hot and humid weather outside.

We were staying at Marina Bay Sands Hotel, which was only a short walk from here. From the balcony of our hotel room, we could see this Dome and the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,"We came here after visiting the Cloud Forest. Like the Cloud Forest, it was a little chilly inside which was great because Singapore is humid. We enjoyed taking plenty of pictures. It was great to walk around and see all the beautiful flowers."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"I am not an avid gardener but totally enjoyed walking around this air conditioned dome. Very well thought out, beautiful"
,,Love this place!!,5.0,,I absolutely loved this new attraction because I love plants and stuff. But the design of the building and the landscape is really fantastic. Plus the cold climate inside is quite a relief from the heat and humidity of the tropics.
,,One of the many amazing gardens on Singapore,5.0,,Such an incredible place to see. It's breath taking when you walk in all the colours smells and beauty. It's separated into the different countries and regions so you get to experience each place separately. They have tons of amazing root sculptures throughout the grounds that are stunning! Absolutely must see if you're in the area!
,,I don't understand why it is so cold.,3.0,,"I'm no flower scientist but this place confused me. Flowers from lots of lovely topical places across the globe in this massive greenhouse. But it's freezing. Totally confused. Worth a look, but the cloud forest is far better."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Well worth the price of admission if you like plants and flowers from around the world. Relaxing and peaceful walk.
,,Leisurely walk around the Flower Dome,5.0,,"The Flower Dome in the Gardens by the Bay area and opposite the Rainforest Dome is lovely to casually walk around at your own leisure. The huge Dome houses different garden sections representing different regions of the world, so it's interesting seeing the different plant life. Some were more interesting than others though.
The biggest bonus for us was, it is air-conditioned so you can escape the humidity for awhile. Good photo opportunities and plenty of resting seats, there was also a cafe inside if you felt like something to eat or drink, we didn't as we bought drinks outside the Dome once we came out. Well worth a look"
,,Absolutely gorgeous,5.0,,"This garden is full of surprises on every turn you will gasp with amazement beautiful flowers collection trees, cactus, wood sculpture. If you are a nature lover you will not want to leave this place!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,So beautiful to run from Singapore annoying humidity to these cooling heaven. Lovely autumn breeze mixed with flowers aroma all around you. Your eyes will be pampered with colors and shapes of flowers from all over the world. Romantic and inspiring for adults and Very educational for kids too
,,Go to the Botanical gardens instead,3.0,,"This is a very nice, modern dome with a lot of different plants. It is nice that is is air conditioned. However, it costs a lot and there is only a limited number of things to see here. It is far better to go to the Botanical Gardens."
,,Even better than the Rain Forest Dome,4.0,,"Very beautiful and interesting, with displays of plants from every region in the world. They regularly change the flower displays, so you can keep going back to see something different."
,,Worth the visit!,4.0,,"This place is super nice! You don't only get a break from the outside heat but also a great display of flowers, trees and plants organised by areas and countries. This place also looks very nice at night when the lights are on. I recommend this place is you like plants and nature."
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,Make sure your battery is charged and you have lots of space to take photos. Take your time as there is lots to see.
,,Get your tickets early,5.0,,We absolutely loved this and went on a very crowded day. The dome is air conditioned so its really comfortable to walk through. We bought our tickets from another provider so were able to just walk in without lining up. There were thousands of people but they monitor how many they let in and we didn't feel pushed. There is so much to see and the plants and displays are lovely. We enjoyed everything about the Dome.
,,Brilliant.,5.0,,"Not to missed,Flower displays are outstanding the whole show is well worth the visit.Always something new to see."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"A really beautiful place to visit. Lots of lovely scents and colours. Doesn't take as long to walk through as Cloud Forest, I would probably recommend visiting the Flower Dome first."
,,Wonderful Dome,3.0,,"It is very good, When we went there in the evening there was one function taking place, it was very nice."
,,Peaceful and beautiful,4.0,,"A cool relief after the hot and humid walk. Ticketing is outside and is heavily manned so unless you go at a peak time, you won't wait too long. Although not blessed with green fingers the organised beauty of the displays lets everyone appreciate what a garden could be. The highlight for me were the sculptures placed throughout the gardens."
,,great job for the sakura festival!,4.0,,"I went all the way there particularly for the sakura cherryblossom festival and it's worth the looong queue at the entrance and the extra crowded place that weekend..they did a great job with the cherry blossom tree and peach tree exhibit as well. all the colors and blooming flowers--oh so amazing..at last I could see the real sakura flowers myself, before I get to go to Japan someday :) oh this place also has variety of plants and trees as well such as cacti, baobab tree, colorful flowers of many species, etc. So this is the right place to go for you nature lovers out there.. ths dome is also air conditioned, so even if it's hot in Singapore, you can stroll conveniently around the dome admiring those pretty little flowers inside."
,,A world of biodiversity!,5.0,,"It is so wonderful and cool in here with little to no humidity - amazing for what appears to be a glass greenhouse in the middle of tropical Singapore!

There are specimens from all over the world in this neat, well-organised display, all of which are organised by country/region and the plants are all in perfect health (with the exception of the Boab Trees & Balga Trees from Australia, which are used to a hotter environment with less-filtered sunlight, but these trees are still in remarkable condition).

The Cherry Blossom display of Japan is especially beautiful and extremely popular, so be patient here and you'll get some wonderful photos!"
,,Huge flower and plant display,4.0,,Huge display of flowers and plants arranged by different themes and countries. Nice place to spend an hour or two if you like plants. There is also a cafe and little restaurant inside for a break. Recommended to do that together with the Cloud Forest as they are close by and there is a combined ticket available.
,,Well worth it for anyone. Good for couples and families.,5.0,,"Unlike anything you'll ever see. The venue, plants, flowers, and walkways are all spectacular. It's worth getting the pass for both conservatories -- the Cloud Forest is also worth seeing."
,,Beautiful but packed,4.0,,"The flower dome is huge and has a diverse range of flowers, plants and trees. Everything is displayed beautifully and if you are a nature lover/photographer, this place is great for you. The draw back is the crowds. There are so many people you are forced to move with the crowd around a set route. Feels a bit claustrophobic and difficult if you want to stop or take photos. Could have just been the day we visited to be fair. A great place and worth a visit but not as good as the cloud forest some."
,,Amazing display of flowers and plants,5.0,,"We came at the right time of the year when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom for a spectacular showing. In addition to the cherry blossoms (which was the main attraction), there were other interesting plants from around the world as well as artistic driftwood renderings. Another plus was the cool temperatures inside the dome which was a nice welcome from the heat and humidity of the day. I will post pictures of what we experienced as pictures tell more than words ever could. It does cost a little to enter, about $20 US, but well worth the amount, although the prices are reduced for a Singapore citizen or permanent resident."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Take your time and see it all. All levels. And take your camera. Everything from cactus to apple blossoms.
,,"Good, but the Other Dome is Better",4.0,,"We visited both domes at the gardens, and while this one is absolutely massive in size - it was not as good as the cloud dome. If its a warm day (and it normally is) it is a great relief from the heat, and has a number of different plants, flowers and trees from different parts of the world. We had a special exhibit with lots of orchards due to the Chinese New year celebration."
,,very nice,4.0,,"loved all of this gorgeous displays plenty to look at , not too busy but yet again very expensive to eat or drink here"
,,Can be avoided,3.0,,Not much of flowers to be seen. I had a better experience of watching so many types of flowers in Darjeeling and this was disappointing.
,,nice garden,4.0,,"a lot of collection, varieties of flowers and herbs, must see place if u love nature and flowers. very clean and well maintained."
,,Must for flowers lovers,5.0,,"If you like flowers including orchids you should visit this place. I'm sure you can enjoy so many flowers around the worlds. It's located next to the Cloud Forest and I recommend to buy a ticket for both places together. BTW, I was quite surprised that the temperature is quite low, I expected higher ambient temperature inside this dome.."
,,Great Place,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is great but not excellent like the Cloud Forest.
Yes I did enjoy the Flower Dome but it didn't have the wow of the Cloud Forest.
The variety was large but nothing that I don't see in the average Australian garden.
Except the Japanese garden with the Cherry Blossoms. (very nice)
This is still a must do but if you don't have time to do both maybe give Flower Dome a miss."
,,Lovely cherry blossom,5.0,,Beautiful range of flowers from all over the world. Lovely to see the cherry blossom in flower along with all the other gorgeous plants. Worth a visit and the money to get in to both conservatories.
,,nature..ristic...!!!,5.0,,most varied plants and flowers under one roof and beautifully managed and taken care off. Superb feeling of being so close to nature.
,,Incredible Displays of Nature's Wonders,4.0,,Be sure to include a visit to the Flower Dome as part of your visit to the Gardens By the Bay experience. The displays and variety of natural wonders is simply amazing.

,,Cherry blossoms,5.0,,"Spectacular love that the displays are seasonal and change every few weeks, eg Christmas, Chinese New Year wonderous"
,,Amazing...if we could have seen it,2.0,,"We were so excited to visit here after the amazing experience at Cloud Forest. But the first thing we are told is ""KEEP MOVING""!! With the attendants of the flower dome twirling around bright orange batons and acting like we were cattle. It was quite upsetting and really made the whole visit there unenjoyable. If they were expecting large crowds for this cherry blossom event (which I had read nothing about as I was planning my trip to Singapore for weeks now) they should have LIMITED ADMISSIONS per day OR add the cherry blossom on as an extra exhibit for an added fee. The crowd control/patrol was intimidating and took away from the beauty of this excursion. We paid $ to get in and enjoy this ""spectacular building exhibit"". So upsetting and a shame to have to write a review like this. :/"
,,Not only for flowers..,4.0,,"Although the name says its a flower dome, it has many varieties of trees from different parts of the world. I specially liked the massive cactus and succulent collection located near the entrance."
,,You have to be there!,4.0,,Leave your mobile device at home and try to enjoy mother nature pure without taking selfies with fowers. I saw on TV a documentation about building domes. Great thing / better: go to the cloud forest. Amazing!!!!
,,Out of this world,5.0,,"The gardens in this fully air conditioned exhibit are simply stunning. The first garden we came across was the Australian garden, very close to our hearts. There were gardens from many countries and it is a must see."
,,Site for those who are into gardens and flowers,3.0,,"It was part of the ticket price so I decided to visit the Flower Dome. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. It's a beautiful garden to visit, however I'm not much into horticulture and didn't appreciate it as much."
,,Cherry blossoms in flower,4.0,,"What a wonderful, colourful extrasensory overload. Cherry blossoms in flower mixed with many, many other varieties of flowers, shrubs and trees."
,,Attractive,4.0,,one would enjoy provided he is a nature lover. have sufficient time at disposal ad rain cloud and other attractions are in the campus . at least take half day for seeing all around
,,Cherry blossom first time in Singapore. ..,4.0,,Waw ! Cherry blossom is in Flower dome Singapore now ...is really amazing! If you are flower lover don't miss this chance to visit flower dome. ...cherry blossom period is until 27th March 16 only....but must go early the morning because is really packed!
,,Take a quick picture and keep moving!.,2.0,,"The so call cherry blossom.

understand that due to PH, there are a large crowd. However, we go there to relax and enjoy, not take a quick photos, rush and keep moving. It quite irritating to here the staff saying that.

We want to take a nice photos and relax.

A few imported sakura and they call it cherry blossom!!

Rather the controlling the flow of the crowd you may want to consider the no. of pple per day.

SAd."
,,ake a quick picture and keep moving!,3.0,,"I understand that due to PH, there are a large crowd. However, we go there to relax and enjoy one, not take a quick photos and keep moving. We want to take a nice photos and relax. Further more, a few imported sakura and the ticket cost 20 bucks each, isnt it too expensive?

rather the controlling the flow of the crowd you may want to consider the no. of pple per day.

SAd."
,,beautiful display of flowers from around the world,5.0,,it's incredible that so many plants from around the world are grown under a single dome - you can feel the temperate change as you wonder the labyrinth of pathways between the gardens of the world
,,Futuristic Garden.,5.0,,"As part of Gardens by the Bay, this part is free and the walk along the amazing walkway is well worth it."
,,seasonal exhibitions,4.0,,"went during the christmas season, main exhibitions were christmassy flowers with fake snow, bears, reindeers and toy soldiers. for the spring season now, they've got cherry blossoms! bring a jacket if you're sensitive to cold, as temperature in the domes are lower than outside. the waterfall dome is much colder and windier though."
,,lovely gardens and flowers,5.0,,Totally enjoyed ourselves especially the cherry blossoms from the Japanese garden. You have to see it to believe it.
,,amazing plants,5.0,,"really unique experience with thousands of different plants, flower and trees. I loved every part/floor and would recommend it to everyone."
,,Pretty as a picture,5.0,,What a spectacular place to visit. Such a diverse range of flora from all around the world. The cloud dome is equally as beautiful and most definitely worth a visit. The views are stunning and the temperature is nice and cool - a great escape from the humidity. It's suitable for all ages.
,,So refreshing from the heat!,5.0,,It cost to go i ($25 from memory) but we avoided this because we were at an event in Pollen - a bar/cafe attached to the place. Japanese blossoms are out. So refreshing to walk around and enjoy the variety away from the heat!
,,One of the best,5.0,,"One of the main conservatories at the gardens by the bay. You have to purchase the tickets but it worth the pay.
I am not much of a flower lover but the beauty of this garden completely shook me off.
It consists of thousands of various flowers and trees and in think this is a place that you must visit in singapore.
Since they have a indoor temperature system don't forget to take a jacket or a shawl as it is cold inside.
Make sure to carry a water bottle and a camera with enough memory."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Allow plenty of time. They are huge domes and the gardens outside are stunning too but we ran out of time. It's lovely and cool inside the Domes.
,,Flowers Galore,5.0,,Take a slow walk though an amazing variety of flowers shubs and trees from all over the world. The Domes are enormous with climate control that keeps the plants in wonderful condition. If you have time a must see.
,,A Cool Garden in Warm Singapore,5.0,,"An award winning indoor garden, this is a popular place for the locals to while away the weekends in a cool ambience .. The flower domes have been divided into different climatic zones like the tropics, temperate regions etc where the blooms and vegetations vary as well!"
,,Flora from around the world,4.0,,The flower dome is a closure of native flora from different nations. Depending on the time of year different flora is in bloom.
,,Beautiful display of flowers and wooden driftwood sculptures.,5.0,,Very beautiful display of flowers and the Marina Bay Sands Area. Take time to seek out and find all of the driftwood sculptures as they are amazing.
,,Flower dome,5.0,,The place that give you posetive energy You came smell fresh air Green vibe Butiful flowers Fantastic green architecture
,,Not quite Blossom,3.0,,"We may not visit the dome at the right time (20 Mar 16), was attracted due to the ""Cherry Blossom"" Season, heard that we need not to go to Japan to experience something similar.
Well, hate to say this, it is kind of disappointed, As I said, I may be too late, saw some of the flowers already started to die off.

If I didn't buy the ticket online (using mobile phone while queuing for the tickets), it will be more disappointment (cause need to spend at least 45 mins to 1 hour to purchase the entry tickets)

Tips: Go online to buy the tickets, it will save you lots of time!!

Btw, there is another queue inside the dome, to take their turn to go into a claimed to be a good spot for photo taking (heard that will take 2 hours wait).

If your aim to the dome is for the cherry blossom, in my own opinion, I wont recommend, but if you are visiting the whole dome and enjoy the setup with lots of plants and flowers, this is a great place to visit."
,,Variety of flowers,4.0,,Did not excite me much as not much of a flower person. But they have taken lots of efforts and maintain such a huge bouquet. Definitely visit is a must if you can
,,Lovely Place with Lots of Flowers,5.0,,"We can see almost all colours of Flowers, from different parts of the world. Great work done by the Flower dome team. This place is so refreshing."
,,CHERRY BLOSSOM SEASON!!!,5.0,,So thankful that Gardens by the Bay brought CHERRY BLOSSOM to flower dome! The flowers were amazing! I wish I could live in there. :D
,,Worth to visit,5.0,,"Walking around in perfect temperature in Flower Dome make you do not feel like going outdoor again. Meet variety of flowers and trees under one dome! So happened it was featuring Japan Sakura during our visit, never thought we can enjoy Sakura view in Singapore! It was a pleasant getaway from the heat!"
,,Fascinating FLora,4.0,,It was very busy- good to see the locals supporting it. Interesting to see the plants divided by geographic origin- lots of stairs

,,Meet all the world flowers under one dome.,5.0,,"amazing work ! You get variety of flowers from diverse seasons, climate,habitat, hemispheres at one place. The section of African jungles with variety of cacti and the unique trees like Baobab is wonderful. Must see and experience."
,,"Random collection of plants and trees, very few flowers",1.0,,"I don't see the point of this attraction. I walked around and got more and more confused. Was this supposed to be educational? Entertaining? I have no idea. I left without an appreciation of why anything was there. Probably the only saving grace is that the place was cool, and a nice respite from the humid, tropical heat. Other than that, don't waste your money."
,,Worth the Visit,5.0,,"We did not make the Botanical Gardens, but this was a fabulous replacement. The amount of different zones represented was well thought out and beautifully done. My 2 favorite areas were the succulents and Japanese gardens."
,,Visit a garden centre,2.0,,"Definitely not worth paying to get into. Although this place is colourful, there really isn't anything else to it. If you have visited a garden centre in Europe, then you have seen this."

,,Flowers Galore!,5.0,,"If I had seen this earlier I could have reviewed the place properly. We visited the dome when flowers were starting to bloom, we even caught the cherry blossoms for some photo op!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Unbelievable range of plants, shrubs, trees,flowers and sculptures set in imaginative/innovative displays representing countries/continents. A must see attraction."
,,Poor Brother to the Cloud Forest,2.0,,"Yes had to go in this one as well. It's clean, hot, very well laid out but frankly not worth the admission fee. There are several well maintained paths surrounding different types of garden, but nothing spectacular. Cost around $14 per person. Since it once...More"
,,OK ok,2.0,,For us it was not foth the visit there is so much else to do you could just visit the free garden but nice flowers though :)
,,Wonderfull,5.0,,"We visited here in the evening, so it was all lit up with assorted lighting, which showed the plants at their best. It was a different way of doing gardens, as one would usually visit in the day, so it had a different aspect to...More"

,,Disssapointing,3.0,,"However many worlds plant samples has been gathered, bur all clinical, lifeless. Still good exhibition but not to be compared with Kew Gardens in London"
,,Beautiful oasis,5.0,,Great place to get out of the heat for a few hours. Displays are beautiful. Spent about 2 hours walking around both domes.
,,As good as Chelsea.,5.0,,"More a vegies and edibles gardener however this flower garden is fantastic. Not a collection of every floral plant of a region but it does provide a view, by region, of a good number all very well organised and presented."
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,I spent quite a few hours here because there is just so much to see. The plants are amazing and well cared for. Great ideas of how to put some plants together in the home garden. I loved it
,,Flowers flowers everywhere,4.0,,The place is full of flowers on all sides and offers a beautiful time to roam around inside especially if you have a lovely companion. The place is kept cool and serene and it is a respite from the otherwise humid climate in Singapore.
,,Not as good as the Cloud Forest Dome,4.0,,"A must see in Singapore. We enjoyed the Flower Dome, but it is not as impressive as the Cloud Forest, which is just amazing. In the Flower Dome we loved the animal and bird carvings made of wood."
,,Flowers from around the world,5.0,,We went there on 6th march.. we were 6 pax including senior citizen... little bit hard for differently able people as we needed to walk so long.. tram is available from marina.

,,I would skip it if I had to choose,4.0,,"In Gardens by the Bay there are two conservatories. One, and more interesting, is the Cloud Forest. The flower dome contains many plants that we often see in European and American gardens. Thus, this conservatory is not so interesting as the other one. But, if you have time, it is still great place to visit."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,I actually enjoyed this dome more than the cloud forest. They have plants set out in sections representing their country of origin and the whole dome is very well presented.
,,A normal flower Garden,4.0,,the place is nice and cool. Its a big gardern worth a visit once. It took us 30 -40 minutes to cover the garden. We bought the ticket for $28 pp for both cloud forest and flower dome.
,,Beautiful experience!,4.0,,"This place has a lot to offer and you can spend quite a while in here. It is cool inside and after a hot weather outside it's pretty nice to spend some time in there.

It will pretty busy during the weekends, so be warned."

,,Many of the plants wont be a surprise to Europeans,3.0,,"The flower dome contains a lot of plants that Europeans and Americans wont find so surprising, such as the Mediterranean garden or the Californian plants. So although I enjoyed it, IMHO its not as spectacular as the cloud forest dome."
,,Wowwww you are in heaven,5.0,,"Their would be hardly any person who will say that he doesn't love flowers. The flower dome surely is a must visit spot and is surely one of the top attractions in Singapore. The flower dome is part of the gardens by the bay and showcases lovely flowers taken from many parts of the world. The flower dome is full of rare, enthralling, captivating flowers. Colourful flowers really make you feel that you are surely at the one of the greatest part of earth. I was so attracted by the sheer varieties of flowers that i was feeling very sad when i have to leave the place. But their was peace in my mind that i have visited something that will always click and refresh my wonderful memories of visiting Singapore. IF YOU ARE IN SINGAPORE THAN NEVER GIVE IT A MISS."
,,Superb collection of exotic flowers and plants,4.0,,Superb collection of exotic flowers and plants. Great carvings in wood. Look out for the wooden dragon
,,Plants from around the world,5.0,,"I was pleasantly surprised by this attraction. It is simply amazing the amount of effort and constant care that would be needed to maintain all these beautiful flowers, trees and shrubs from around the world. Temperature controlled it is a welcome relief from the humidity of Singapore. We did the flower dome, the. Cloud forest then gardens by the bay. We started quite late in the afternoon so rushed a little but still fantastic. I recommend starting around 1 or 2pm and staying for firs gardens show."
,,Remarkable gardens and art projects,4.0,,"This dome is next to the rainforest eco dome, you can buy tickets for both domes. When visiting one dome, I really recommend doing the other one as well. The flower exhibitions inside are absolutely stunning. They have tried to make it real works of art."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Loved the flowers and way the gardens layout, beautiful wood carvings throughout the place, nice on a hot day."
,,Just flowers... no information,3.0,,"I visited this place after my business hours. It was almost 7 pm when i reached. The place closes down at 9 pm. Since, I did not have any time I decided to visit the closed areas - Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. It costs 20$ for one exhibit and 28$ for two... for foreigners. I got a two exhibit ticket and decided to visit the Cloud Forest first. It turned to be the right decision.

The entry to exhibits close at 8.30 pm. So when I walked over to the Flower Dome they had closed the entry. I requested them saying it was my last day in Singapore and they allowed me to enter. I had only 30 minutes before it closed at 9pm.

The place is huge... but no info boards. A disappointment after the wonderful Cloud Forest. Once you exit the flower area, in the pathway to the exit gate, on the right side there are displays on the adaption strategies of plants. Those were the only impressive stuff. Dont forget to view them one by one.

At 9 pm, I exited the Flower Dome and into the souvenir shop. However, the staff was only interested in closing the shop and were ushering all visitors straight to the exit door. So I came away with no souvenir from this visit.

This is a must visit place if in Singapore.Also, budget a full day at this place. It should be wonderful during the sun light hours."
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,Go far it - if you do the Gardens by the Bay - the Cloud Forest - go of the Flower Dome. Really enjoyed walking through - the sites and smells were really nice.
,,In another World,5.0,,"We knew there was a ""mist"" show. So we waited half an hour for it. Amazing experience. The waterfall is a pleasure to see. I could view it all day! Good escape for a hot day."
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,"In this garden you'll see lot of strange, beautiful, alien flowers, trees and other kind of plants. Though there are a lot of people you won't fell crowded. There wooden statues made of sticks? Those are really marvelous! For tourists the ticket is valid both to Cloud Forest (the other glass dome) and here so don't miss it."
,,An absolute must!,5.0,,"If you are considering the a visit to the flower dome, do it!
The dome itself is an incredible piece of architecture but the variety of plants all growing in harmony under one roof is nothing short of amazing.
It seems that the flower dome is closed most Monday's for maintenance so do check before you go.
The audio tour was easy to use and informative about the entire project not just the plants. It was a shame that it was so difficult to access though as you can't purchase the audio kit from the ticket office, you have to queue again at the visitors centre and if you want to pay by card, you have to go and queue at the ticket office again to pay, which seemed unnecessary."
,,Nature lovers Dream,4.0,,"Flower Dome: It’s beautiful and there is an amazing variety of flowers you can see. Photographers delight! There are specials ongoing depending on the time of the year. We were greeted with the Dahlia festival with a huge variety of this flower. Also the dome was decorated for the Chinese New Year. Be sure to cover the entire area including the Cactus section on the upper deck of the dome. All in all, if you love flowers, you can see God’s magnificent artistry in every bud and blossom."
,,Home from home,5.0,,So many flowers to see that grow at home in the UK plus many more from around the world. Wear a cardigan because the air in the passage leading into the dome is freezing and it feels pretty cool inside too. For locals it must feel like the attic!! Gorgeous colourful plants everywhere you look. The wood carvings are amazing too.
,,Worth visit,5.0,,Just as good as the Cloud forest. Flowers & trees / [plants from all across the world make it a very attractive and overall makes it very colourful. Pleasant to eyes.
,,Difficult choice to make if only doing one and not two - the other being the Cloud forest,5.0,,"Due to limited time, we could not do the Cloud Forest as well as the Flower Dome - better price for both.

Cost for adult is 28 SGD per person.
You can go out and return by having your hand stamped.
It is amazing the gardens are so well maintained that you might think that every flower is just inthe blossom period.
The garden is well arranged and it is airconditioned. For someone coming from the outside heat and humidity dont forget to take with you an extra long sleeve shirt.
It worth the visit.
You can switch between the rain forest and the flower dome as much as you want."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This attraction is well worth the visit the trees and flowers are just beautiful from all around the world don't miss it
,,Perfect when it rains!,4.0,,Walking round this dome environment when it rains it is possible to enjoy these amazing gardens without getting wet at all.

,,Full of Monkeys! lol,4.0,,"In preparation for the Chinese New Year, the flower dome had flower and man made monkeys of all sorts which added an element of flimsy to the garden. I didn't find the overall experience as awesome as the rain forest dome next door, but you get in on the same ticket and - not to dismiss - there is a clean and large restroom hidden away in the background."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"What an amazing array of plants from all over the world. So beautiful, and interesting to find out where many plants I was familiar with actually originated from"
,,Amazing place !! Beautiful !! Heaven !!,5.0,,"It is one of the best nature places must visit for those who love nature, gardening, etc. When I was there, I felt like I was in Heaven !!

Lots of walking will be there. Also don't forget to carry your camera! you can get loads of pictures done if you are fan of photos!!"
,,A must see for Flowers Lovers,4.0,,"I visited both Flower Dome & Cloud Forest on the same day.

Flower Dome is beautiful in a different way, it is not as spectacular as Cloud Dome, but it is a heaven for flowers lovers. Too many flowers I can not remember the names now, but they are so beautiful. I stayed 30 minutes inside taking photos (please see my photo attachment)."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Do go and see this epic attraction, it's the only greenhouse with no central structures in the world, a set of gardens laid out in different types of garden, like dry or wet etc"
,,Little bit disappointed with this part of the Gardens by the Bay,3.0,,Each place you go in Gardens by the Bay you have to pay for tickets.I was somewhat disappointed with this part of the gardens.Not really allot to see and not all that interesting.I guess because most of the plants are in Australia where I come from so there wasn't anything too unusual to see.Very crowded too
,,The best place for lovers of flowers,5.0,,All the flower arrangement that is in place is very beautiful. colors and shapes of flowers and other plants are very pleasant to the eye. Here we can see all types of flowers and plants from almost all over the world
,,Clever!,5.0,,"My opinion is a bit small, if the dome is larger, with bigger room to walk, should be an appropriate walking visit for me. What i like about is their constant renewal of exibit themes according to the seasons and festivities. After all it worthwhile to visit this garden."
,,beautiful !,5.0,,this place offers a seriously huge range of flowers and all are veryyyy beautiful. definitely worth visiting !
,,No a flowery guy,4.0,,"Can't say I'm a huge flower or plant kinda guy but I got this ticket with my Cloud Forest one so decided to make the most of it - and glad I did.
Everything is well maintained and displayed, easy to spend a long time walking around.
My only complaint is the layout isn't very easy to follow and it's hard to tell if you've missed areas or not."
,,Better to go in the Cloud Forest,3.0,,"We had a choice of this venue or cloud forest as each one has a separate entry fee or you can get a cheaper deal by getting both tickets, we elected to go in the flower dome and whilst it was nice it was not much more interesting than walking around my local garden centre and that's free, after about 5 minuets my interest went as whilst its nice to look at different plants it can get a bit boring, the cactus section livened it up a bit though, I think looking at the Cloud Forest I think with hindsight this might have been better as it has a waterfall"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is an immaculate set of gardens with various botanical displays indigenous to different parts of the world. It can take at least a couple of hours to walk through the entire display. Well worth the priced of admission, especially if you are a nature lover."
,,Spring in Flower Dome,5.0,,"Indigenous n exotic flowers from all over the world filled the flower dome with the atmosphere, scent n joy brought about by Spring. Match so well with the state of the art green house architecture. As someone who love nature n landscape (both urban n rural, built n natural), I would say the greenhouse is an unique exhibit of nature n man's effort in bringing peace n joy to patrons."
,,Cloud Forest'poor relative,3.0,,We visited this dome first and were underwhelmed. The building itself is impressive and the sculptures are good. However we found the floral/plant exhibits a bit boring. I'm glad we visited this before visiting Cloud Forest because that was the highlight of the two conservatories.
,,Mesmerizing world of colorful flowers!,4.0,,"Ever imagined getting lost into the ocean of colorful flowers? If you did, then come into the ‘Flower Dome’ and see your imagination comes alive. The place is full of thousands of variety of flowers from all corners of the globe. It’s a great opportunity to experience of beauty of flowers all over the world sitting at the one place. I been there in the earlier of this month and it was overall a fantastic experience! Made my mind calm, relaxed and soothed.

Would surely suggest to visit this place if you are in Singapore."
,,Great but do go during the day,5.0,,"A very good indoor garden full of flowers and succulents. However, we only had time to go at dusk and although still good it would have looked much better in full daylight. Also a remarkable architectural structure, as is the cloud dome."
,,Photogenic gardens,5.0,,"All the plants here are wonderfully curated and maintained. You can take a picture anywhere! The temperature is cooled down, so you can go here even at the hottest times of the day. The smells of the trees, plants, and leaves are wonderful.

Try going up the desert area and see wonderful vistas of the whole dome. I suggest to do this one before Cloud Forest though, as this is the ""teaser"" to the more amazing Cloud Forest. Highly recommended."
,,Complete Collection of Flowers,5.0,,"This probably the best indoor garden i've ever seen, and also probably, the best in the world. They have collections from Mediterranian to Asian. All the flowers here are air conditioned and well maintained.

Admission fee is 28 SGD combined with Cloud Forest. To get there, you can either take downtown line or circle line MRT to Bayfront and then take a 10 minutes walk to Garden by the Bay."
,,Highlight of Conference,5.0,,This was the venue for the official Conference Dinner. The dinner itself was well and truly outdone by the venue which just had so much to offer for anyone who appreciates horticulture.
,,Beautiful flowers.,4.0,,"I went there during when it was showcasing chrysanthemum. The flowers there smelt nice and the view was beautiful. However there are some rotting flowers though. But still, it's a great choice to visit the flower dome."
,,Not particularly impressed,3.0,,"Came here after Cloud forest dome and was not as impressed with this dome. Was told by my parents who came here months ago that it was quite nice but this time round, my wife and I didn't think much of it. Flowers were okay but not as impressive as we thought. Nice escape from outside heat and as part of combo with Cloud forest, would be worth it. However, would recommend Botanical garden instead."
,,Interesting plants,4.0,,"Beautiful place! The Flower Dome is the world’s largest column-less greenhouse and houses a few thousand species of plants. I spotted some species from New Zealand and South Africa! It was pretty amazing. There was a spread of cactus plants that we’ve never seen before in Singapore and flowers were blooming at their best because there was no wind or storm to hurt them. I have to say that I had expected great things from the dome, but I didn’t expect to feel like I was walking around in cool spring weather in New Zealand, admiring flowers.All in all an enjoyable experience only slightly affected by the lack of affordable snacks or drinks in the area."
,,Great Chinese garden display,3.0,,"An array of international flora. The dome is divided up into different gardens; Californian, Mediterranean and chinese for example.

It's not clearly signposted when you get in, but it's small enough to figure out.

The Chinese garden was impressive.

The dome is chilly to cold.

Good rainy day activity."
,,Splendid...,4.0,,"Flower Dome and Cloud Forest can be seen together. The display and the arrangements are great - great colours, arrangements - good place to have a few brilliant pictures :-)"
,,Average,3.0,,Half of the flower dome consists of cactusses. Not really much flowers. Were there inside for just a couple of minutes.
,,See with Cloud Forest,5.0,,"You can do both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome in three hours and there is a combination ticket for S$28 per person. I found the exhibition was more about trees and cacti than flowers but there certainly are plenty of spectacular flowers. I thought the restaurant was incredibly pricey, as in S$14 for a can of Tiger you can buy anywhere for $5. We went in, saw the menu, and walked out."
,,Currently displaying a Chinese New Year display,5.0,,Any time of year is good for a visit to the flower done but currently the display reflect the Chinese New Year. The display is very colourful reflecting the year of the monkey
,,Flower is heart,5.0,,I Love the flowers and the temperature. It’s too cold inside the dome. We enjoy the Christmas theme with so many different kind of flowers.
,,Interesting place to see flowers and trees,4.0,,"Though it is a artificial place to display various kind of flowers and trees of different continents, it is worth to visit especially it is so hot outside. The most I like is the old old trees. They are so eye-catching. Also, I do appreciate their efforts to keep all those plants so fresh and so natural. Not a easy job."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This was excellent, so many different plants and flowers from all around the world. Certainly worth the visit."
,,Beautifully designed,5.0,,This is the perfect place for flowers lover! It was awesome! Although I'm a bit confused with the route. The ticket for this conservation is bundled with Cloud Forest
,,great seasonal exhibits!,5.0,,"the flower dome changes part of the exhibit through out the year - so there is always something new to see - beside the large permanent collection of flowers and plants form all over the world.
the annual pass is a great way for locals to go several times are year to experience the changes."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The array of different kinds of flowers was very interesting. There was a huge influence of Chinese New Year, s it was within the next 3 weeks. I did not feel that this was as nice as the National Orchid Garden."
,,So pretty,5.0,,"I was lucky enough to just be there with the Chinese New Year decoration it was so beautiful. They have a great variety of flowers and plants, it was awesome."
,,Interesting selection of plants and trees,4.0,,"The dome contains a wide and varied selection of plants and trees from across the world and garden sections representing each. Our favourites were Baobabs, but they also had very old olive trees and some amazing wooden creations."
,,the best flower showing dome!!!,5.0,,ideal for nature lovers as u get to see flowers from all around the world.never seen such a wide range of flower collection under one roof.
,,Amazing Collection of Plants,5.0,,This is a Garden created inside an AC doom. Has a amazing collection of plants from all over the world. Especially liked the huge variety of Cactus and the Olive and orange trees. A must see for all tourist.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,We visited the Flower Dome during Chinese New Year and were lucky enough to see the beautiful Chinese Horoscope flower display. The Dome has lots of beautiful flowers and plants from around the world in one easy venue.
,,Do it before the Cloud forest,3.0,,"Read my review for Cloud Forest. You cannot buy separate tickets for those two. The Flower Dome is almost boring, specially for Europeans. You see plants you have at home. It is nicely decorated, but just walk through it to the Cloud Forest."
,,Flower Dome Singapore,5.0,,The cost is $28.00 for both domes and worth every penny the way it has been put together is amazing and you will not be disappointed even is you are not a plant lover like me
,,"Beautiful, informative, creative",4.0,,Definitely pleasant and relaxing to have having so much flora around you. It is nicely designed and laid out to showcase all varieties of plants.
,,A must place in Gardens By the Bay,5.0,,"Firstly I want to tell you that Flower dome is a Part of Gardens By the Bay where you can see the very distinct species of Flowers & Plants which you have not seen anywhere else & the scent of the flowers is so amazing that can take away your senses.........
It has Nine different types of Gardens some of them which I Remember are as:-
Australian Garden, Californian Garden, Succulent Garden etc. which houses 30,000 plants from over 150 species......"
,,Could spend an entire day here!,5.0,,"Escape the hustle and bustle of the city here. Air conditioned and very easy on the eyes, you can wander all day in this beautiful garden. Would be a lovely place also to organise a wedding as they have a banquet hall as well."
,,Varied zones,5.0,,Quite how mature olives and boats were transported here is a mystery. This garden within a garden is superb. The Chinese New Year decorations were a bonus.
,,Not a flower kind of person,3.0,,"Got a ticket to the flower dome as it was cheaper to buy 2 domes at once. Was really excited to go inside the flower domes at first but it wasn't as expected. However, we absolutely loved the wood sculptures inside the flower dome. But that was all we liked from the flower dome.

I wouldn't recommend it to someone who, like me, aren't really interested in flowers. We brief through the dome and it took only about 30mins for us to complete the place."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Not the type of tour, that I normally add to my itinerary, but had a free morning, and decided to take a try.
I m lucky that I had my camera, coz if not, I should had to return later that day, coz was impressed with the beauty"
,,Full of colour,4.0,,Situated within the Gardens by the Bay the Flower dome is great for people who love flowers of all descriptions. Full of colour.
,,Spectacular Chinese New Year display,5.0,,We almost had the place to ourselves as an adjunct to visiting Pollen restaurant. Wonderful planting in a spectacular piece of engineering. Added to which lots of Chinese New Year related adornments added interest. Loads of monkeys!!
,,Worth Going Inside,5.0,,"The flower domes beauty cannot be captured in photos. This is a must see for those who know their flower (myself) and for others who are interested in seeing some pretty colours and arrangements. We were lucky enough to visit around the Chinese New Year so the place was decked out in celebratory decorations and plenty of red!! But the dome is arranged nicely to walk along through the differing climatic flowers and native for different countries. If you are visiting the Gardens by the Bay, why not see this dome also, highly recommended."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Enjoyed the visit to flower dome, temperature was pleasant, flowers were interesting and some different ones to what I have seen before. If I was pushed for time, I would stick with the cloud forest mountain dome, this is most likely personal taste."
,,"An amazing collection of flowers, trees and plants",5.0,,Im not too excited about flowers but flower dome even got me hyped! Its an amazing collection from all over the world that is presented in a really beautiful way. A must-see in Singapore!
,,Stunning international displays,4.0,,Wonderful displays of various types of gardens from around the world. Very busy on weekends and holidays so try and go mid-week to avoid the bigger crowds/getting whacked by a selfie stick...
,,Fantastic attraction,5.0,,We combined the flower dome with the cloud dome. You can visit both easily in a day. Well worth the effort to go there. The outdoor gardens are really great also.
,,Nice place,3.0,,"So much flowers to see, enjoy different seasonal pants every few months. The singapore government put a lot effort here"
,,Architecture,5.0,,"This place looks pretty nice from outside. Kudos to its Architecture. IF you love flowers you can visit and since u visit you have to purchase two tickets. one for the other dome as well, which has waterfall and different level! People do enjoy it."
,,Family outings during the Chinese New Year,5.0,,"Within Garden by the Bay,one of must visit place in Singapore. Display flowers and plants from different parts of the world. Very educational and nice place for both young and old, family members, business associates...
The Dome is fully air con so very good for hot country like Singapore."
,,Expensive and not THAT impressive...,3.0,,"The Flower Dome is fine but expensive for what is there. If you're on a budget, I recommend skipping it and just walking around the free parts of Gardens by the Bay - especially the SuperTree Groves!"
,,Mindblowingly beautiful and romantic,5.0,,crazy!!!! - I just cant get over how big and beautiful this place is groomed perfectly - aircon is cold so bring a jumper. wear good walking shoes. costs $28 to get into both domes - so worth it! Allow 2 hours per dome. excellent
,,Go to Cloud Forest first!,3.0,,"Flower Dome is lovely, and we were lucky to see it presented with the Chinese New Year displays, but it is just a nice garden. No wow factor.
Do the Cloud Forest first, which is much more impressive, then the Super Tree Grove, and make Flower Dome the lesser priority."
,,The world of flowers in one place,5.0,,"We visited in January, just before the Chinese New Year. There was a huge display commemorating this festivity along with all the regular plants from different regions of the world. The displays are extremely well-kept, well documented and just stiunning. Take a jacket and maybe long pants as some might find it too cold in there. It's definitely worth the time + money spent."
,,A neatly presented and laid out garden but...,3.0,,...no wow factors at all..nothing to write home about..just an average large garden..not quite impressed..
,,wonderful gardan,5.0,,wonderful plants from around the world. combined with the cloud in the sky is a must see under cover
,,A Visual Feast,4.0,,"Though I am not really a big 'fan' of botanics, one does not need to be one to appreciate the splendor of nature housed in one dome. The ticket price might be a wee bit expensive, but the experience of being in this dome is, for me, worth it."
,,Freezing!,5.0,,"Great place to take pictures wven if you're not much a fan of flowers. Place is literally filled with different kinds of flowers with different colors, shapes and sizes. Bring a jacket! It's very cold inside the dome. There's lots of sitting areas and you can stay longer if you like. There's also toilet inside the dome and drinking fountains! Great place for dates and relaxation."
,,Great selection of exotic flowers.,5.0,,We went here over the Chinese New Year and it was just amazing the flower were just incredible. The selection in bloom in February for some who lives in the uk is just incredible. The whole set is in very enjoyable and very peaceful. And a good part of the gardens on the bay trip although it's is extra and not free.
,,So much to learn,5.0,,"There are so many species of plants and flowers to see! Its like a one stop view of plants from all different continents in the world, right in one place."
,,Nice if you really really like flowers,2.0,,We only went because we could not buy a separate ticket just for the Cloud Forest. We stayed for about 10 minutes just because we felt bad for the money we payed. It looks like a flower market so nothing special. I guess it could be nice if you really really like flowers. Plus it was freezing cold.
,,ANOTHER AMAZING PLACE TO VISIT,5.0,,"The flower dome is excellent. So much fun to walk around, you can even have a meal there. It was very enjoyable and relaxing at the same time. We spent about an hour at this dome."
,,"Nice and cool inside, but not as fantastic as Cloud Forest",4.0,,"Our Garden by the Bay admission included the Flower Dome as well as the Cloud Forest. Of the two, if you HAVE to pick, go to the Cloud Forest. Flower Dome was nice, but it really is more about trees, cacti and some flowering shrubs than really about flowers."
,,Varieties of flowers,5.0,,"Amazing flowers with so many species and colours of various flowers. If you are a flower / garden lover, don't miss it"
,,Nice and cool place... Not to say cold,4.0,,Very nice venue to visit. Rather chilly inside. Lots of nice flowers from different places in the world. I personnaly prefer the cloud forest dome
,,Add it to the list,5.0,,The flower dome is next to the cloud forest and is a really cool attraction. Beautiful botanical experience on multiple levels with creative art infused into a breathtaking canvas of colours. Strongly recommend.
,,Unique plants,4.0,,"Spectacular and innovative, it is the largest glass greenhouse in the world as listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records! Be amazed by changing display of flowers and plants."
,,nice,5.0,,this was a very peaceful and tranquil place and if you like botany or just gardening its a must visit very cheap tickets
,,Outstandingly Beautiful,5.0,,"This is an enormous greenhouse dome with beautiful orchids and thousands of plant species, rare and exotic trees from many continents, and succulent plants as well. It and the Cloud forest dome are well worth seeing at Gardens by the Bay."
,,Very beautiful,4.0,,"The roof is just amazing ,no matter how beautiful the cactus or baobab are ,how surprising are the 1000 year old olive trees ,the structure needs to be looked attentively .The trees can be seen elsewhere ,some are more interesting others less,very nice was the area full of flowers ,but the all ambiance is stunning ."
,,Huge trees and plants from all over the world.,5.0,,"We would have been more impressed if we hadn't gone to the Cloud Forest first, so this was a it of an anti climax, do it the other way round!
The gardens were laid out in countries, so there was an Australian garden, a Mexican garden for example. We were amazed at the size of some of the trees there! Lovely wood sculptures are around every bend. Sit down in each garden area and enjoy the scene, don't rush."
,,Over rated.,2.0,,Not much flowers even the name is Flower Dome (they might blame the season). The showcase is more to highlight trees and plants of the world (kinda of). Everything looks plain with no character. Well you can spend some time here if you have nothing much to do.
,,A world within,4.0,,"This highlight features flora exhibits from various parts in the world. As an attraction, it is amazingly attractive, especially during the Christmas season."
,,Feels like in the Mediterranean!,4.0,,"A mild, dry climate and features plants found in the Mediterranean and other semi-arid tropical regions. As a nature lover, we went there after the visit from Cloud Forest; and this place doesn't disappoints. It was good!."
,,A sensory delight,5.0,,"Please read my review for Gardens by the Sea for a more in depth talk about this venue.

Filled with plantlife of all descriptions, this venue's olifactory & visual influence affects your senses as soon as you enter. With many examples of plantlife from around the world guests are treated to many plants they might never have experienced otherwise. Multitudes of paths allow guests to walk amongst many different plant areas, with a major themed area situated on the bottom floor.

Highly recommended."
,,"Blaze of Colour, Simply Awesome",4.0,,"Love to sit and see the mother nature. Flowers are everywhere, you can sit and have mind satisfaction. Its a paradise for flower lovers, with lot of photograph opportunities, simply love this place."
,,Amazing Garden,5.0,,The Indoor Garden is a great site for nature and garden lovers.The flowering plants in the closed environment are a treat to behold.May afford half a day's treat for those nature lovers
,,A great place to visit,5.0,,This huge dome is full of trees and plants from around the world. Temperature controlled so cooler than outside. Special decorations to celebrate Chinese New Year of the monkey.
,,Flower Power,5.0,,"Impressive display. Chinese New Near symbolism made the experience extra enjoyable. The dahlia display was incredible, the largest flower heads I have ever seen."
,,A Little Bit of World Nature in the Heart of Singapore,5.0,,"The flower dome is divided into different sections representing the flora from a variety of global locations and is an easy stroll around in the climate controlled interior to enjoy the various plants.
We visited at a reasonably quiet time, early afternoon mid-week and were able to avoid much of the crowd.
A little bit of nature in the heart of the hustle and bustle and yet another place to get away and relax."
,,Lovely and interesting flowers and plants,5.0,,"It was nice how this was divided up by regions and learning more about flowers and plants from all around the world. It is amazing that they were able to bring in so many different big trees from around the world.

Also a nice way to escape the heat, buy the combi ticket so you can enjoy both domes."
,,Decent flower gardens,4.0,,These are decent flower gardens although it is quite crowded here. When we went there was a lunar new year theme
,,A must,5.0,,"Fantastic,hudge,you will walk all day,bring good shoes,great impressive flower collection,a must for flower and garden le vers,everyone will enjoy."
,,Impressive wooden carvings (and flowers),5.0,,"This would be my pick of the two conservatories if you could only do one. Lots of great flowers and everything is so well maintained. The highlight for me was actually the wooden animal carvings that don't get mentioned too much (unless I missed it). There is a giant dragon, eagle, horses, monkeys, goats etc. All very impressive."
,,The year of the monkey statues are amazing!,5.0,,Another trip to the flower dome for us as this is another fantastic place for plant lovers...great photo opportunities and a nice leisurely walk amongst well set out gardens!
,,Colourful park,4.0,,With many kind of flower and plant this dome is beautiful. This refrigerated dome make you enjoy and happy. Colourful flower and good lanscape desain make this place must be visit
,,Christmas in Singapore at the Flower Dome,4.0,,I was there the first week in January and all the Christmas displays were still up and there were poinsettias everywhere. Just beautiful. It was my second time there and it's just a lovely walk through a perfectly manicured/well kept slice of nature...under a dome.
,,"Every Climate Under the Sun, Under One Roof.",5.0,,"A must see while in this fabulous city. So many plants from all over the world, some weird and wonderful specimens. The plants are all grouped in climates or countries which makes it easy to understand and wander around. Everything was wheelchair accessible with ramps."
,,Take Your Time and Appreciate,5.0,,"Must allow yourself at least a couple of hours and make sure you pack something warm. Its a bit cold both in here after being outside all day in 30deg heat. Also make sure you go in plenty of time before sunset as it gets a bit dark and you cant really see much. If you like what nature can give you, this place is a must do!"
,,Amazing Garden,4.0,,"Imagine Flower Dome as the world's garden where you can find all beautiful flower around the world, it definitely was an amazing experience and exquisite view"
,,Another gem for plant lovers,5.0,,"Similar to the other dome there is plenty to keep the average visitor interested. Cool, lush and verdant so take your amble through seriously."
,,A place to Go,5.0,,"Amazing , serene, fun, interesting . A great place to visit and admire many many plants from around the world. The sculptures are truly fascinating. The only downside would be the cost of food/drinks at the internal restaurant. Always the same temperature so you may need to take a wrap/cardigan."
,,Extraordinary and stunning,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is within 'Gardens By The Bay'. It is a relaxing and cool place to visit displaying plants suited to cool-dry climates. The dome replicates Mediterranean style weather conditions but has displays of plants from varied temperature zones. There are cacti, olive trees, Australian natives, living stone gardens, pine forest trees; to name a few. It is easy to spend the good part of the day in this dome as there is a lot to see. The sculptors and wood carvings are incredible works of art, the plant displays are simply beautiful, the architecture is unique and unusual. Don't miss this attraction!"
,,Beauty,4.0,,"If you need or want to relax, this is one of the best places to do it, its air conditioned, and you can seat or walk around the dome."

,,"relaxing, cool and beautiful place",5.0,,"We really enjoyed a cooling and leisurely stroll through the Flower Dome and immerse in a world of perpetual spring. The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like South Africa, California and parts of Spain and Italy. Here, you'll discover not only the amazing beauty of these plants and flowers, but how they have also adapted to the cool-dry environments. This is within the Gardens by the Bay and it is a very relaxing, cool and beautiful place, Easy to lose a day here .If you like plants, flowers , architecture, or striking views or remarkable buildings or unusual layout of parks then this is the place for you It is a must when in Singapore. By sharing your experiences, you're helping travelers make better choices and plan their dream trips. Thank you!"
,,Beautiful flowery dome,3.0,,"Flower dome is beautiful, nice, with cool air con but actually I'm expecting more to be seen. It is just a nice with big effort to bring us the flower park and thematic decoration into cool indoor dome."
,,Nice,4.0,,"be prepared for the big temperature shock when you entering the buildings, I was sick for about 1 week after visiting the domes"
,,Tourists beware,2.0,,"Very disappointed, not for keen garden visitors. Plant labelling very poor.
Many plants were inaccurate......Mediterranean garden full of Foxgloves!!
Their were no staff/gardeners around to ask anything, just a few kids on their mobiles who knew nothing about plants.
Very expensive, $28 with Mist Mountain plus $3 for bus to Domes then extra for the bus around the gardens. 30 mins was enough for me, a keen gardener! The gardens outside were very pleasant and free! The Botanical Garden is very, very much better and free."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"My 5 year old daugther loves flowers- it's a treat for her when she gets a bouquet of flowers from us so we knew we had to bring her to the flower dome. She absolutely loved it but it was hard to always stop her from touching & picking them! :)

It was also great that it's air-conditioned, so you get to cool off after all the walks around the gardens."
,,Lovely flower gardens,5.0,,"The garden showcases Flowers, shrubs and trees from around the world very interesting if you love nature."
,,Great scenery,5.0,,The flowers and trees from all over the world was awesome. It was a nice relaxing walk around the place and a means of staying away from the heat. Worth the money spent.
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"In most places, when you visit this sort of place, the glass is there to let the sunshine in and help HEAT the place. Here, the dome is cooled. Says something about the climate of Singapore. I wanted to see the baobabs, for personal reasons, and they are quite impressive. But it's the sheer size of this largest conservatory in the world is impressive, and the amount of plants on display and the number of biotopes showcased is impressive. If you live in Singapore, this is the perfect getaway to a cool, tranquil place to read, or spend time on a date. If you're a visitor, this is the place to unwind from the crazy hustle and bustle that is a south-east Asian metropolis, let your soul dangle for a bit. I'll be back!"
,,A fascinating and surprisingly varied visit,5.0,,"With the new Chinese New Year imminent, the extra displays were very interesting and informative. There are lovely sculptures, varied plant areas and lots more to look at. It is well worth an hour or more to visit with the rest of the Gardens"
,,A must for gardeners,5.0,,This can be enjoyed by all the family all ages.Book on line before you go to save you time when you get there.It was near Christmas when we went a must if you have children
,,Orchid Flower was on Display,4.0,,Never seen these many species of Orchid and the sculptures and gardens on the theme of 50th Anniversary was worth visiting.
,,Loved it,5.0,,A lovely respite from the heat. Themed by geography. Great aussie gardens & stunning Mediterranean gardens to name a few. The olive trees were amazing. Please give the camellias some attention - not well. Everything else was perfect!
,,Must go,5.0,,"It's right next to cloud dome no reason not to go there too. Beautiful scenery, at the moment it's got the Chinese New Year decorations so it's getting very festive around there"
,,Lovely place with lovely flowers,5.0,,"If you're into flowers or someone who loves/appreciates flowers, this is the place to be. Not to be missed on your next SG vacay. Have been there twice (diff themes) and I loved the experience."
,,Breath taking,5.0,,A wonderful space to visit with plants from round the world displayed. The baobab trees are huge. The sculptures in wood and stone add another level of interest. The temperature is cool so it's a very comfortable space to walk round.
,,nothing special,1.0,,flowers are even not really plant in the ground. Still in the boxes. Did not catch me... Boring and nothing special
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"Even if you are not really interested in the huge number of unusual trees and plants, there are some amazing sculptures that blend into the scene wonderfully. Well worth a visit. It's a controlled environment so on a hot or rainy day you can stay cool and enjoy."
,,Florist Haven,4.0,,"Pros :
+ Its still awesome even for the 2nd visit
+ the central area are often themed changed, so for your next visit, might have different photo session
+ plenty of awesome photo location
+ easy access for stroller / wheelchair.

Cons :
+ a bit pricey compared to other ""typical"" gardens, then again the maintainance and construction cost of this venue is probably very high too"
,,Loveable park !,4.0,,"I love it, I love it, I love it. This place is a little piece of flower heaven. There are few categories of parks in this place named by continent or regions like australia, afrika, america. In each of its categories you mau find typical flower and plants from the origine of the plant ( according to the name). interesting! I am amazed by the cactus park, incredible. It bring the sense of visiting desert.
At the main hall of this place you may also find thematic park according to the current seasons. Since I waa here during the end year surely a christmas and winter thematic presented and its incredibly beautiful. I love it"
,,Worth investing in,5.0,,This was a very wonderful attraction. It was January when I went. They still had a couple decorations from Christmas as well as prep for the Chinese New Year. This is defiantly a place to visit.
,,Skip this if you have seen Perth/Australia/Africa,3.0,,"Other than the views outside, there is nothing much to shout about in this dome other than the interesting wooden sculptures (fish and eagles and african totems). Visit only if there is a themed exhibition you especially want to see. Spend your time at the Cloud dome instead."
,,Singapore doesn't disappoint!,5.0,,"Everything in Singapore is fantastic and the Flower Dome was no exception. We visited in Christmas time so the gardens were all decked out in Christmas decorations and look even more spectacular. Even though it was peak season, you didn't feel overcrowded and were still able to take great photos without people getting in the way. Although it is not located in central Singapore, it is definitely worth coming out for a visit, a great tourist attraction."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,We were glad we had the time to look around this dome. The variety of plants and being later out in different types eg South African etc made the attractive interesting and educational as it was good to find out where plants came from originally.
,,Scents,5.0,,"If you are into gardening or not, you will love this place, it will relax your mind, and its even air conditioned!"
,,Lot of variety,4.0,,"The flower dome has a lot of different plants and flowers from all continents. It is very nice, however if you are on a tight schedule I would recommend visiting the cloud forest."
,,Beautiful in all way,4.0,,"As you enter the flower dome, you can spot very many amazing views. If you’re a photo freak, this is one of the place that is MUST VISIT! You can find some different gardens inside the flower dome. The colorful flowers, beautiful views, you name it."
,,Pleased I had the time to visit,4.0,,Went just to pass away a couple of hours and it was a very good decision. The whole experience was just lovely
,,Absolutely worth the look!,5.0,,"The plants and the smells of each area was amazing. We were there around the xmas period and January so the Christmas display was amazing. All I can say is go, go, go!"
,,Different floral displays for different occasions,4.0,,One of my favourite place to visit throughout the year. Entrance fee required. The flower dome features different floral displays to mark the different festivals that we celebrate in Singapore. The weather can be quite hot in Singapore and can get quite tiring walking about at the gardens by the bay so the air-conditioned Flower Dome gives us a cool respite from the hot weather.
,,Mini world of Plants,4.0,,"Flower Dome inside the Garden by the Bay, is another interesting place to see the different plants, trees and flowers from all over the world. Names of plants are written with some details. One can feel the season, festivities, coolness and warmth in each distinct corners of the world. People travel from Australia, to Europe and then Africa or the desert in the garden. Lovely place to spend the time with family and friends in a cool nice ambient weather.
We purchased tickets for both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome together from airport at SG Dollar 52 (couple). They can be purchased on location too. As Gardens by the Bay is huge and demands lots of walking in the warm and humid weather, it is wise to hire the Golf Cart for SG 3 to go to these two places. After visiting the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, one gets really rejuvenated with the freshness of the gardens."
,,A bit of everything,4.0,,"The dome was set up for Christmas so the nutcracker theme stretched throughout the dome during our visit. It was really nice to see some good old South African plants and trees, the things I grew up seeing in our back yard.

Very interesting plants and flowers and because it is temperature controlled it is quite a pleasant experience. There is a restaurant inside the dome but we did not eat or drink there.

Overall a good experience."
,,A Gardeners Dream,5.0,,So many wonderful plantings and displays of unique and interesting plants from around the World. There is something in flower all the time and the displays are meticulously tended and cared for.
,,DO visit Flower Dome,5.0,,"This place is not free, but it worth paying for it (is inside the Gardens By The Bay). You get to see a lot of plants in Flower Dome. Do remember to bring along a jacket for your kids, it might be too cold for them."
,,The whole world under one roof,5.0,,"This is an indoor air conditioned park. One can see some rare plants and flowers found in different countries of the world under one roof. I wonder how they were able to grow and maintain such diverse group of plants in one place.
Food near this place is not good, just snacks available, so try to the take your own food."
,,Magical,5.0,,Hard to describe unless you enjoy nature and if that's the case all the superlatives that imbibe this tourist destination .
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Do this before the cloud forest. The cloud forest is more spectacular but this shouldn't detract from how amazing the flower dome is.i had a tea and cake at pollen. Very expensive but great service and excellent surrounds and tea and cake was worth the money. It's a treat and shouldn't cost any less. If you are on a budget then go to satay by the bay. Which is also great
,,Fun flower dome,4.0,,"This is located in one of two glass domes in the Gardens by the Bay. It was decorated for Christmas, and had a great holiday atmosphere, although there were so many children and families at this time of year, it was crowded and noisy. Because of the decorations, a lot of the botanical areas were covered with lights and Santa. However, it was pretty. We felt the Cloud Forest was a better experience. If it's raining, this is a good way to pass the time dry."
,,Spring all year around,5.0,,"This dome is fully air conditioned and full of a number of different plants from around the world. The gardens are segmented into areas such as California, Australia, South America, cactus garden and so on. December and January have a Christmas theme, so you are assured that the attraction is dynamic throughout the year. Allow a good hour to see everything properly."
,,Lots of flowers,3.0,,"Situated in Garden's by the Sea, this is one of two dome's. The place is filled with different flowers and tree's with there own area example Mediterranean, amazon etc."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Huge park with very well decorated for Christmas eve. Full of many variant of flowers and trees completed with the deskripsi on of each floral.
,,One of the most beautiful gardens ever !!!,5.0,,"This is within the Gardens By The Bay and it is a very relaxing, cool and beautiful place. It is a must when in Singapore."
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"Expected a little more, the different gardens for parts of the world were small and really only seemed to be a few trees and not much other variety. Maybe that just the non-plant experts in us. My husband was not impressed. We weren't into the Christmas decor that took up a huge portion of the dome, perhaps some of the other season displays would be more interesting in our opinion. Plus was air conditioning."
,,Very pretty,4.0,,"beautiful, very well thought out, the flower displays were amazing, every where you turned there where art pieces and floral displays, we had to go around from different angles to take it all in"
,,Huge,4.0,,"Very well decorated for Xmas, stunning displays, $28 for the 2 domes. Not hot inside as I assumed it would be."
,,Tulipmania is a MUST GO,4.0,,"I've been to Tulipmania twice (once in 2013 and another in 2015) and I've never been disappointed. They're usually held in April or May each year. The exhibits are stunning and beautiful. Be prepared for crowds. Bring a jacket as it gets cold inside relative to the temperature outside.

Go up to the area with the cacti - it may not seem like much at first compared to the colourful flowers below, but you get the best view at the far corner, where the wooden eagle and dragon are!"
,,It doesn't get any better than this.,5.0,,"If you like plants, or architecture, or stunning views or amazing buildings or parks then this is the place for you. Easy to lose a day here, more if you are a gardener."
,,Beautiful flowers & plants in a cool atmosphere in Summer Singapore!!,4.0,,"If you love the sun, visit Garden by the bay 1st & Flower Dome to cool down. Never get tired of going to the Flower Dome. Been there several times & saw the themes changes according to the festive seasons - Christmas, Chinese New Year, Deepvali & so on.... Snap away your photos & sit down when you tired ( there are round wooden resting seats where you can relax). But remember to bring your own mineral water as there there is only 1 cafe in the Flower Dome)."
,,Greatest indoor plant attraction on earth!,4.0,,Very very unique experience. All rare tress and flowers are planted here. The odor of the organic fertilizer is really a temptation. Make sure you try this experience when you come to Spore.
,,Flowers,5.0,,We visited this place for the first time. This place is so beautiful. Many kinds of flowers and plants. Flower dome is so interesting. We spent several hours there with hundreds of pictures.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Step into the Flower Dome and stand in awe. Spectacular and innovative, it is the largest glass greenhouse in the world as listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records! Be amazed by changing display of flowers and plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid regions."
,,Recommended for flower lovers,4.0,,"Recommended for flower lovers, with all kinds of flowers from all over the world. It's air conditioned and wide open space."
,,Nice way to spend an hour,4.0,,"We live in Singapore, but went to the Gardens By the Bay for the first time when my parents visited recently from the US. We only went to the Flower Dome, which was a nice way to spend an hour on their first day in the city. I think we'll be back soon because my husband was quite impressed with all the trees procured from around the world."
,,Not in the list at first,5.0,,"We bought the unlimited shuttle service (SG$3 per person) with tickets (SG$28) for both dome (the not sell it separately for tourist). The dome was not in our must-see list at first because we are unaware of their existence LOL! But thanks to the rainy & gloomy day, we bought the tickets since we can't enjoy the attraction of the Sentosa Island."
,,Great,5.0,,Wonderfull place. So many flowers and trees. Smells really nice in here. A lot of Photo opportunity bring a good camera
,,Dissapointing,3.0,,Really not that interesting and when compared to the Cloud Forest this experience does not even come close. Appreciation of plants is better done at the Botanic gardens with perhaps the exception of the cacti.
,,An extended visit to the Bay area.,4.0,,Visited the flower dome with my younger son. There were aplenty of various flowering plants. Chrysanthemum was the theme flower. It was quite an impressive display though the dome wasn't as big as i thought. worth a visit depending on the seasonal flower theme.
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"Pleasant but doesn't nearly compare to similar facilities I've visited elsewhere in the world, particularly given the high ticket price."
,,Go here it's seriously cool,5.0,,Great place and simply amazing structure. Can easily spend an hour here and well worth the entry fee. Great gardens and sculptures. Go early to avoid crowds and pay a little extra for the electric car ride from the entrance if you're not used to yhe heat it can be a hard walk. Family friendly place
,,fresh air,4.0,,This place is fun. There are a lot of kind of plants and trees. The decoration inside it is also adjust the season. I like to visit there because it so colorful inside. Just relaxing and the air is so fresh and cool inside. I like it so much.
,,Boring,3.0,,"This place provides a wide variety of plants and trees, but for me personally, this place is very boring."
,,Really lives up to its name!,5.0,,"Absolutely love the atmosphere and ambiance in the Flower Dome. There are loads of interesting and pretty plants/flowers within, and plenty of seats for you to just relax and take in your surroundings. The climate control makes you feel like you're overseas. A very nice place to just relax and enjoy the wonders of nature. Went at night so it has a very much different feeling compared to daytime. Would love to experience the Flower Dome in the daytime when it's not during peak season. (I went during Christmas so it was really crowded even at night near closing time.)"
,,"Great place, but very crowded",4.0,,"In summary, the decoration and flowers are great. Definitely a feast for all of us who likes to take pictures. This time around they make it to a Christmas wonderland theme, which I found really nice. But prepare yourself mentally before you visit this place, especially on holidays. A lot of tourists from Malaysia, China, and Indonesia will come here during the festive season.
If you are a Singaporean or Permanent Resident of Singapore, I recommend you book the tickets online and get it at a rate of $12 per dome. If you are planning to buy the tickets on the spot, you might waste another hour to queue and it will definitely ruin your day. If it is a hot day, it would be really great to go inside the dome to enjoy the air conditioner. But beware, a lot of people might have the same thought and end up over-crowding the area."
,,Amazing array of plants!,4.0,,"Fantastic conservatory with wide varieties of trees, flowers, succulents, bushes and cacti. I live in Australia, so the South African and Australian plant section was more like greeting old friends. But we were fascinated by the baobab trees and the olive grove.

We were there during the Christmas period and although it was busy, it was not too bad and people were very polite with regards to taking turns to queue and take photographs.

There is a fine dining restaurant ""Pollen"" inside the dome.

Again very wheelchair and pram friendly with seats around for tired legs.

See my Gardens by the Bay review re ticket price tips."
,,Different flowers for different festivals,5.0,,Was there just in time to catch the flowers for xmas. Amazing xmas wonderland decorations with fir trees and colorful poinsettia plants. Check out the gardens by the bay website to find out what flowers are on show.
,,Not So Interesting,3.0,,"A lil' bit bored inside.. Just looking around flowers, shrubs, etc.. With long queue, I think it's better to spend your time at Cloud Forest rather than Flower Dome."
,,The largest greenhouse.,5.0,,"Superb collection of flowers with a wide range varieties of flowers and indeen colorful. For flower enthusiasts, this dome is for you."
,,Beauty at its finest,5.0,,Having never really been a flower person before I was hesitant. Absolutely stunning once you step inside the dome. Would recommend this to anyone
,,For Lovers of Flowers and Photo Opportunities,4.0,,They had a nice Christmas display on during our visit which only added to the interest of seeing so many different flowers from around the world. Go early to aviod the crowds and have plenty of time for photos with flowers.
,,Christmas delights!,4.0,,"Besides the plants and flowers from various continents, currently on display is also the Christmas theme, trees and reindeers etc. Lots of poinsettia's. The cacti (succulents) are also very good"
,,Don't bother,2.0,,"With the long queue and the building itself receiving so many awards, I am totally disappointed. The inside doesn't justify the outside. Boring looking plants, more like shrubs than flowers. And expensive, $16 for one conservatory, $28 for two(+ Cloud Forest)
Just walk around the garden outside, much more fun"
,,Superb collection of flowers.,5.0,,It is part of Garden's by the bay and has one Dome dedicated to flowers and mostly from the tropical region good to visit if you are nature lover and like to see how this things are managed scientifically plan it in advance wil require at least half a day to cover both the domes
,,OK but not really worth the entry,3.0,,"We visited at a very busy time on public holiday. It was OK, but the free botanic gardens were better. The gaudy Christmas display added little."
,,Christmas at the Dome,4.0,,This dome has lots of flowers from all over the world. But the difference is that the lower area of the dome has a diffferent theme according to the holidays here. We just saw the lovely Christmas theme and they will be changing it in January for the Chinese New Year blooms. Can't wait to see it!
,,Amazing,5.0,,Its simply incredible in there. Very well built and impecable. You can learn a lot and enjoy a break from the strong heat outside. Both domes are amazing
,,Not worth spending money to go inside,2.0,,"It has gardens from different regions. I didn't find it interesting enough. If I were to pay for this only, I would give it a miss."
,,EXCELLENT PLACE TO VISIT,5.0,,Wonderful place to visit in Singapore and a must do when in Singapore. Its at the gardens by the bay and once there you can take a shuttle bus for $2.00 to the other attractions.Entry ticket to the Flower Dome and Cloud dome was $56.00 for two people and well worth the cost.
,,"Flowers, flowers and more flowers",3.0,,A nice place if you are into flowers from various parts of the world. The place gets pretty boring after a while as it looked about the same to me
,,Egh... I could have skipped this tour,3.0,,I was ok I had more fun at the Botanical Gardens. Its a good place for kids but I had a better time at the orchid garden. A must see if you just want to day that you have done it. But if you are tight on time skip it is my vote
,,Pretty flowers bloom for u n me,5.0,,"For visitors who love flowers n cactus ! There are a lot of species of flowers n cactus. Not only that, there are also wooden sculpture tt we can enjoy seeing which enhance the garden. Another great hide out place from the humid weather."
,,Flowers are cool,4.0,,Imaging walking through a garden in the heat and then escaping into an air-conditioned dome filled with floral displays. Well that's this place. I'm not really into flowers and gardens but this is something special. Worth seeing!!
,,Who knew flowers could be so beautifully presented?!,5.0,,"Loved the flower dome - we were there just before Christmas so beautiful flowers and beautiful aroma from the flowers. Plus there were some amazing displays of reindeer, Santas, elves etc."
,,Incredible feature beautiful construction and entry charges so reasonable,5.0,,Excellent a marvel for tiny Singapore the pride and joy of this country loved it just awesome. All these structures were I am told in a short matter of 4/5 years the complete Marina Gardens by the bay. Marvelous one has to visit them to truly appreciate them
,,A must visit during Christmas eve,5.0,,"Went there two times with different group of friends. We bought our tickets at the airport, apparently it is $3 or $2 cheaper than purchasing online. Different price for the children. It is a 2 in 1 ticket, access to both flower dome and cloud forest. I would suggest spend half of your day at Garden by the bay. Best time to go is around 4 or 5pm, so that you have enough time for both flower dome and cloud forest.

Take note of this!! The flower dome last admission is 8.30pm. Remember to arrive the place before that! Bring along your jacket, other stuff you can put in the locker which you can find in front of the entrance (make sure you have a few $1 coins with you).

Went there in December, so the place was full of Christmas decorations. The whole place is really nice with the decorations, but it would have been better if i went before the sunset. Didn't get to witness the vividness of the flowers and plants.

If you're a nature person, this is definitely a must visit for you!"
,,Do yourself a favor and don't plan your visit at night.,4.0,,It is beautiful place but I think I could have enjoyed more during the day. The Christmas decor looked great and there are so many exhibits that are very informative. Like the concept.
,,Nice place to spend an afternoon,5.0,,This was a very interesting place to visit. Beautiful and elegant by any standard. If you are at the Gardens then this is a must visit place.
,,Christmas toyland,4.0,,It's the Christmas toyland and whole place was decorated with Christmas theme settings. A pity some of the flowers were not that well maintained. Hopefully the next time I'm back they will have more beautiful flowers.
,,secret garden,5.0,,"It's very remarkable to see different species of plants that came from other side of the world. The landscaping and control of the temperature, the blooms and the maintenance for sure. The intricate designs of the stone and wood carvings are so overwhelming."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is my second visit to Gardens by the Bay and I was impressed with how much things have grown in since visiting 12 months ago!
It is very informative and the variety of plants here is unbelievable! The price for such an attraction is also very good. The Christmas display in the centre just topped it all off.
Word of advice, bring a jacket if you feel the cold. Both domes are cooled and it can get a bit chilly!"
,,Disappointing but still good in parts,4.0,,Sadly we arrived at the end of the chrysanthemum show period when most of the display flowers had past their best. I'm sure that the shows are a lot better when you see the flowers are fresh.
,,Happy ever after in flowers dome,5.0,,"Where ever your eyes see, you see the beauty. Left right back and front are full with beautiful flowers from many kinds and colors. Make sure you have enough memory card for your camera, you don't want to missed the moment. Spend as much as you want slowly pay attention on all the flowers. Amazing, feel so happy spend time in here."
,,'Cool' place,5.0,,"Is a nice place with all the flowers we never see in tropical and a good getaway from the humid and heat. Although not a large place, we spent 2 hours plus enjoying the atmosphere. Do bring your elderly there as it is foc for then and half price for accompanying adult till end Dec 15. You can spend some quality time w them. Sorry folks...only for Singaporean."
,,So Beautiful,5.0,,So many orchids and other Tropical flowers ! The grounds are so very well laid out. The views of down town Singapore are awsome.
,,Pretty!,5.0,,The cool airconditioning was certainly a relief from the hot weather! The flowers were so beautiful and I enjoyed the theme! I could also see them setting up for another theme as we were walking about so it was the best of both worlds!
,,variety,5.0,,"You can see variety of flower and plant from all around the world. If you love flower, it is an excellent choice."
,,Beautiful conservatory,5.0,,The flowers in the Dome changes with the seasons. The Christmas theme was magical and worth our visit. Definitely the place to learn more about fauna.
,,Smells Good,4.0,,"Here you can feel the cool, fragrant flowers, and enjoy the beauty of flowers from different countries, so many kinds, you can take pictures freely because the place is spacious and very beautiful.."
,,Just Australian plants,3.0,,"90% of the plants seen are seen in Australia. Not really worth it if you live in Australia. It was also very crowded, but i guess it was just low in standard compared to the cloud forest."
,,"Awesome Festive Decors, Christmas Trees and Flowers",5.0,,"Visited this world famous Flower dome last year and again this year to look at the Christmas themed flowers and decor.

With Christmas less than a week away, the year end vacation season in full swing, and the ""future of us"" just exhibition midway, we went there during day time to avoid huge crowds and have a more leisurely and different photo taking experience inside the dome.

This meant we missed the night displays, musical lighting show and festive market. No regrets though as we took lots of happy photographs and enjoyed the cool temperatures for over an hour before adjourning to McDonalds for more family bonding time and moments. Parking was easily available.

Beautiful arches and a huge ferries wheel of Christmas toys from Santa's workshop, an Air traffic control tower and a plane, toy soldiers, fire place without a chimney and a family of dolls. The Last Christmas scene has changed at Gardens by the Bay this year with a different creative interpretation to convey the love of Christmas. Well done team GB. We will certainly come back again next Christmas!"
,,Flowers galore,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is a gardener's paradise. Even though I don't have a green thumb, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing and learning about different plants and shrubbery. It looks especially festive this time of year with the Xmas exhibit present. What surprised me was that they were able to keep the Dome so cool and comfortable, and yet, there are many cactus varieties that seem to be thriving."
,,Not worth the cost!,1.0,,"This was very disappointing with not many exciting plants and certainly not many actual Flowers (more cacti).

I don't think it worth the while going!"
,,Air Conditioned!,2.0,,"If you really really love flowers and plants, or if you're already going to the Cloud Forest and can get a good deal on tickets to both, then the Flower Dome isn't a bad way to spend some time. But with minimal explanation of what anything is, it's not going to be much of a learning experience. It was decorated for Christmas when I was there, and the Christmas decorations were more engaging/exciting than the actual flowers. The best part was the A/C- anything to escape the oppressive heat & humidity. We tried to eat in the restaurant, but it was closed for a private event."
,,Worthwhile to visit especially during xmas season,5.0,,Went to Flower Dome in December and it was decked with Xmas decorations. Beautiful place for both plant and non plant lovers. Tried go on a weekday to avoid crowd and do check the website in case the dome is closed on that day for maintenance. It is sheltered so no worried abt poor weather.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Enjoyed the cool climate and beautiful flowers from different parts of the world that are changed periodically. Surprised by how spacious the place is in an enclosure and in land-scarce Singapore. Highly recommended for all ages.
,,"A man-made wonder, beautiful and breathtaking!",5.0,,"Though the ticket price then was quite expensive, I think we paid something like S$ 100+ for 3 adult tourists plus one who is a SG permanent resident-- we thought that it was worth it going to the Flower Dome of the Gardens by the Bay. We went there in Dec 2013.

It offered us so many learning experiences on what we still needed to know about the plant kingdom. The way that the place was designed made us awe struck and really at a loss for words on how all these could have been thought by the planners. We appreciated the areas that were distinctly ""curated"" like the place for the cacti, the huge trees, etc... When we came out of it, it was already almost 10pm... we were just so engrossed at the huge display at the garden that we didn't mind the time that passed us by."
,,Spacious and a great escape from the Singapore heat,4.0,,"Flower Dome is one of the two conservatories at Gardens by the Bay. This one is more spacious and has a cooler, drier climate. You can take some great pictures here with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Singapore Flyer in the background.

However, I expected more flowers from something with ""Flower"" in its name. Most of the conservatory featured cacti and plants you can find in dry climate.

The majority of the flowers were found in the Easter exhibit when I visited in April. Which, fortunately, was very nice and colorful!"
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,When in Singapore don't miss the Flower Dome gardens. The Christmas displays are beautiful and the gardens have flowers and plants from around the world
,,An interesting array of plants from all over the world.,4.0,,A must for any plant lovers and even non lovers. It isn't just limited to flowers as there are various species of trees from around the planet also. There is a fantastic Christmas display there for the time of year and the Poinsettias are beautiful
,,A wide variety of flowers and displays,5.0,,"Plenty to see here, with plants from a range of places around the world. There are various special displays on at different times, when I went there was a Christmas display, this was bright, colourful and fun. A good place for a family day out. The place can get crowded depending on the time of year, but that doesn't take away from the great experience of visiting here"
,,Unique Flowers Found Here,5.0,,Caslimo Transport Services was very knowledgeable about Singapore Tourist Attractions and we thank him for recommending and sending us to Garden By The Bay - Flower Dome. We love the species found here. MUST GO!
,,If you're interested in plants from around the world it's perfect.,4.0,,Lots of walking. Wheelchairs can be hired at foyer for $2 and you have to leave your passport with them! Didn't like that at all. It's an interesting one off must see.
,,Amazing place that Singapore has to offer during your trip,4.0,,What money can buy. An artificial garden under roof. Only Singapore can do this. Great place to visit for the first time if you are in Singapore.
,,Impressive!,5.0,,My sister organized this little excursion and I truly enjoyed the whole set up. You see a whole range of plants in a cool environment. It was a lovely reprieve from the heat and humidity of Singapore.
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,variety of flowers to be seen. themes change periodically. The dome is spacious and fully air conditioned.
,,Christmas Wonderland decoration is very nice,5.0,,"This is first time I went there and due to the season of Xmas, they are holding the Christmas Wonderland at flower dome. This is very nice, together with the lovely flowers in it. Better come to here during some events such as flowers expedition or others, it will be more beautiful."
,,Delightful and beautiful,5.0,,Definitely worth the time and effort viewing the vast flora collection and the immense wonder of the whole dome.
,,Vareity of Flower,3.0,,"Being a passionate traveler for Natural beauty might be feel sorry as Singapore do not offer plenty of those as most of the iconic structure is artificial. But here in the whole premises of Flower Dome, architects have shown how efficiently natural beauty can be preserved & offered to people in search for. Excellent it is especially in variance of it's collection."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautiful beautiful beautiful!! So many flowers inside the cold room, colourfull and very relaxing. There is theme on every season, we visited on chinese new year season, so it were asian flowers everywhere."
,,don't visit at night for the flowers,3.0,,"If you are there for the flowers, visit at day time. In the night, the lighting is very dim and you cant appreciate the flowers."
,,Flowers but not many,5.0,,"Located right along side the cloud dome, this flower dome is more open in nature. Their are lots of unique cacti. Th open area is very beautiful, filled with the sights and smells of plants and flowers. Broken into several areas (Mediterranean, Asia, etc.), you can see plants from the different continents. Wanted to see more flowers but the ones that were blooming were beautiful."
,,Amazing Flower Dome,5.0,,"Our Third visit to the Flower Dome - This attraction situated in ""Gardens By the Bay"" never ceases to amaze. Breathtaking floral attractions - Definitely a must see attraction in the amazing city that is Singapore."
,,For Plant Lovers,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is one of two dome attractions located within the Gardens by the Bay. We were limited for time so we choose the flower garden. The first thing I noticed was the place is air-conditioned, after walking around the gardens is was a pleasure and a relief from the humidity. There was a large variety of flowers from all over the world, but the plant species were basic, very little exotic flowers. What made up for the lack of exotic flowers was the Christmas theme…the theme set-out was well presented which raised our view of the attraction. We never got a chance to visit the Cloud Forrest, with our limited stop-over time we enjoyed our time in the Flower Dome."
,,My favourite attraction in Singapore!!,5.0,,This place is truly amazing! It is the best garden I have ever visited in my travels. I loved of the layout & use of plant species. Singapore should be proud to have such a amazing structure and garden. I must to see & do for all travellers!!!
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I am not that interested in gardens or gardening but this flower dome had me captivated. It is beautifully landscaped and there is such a large variety of flowers, plants and trees. The only drawback is that not all the plants are named although some are not only named, but they have descriptions as well. A beautiful place to spend an hour or 2 even if flowers aren't 'your thing'."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,Whilst mildly interesting the flower dome is misleading in that it consists mostly of plants and cacti with little in the way of actual flowers. You can see everything in 30mins and afterwards will be left wondering 'is that it?' Definitely not worth the money when you can just go to the free gardens and overall very disappointing!
,,Well Worth A Visit,5.0,,"Went to the Flower Dome as part of the package of Cloud Dome, Flower Dome cost $28. The Flower Dome usually has a theme as well as the normal displays. It has about 8 permanent displays of plants from throughout the world. Some of these displays are fascinating and the only way you can see these plants other than going to the areas concerned is to see them in an environment like the Flower Dome. A lot of the displays are from drier climates so the plants are quite different to what you would experience in Singapore. Spent about an hour here and enjoyed the experience. A part of the bundle really good value."
,,Pretty interesting plants and trees,4.0,,Spent an hour here and enjoyed most of what we saw. Got a little boring towards the end. Some of the trees and bushes were shaped into animals and such - that was cool. A nice quiet place to relax.
,,Overpriced and overhyped,3.0,,"Located at gardens by the bay you need to purchase a separate ticket for each of the domes. A visit to just one cost S$16. We expected to be amazed with exotic flowers from all over the world but that was not the case. There are some common flowers, but nothing truly exotic. Perhaps it was because of the Xmas exhibits."
,,Flower Dome.. Not to miss,5.0,,"Its indeed a rare place with variety of trees, plants and flowers! So special and aesthetically set. Go around relax in the dome with flowers and flowers"
,,Flower Dome with season,5.0,,"Occasionally the theme changes in the Flower Dome. During Tulip season, the place is fill with all sort of Tulips."
,,You could stay there all day!,5.0,,"My family enjoyed looking at the different flowers , a lot we have never seen before. Very peaceful and relaxing."
,,Amazing place.,5.0,,We were amazed how large this dome is and how many plants and trees the put into it. Every where you turned there were more exotic plants or trees and the wooden sculptures were amazing.
,,Singapore Eden,4.0,,On a par with the Eden Project but with some very different plants. Works well as part of the wider Gardens by the Bay attraction. Offers variety as well as a chance to get out of the outside heat and humidity for a while.
,,Visit and you won't be disappointed!,5.0,,A visit to the flower dome will leave you in awe of the amazing displays. The Christmas themed areas were fantastic. So much so we revisited at sunset to see the areas lit up with Christmas lights....just gorgeous! Tip you can get a pass out stamp and revisit at night if you are there during the day? Take time to explore the diverse plant life from around the world and I am sure you won't be disappointed ....this was a highlight for us!
,,Colourful flowers from various regions around the globe.,5.0,,"This is part of the Gardens by the Bay facility...purchase a ticket for both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forrest...it is airconditioned with many flowers, trees and shrubs on display.

Currently there is a Christmas display....kids of all backgrounds were enjoying and taking many photographs.

This is good."
,,Pretty cool,4.0,,"The flower dome is cool because you can see different plants from around the world growing. It was nice to see a California section of plants and then see Australia plants which is next on our stop. It's cool to compare and read the details. Again you have to be someone who appreciates nature. The cloud forest is by far the best, but you can buy a package deal to see the two sites which I think makes it worth it. They had a Christmas section set up which was cool."
,,Lesser,3.0,,"The lesser of the two domes , still worth a visit , but the other dome is gobsmackingly good , and this one is just ok, does have good clean facilities and would be easily navigable with prams or disabled access"
,,Be surprised by all those different coulours at one spot,4.0,,It is amazing how many species of flowers you can detect when wandering around; you are stunned by all coulours represented in such relatively small area.
,,not much to see,2.0,,"small and not mich too see is nice if you feeling hot outside, and stay in here to cool yourself down"
,,A visual treat!,4.0,,"Visited this place during SG50 celebrations and could not fathom how colorful an indoor garden can be. Just looking at such beautiful flowers can cheer you up! Advised to buy tickets in advances, queues can be long on weekends and holidays."
,,Fun!,4.0,,The+ are : -Beautiful flowers -Unique pathway -The screen of flowers just outside the dome itself -The welcoming structures The -is: -It's very cold The tip is:Don't forget to bring a sweater!
,,Must go,5.0,,If you like colours and nature...this is a must go place.not too expensive.take the time and relax.the sound and colours worth ir
,,Interesting,4.0,,This ia a very large green house hosting a large variety of trees and flowers from different parts of the world. This is not so spectacular like Cloud Forest but if the price of the ticket make no difference for you is definitely worth seeing. Nowadays is Christmas decorated and fun for children. You will need about one hour to enjoy if no waiting is involved. Flower Dome is a day attraction so coming here late is not a plus.
,,Boring for Brits,4.0,,"Thus month's display contains some common eed and white flowers found in Britain,two olive trees,lots of Christmas trees,cacti amd veey little else.Avoid if you do not find geraniums a novelty flower."
,,Amazing for Children,5.0,,"So much effort has gone into making such a beautiful Christmas display. I believe children, & adults alike will be enthralled by this lovely display."
,,Not as expected,5.0,,"Your ticket includes it so may as well see it. It maybe really beautiful at other times of the year, but because it is close to Xmas, it was decorated with all colors of poinsettias!! They may be pretty but nothing out of the ordinary. There were some flowers and other plants, but not all were in bloom, so it was somewhat disappointing. VERY cold inside!
The Gardens outside are beautiful and expansive with an impressive sound and light show in the man-made trees area. Those are free so you can go any time."
,,Architecture Masterpiece,4.0,,An impressive Green House and everything is very well arranged or staged with Plants from all over the world. We recommended this to all our friends and families. When visiting Gardens by the Bay you need to calculate already half a day and maybe anther half for jumping over to MBS.
,,Air Conditioned Garden,5.0,,Its in Garden by the Bay and you can buy tickets for both Flower Dome and Cloud Forrest for like 20 bucks. I liked Flower Dome better amongst the two. It is air conditioned dome with so many different plants and flowers from all across the globe. Its a nice getaway from humid day.
,,Awesome manmade place !!,5.0,,Flower Dome & Cloud Forest are must visit places in Gardens by the Bay. You may find it costly but you wont visit it again... experience what Singapore has done artificially which somehow we dont even preserve that we have naturally ...
,,"Impressive, take warm clothes",4.0,,"The 2 domes were unique and impressive. Impecable presentation. The domes are Very Cold compared to outside so take warm clothing. Plant displays were interesting, we could have purchased audio, may have enhanced visit. Staff extremely helpful. Definately worth a look. Were impressed to see so many Australian plants and an indigenous theme, well done Singapore"
,,Nice,4.0,,"The flower dome is worth a visit, there is different sections by continent and kind of plants (baobabs, cactus). As it was close to Christmas a special area was decorated for it. The entrance for a single attraction costs $12 if you are a foreigner, if you buy a ticket for both flower dome and cloud forest it costs $20."
,,Flower Dome,4.0,,Its located in Gardens by the bay. Its a good place to spend an evening or actually any point of the day as it is completely covered and Air conditioned.
,,Made Us Homesick to see the Australian Garden,4.0,,Amazing the way they showcase plants from all areas around the world. We thought this would be very hot inside however the bonus was that it was all air conditioned. A great place to go for people who enjoy gardening.
,,Great orchid show,5.0,,"While the Dome does show off plants from all over the world in themed zones, the best by far is the orchid display and provides a somewhat more showy display but an excellent counterpart to the National Orchid display at the Botanic Garden - includes a secluded bar/cafe with appropriately eye watering Singaporean prices."
,,Daytime only attraction.,5.0,,You will see trees and plants from all over the world and regions that will delight the most seasoned traveler.
,,If you'd like to see non-native flowers,4.0,,"The dome is really beautiful with species from multiple continents. It does require an admission and can be crowded, but it's really charming."
,,Cloud dome is way better,3.0,,I was a bit over it after the cloud dome which is pretty amazing. I found this dome a bit dull and mainly full of potted flowers and tourists which makes it a bit crowded at times. If you love flowers probably worth a quick stroll through.
,,Beautiful display,5.0,,"We visited the flower dome during the tulip festival and it was beautiful. We are not expert in this area, but loved seeing the variety of tulips. Clean, easy to walk and not too crowded."
,,Unexpected - but delightful,4.0,,displays of cool-dry Mediterranean and sub-tropical gardens on display but the highlight was the very vivid Christmas display - need to experience this - a childrens delight
,,Interesting Tourist Point,5.0,,This is part of Garden By the Bay. It is having collections of flower plants from all over the world. Its arrangement is very nice.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Really lovely, flower displays are gorgeous, lots to see and very relaxing and enjoyable. Great attraction and good for families, kids and adults."
,,Simply Brilliant - Must-See,5.0,,"This is one place that all must visit, locals or tourists... it's simply amazing and stupendous... displays change four times a year according to the seasons with some special treats ever year. Well worth entrance fees. Lots of photo opportunities, whether still-life photographers or casual selfies. Highly recommended. Repeat visits highly recommended."
,,A wonderful escape from the heat!,5.0,,This dome is wonderfully air-conditioned so a delight to walk around and escape the heat. It's well laid-out with various 'countries' and their endemic plants. There's also many sculptures made out of driftwood which are truly excellent.
,,Makes for stunning pictures,4.0,,"It is a good place to visit for bright and stunning pictures. A lot of different flowers, very well maintained. Personally, I found it a bit boring after 20 minutes walking around, there is just that many flowers you can look at."
,,Neat way to see flowers and fauna of the world and escape the heat!,4.0,,"The display is a unique way to view flowers from different regions of the world in one location. When there in November there were setting up a seasonal Christmas display to make the dome even more festive.

Hint - if you want a great meal (albeit not cheap), eat at Pollen and then you can get free admission to the dome before or after your meal."
,,Love all the flower,5.0,,"This is my second time here, still amaze with all beautiful flower. Many roses, rare plant from other region. They also have special event theme, when xmas theme is for xmas with snow, green and red, also the snow man. Is lovely place for those of you like natural thing, bring your camera to get best picture"
,,The smell is good,5.0,,When you enter the flower dome you will really love the smell of many kind of flower. When i came there it was around 7PM and it dark so I cant see it clearly the colour of the flower
,,This is just for Kid's,2.0,,Couples and bachelor's don't go there. There is nothing made for Adult's. Adults can go for there kid's. kid's may like it but nothing is there waste of time.
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Strangely enough, given that we can grow so many of the featured plants here in the UK, I found the most interesting aspects of the flower dome to be the wonderful sculptures scattered throughout the place."
,,Don't miss,5.0,,Another wonderful attraction not to be missed. Very interesting walking around and looking at all the displays from all parts of the world.
,,Botanical Domes: You should not miss them,5.0,,"A great attraction near Marina Bay Sands Skypark are the Flower Domes, as I was told by my guest, the largest man made structure without inner columns. They are beautiful and the food at the restaurant inside the dome is also great. It is also a great place to visit during a raining afternoon."
,,What a surprise,5.0,,"A magical awe inspiring garden, so cool on a hot day. We didn't expect it to be so good even after reading all the good reviews"
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"The bright vivid colors of pink, green, blue, yellow, purple are breathtaking. Time in the flower dome gives a sense of happiness and well-being... a very therapeutic experience."
,,nice place to cool down,4.0,,"beautiful setting nice place to cool down on hot day when visiting garden by the bay The display, variety of flowers and plants were excellent. Bring your macro lens for all photography lovers."
,,Good but not as good as Cloud Forest,4.0,,"although good it was not the same extravaganza as the cloud forest. The area being planted for Christmas was very much a work in progress but other temporary planting was bright and colourful and the permanently planted areas representative of various parts of the world were fine, some quite interesting. We particularly liked the little setups behind glass of e.g. stone plants with crystals and mini stalagmites. Both of the domes had some astonishingly good carvings especially ones where the carvings were integrated into original gnarled pieces of wood."
,,Too wonderful,4.0,,This flower dome is breath taking and wonderful. There is mountains to see you could roam in there for hours. Truly beautiful.
,,Fower Dome Gardens by the Bay Singapore,5.0,,The Flower Dome is a must when you visit Gardens by the Bay. There are several domes in the area so make sure you visit all of them. The flowers are spectacular. The entire area is wonderful and very relaxing. A must1
,,Nice place,4.0,,"This is located in the Garden by the Bay,There is an entrance fee .. A variety of flowers are lined up and also various plants and trees. The place is air condition."
,,Definitely for Plant Lovers,5.0,,"If you love plants and flower, the Flower Dome is definitely worth a visit. It's in a climate controlled atmosphere, so its a good way to escape the heat or rain, depending on the day's weather.

They also put in a real effort for special events like Chinese New Year and Christmas etc, so there is always something different to see. Very good. It's worth getting the dual entry to check out the Cloud Garden as well."
,,Really nice,4.0,,"I liked it a lot because there was and exhibition of chrysanthemums, which created a really nice view. However, I don't know how would it be without an exhibition, cause apart from that it was mostly plants and cactuses and not flowers."
,,Blooming Incredible,5.0,,"The Flower Dome at The Gardens By The Bay is beautiful!

There are many different gardens inside this dome featuring many flowering species and it is very well done and a great way to spend a couple of hours. I really enjoyed seeing the different geographical regions represented by the diverse plantings and the beauty of this attraction. It was also cooler than the outside air and a nice break from the heat of Singapore!

You won't be disappointed by a visit to the Flower Dome."
,,Flower Dome - Heavenly Abode,5.0,,"The Flower Dome replicates a mild, dry climate and features plants found in the Mediterranean and other semi-arid tropical regions e.g. parts of Australia, South America, South Africa.
The Flower Dome features seven different ""gardens"" as well as an olive grove with a bistro and a central changing display field has also been incorporated to enable flower shows and displays to be held within the conservatory."
,,A great way to spend the day,5.0,,An amazing place to go. It is incredible how well this garden is designed. We went there middle of the day and had no problem with the hot weather. It is a great way to spend a few hours.
,,Everything was cool,4.0,,"Like just about everything in Singapore the Flower Dome is a stunner , it's also a nice cool place to,walk around on a hot steamy Singapore day . It is easy to access from the Marina Bay MRT station so no drama getting here .
The colour and variety of the different displays from all the regions was beautiful , it really was just great for a cool amble around ."
,,Clever indoor garden,4.0,,Interesting but the seasonal display of mums was at its end. Permanent collect of certain trees very interesting. California gardens not representative of what it could be..only citrus and olive trees.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"The sheer variety of plants and flowers is too good. I appreciated it because of the engineering feat. The different environs created and displayed is very informative. And yes obviously, the best place to take pictures endlessly."
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,One of two domes in the Gardens by the Bay. A very diverse range of plants and flowers with some beautiful wooden sculptures. The colours and smells were amazing.
,,Flower Dome - Excellent Display.,5.0,,We followed on from the Cloud Forest to the Flower Done. Another must see activity - wonderfully done - especially the wood carvings and wood statues. Would love to know the sculptor so that we could purchase his/ her work.
,,A Beautiful complexion,5.0,,"I can only imagine the amount of effort that goes into keeping this place maintained, such a colourful a diverse environment. A must see."
,,Loved!!!,5.0,,This is absolutely brilliant. We did both domes in 5 hours so be prepared for a long day. The flower dome was all chrysanths when we were there & the colours were beautiful so no doubt different flowers at different times of the year. A must see.
,,amazing place,5.0,,excellent australian gardens marygold flowers delias all types of flowers and plant place not to miss can spend a full day if you are a nature lover
,,Disappointing,3.0,,I found the entire place quite disappointing and would recommend a walk in Bukit Timah any day over this very artificially manicured Flower Dome
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Visited Flowerdome over the weekend and ended up spending a few hours there. There are 2 domes to view and they are absolutely beautiful. It was also great to get out of the Singapore heat for a few hours by enjoying the dome.
,,Stunning place to visit.,5.0,,"We spent a full day and evening at the gardens of the bay and chose to do the two domes. The flower dome was stunning, the plants and trees were a delight to see. When we were there there was a chrysanthemem display on, just fantastic."
,,Flower Power,5.0,,What a great spot to get out of the smoke haze in Singapore at the time of our visit. This place is a floral oasis with exhibitions from all regions of the world. I particularly enjoyed the Boab trees and the chrysanthemum exhibition. Queues were resonable and people flow was reasonable. The usual mass of camera phone selfies and paparazzi .Plenty to take in and enjoy.
,,you will be forgot your self,5.0,,wow...just flower dome comes in front of me at this time also when i am in India.....wants to spend more time here but i have flight so go early
,,Flowers galore,4.0,,"This dome is more about colour and different gardens from around the world, stunning chrysanthemum display at moment, personally preferred cloud dome but was good to visit also"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Went round dome at night .After having seen the light show . It was empty and very beautiful. A must see for anyone visiting Singapore
,,amazing flowers and plants.,5.0,,"an amazing glass dome filled with flowers and plants, as I am a flower lover I was in heaven. the colours of the tulips were amazing."

,,Amazing,4.0,,Really enjoyed this attraction. Some of the plants are just amazing - particularly the very old olive trees.
,,"If you love flowers, this is the place to be",3.0,,"Good
-Flowers, flowers, lots of flowers, big flowers, small flowers, different coloured flowers
-Air-conditioned
-Go to the other Garden and the light show in the trees at the same time

Bad
-If you're not a flower person you probably best go to the water fall garden and the light show at the same time to make it worth it"
,,A gaint structure.,4.0,,The Eden Poject (UK) looks like a toy compared to these enormous domes. A good place for photographers.It is full of vivid colours.
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,A huge glass enclosed botanical exhibition area having both world region displays as well as special exhibits. There is an entrance fee
,,only if you really really like flowers?,3.0,,It's a place filled with flowers. They change them seasonally or something I guess. The flowers are pretty. I think it's nice if you're just out to relax with family and with kids to show them nature (since Singapore doesn't have that much of it). But I wouldn't really spend money if I am a tourist coming from countries with more natural settings. Unless there is really nothing else I want to see or do in Singapore. The free areas outside are already really nice anyway.
,,"go inside, when you like plants",5.0,,"When you like the Gardens and the nature, then spent the money and get inside, you can see there so many nice plants from all over the world"
,,Flower Power at it's best,5.0,,"We combined our visit with a Cirque du Soleil show and dinner at Pollen. The flower dome is a 'must' whether or not you have gardening duties back in the real world, if only to appreciate the sheer scale of the enterprise. For the enthusiast, an absolute delight."
,,Beautiful and peaceful to visit,5.0,,I visited it during the chrysanthemum show and there were all types and a beautiful thing to see. The recreation of many different types of gardens was incredibly impressive as was the sculptures chosen to adorn the landscapes
,,Fantastic Creation,5.0,,A must see in Singapore. The collection of flowers and Cacti is fantastic. It is amazing to see such an indoor garden.
,,Great attraction,5.0,,5star attraction that you need to visit when you are in singapore.. Imagine an indoor garden near the marina bay sands..
,,A Taste of Holland: Tulips and Hans Christian Andersen,4.0,,The display of tulips decorating various scenes out of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tails were very well done. The AC was a very welcome escape from the sweltering heat.
,,Great attraction within an Attraction,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is contained within the Gardens by the Bay exhibition
It showcases plants from all around the would in close to their natural environment.

The landscape we witnessed there were simply beautiful and understand these are changed quite frequently to reflect the different seasons of the year.

Could quite happily wander around this place for hours admiring the plants, colours and plantscapes"
,,Incredible well with the 16 SGD entrance,5.0,,"-excellent way to pass the time,was here nearly 90 mins -fantastic display of Chrysanthemums,was previously roses -wall thru the different gardens,california,mediterrean,see plants being grown lemon trees,animals carved from wooden large greenhouse of plants -"
,,Aways my favourite,5.0,,This is the most amazing example of bringing the gardens into a contained beautiful space. It is better than the botanic gardens and if time poor quicker to see.
,,Well worth visit,5.0,,Another great flower dome colours were outstanding. Well worth price discount on showing Singapore air boarding pass. A must visit have been before but had to go back again on this visit to Singapore
,,Impressive Flower Dome,4.0,,"I visited both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest during my visit to the Gardens by the Bay. Both were worth the admission price of S$28. Upon entering the Flower Dome, you have the option of getting your photo taken in front of a green screen which is superimposed on various backgrounds of the Gardens by the Bay that you can later buy in the gift shop.

There is quite a variety of flowers, plants, and trees in the Flower Dome from all over the world. It is quite spacious and bright inside. Best of all, the Dome is air-conditioned."
,,Flower power alert!,4.0,,"I have written a separate review based on the 'gardens' as a whole, so you can check that out.
From what I can see, there isn't an option to buy a ticket for just the Flower Dome if you are a non-resident, so, you will need to visit the Cloud Dome as well. Adult/Senior two dome/conservatory tickets are SGD28.00 per person (05NOV15 prices), with children 3-12 yrs being SGD15.00.
Depending on when you go, there may be a certain theme on display. Ours was celebrating Chrysanthemums.
The driftwood sculptures are also fascinating, so look out for them dotted throughout the dome."
,,A Must See if Staying in Singapore,5.0,,"Beautifully laid out with interest in multiple areas. A rainbow of colours and flowers. The way each garden area had a point of interest with perhaps a small house, or a bird almost about to fly (made of driftwood)!... just amazing. Cacti, tropicals its all there. Allow time to wander, photograph, admire and look again at things. Many many hours of work goes into this Flower Dome!"
,,Disappointing!,2.0,,"A pseudo-botanic garden, seemingly just thrown together without thought for visitors from beyond Singapore. The ""Australian"" section was particularly hard to understand, and the US section included olives? They are a mediteranean tree, not native to USA!
IOf you want to see a real botanic garden with flair, go to the Singapore Botanic Gardens!"
,,Flower Dome,4.0,,"This is my second time there. The first time in May, they did a children theme, which was excellent. This time they did a theme of all mums, which was OK, since they just set out lots of pots of mum, which was less interesting. They told me in December, the theme will be Christmas, so I bet that will be very interesting to see."
,,Air conditioned bliss,4.0,,"Great place to visit.When we went there was a chrysanthemums exhibit on,many of which should have been staked better and deadheaded.Amazing drift wood animals and huge plants"
,,Heaven for flower lovers,5.0,,"This is one of the 2 domes in the Gardens by the bay. We went during 'Celebrations of Chrysanthemums' and loved it. The dome also has smaller, themed gardens by geographical regions (Australia, South America etc.)"
,,It's a wonderful nature feeling,5.0,,"Very relaxing and feeling fresh , beautiful flowers at different time of the year. A walk through nature in a cool and nice environment, a great outing anytime of the day especially with family. Been there several time."
,,Worth the visit as part of the Gardens by the Bay visit,4.0,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay, a huge amazing complex on reclaimed land, comprising gardens, lakes, two domes, the Supertrees with a skywalk. This is one of the two domes, this one replicating plants and trees from Mediterranean and semi-arid subtropical regions, as well as having a center section for special exhibits. For example, there were succulents and baobab trees. The center section had an beautifully set chrysanthemum exhibit while we were there. Worth the visit. The Gardens are free, with charges for the domes and the skywalk, but worth the admission for sure."
,,Tulip festival (aka Holland),5.0,,Tulip festival is a annual event that brings in many beautiful tulips to savour in their pretty colours. Do try come visit on weekdays as there will be less crowds.
,,Beautiful and vibrant,5.0,,"A gorgeous biome filled with individually designed zones enhanced by dramatic sculptures which frame and punctuate the floral designs. The biome provides a break from the heat outside and is a lovely cool temperature. There is a restaurant ""Pollen"" which looked stylish but I didn't partake so I cannot comment."
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,The flower dome of Gardens by the bay is simply mesmerising... I visited during the christmas time... so there were snowmen made out of flowers...
,,Fascinating dome,5.0,,"An extraordinary huge dome contains arranged, colorful and amazing works of arts using different plants and flowers. good temperature. You will appreciate the different kinds of cactuses. Its really stress-free visiting a place like this."
,,"Just magnificent, mind blowing",5.0,,The sights that meet you are like a floral orchestra playing in perfect harmony. Also the domes are all cooled and perfectly comfortable. They are a welcome release from the heat in the gardens. There are plenty of places to sit and absorb the sights and smells.
,,Less than spectacular,4.0,,"Literally a cool spot of respite from Singapores incessant heat, at Gardens by the Bay. Some of the flowers are beautiful, whilst others were less than well maintained."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The only one word I have for this place is ""beautiful "" .the different coloured flowers, the decor they have done using it is just breath taking....!! And if ur a nature lover and ur visiting Singapore... please don't miss this place...it's just wonderful..."
,,Flower display is amazing,5.0,,The display of flowers is amazing - each is clearly named. Flores and plants significantly grouped together. Easy to walk through and suitable for people with mobility issues
,,Pretty to see,3.0,,"The whole ""gardens by the bay"" is spectacular, the cloud forest was nicer, this is pretty ordinary but worth a look! :)"
,,Fabulous Flower Dome,5.0,,"I have been meaning to visit the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore for some time. I have watched it being built over many years tripping in and out of Singapore for work. Now I made the effort, timing my visit for a dinner and...More"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is one of three related attractions, next to the Cloud Forest and the Supertree Garden. It is not as spectacular as the Cloud Forest, but that doesn't do it any harm. It is a great place showcasing vegetation from various parts of...More"
,,Beautiful tulips during tulipmania season,5.0,,Came here when it was the Tulipmania season (think it's the third time it's here) although I came when it was nearing the end of the season. The tulips were still in bloom although it was probably a smaller variety than when it first started....More
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Amazing variety of plants and statues, the walk way and waterfalls are fabulous. With the botanic gardens you can have a full day out."
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,Easily the best place in all of Singapore by a fair distance...it is amazing to see so many plants & wonderful flowers in such a man made structure..totally worth the price of admission ticket
,,Lovely place to spend afternoon,5.0,,I live here for many years. I couldn't believe that I never had an interest to visit this place. It was a great Saturday to spending time walking around to see all kind of flowers blooming. It's a beautiful designs. A bit cold inside with...More

,,Great afternoon,5.0,,"Wide array of plants, great layout and easy to spend a good few hours walking, sitting and relaxing here."
,,Nice.,5.0,,"Less impressive than the Clod Forest, but also very nice. We went during the chrysanthemum festival, and it was very pretty."
,,Nicely maintained garden,4.0,,"I would not say it's fabulous or amazing but it is a nice place.. Since its a must to see the Garden by the Bay, especially the Cloud Forest and the light and sound show at Supertrees Grove, therefore it will not hurt if you see the garden which is undoubtedly beautiful and colourful..."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"To see such an awesome floral display, the festival of chrysanthemums was on during our visit, The wonderful collection of cacti & desert plants was unexpected. The display is organised in regions with some large boab trees & palms. Many wooden sculptures add to the beauty of the Dome. Wheelchairs are available for use from the information area. A ticket for entrance to both Domes is S$28."
,,Lovely and refreshing !,5.0,,"Looking for place to be surrounded with flowers? This is one place where you can get totally immersed in flowers!

The place so well designed in a manner that you may start your journey with flowers of various species of cactus (very tastefully arranged) and then gradually moving down towards more eye soothing varieties from different part of the world.

There are beautiful cluster spots created which lures one to go for a selfy or a family picture!

The place can be best visited in the after noon about two hours before the dusk and one finds relieved of day's stress within 10 minutes of entering the dome :)"
,,Lot of Unique Plants,5.0,,Pretty informative due to variety of plants and flowers from world over. The Chrysanthemums show was a visual feast.
,,Indoor garden,5.0,,"The garden is pretty cool and AC-ed, so it is great thing to do in a hot day. Use the shuttle to go from & to the flower dome & cloud forrest. It requires you to walk a lot if not."
,,"Flowers, plants from all over the world",5.0,,Different variety of flowers and plants are brought from all over the world and kept under one dome. It is a treat to watch for eyes. It is so colorful and fresh air. it would take 1 hour to cover and it is a must see for nature lovers.
,,great indoor botanical experience,4.0,,"man made wonder, this place boasts of the finest flora and fauna found across various continents hence worth a visit."
,,HEAVEN TO FEEL,5.0,,I have not seen ever this type of garden.it feels awesome to be there.cold atmosphere and amazing flowers to be seen.you cant take your eyes from them.
,,Nothing great,3.0,,The ticket price is 16 SGD and with cloud forest its 28 SGD. Not worth at all - there are just different types of flowers in a green house. Cloud forest is much better.
,,Colourful delight,5.0,,"Wonderful place to visit, with great tree sculptures, amazing floral displays and wonderful rain forest. A must see"
,,Not as good as the Cloud Forest,4.0,,"We went during the Chrysanthemum show celebrating the Chinese Mid-Autumn festival. The place was filled with thousands of potted mums. I just think chrysanthemums are the most boring flower ever.

However, they have lots of interesting cacti and succulents. Their display of Australian and African flora were great. Tey fell down a bit for the other continents. For example, they had some roses for the English garden, but they should have gotten a few varieties of David Austin roses as the most suitable examples."
,,Colourful and beautiful indoor Garden,5.0,,Simply fantastic! My family and I always visit this attraction first before the rest of the park. Love getting indulge by colourful enriching living things. Really appreciate the loads of effort put in by the management. Every single detail was well looked into. Makes you feel joyful to be present.
,,Beautiful variety of flowers,3.0,,They have good variety of flowers - but there wasnt any great novelty factor in that. Cloud forest is much better place to visit.

,,fun place to visit,4.0,,"great place to visit for families, couples, single people. if your in Singapore, you have to go visit"
,,Not a chrysanthemum lover...,4.0,,"I have visited the Flower Dome before when the seasonal flower displays were more to my liking. Aspects of the Dome and the other garden displays will always impress but I was surprised to see so many of the chrysanthemums were looking, tired, brown at the edges, quite droopy and shedding petals. Perhaps the Seasonal display was coming to an end ( we visited one weeks ago)? My husband who loves chrysanthemums was a little disappointed although he delighted in seeing them en masse. The cooling temperature of,the dome made a pleasant relief from the stifling outside humidity and it would always be worth purchasing a double admission pass which includes, in my opinion, the more impressive Cloud Forest Dome."
,,Not as impressive as the 'big brother' next door,4.0,,"As a non-Singaporian resident you can only buy the combo ticket for this together with the Cloud Forrest and it simply pales in comparison ... one 3rd looked more like a cacti-garden, another third looked like seasonal potted plants ... it is still very nice and the cool climate was a great break. But after the Cloud Forrest it just feels 'meh'"
,,Beautiful Plants,5.0,,"When in Singapore, a trip to the Flower Dome and the Cloud Frest Dome is a must. Hre you will see a vast array of plant life beautifully arranged. Do yourself a favour and visit this place"
,,Good to see,4.0,,"Really good collection of flowers and full of Singaporean hybrid orchids. Nicely maintained , designed and laid out. Cactus collection is awesome."
,,Beautiful array of flowers,5.0,,"I had a great afternoon at the Gardens at the Bay, and a stop at the Flower Dome was a must-see. I was fortunate that the timing allowed me to see a Chrysanthemum Festival. Flowers of every hue filled the dome in beautiful arrangements. If you go, don't neglect to see the display of desert plants. Baobab trees, barrel trees, and a large variety of cacti were a wonder to see. This is an attraction you don't want to miss if you love flowers and gardens"
,,Great cool colourful place,4.0,,"Great cool place to escape from the heat in Singapore. Nice arrangements of flowers, foliage and trees, from small to big. The theme of the display is seasonal, sometimes it is tulips, sometimes it is Chrysanthemum. Good if you are interested in flowers or plants."
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"This was a nice display of plants and flora but nothing special. Maybe it's because I visited the botanical gardens first, and thought this was no where near as impressive as the gardens. The admission for both cloud and flower dome is 28$ for non residents ( no student discounts).

It is nicely organized and there are nice flowers, plants and displays. But it's not something I would go out of my way to do. If anything I would have probably skipped it."
,,It is all indoors!,5.0,,"You have to visit the place to find out how nicely are flowers and flower beds arranged, and that too at different levels. Go there in the evening, so that you can enjoy it in the beauty of colourful lighting. The crowd also adds to the attraction. You can take plenty of photographs for preserving memories! We really loved the place."
,,Celebration of Chrysanthemum,4.0,,"This is my 6th time visit to Flower dome , i really love this place. For those who love flower this place is like heaven. ..
This season is Chrysanthemum flower until 10th of November 2015, first time i saw so many varieties of Chrysanthemum i just can't stop talking photos & share with my friends. ..."
,,great greenhouse,5.0,,lovely place with great variety of flowers. the flowers change from season to season. place is slightly cold.
,,If you like flowers you must visit Flower Dome,5.0,,1. If you like flowers you must visit flower dome 2. A large variety of plants and flowers from all over the world 3. Is like you are in the paradise
,,Gigantic Greenhouse,5.0,,"This was my 2nd visit & it was just as good as the first. This has to be the largest green house with walk ways spread over multiple levels; even includes a cafe. Displays are arranged by region, eg Australia, South Africa, Mediterranean. The tree specimens are mature; some must be several hundred years old. The ancient olive trees and baobabs are amazing and interspersed with wonderful floral arrangements that obviously change on a regular basis. Entry cost is about S$18- for adults and the whole complex is air conditioned - a nice respite from Singapores humidity."
,,One of my new favourite things to do in Singapore,5.0,,Visited here last May and enjoyed the tulip festival and this time it was the chrysanthemums turn and what a show it was. Also loved the driftwood statues around the dome. Husband enjoyed the break from the Singaporean heat!
,,A nicer version of b and q garden centre,2.0,,Although the flower dome was nice. It has nothing that you haven't seen in the UK. It would be more appealing to those from a hot humid climate to get a chance to see some flowers they don't get a chance to. 15 -20 mins is all you will really need here
,,"Lovely place, annoying staff",4.0,,"A lovely break from the hustle of the city, a fantastic range of plants. The only problem is the over zealous staff who insist that no one can touch the flowers! Ridiculous"
,,Bit pricey,3.0,,"Was well done much like most things in Singapore, fairly crowded but had some very cool garden art work."
,,Excellent,4.0,,The flowers in this dome are beautiful. It is also cooled some provides some welcome respite from the heat.
,,Vast variety of Flowers,3.0,,"A huge variety of lovely flowers and plants are on display. Good for nature lovers. Personally, I was much more awestruck by the Super-tree Grove and cloud Forest. So Flower Dome should be combined with those, but may not be worthwhile on standalone basis."
,,"Beautiful, seasonal displays",5.0,,"Flower Dome is worth the admission. Diversity of plant matter, regional displays, and comparisons/contrasts help explain the marvels of the plant world and its benefits to life on earth."
,,Good effort,2.0,,I must say this is a good effort. However not much of a sightseeing value. (this is my personal opinion. I am fascinated by nature as it's more relaxing than man made marvels)
,,amazing array of countries under one dome,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is the less spectacular of the 2 domes but still worth seeing.
As the name suggests this is a flower dome with several different countries represented with their typical species of plants.
Admire the different sculptures through the dome. Some will surprise you.
Please check the website for closure dates every month for scheduled maintenance. This varies every month so there is no excuse to arrive and find it closed.
In the flower dome the maintenance is for the chance to the fresh flower displays whuch change theme regularly.
This dome is a must for any budding botanist or loving gardener.
Plenty of photo opportunities in this dome to keep your zoom lense buzzing.
I would say less time is needed in this dome compared to Cloud Forest.
Buy a joint ticket for $28 Singapore. Lunch at the dim sum restaurant downstairs is reasonable and worth having in between the dome visits.
High recommended if you are in the city or bay area."
,,Oasis in the city,4.0,,Attended a business function at the dome. Large reception area that held over 500 with number of food stations. Access to the flowers was available which is a true oasis in the city. Well laid out with different sections showcasing different geographies throughout the garden.
,,what a fantastic flower display,5.0,,what a beautiful way to display flowers and other plants lots of room to move around and plenty of photos to be taken
,,Amazing dome a true must do venue,5.0,,"Loved both domes as great half a day. Truely amazing displays that you will never see again anywhere and you don't have to a garden lover to to overwelmed by the excellence achieved here. So many different amazing displays, loved it"
,,"Sweat free, instant forest and a cool temperate climate in hot humid Singapore",5.0,,"In true Singapore ""make everything perfect"" fashion, this is the ultimate bubble micro-climate attraction. If you don't like nasty bugs and sweating in dense forested parks, this is definitely a place for you. The kids loved the freedom to run around and literally they got the chance to smell all the roses and exotic flowers. It is artificial, but to get such a diversity of flora into domes is a true horticultural achievement. Don't forget to visit the misty waterfall dome too - don't get too close, you'll surely get wet!"
,,Truly Amazing,5.0,,"Looking at the Flower Dome from a distance it is obvious that it is a design master piece. Inside you get blown away by the multitude of different plants and colours. Set out on various levels, the different sections provide a wonderful opportunity to see plants and learn more about them. The colours were amazing, especially since there was a chrysanthemum exhibit in bloom. This is a must visit."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,It's is truly one of the things to do in Singapore it's unique in the way they have presented and harnessed flowers from all over the world. Get up cameras ready for beautiful flowers
,,is this in Singapore?,5.0,,a must visit when you are at this tropical city; amazing technology and attention to detail led to this wonderful garden
,,Closed for Maintenance,3.0,,"I had seen advertising around SIngapore city for a special exhibition of chrysanthemums being presented at the Flower Dome, which was the reason I visited, BUT it was closed. So I am suggesting that before you head to this attraction, you check first. I was disappointed, but went to the Cloud Dome instead. So can't compare only seeing one."
,,Beautiful display in a glass dome ....,4.0,,"The Flower Dome, a large glass dome housing a collection of trees and plants from the Mediterranean and subtropical regions of Australia, South America and Africa, is a part of the Gardens by the Bay. There are varieties of cacti, many shrubs and trees. You will see olive trees, palm trees, baobab trees and many more. The ongoing display of chrysanthemums is really worth seeing. Traditionally, chrysanthemums are used to depict autumn in Chinese art and literature. Don't miss the marvellous wood sculptures!"
,,Super Amazing,5.0,,first time to see such place...Flower Dome is something really unique and Singapore has put really hard efforts to make these world leading attractions in their city
,,Awesome collections,4.0,,"I didn't regret visiting the Flower Dome...there's an amazing collection of flowers and cactus from not only local or tropical countries but from around the world. Perfect for gardeners, flowers & photography enthusiasts. It's a good place to spend the afternoon."
,,Never seen anything like it,5.0,,"What an amazing place this is, the flower displays were so colourful and we were lucky to see the chrysanthemums which were in their full glory. We had planned to take around an hour to walk around it but we were there closer to two hours, and even then I am sure we didn't see everything. Very well set out, my husband uses a walking cane and had no problems walking around it. Do yourselves a favour and go and see this amazing dome"
,,Excellent,4.0,,Very well maintained and beautiful. You can capture nice pics in Flower dome. If you have limited time then Cloud dome can be avoided.
,,Great collection in an amazing location.,5.0,,Multiple plant exhibits showcasing plants from around the world. Building and its climate are an engineering marvel! Great way to beat the daytime heat.
,,Green Fingers in abundance,4.0,,"We visited both this and the cloud forest. Though this has some great displays I personally preferred the could forest, as I felt it flowed a little better. That said both are wonderful displays and a real showpiece for the magnificent city that is Singapore. A good attraction and worth a few hours of your time, especially if you're staying within walking distance."
,,Walking around flowers,5.0,,Another great experience for learning and just simply enjoying the walk among beautiful flowers. It is not the same as botanic gardens but I dont have time to visit many gardens around the world nor do I have the resources to do so.
,,Average compared to the Cloud Forest,3.0,,"Bought a double pass to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The flower dome has zones featuring plants from different regions of the world, in an air conditioned dome. Personally, I preferred the Cloud Forest out of the two attractions, and wouldn't visit the Flower Dome again, but combined they were a nice way to spend a morning."
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,You guys have to check it out. Very beautiful. I love it but I think once is enough. I won't come back.
,,Very beautiful flowers everywhere!!!,4.0,,Super lovely place to be in if u love flowers!!! Very worth the time and effort to come here! Will definitely be back for more the next time and what I love most abt this place is tt there are benches everywhere around the flower dome to rest ur tired feet!
,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,I love this dome! The air was fresh and cold. It has a lot of flowers that blooms beautifully. I like taking pics and selfie there.
,,A Peaceful and Colorful Experience,5.0,,"Complementing Gardens by the Bay itself, the Flower Dome is a nice place to walk around, relax, enjoy the colors of nature, and take pretty photos too!"
,,Flower dome,5.0,,"Fantastic. Beautifully maintained. Colourful. If you are a botanist, you may be interested in renting out their audio tour guide using which you can press the corresponding numbers of the plants to find out more about them."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,the flower dome is an amazing place especially if you are a flower lover. The vibrant colours of the flowers and the air conditioned place is a respite from the humid Singapore weather. Overall a good place.
,,Lovely,4.0,,A huge covered area filled with plants and trees of various countries. Can easily spend couple of hours here taking photos and selfies. Its cool inside too so makes a change from the heat outside. Its a amazing display of the SIngapore governments efforts to create a garden within glass :)
,,"An excellent place to hang out close to ""nature"" but without heat & rain! :)",5.0,,"There seemed to be more plants than flowers here, nonetheless it's a great place to hang out under a high dome-ceiling with benches for resting and restrooms, and most importantly the entire big place is air-conditioned, so to me it's an ""ideal"" place to go read a book close to ""nature"" but without having to worry about rain and heat!

Among the many trees and plants, I was especially interested by the baobab trees with huge round trunks in the shape of jugs that can store water since those trees are naturally seen in desert environments. All in all, there are quite a variety of plants from various parts (like 8 or 9) of the world to see here, and also to see besides the plants are wooden sculptures of running horses and of an eagle (that I saw, maybe more of them), and through the big glass walls are great views of the major ""landmarks"" nearby such as the Marina Bay Sands hotel with its SkyPark in the shape of a boat deck on top and the Singapore Flyer.

The best way to get here by public transportation is taking the MRT to Bayfront station (by blue or yellow lines), then go up to Marina Bay Sands hotel above and from there take the elevator to the sixth floor where there's an overpass leading out to above the road beside and then to the bridge over the Dragonfly Lake, and once you're on the grounds of the Gardens by the Bay on the other side of the bridge, the dome is just about a 5 to 10 minute walk to your left.

You could buy a combo ticket with Cloud Forest Dome right beside this one, and I noticed that they also have an annual pass for both domes at a quite reasonable price(it will pay for itself just after like 5 times) which in my opinion is a very good buy if you're in Singapore for some long term and looking for a way to kill time indoors.

Lastly, if you come here at Christmas time, you'll see some incredible Christmas-themed displays inside."
,,Not particularly interesting.expensive @$14Sing.,3.0,,"For non residents, tickets can only be bought at $28 Sing in combination with the much more interesting Cloud Forest dome. Masses of near perfect chrysanthemums but oh so boring! Some of the trees demonstrate excellent replanting achievement. The small display of stalagmites along side outdoor plants gives the totally wrong impression that stalagmites can form outdoors. This item really should be removed in the interest of authenticity or should have a clearly worded explanation at the very least."
,,Don't believe the Hype,3.0,,Worse part of Gardens by the Bay. About as exciting as visiting your local garden centre with barely more species of plants you'd find there.
,,Colorful flowers at dome,4.0,,a new addition to the Singapore tourist attraction and displays flowers according to theme. The plants were not fresh but the theme..colorful flowers used to make animals...house etc was worth a visit
,,nice display,3.0,,exactly what the name says its full of flowers and well set out displays though the cloud dome is better and more captivating.
,,Refreshing,4.0,,Was a refreshing change from the outside humid weather. Plus beat the haze. Beautiful flowers and marvellous sculptures made from wood. I loved the palm trees and the many variety of cacti. Think a more older crowd would enjoy the place
,,Amazing,4.0,,The flower dome is simply amazing. My daughters and I took so many photos. If you go at night it is even more amazing as you get the amazing lighting - wow!
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Loved the flower dome, it was absolutely gorgeous. So many different gardens from all over the world with such a variety of plants.
The wooden carvings everywhere are just amazing. As it's climate controlled it is very comfortable to walk around and is a great place for a break from the heat and humidity.
The Flower Dome was one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore and I would rate it a not to be missed experience."
,,Chrysanthemums galore,5.0,,"It was the celebration of the Chrysanthemums during our stay. I wish my mum was here as she would have loved the display even more than I did. It was truly magnificent
There is a fee for both the cloud dome and flower dome but it is worth every cent.."
,,More than just flowers.,4.0,,A bit of a let down in my family's opinion after the cloud forest. Chrysanthemums were the main flower because of the autumn festival at the time. Lots of interesting plants and trees. There were many beautiful and intriguing wood carvings throughout. A huge facility.
,,Beauty All Around,5.0,,Great collection of colors all around you. Visiting Flower Dome should be a must to do in your list when visiting Singapore. There was a bridal photo shoot going on the day we visited Flower Dome. Colors colors and more colors..
,,Beautiful and great place to escape from yhe heat,5.0,,beautiful and nice smell in the dome. Good place so far. Should buy a pass ticket before visit this place
,,Don't expect tropical plants,4.0,,"Be aware that this is a temperate garden. It might sound obvious but we didn't do our homework, so when we walked in we saw a lot of plants that we have growing in our own garden at home in Australia. If you want to see tropical plants then go to the botanic gardens."
,,Nice retreat from Singapore's hustle and bustle - and heat,5.0,,"Quite expenisve and rather crowded but definitely worth your while. A very diverse, beautifully designed indoor garden, with all kinds of flowers ranging from orchids to spring snowflakes (though they where a lucky find and rather hard to spot). Plus, as it is inside, it's a nice escape from either rain or heat. Or both."
,,A new season every 3 months,5.0,,"Flower Bed changes its theme every three months. Tulips, MidAutumn, Christmas, Orchids and even lettuce! The flower landscaping never fails to captivates visitors young and old. Flower dome is trolley and wheelchair friendly. Visitors can get to enjoy different temperate flowers under Singapore's tropical climate,"
,,Pleasant to visit,5.0,,Flowers from international and they changed it every season and arrange it beautifully.... It is truly interesting and wonderful were you'll see flowers which you can't find from Singapore...
,,Breath-taking,5.0,,"The cool-dry climate of Mediterranean region has been created in this indoor domed structure. While walking through the cool surroundings, I thought that this 3-acre place was air conditioned. I learned from literature later that a temperature of 23-25°C is maintained by cooling air at the lower level through chilled water pipes in ground slabs, and venting out the warm air at the top.

The Flower Dome features plants found in the Mediterranean and other semi-arid tropical regions e.g. South America, South Africa, parts of Europe, Australia, California etc. The huge variety of colourful flowers is both eye-catching and breath-taking."
,,Lovely,4.0,,A gorgeous display of chrysanthemum flowers. Air-conditioned and a lovely place to wander about for an hour or two.
,,Just amazing arrangements of flowers under one roof,5.0,,"An amazing arrangements of fresh flowers, shrubs & tress from all over the world under one area... Very nicely decorated & kept very clean. Good indoor restaurant as well to unwind & have a drink or snack while enjoying the scent of fresh flowers..."
,,wrong timing,4.0,,"We expected to see lots of flower variety and kinda disappointed on the flowers option, limited flowers inside, before we go there we googling on the flowers pictures and find only few available at the time.

The haze perhaps contributed on the lights inside the dome, make it less sunny, the place itself was nice, cool and well organized."
,,World class Indoor flower display,4.0,,One of the worlds best indoor flower displays which is sure to please all garden lovers. Visitors will be impressed with this attraction which changes it's displays to match the seasons. An added bonus is that you can escape the Singapore heat and enjoy walking through the displays in air conditioned comfort.One important tip! check their website to make sure you don't plan a visit on a day that has been scheduled for maintenance.
,,Nice Indoor Garden,4.0,,The dome is not just a show-off but a mark of Singapore's sustainable plan to conserve water and preserve mother nature. A good family excursion.
,,Must see,5.0,,Do not miss out on a visit to the flower dome. Stunning floral displays and includes the most amazing wood carvings. Cool relief on a hot day with ample photo opportunities. Loved every minute of our time here.
,,Simply stunning and serene,5.0,,"What a beautiful haven set in mesmerising architecture. A stunning array of plants, beautifully designed and so enjoyable whether you have green fingers or not. An easy stroll for all ages in this little piece of heaven. Really good value for money when you buy the pass for this and also Cloud Forest."
,,Fantastic Indoor Flower Garden,5.0,,This attraction exhibit real tropical flower in airconditioned dome. The idea was very smart. There are variety of tropical flowers. It is very beautifully arranged. The most interesting point of this attraction is that visitor will not have to walk a lot neither to feel the very hot Singapore weather.
,,Absolutely outstanding,5.0,,Was far beyond and much more impressive than i was expecting. Truly magnificent set-up with an astounding array of plants form many regions of the world. The cactus section was my favorite.
,,Flowers,5.0,,"In the conservatory, you will find arrays of flowers from various continents and parts of the world. In an air-conditioned environment you can view the flowers away from the hot tropical climate even during mid-day."
,,Heaven of Flowers !! Big Positive to your Soul,5.0,,"One of the best gardens visited in my life. There is lot of positive rays the moment you enter here. Beautiful , outstanding, you can spend hours together and have peace here. Forgetting all your worries."
,,"A ""must do"" for any visitor.",5.0,,Probably the best value in Singapore. This is just an awesome place which you cannot describe in words.
,,"Do this on a rainy, foggy day",5.0,,"This is worth it and far more entertaining than the Botanical & Orchid Garden. Try to save this for a rainy, foggy or hazy day in Singapore."
,,Oasis in the middle of hazy Singapore,5.0,,Wonderful experience if you have never been before. Very interesting and beautiful flowers (especially orchids) and fauna. Worth a visit.
,,"Kind of cool, but expensive",3.0,,Make sure you get some kind of attraction pass because this is pretty expensive to just pay a la carte if you're a foreign visitor. Only discount is for Singapore residents.
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,"The flower dome is fantastic, I would go again, a lovely walk and so pretty, a must see! Once again Singapore got it right."
,,Good stuff... very refreshing,4.0,,Several positives: 1. Great place to see different type of flowers and trees 2. Very refreshing and good feeling overall. 3. Must do with small kids -ves: 1. One time watch only 2. A bit expensive for all the offerings...
,,Flower heaven,5.0,,"Fantastic job to build such a beautiful place for walking and taking pictures. The place is full of different species of plantation from around the world. And it has of the beautiful roses I have ever seen. Went there on a weekend, and it was a bit crowded from all the tourists, locals, different groups and school kids pouring in. So to avoid any ques I would suggest to come early or to visit during working days."
,,Closed for maintenance,1.0,,"We went to gardens by the bay last week... and unfortunately this flower dome was under maintenance and could not see.. but it must be a part of the itinerary of ""Gardens by the bay"". .
My rating is low just coz we could not see and enjoy this... but from nearby view I feel it should be a 5*"
,,Amazing creatures,5.0,,"This place is really amazing.. Beautiful flowers and nice for picture taking.. The garden is clean with amazing works..If u will go to gardens by the bay..make sure to visit this area.. The first time i visited Sg, i was not able to visit this.. Good thing, now, i did! Worth it!"
,,International Flowers and Plants,4.0,,"Flower Dome is fully air-conditioned and features international flowers and plants. There are also some wood sculptures around the dome.

Of course, do not expect to find the whole world in here or you'll be sorely disappointed. There are some good varieties of plants and flowers and most people would find it beautiful enough to sing praises about it.

It would be a pretty nice place to try find peace and watch as the people go by."
,,Always a different surprise,4.0,,"This is great for families with young children as the garden is designed in a way where there is minimum stairs climbing up/down. This dome offers different types of flowers displays based on theme. The previous trip was rose garden theme and this trip was orchids theme, inline with Singapore SG50 jubilee celebration."
,,"Flowers Flowers Everywhere, Quite a site to behold",5.0,,"Granted, it's probably not like some botanical gardens you'd get in colder climate countries, but it's amazing all the same. So many flowers beautifully laid out everywhere. This is my third visit, and I still like it very much. (The first was during Year of the Dragon, Chinese New Year, the second was one of the tulips displays and now it's Chrysanthemums). I know it's impossible to expand the place, to allow for place to sit and admire the flowers a little longer, given the potential crowd too, I just wish it could be done! :)

There is a shuttle bus available from Bayfront MRT, so that's really helpful, as it's quite a distance to walk to the dome in this heat. Although the outside gardens is really worth exploring and seeing too (and this part is free to the public). If you're just coming to see the Flower Dome (without the Cloud Forest), then prepare for about 2 hours at least. If you're walking in from the MRT or the hotel (MBS), the walk alone would probably take about an hour as you'd have lots of exhibits to look at too.

Overall, I would come back again for another show."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,After reading all the hype about the Flower Dome I was expecting to find something on a par to the Eden Project in Cornwall. Instead I found planted areas and lots potted Chrysanthemums. Looked more like my local garden centre. Very disappointing.
,,"Interesting,beautiful and not to be missed",5.0,,"Awe of nature and You'll discover amazing plants and flowers from different corners of the globe, also we enjoyed spectacular view of the Marina reservoir skyline."
,,Fun dome,5.0,,this was full of knowledge and fun.. had an exciting trip with friends.. had lots of 'most colorful' photographs of our lives..
,,Great this time of the year !,5.0,,"My Father's a lover of botanists and flowers, and at this time of the year (September visit), the sight after our entrance amazed him. He would spend over an hour taking pictures of just the flowers' section.

The Flower Dome is an interesting idea and creation that I would certainly not miss. Maybe not a frequently visited spot though.

Definitely get tickets to both conservatories rather than just a single dome."
,,Amazing journey through impeccable floral landscape,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is an amazing architectural and sensory experience, situated immediately behind the stunning Marina Bay Sands complex. The dome is part of the overall larger gardens exhibit and house an incredible cross section of floral species from near every corner of the globe."
,,Amazing variety of plants,5.0,,"Now this is truly worth spending your time visiting - carefully designed, curated and truly a stunning attempt to capture the world around us."
,,Nice place for photo.,5.0,,Went there with very limited time and the dome is big and many place to keep photo. Will go there again for whole day trip since there are also forest dome and sky tree nearby.
,,really impressive place,5.0,,full of dry climate plants and interesting. like to explore and took photos. really impressive place.
,,Spectacular and innovative in design,5.0,,"Step into the Flower Dome and you’ll be standing in awe of nature. Spectacular and innovative in design, it is one of the icons of Bay South Garden. The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like South Africa, California and parts of Spain and Italy. Home to a collection of plants from deserts all over the world, it showcases the adaptations of plants to arid environments. Stop and smell the flowers in the colourful changing displays of the Flower Field, which reflects different seasons, festivals and themes."
,,awesome flowers,5.0,,Flower dome was a superb experience with a lot of flowers around you. I really enjoyed clicking photos there. This flowers made me super happy.
,,Much more than flowers; this is an Oasis,5.0,,"An extraordinary display of flowers, artwork and architecture. Sunday was a perfect day even if there was a crowd. There are photo opportunities at every angle. The displays covered all continents except for Antartica. Just about each plant had information about origin and some peculiar fact. The naturalistic artwork was superb. We got lost in the maze going up several floors but it was all worth it. The Dome structure was impressive and the staff were very helpful."
,,Paradise of singapore,5.0,,In this dome they keep changing the decoration according to season and requirement . In June they bought 4200 tulips plants straight from amesterdam .in Christmas they decorated according to winter theme with snow . Always get a refreshing feeling when ever you visit it .
,,Lakwatsera SA Singapore,5.0,,Oh the flowers is so plenty... I love seeing them. Taking pictures and smelling it... So relaxing the area has a lot of flowers all over since its flower festival coming Inn you'll enjoy much seeing this area of singapore
,,Nice,3.0,,"It's nice but not very special. I think if we knew what to expect we would miss it because the lack of time we had. But it's not total waste of time, it's still very beautiful:)"
,,Beautiful displays,4.0,,There is plenty to see showing different flower displays from around the world. I think display is aimed at more local people and not for the experienced traveler. I would recommend the botanic gardens if you want to get more of the Singapore experience.
,,Flowers in dome,5.0,,It was Christmas time . We all decided to go to see the beautiful decoration .it was beyond expectation . Lovely flowers all around us from all over the world . Beautifully blooming in controlled temperature . A real must for all family members .
,,Informative and fun,4.0,,"Hours and hours of informative fun, good for the family. Lots of things to learn about flora and fauna. Walk leisurely through the different areas to get the best of the place."
,,Nice interior flower display,4.0,,"Nice flower and botanical collection from all around the world In my opinion, very important to have daylight, as we arrived very late around 730pm and it was quite hard to see the colours and read the labels at night."
,,Bright and Beautiful,4.0,,"There is a plethora of plants and flowers displayed here. As adults we enjoyed it but it is also a great space for children. There are amazing sculptures fashioned out of trees and twigs, and branches eg a full sized horse standing in the garden of the old lady who lived in a shoe, the shoe was very large and the flowers in the surrounding garden were almost blinding in the intensity of their colours. There are displays of cacti of all sizes and many of the gardens seemed to have a theme to them. Of course being in Singapore there are many beautiful orchids. Well worth a visit"
,,Impressing!! (and refreshing...),5.0,,"Very good indoor attraction, where you can learn a lot about flowers from all over the world. The animals wood sculptures are very interesting, and we found it much more interesting than the Cloud Forest. And it is always good to be inside this air conditioned spece to take a break from suffocating heat of Singapore."
,,Cool and colourful,5.0,,The day we spent at the cloud and flower dome it was during the tulip season and so we got to see tons of tulips ranging from a variety of colours. The dome is very cool as in cooling and its elderly friendly too ! There isnt any shops inside though so you may want to purchase a drink outside. Overall was a unique experience...
,,A comfortable way to see Singapore's orchids,5.0,,This dome contains flowers and plants from weather zones across the world. It is laid out very well to keep the traffic flowing and so did not seem crowded. The orchids were especially beautiful. The air conditioning made wandering through the various gardens very pleasant.
,,Flowers around the world,3.0,,This air conditioned dome has vast collection of flowers and plants around the world. it has different theme of sections for different continental plants. if u r a nature lover i am sure u ll love it. But if u r running out of time u may skip this one as nothing much to see except flowers and plants like any other garden.
,,Wonderful Range of Flowers - Better to Come During Daylight,5.0,,This was my third time visiting the Flower Dome (May 2015) and in each visit I was able to see new flower exhibits with different themes - this time the Ginger Bread House was the main focal point of attraction. For those who are into photography (also selfie addicts) you will be able to spend hours exploring the wide range of flowers on display - but I suggest to come during daylight to get the best picture quality.
,,Garden at its best,5.0,,"Air conditioned dome offers varieties of flowers from all parts of world, must stay 3-4 hours to cover entire area."
,,bloomin lovely,5.0,,"such a variety of flowers, lovely and cool inside, and well set out for easy walking. really enjoyed it"
,,Lovely gigantic garden,5.0,,A place not to be missed by flower and nature lovers. Great varieties of beautiful flowers and exotic plants well-arranged along different routes. The number of visitors should have been well-controlled that the place was not overcrowded during our visit.
,,"Marvellous,Awesome",5.0,,worth to visit Flower Dome in singapore. unique thing. our all 16 group member appreciate this efforts of singapore fovt.
,,A great attraction for nature lovers,4.0,,"We're not particular nature lovers but spent quite a time looking round the Cloud Forest and adjacent Flower Dome. We found it quite good value at SG$25 for both, well worth a morning of our holiday.

I prefered the Cloud Forest out of the two, although less of a global flora showcase than the Flower Dome, it is more spectacular and engaging. I like the way the paths take you round the entirety of the domes without too much thought, and the combination of signage, nature and education to be perfect.

I do question the ethos of the eco credentials given the substantial carbon footprint in construction it must have used however."
,,Fascinating and beautiful,5.0,,Went with my wife's family and it was actually really nice. The cactus area was fascinating and this is truly an engineering marvel.
,,a must do!!,5.0,,"Like my review for the gardens and cloud dome ,this is a must do if your in Singapore absolutely amazing . we loved it"
,,Must do if you are visiting the gardens,4.0,,Well worth a visit. Bring your camera as you will see some beautiful flowers. Has wheelchair access via lifts. Flower colours are fantastic.
,,Away from the equatorial heat and haze.,4.0,,"Well designed, dry and temperate climate green house. It appears to have plenty of tropical? orchids planted in between other plants to produce the ""wow"" and colourful feature of the garden."
,,Definite must see,4.0,,"So much detail and care has gone into creating this garden. Admittedly, we were quite tired while going through here, so perhaps do this one first? Again so much to see."
,,An Unique Experience not to be missed.....,5.0,,"Beautiful, unique & very colourful flowers species from all over the world, encased in a huge cool airconditioned serene Dome.

Experience the tranquil & wonderful feeling of being in & within Nature, yet in a world of its very unique own.

An experience not to be missed!"
,,So many flowers,5.0,,The theme was nursery rhymes. The flowers were amazing and many of the characters and animals were made out of flowers. Amazing
,,Flower lovers rejoice!,4.0,,I love this place because i was able to enjoy a wide array of different flowers in the area. The dome is an architectural beauty too!
,,Great,5.0,,"With the could forest in the Garden by the Bay, this dome will give you a fascinating experience how technology could improve the quality of the nature"
,,Flowers from the world,4.0,,"Inside flower dome there are sections for different places throughout the world and their different flower species on display.

They also have the outlines of stamps within the flowers which are really cool ideas for photos.

It's a nice walk through and you can pay for a guided tour by headset, but we opted just to make our own way through as there are many facts about the plants as you walk around.

We also happened to see a bride and groom having some wedding photos done within the flowers and using the stamp outlines also."
,,Flower power,5.0,,This dome next to the cloud dome is a feature not to be missed with all aspects of the worlds vegetation highlighted. Every season a different view and flower display
,,A pallet of flowers!,5.0,,"Another exotic dome to visit in gardens by the bay. The flower dome showcases a lot of unique flowers from all over the world . It's pretty amazing to see so many different kinds of plants growing in one place. What fascinated me was the variety and colors of tulips and orchids , it was like walking through a hue of colors!"
,,Truely beautiful,5.0,,If you love everything flowers this is the place . It is special with temperatures just right for the beautiful orchids and many other species of flowers . You can even have a coffee and food inside at the cafe
,,Wonderful range of plant life - amazing,5.0,,"This was amazing - where else could you see so many different and unusual plants from every corner of the World. The displays were beautiful and interesting,"
,,Exceptionally good,5.0,,Collection of flowers and plants from world over is so good that you can fall in love with them. We enjoyed clicking pictures with almost every other flower plant.
,,Educational indoor botanical gardens,4.0,,"Flower Dome is another attraction in the Gardens by the Bay complex and is located opposite the Cloud Forest. It showcases the flora from the major regions of the world including North America (California Garden), Mediterranean, South America, Africa and Australia in addition to some themed exhibits showcasing some unique plant types like succulents, baobabs and olives. A flower field in the middle provides a splash of color and also hosts themed exhibits. Conspicuous by its absence of course is Asia but I guess you just have to walk out to see that. The garden is indoors and climate controlled to provide a suitable habitat to the diverse species of plants from various regions growing inside.

The central flower field was holding an India themed exhibit (apparently this keeps changing) when I visited. It provided a very colorful backdrop to the rest of the garden.

It is pretty amazing to see so many different kinds of plants growing in one place. I am sure it must be pretty challenging considering that they are adapted to differing environments - although to be fair most of the regions represented are arid and desert regions. You don't see many rainforest species.

The section on succulents and the one on Baobabs was especially informative since we don't often see these in Asia.

This is an essential part of your Gardens by the Bay tour. Buy a combined ticket with the Cloud Forest to avail attractive discounts. Essential if you are interested in Botany and good for a nice family outing."
,,Paradise for a person want to a have little space for flower from over the world,5.0,,"Are you from anywhere from world, it is a place you will found some very known some are very unknown, the environment is just awesome..just avoid weekends"
,,Overdone floral displays,3.0,,Truthfully I didn't love the Flower Dome as much as the Cloud Dome. I thought it was a tad overdone and gaudy -- flowers and brightly coloured wood statues/boats supposedly telling the story of Singapore legends -- but all competing for attention. Also it was quite pricey -$28 to visit both domes (no senior discount). For my taste (and budget) I much prefer the Orchid Gardens.
,,A different world,5.0,,"Till one is inside, it is difficult to imagine the vastness of the exhibit. Air conditioned atmosphere, proper explanation of what is expected makes it easier for the tourists of every region. Definitely worth the ticket."
,,How good is this?!,5.0,,What architecture and horticulture! Must see. Welcome relief from the heat too. I'm not easily impressed but this place and its sister glasshouse were amazing.
,,Beautiful flowers and surroundings,4.0,,Visit the flower dome to enjoy hundreds of different species of flowers and fauna. A heavenly place to get lost in nature and appreciate what mother earth has given us..
,,One of the best places in Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of the crown jewels of Singapore.
The flower dome is a botanical garden of sorts. It houses flora from different parts of the world, arranged in unique manner. Details have not been spared to anything.
You can easily forget that the walkways even exist.

Orchids, Baobabs and all kinds of flowers and trees are all around you."
,,Flowers Galore,5.0,,"Singapore's pride! Truly a sight to behold-each nook and corner was artfully landscaped to highlight majestic flowers. If you love to see nature's beauty through flowers, you shouldnt miss this attraction."
,,Another cool garden in the midst of the city,3.0,,A good place to stroll after walking under the heat of the sun. The entrance fee going inside is separate from the entrance fee of cloud forest.
,,Good for Nature lover,3.0,,"Great place to meet the plants from all over the world. Value for money, if you are nature lover. Bought tickets from Asiatravel online and brought printout but staff still requested us to queque in normal line to collect the tickets. Good to book online if have some promotion."
,,Bring your camera and video,4.0,,Extremely beautiful and breath taking. Bring your camera and video. It's fully air conditioned so one can visit when it's rain or shine. Different experience to see it in the day or night
,,Singapore orchids in their thousands,5.0,,"Whilst at the Marina Bay gardens it's a must to pay the $27 approx. per person fee to enter the 2 domes. The flower dome was really beautiful, I have never seen so many orchids in such full and beautiful bloom altogether in one place. Whilst many people were visiting at the time we were there it was still possible to see all the displays and take many photos. This dome has easy walking and wheelchair access. There were just as many men as women in the dome and none looked bored or unhappy to be there. It's a truly amazing feat for the gardeners to put this display on show. It's a place to take hundred of photos. Spent 3/4 hour in the dome and easily could have walked around it again."
,,Wonderful exhibition,5.0,,Visited with our granddaughter in August and ahad a lovely couple of hours walking round. The fairy tales exhibition (part of the SG50 celebrations) was under construction and was well worth a look.
,,Nicely kept garden area,4.0,,"The flower dome actually showed how organised a place can be, wonderful life like statues from wood and stamp photo stops and plants make it ideal place to enjoy the charm of Singapore and cherish them"
,,Flowers flowers everywhere......,5.0,,"A supermarket kind of place, growing flowers with architectural interiors....is what was the first sight. But as you go further down each and every place you will take a selfie....or click with the SLRs flower pic....that big is the dome....anybody will be attracted to its variety.... Must visit please don't miss it..."
,,Family Trip,4.0,,"Huge and clean, went together with family, just nice with the Tulips Theme. Really enjoyed to see the Tulips Garden."
,,Flowers everywhere!,4.0,,"Good self-sustaining and full of flowers with different themes depending on the occasion. Problem is, I'm not much of a flower person so I can't say I enjoy it a lot."
,,More greenery than flowers on the upper level,3.0,,"We purchased the 2 dome ticket for $28 which included entry to both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.

We were a little disappointed with the Flower Dome, as the upper level where you first walk in, is mainly greenery and not many flowers / colour.

The downstairs area has a lot more flowers, however not as many as we've seen in other gardens elsewhere in the world.

If it's on your bucket list, check it out, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it others."
,,Discover Singapore Stories,4.0,,"Visited on 6th Sept 15' w family. This was my fourth times visiting. Today's theme is a SG50 commemorative floral display-From Tales to Legend : Discover Singapore Stories. It is for celebrating Singapore golden jubilee. There r more than 8,000 orchids used.

Discover the stories of Sang Nila Utama, Tanjong Pagar, Bukit Timah, Redhill, Sister's Island, Pulau Ubin, Kusu Island...Each tale is framed in a 'stamp', an unique way of displaying to create beautiful scenes of the past. There r helpful plaques at every station for explaining each folktale.

There r displays of old Singapore,ranging from defunt occupations of coolies,Samsui women,movies cart man,kacang puteh seller,nightsoil carries...All these nostalgic scenes r constructed in a paper tole style n wooden structures. These r to pay tribute to the pioneers who helped to build Singapore. It gave the older folks a chance to reminiscence n younger generation to learn about the contribution of the pioneers."
,,Very beautiful,4.0,,"An amazing range of flowers and plants - a stunning place to visit! The ""restaurant"" inside is bit on the pricey side unfortunately but it looked like it had some tasty food!"
,,Really lovely,5.0,,Great place to visit we went here and the falls kids loved it got some great photos very educational in a fun way we payed for the double pass walked all around the gardens lots of walking to do these gardens and observatory
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,One of the must visit in Singapore. Around 10-15 by taxi from the city centre. You will need to spent at least 2-3 hours to visit the dome. They also provide a walking tour at the entrance. Mag Tang has done a very good job for the tour. She gave lots of information regarding the dome and Singapore history
,,A must see,5.0,,A place to visit when in Singapore Beautiful places Awesome for pics....please take a selfie stick If u don't have one get one....one place where indulgence is selfies is justified!
,,Flowers From the world,4.0,,"If you want a great place to see nature from around the world, then you need to visit the flower dome. After the cloud forest dome, we visited the flower dome. We were happy to see a section for the Australian flowers however it off course was great to see flowers from other countries. There is also some great statutes and architecture in the dome.

When we were there a staff member was taking photos as you enter. Make sure if you take a photo, you remember to go to the store and purchase it. we unfortunately forgot..."
,,Flowers at their best,4.0,,The flower dome is a magnificent array of plants and flowers from around the globe. The dome is split in to small areas with gardens from various countries. The display of Orchids the national flower of Singapore is beautiful. Whilst smaller than the Clouds dome this is still a lovely attraction to visit.
,,Enchanting,5.0,,"A different place upon entering the beautiful and colorful garden that houses more than 1,000 types of orchids that have bloomed amazingly."
,,Crowd,5.0,,"Very interesting place. I'm not the fans of plant nor flowers, but I still like here. However, many people visited here, so it's very crowd"
,,A nice break from the city,3.0,,"This is a lovely oasis in the middle of the city, it is located in the gardens by the bay complex by marina sands hotel.

There is plenty of variety and plants from around the world as well as one of the best orchid displays I have seen.

I felt that the overall concept was good, however it was spoilt somewhat by a band playing indoors with excessive volume, which meant you couldn't hold a conversation at times, this meant we ended up rushing through the final parts so we could get away from the noise. Without the band it would be the tranquil oasis most would be looking for.

This is probably a one off thing and it is unlikely we would return but an interesting way to pass an hour."
,,Can say we have been,3.0,,"We purchased as part of a package, visited the cloud dome first and found the flower dome a bit of a let down as the cloud dome was so good.
A good set out and lots of flowers to see but nothing like the cloud dome.
People who love flowers etc will find this a good place to visit and would enjoy it."
,,Great place for kids and adults alike,4.0,,"Great indoor gardens with plants and trees from around the world, kids garden and huge open space. Some great quirky features and culture. Amazing structure."
,,The plant world all under one roof,4.0,,"The flower dome is the leisure gardener's paradise. It presents thousands of plant varieties all meticulously laid out for viewing pleasure. The dome is arranged according to garden types and species. It's houses a lot of species that it can get overwhelming at times. The design of the dome keeps the flow of people moving thus, it never feels crowded even if there are a lot of visitors.

A must see for the plant lover!"
,,top atraction,5.0,,"This park is a different story if you can call it a park. First I though it was a little bit pricy when you just have been in Botanic garden, but not as this is total different"
,,Frangrance Heaven,5.0,,"Entering the Flower dome you are enveloped into this amazing array of Flowers from all over the world, the smell is absolutely beautiful."
,,Amazing Garden!,5.0,,A dreamy garden full of different plants and flowers! Truly amazing way to further appreciate nature and the beauty of flowers. A lot of different spots to take pretty pictures! The dome is also airconditioned so it made it easy to walk around and appreciate everything in it. Don't miss the area where the desert plants are! Lots of varieties of cacti! Very interesting!
,,The advancement of technology brings you flowers from all around the world in one place,5.0,,"i love the air-conditioned feeling inside the dome. In Singapore, this is very appreciated because it's hot and humid. The fresh smell of the plants fills the air and heightened your spirit. There are many varieties of plants from all around the world. There are cafe inside as well for you to feel totally indulged"
,,Cool aray of flowers...,4.0,,Most of these we have back home in Washington State but it was nice to see them on display along with a few new ones in Singapore. Personally we got more out of seeing the waterfall dome next door then the flower down but both were interesting and worth a visit.
,,Plant Lover's Bucket List,5.0,,"A ""must see"" if you are in Singapore and into plants. The theme changes seasonally (I believe). If they have an orchid display, I imagine it would be spectacular. Lots of wide paths and easy for any age to see the majority of it."
,,Nice great assortment of plants,4.0,,Was some beautiful plants the lay out was all over the place though people heading in all directions and some gardens were as though they were just thrown together but over all great place to visit and admire the hard work that has been put into this place
,,all a bit Disney for me,3.0,,Apart from the interesting baobab trees on the upper level this was all a bit too tacky for my taste.
,,Tulip's.....Wow !,4.0,,My two daughters enjoyed the Flower Dome the most as they spent all the time clicking pictures of themselves among all the beautiful and colourful flowers. They were most captivated by the large number of Tulips (during the ongoing festival) which they were experiencing for the first time. I also loved the Tulip exhibits despite not really being a flower person.
,,FLOWERS DOME WHICH YOU SHOULD NEVER MISS,4.0,,"This garden is adjacent to the (cloud dome) and is full of different types of flowers, which are nicely organized and planted. You will enjoy going through this air conditioned glass dome gardenand take many photos."
,,Beautiful building with many interesting plants,5.0,,Very beautiful place where you can take a rest form the heat. You get a chance to see lots of plants from many different places. The baobabs are particularly impressive!
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Flower dome is certainly worth a look lovely set up beautiful flowers - just don't pick a day when it's a public holiday you will be lining up to get in.
,,Monumental,5.0,,"No words to describe! Big, imposing, monumental! Every detail, every flower, every plant... You can find it here. Sustainability at the top. A work of the modern and art and a architectural project phenomenal!"
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful orchids and many other varieties of plant life displayed creatively as you wander through the many gardens and history.
,,Outstanding value,5.0,,Really awe inspiring leave enough time for this. It is worth the money. You could lose yourself and go down and watch the documentary on global warming. So enlightening. All are self sustain by the metal trees they are` solar.
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,this is one of two dome in Garden by The Bay.....inside this dome have collection of plants from all the world
,,Orchidzania at Singapore's Flower Dome,5.0,,"We went in time for Singapore's Golden Jubilee celebration. At the time (until 31st September 2015) the main features in the Flower Field were orchids - rows and rows of them. Some were really big and some were small. Never had I seen so many orchids in one place in my whole life. It truly was orchidzania in the Flower Dome.

There were many other types of plants from other regions. Towering Baobab trees almost reaching up to the ceiling, cacti, succulent plants and other flowering plants were on display.

It's easy to get lost though. As we were pressed for time and only wanted to see the orchids we kept reaching a dead-end. The pathways were not clearly labeled. You wouldn't have any clue that the enticing plants you're admiring will lead you to a cul de sac. It was like being in a colossal maze at times although not confusing. The Flower Dome is the world's largest columnless conservatory so yes, it's quite massive.

Bring a sweater as it might get chilly inside. For more tips please check my blog here http://globetrottingfilipina.com/orchidzania-at-singapores-flower-dome/. If you love flowers esp orchids it's definitely worth a peek."
,,Wow,4.0,,"What a lot to see and photograph, we arrived late afternoon, so got to see the flower done in both day and turning into night. Wow"
,,Flower scented dome,5.0,,"We loved it here, the flowers and plants are amazing. So many varieties of them. It's cold inside so you might wanna put on something warm. Great place to take pics and to just sit and enjoy the flowers. Take your time here for this dome is very soothing. Nice!."
,,Orchids Galore and not much more,3.0,,"I was anticipating a fabulous flower dome and was a little disappointed as it had been recommended by so many people.
It was pleasant but not spectacular and an hour will be about the right time to look at everything.

Orchids are lovely but not unique and other plants are the same as you would get in any well kept garden in England."
,,A riot of Colour and worth visiting,5.0,,"The Flower Dome was well worth the visit with garden sections from all around the world. Quite proud that I knew most of the plants in the Australian section. The whole dome is worth walking around from the Cactus section to the Orchid section. Plenty of photo opportunities amongst the wall of coloured flowers.
Would definitely go back for another visit and drink it all in again."
,,All depends on whats going inside,4.0,,"This is such a different experience to the cloud dome. We got lucky as there was an art display for kids which made it quite interesting. Check out what's on and decide for yourself but if you are there, then why not take a look."
,,"Ok, but botanical gardens may give better value if you're into plants.",4.0,,"If you're into flowers, then Singapore's botanical gardens may be more for you, especially if time is precious & it comes at a £12 price tag"
,,Great displays for SG 50,5.0,,On this visit to the Flower Dome there were excellent displays representing the culturally diverse neighbourhoods of Singapore.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,The Flower Dome plus Cloud Forest are both part of the fantastic Gardens By The Bay. They are massive indoor environments and in the case of the Flower Dome do showcase flora & fauna from different parts of the world! Uniquely Singapore!
,,Enjoyable but maybe trying too hard,4.0,,"Worth the visit as you can different flora from different continents in an air conditioned environment. In my opinion though the areas assigned to each 'garden' is too small and fails to do them justice. Not saying I didn't like it, but I still prefer the botanical gardens despite having to wander their without air-con."
,,A dome in the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"A fascinating array of gardens from various parts of the world including a spectacular display of orchids and some interesting trees. Amongst the gardens, you'll find wonderful sculpture; some made from driftwood and barks and almost camouflaged amongst the trees."
,,Another MUST of this amazing city,5.0,,"I just went there because, living in Singapore, I should go... Expectations were quite low because i don;t like this kind of places. But this Flower Dome is the exception! I love it!"
,,Must visit for children and flower lovers,4.0,,"Loved it.....it's a riot of colours and takes you to your childhood with humpty-dumpty, farm animals, shoe house etc. The variety of Mediterranean flowers you can see are amazing. There are nursery rhymes and songs played for children at all times."
,,A beautiful garden,5.0,,"Very good place to visit, both for children and adults. Modern yet artistic building with beautiful landscape design inside. In this dome we could learn a lot about plantation in the world, and the most enjoyable part for me was the flower area with colourful tulips. Love it! Entrance ticket was average, but it's worth to pay for. Better to spend more than 2 hours inside this dome, so you don't need to get rush when exploring the whole garden."
,,Dome plantings are lovely,5.0,,As part of the Garden by the Bay this is not to be missed. The dome is very cleverly constructed and the plantings are very lovely.
,,Unique Exhibits and Species of flowers I hadn't seen before,5.0,,"I'm a flower child and the Flower Dome was home to my soul. Species from around the globe were laid out carefully and featured the species of plants, cactus, trees and flora in a way that could be best enjoyed by all onlookers. My eyes drank in the beauty as I walked in a meditative and appreciative state.

There were two elementary schools which had children touring. I noticed that they had assignments to complete after each section. The thoughtful manner of discussion and teaching was impressive. Headsets are also provided to enhance the enjoyment of the experience. Each child had a headset.

Attendants are everywhere, pruning and taking care of the grounds with amazing detail and concern. This attention to detail was part of the culture and I it noticed throughout the entire city during my week long stay.

I enjoyed the educational exhibits which were eye-opening, as well as the unique garden sculptures placed amongst the plants. Beautiful design which I more than appreciate. Thumbs up and high fives too!"
,,Marvelous,5.0,,"Boasts of Trees, Flowers and Plants from all continents of the world. Various Cacti, Olive Trees to name a few."
,,"A bit contrived and kitsch, reminded me of a giant garden centre",3.0,,"Whilst the structure is stunning and the temperature just lovely compared to the heat outside this dome is sometimes rather too manicured for my taste. Various temperate gardens are laid out with paths to walk through, and lead to the main attraction, which is a large display that changes to different themes every few weeks - tulips, nursery rhymes, Easter, Christmas etc. usually accompanied by models and sculptures this always reminds me of a large European garden centre! This part can get very crowded at weekends.

My husband likes it - but several visitors have come from Europe and commented that they find it rather 'naff'!

Upstairs there's a lovely cactus / baobab display which is always our favourite part. Stunning large cacti and trees, and usually much quieter than the crowded ground floor. If visiting don't miss this bit!"
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"It was worth walking in the dome. Nice attractions and beautiful flowers. There are better attractions in Singapore I agree but once you are in the Gardens by the Bay you want to see everything, right? ;-)"
,,Must visit place for Singa,5.0,,"Flower dome has so so many variety of flowers from all parts of the world. Since I am crazy for flowers, it was pleasure to the eye."
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,What a gorgeous display of all things floral. We spent much longer than we'd expected as the display was just so beautiful. Would definitely recommend.
,,Not really worth the time,2.0,,"Visited this in my latest trip to Singapore. To be honest, didn't find it much attracting. The coexistence of the futuristic dome design with nature was probably the only thing that had any interest to me. Other than that I would save the time and the money for other activities."
,,"An amazing attraction, well worth visiting.",5.0,,"A beautiful place and no rushing around, this is a superb attraction with very helpful and friendly staff, I loved it!"
,,Not my cup of tea,3.0,,Personally not a flower and garden fan so did not appreciate it. and entry is a little too steep. with so many other things to do in Singapore as a traveler you need to prioritize.
,,Wow plants.,5.0,,Fabulous mix of plants and locales. Hours and hours of fascinating viewing and incredible pictures to take.
,,Relaxing and informative gardens,4.0,,"This place is amazing. The architecture of the building is incredible. The different gardens created inside the dome are so beautiful and informative (my favorite is the baobabs garden). The flow of the visitors is very well managed and you don't even notice the crowds.
The only thing that I feel is missing is the possibility of renting an audio guide.
The price for the Flower Dome + Cloud Forest is 28$."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Never seen so many beautiful,flowers landscaped so well,came home to revamp my garden. The choice of colours and plants were amazing."
,,Fragrant delighte!,5.0,,"A most pleasant experience, so many beautiful blooms, They are constantly changing the design and lay out, so a second visit another time is well worth it!"
,,"Flower Dome, Singapore",5.0,,"Spring time inside in a controlled environment; colour, fragrance,lit up at night.It was quite an experience. Was being enjoyed by a lot of people;always a good sign!"
,,Awsome,5.0,,Very unique experience. We had to rush to the airport so we had only one hour. The way they built that place is very intresting. You need at least 2 hours
,,Greenhouse Bliss,5.0,,Enjoy the cool fresh air while admiring the beautiful foliage and decor within a giant dome. This attraction is not to be missed whether you are a nature lover or not.
,,Nice yet pricey,5.0,,Nice but a bit pricey for foreigners. Good place to see different species of flora. Accessible by MRT. Check the opening hours.
,,Worth the visit. Lovely displays.,4.0,,"Flora from all over the world featured there. Saw our Aussie Woolly bush, banksia, proteus etc. Floral displays were nicely put together & spread out. The various levels created a 'forest-like' atmosphere, the wood carvings of goose, dragon, bird,the merlion were spectacular. The climate control in the dome was fantastic! Lots of orchids everywhere - lovely! Worth the visit!"
,,Very pretty,4.0,,As with the cloud forest this was just a nice walk. The price for both tickets is about $30 but they are pleasant and worth the money in my view. While I probably wouldn't come again I am glad I have been. Both this and the cloud forest are a welcome change form the hustle and bustle of Singapore city.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,We had a great time here since the flowers are so beautiful! It is very nice and chilly inside the conservatory so you don't to worry much about the weather.
,,Fun place to visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Fun place to visit because there isn't anything like it! Pretty large place and it can take 1-2 hours to tour the whole dome.

Lots of similar things in the dome, but they did a great job on the architecture and setup as you walk through different 'locations/climates/etc.'"
,,Wonderful,4.0,,Loved the flower displays in this dome. So many colorful orchids and unusual blooms. It was definitely worth the trip.
,,"Unique, impressive and fascinating",4.0,,"It is easy to visit this attraction at Garden by the Bay. I stayed around Yew Tee and took the MRT directly to Marina Bay. The train took about 51 mins to reach Marina Bay. On reaching Marina Bay station, I took the Circle Line train to Bayfront MRT station which is only one station after Marina Bay. Once out of Bayfront Station, I turned right and walk towards Gardens By the Bay. I was within the Gardens by the Bay the moment I walked out of the Bayfront MRT station.

There is a shuttle bus thereby but it costs $2/- to take the shuttle bus to the entrance of the Flower Dome. I did not take the shuttle bus but instead took about 10 mins to walk to the entrance of the attraction. Before you start walking look at the map outside the Bayfront MRT station, it should show you the route. The route includes walking across the dragonfly bridge and then walked cross to the Malay Garden, then, the Chinese Garden and the Indian Garden and you are right at the entrance of the Flower Dome. The scenery along the way is breathtaking and you could also view the fantastic and scenic Supertree Grove from the Chinese Garden.

I did not proceed to the ticket counter as I had a complimentary entrance ticket. The Dome was glaringly bright and so comfortably cooling with indoor air-conditioning and beautiful charming plants and flowers. It contrasted with the hot scorching and hazy afternoon weather outside. It was so relaxing and there was soothing band music and singing from a stage at the center of the dome.

There was also a floral exhibition of the Singapore Stories with wonderful and colorful species of orchid decorated abundantly and beautifully amid the few artifacts display. The legend of the Sang Nila Utama King of Srivijaya Kingdom who came across a lion when he visited Singapore and named this country Temasek was prominently and vividly shared at the entrance of the hall. I like the rest of the sections on Tanjong Pagar, the Radin Mas, etc with the local orchid display.

It was the stunning collection of flowers, trees and baobabs of Australia, Mediterranean, the South Americans, African continent that captivated my attention. Those rare species that existed in those temperate cool climates were uniquely stunning and gorgeous. I have not been to these regions and it was an eye-opener able to appreciate the flora and fauna from these regions and it made me want to travel to these regions to view these vegetation.

In fact, the wonderful displays made me so relax and so near to nature that I almost forgot that I am in a bustling city. Industrialization and urbanization have altered city landscapes and implanted architectural stunning skyscrapers, gorgeous marinas and efficient infrastructure with speedy train and transportation system, sophisticated mega sea ports and airports. Suburbs are filled with factories, and petro chemical complexes churning out hardware, chemical by products, plastic resins that flooded the industry markets. We boast of a First World metropolis city and capable of a high standard of living. But the costs is devastating environmental pollution that gradually suffocated us into a cancerous contaminated age.

It is thus marvelous to see such a Flower Dome contributing an oxygenated environment to human kind."

,,"Stunning collection of flowers, trees and baobabs",5.0,,"This is an amazing collection of many, many flowers and trees, and a jaw dropping collection of beautiful baobab trees.

,,"Great outing with mom, good for relaxed day trip",5.0,,"Very fun experience, all indoors so don't have to worry about heat/ rain. Great variety of flowers, with an exhibit of tulips when we went. A must see for plant / flower lovers. we spent the morning here and the afternoon at the other dome, cloud forest--was very fun! then we went to the supertrees to watch the lights show at 745pm. for lunch, we walked over to the hokka stalls nearby from some satay. you can combine these areas with marina bay sands and the shoppes at marina bay, will surely be an all-day affair"
,,Flowers and flowers! Very colorful.,5.0,,Plants and flowers from all over the world. The palm trees and baobab trees are awesome and huge. Very informative.
,,Pleasure for eyes and nose ;),5.0,,"Some trees are incredibly unusual, and there are more types of flowers than I can expected in such small area. You need to have a jacket before going there, it really cold place."

,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore this must be on your list of have to see"". the best part is the whole dome is air conditioned and one can walk around and see the various flowers and plants that they have planted. each quarter in the main area there is a themed presentation and it is not something to be missed, they seem to raise the bar with each theme. in the dome itself there is a very nice up market café with fine wines and great coffee and it is a great place just to relax and chill out. you will need at least about an hour and half just of the dome to really enjoy it."
,,"My kid loved it, all depends what your take on flowers is!",3.0,,"I came here for one reason. My toddler needed a run around and here it's cool and outside its hot and he likes flowers. So win, win.

I can see flower lovers really enjoying this. I'm less concerned about arranged flower displays and so whilst parts are pretty it isn't something that would grab me.

That said, it's an impressive structure."
,,A must see for garden lovers,5.0,,A must see if you enjoy gardens and flowers. an hour or two is sufficient depending on your interest. We had lunch in here which was quite a relaxing break. the souvenir shops were also a joy to shop or just admire the goods.
,,Amazing show of colour,5.0,,Seeing flowers and plants from all over the world together in one place is remarkable. How do they keep everything in such perfect bloom? Loved the special displays depicting Singaporean myths and legends.
,,A Must See,5.0,,Was such a beautiful place and SO MANY COLOURS!! Definitely have a look at this location.. Quite a romantic place to visit too if it's not over crowded with tourists.
,,"Passable, but nothing spectacular.",3.0,,"A large complex filled with various plants. Nothing terribly spectacular. It's a pretty run-of-the-mill garden. What *is* worthwhile seeing though, is the architecture. The steel and glass of the roof is complete with curves and edges, and the sloping walkways are a view to behold from the various vantage points inside.

There are also a few wooden(?) sculptures placed at various points throughout the dome which are quite unique and beautiful. The dragon sculpture in particular is quite intriguing."
,,A dome of flowers,4.0,,Its a park of different continents with their trees and flowers arranged accordingly. Its an easy stroll but better do it before sunset as its slightly dark once its night.
,,It's okay...,3.0,,"The only thing I can say here is that it is picturesque. I went here in July and the flowers are nothing special. I'm not much of a nature person so I don't really find it interesting. It's nice to experience but other than that, there is really no wow-factor for me. Place is also kid-friendly."
,,Flowers and more Flowers,5.0,,Beautiful place. It was nice to see the different gardens from across the globe. the flowers were beautiful.
,,Flowers everywhere,4.0,,"I have visited the flower dome a few times now and each time its different (Chinese New Year, Valentines, Christmas themes) it never fails to amaze. I find it interesting that they change their exhibition and flower range more often than I imagined. A nice place to escape the hot day outside to enjoy the amazing flower and foliage indoors. The Dome is divided into sections (succulents, flowering, etc) and is air-conditioned.

Would visit again during a different season to experience a different theme."
,,Cloud Forest is Better,3.0,,"I came to Singapore on a layover and checked out Gardens by the Bay and all that it entails. I paid for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Cloud Forest was much cooler than the Flower Dome in my opinion. I found myself pretty bored in the Flower Dome. I wish I hadn't spent my money on it and just did the Cloud Forest. It wasn't terrible, but it was not exceptional either."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Something every visitor to Singapore should see an truly amazing place to visit. Such beautiful flowers
,,better for tourist and family,4.0,,"Clean and cold inside dome. Take a walk two of dome. Different place from out side. Better for Tourist and family. Not good for alone. Take lunch at outside of dome, you can eat Asian food."

,,6 themed gardens,5.0,,Be amazed by the beauty of the 6 themed gardens nurtured with tender loving care by the carefully regulated climate control and water/nutrition feed. The decorations are changed with every festival season.
,,Overhyped,2.0,,"The rest of the Gardens by the Bay was a good experience, but I found the flower dome not worth the entry ticket. Merely a collection of flowers and plants of different places, similar to the ones you can find in botanical gardens across the glove. If you don´t have enough time to visit all the Gardens, I advise you to skip this one."
,,OUTSTANDING INDOOR GARDENS,5.0,,"I have done a separate review of Gardens by the Bay, but as a result of this magnifient Flower Dome, i have done another review.
Spectacular and innovative in design it is really outstanding. This indoor garden replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions, South Africa and California. Being a South African I was amazed at the number of plants from our country and how beautiful specimens orginate there.Be aware that it is pretty cool inside and one need to take some extra clothing if one feels the cold.
A great experience."
,,You love flowers come here!!,4.0,,A great display of flowers found across various regions. This makes for a visually appealing scene inside the dome. You will love this if you are a nature lover..else just for some photo opportunity. Unfortunately my visit coincided with weekend and was too crowded to let me appreciate their beauty. One good thing is there are staff around who are ever willing to take your snaps!
,,Vibrant flowers and plants,4.0,,"A smaller place as compare with Cloud Forest. However, this place has more vibrant flowers and plants that promise many photo taking opportunity. It is recommended to spend 45mins to an hour in Flower Dome.
To complete your Garden by the bay visit, do give Cloud Forest a visit too."
,,amazing indoor garden...,4.0,,"Hmm nice place to go...especially if your a nature lover (flower lover)..landscape wonderful,much flower inside,the weather is cold better bring something to cover your body if u can't tolerate the coldness.you will see the different colors of flower inside.

,,A visual Delight,5.0,,This is apparently the worlds largest Glasshouse. Impressive with exotic plants from around the world & of course an abundance of orchids. Amazing artwork & sculptures dotted within the plantings.
,,Great indoor garden but pity about the music,4.0,,Enjoyed the plant display but why have the music playing. Spoilt it. The range of plants was good with some marvellous specimens but not as good as the cloud forest.
,,Tourist trap,2.0,,"Unless you are Elton John, and/or a super obsessive fan of flowers, this is really just a money pit. You see pretty flowers, but that's about it. Head over to the Botanic Gardens instead."
,,sweet place,5.0,,"if you like nature, you have to visit this place! Very comfort to hide there from the hot. Many places to take pics."
,,worth seeing,5.0,,another fantastic place to wander around and see plants from other parts of the world also different statues made of wood

,,People interested in flower gardens need to go,4.0,,"The flower dome is wonderful for people who are interested in flowers. The range of flowers is fantastic and the airconditioning environment is exceptionally well managed to facilitate a wide geographic garden display.

The best part of the dome is the focus on some exceptionally interesting but not normally seen flowers and plants from throughout the world."
,,amazing,5.0,,"many many many beautiful flowers with amazing sight , It was a breath taking place , beautiful flowers all over the worled"

,,Pretty Flowers Bloom for You and Me,4.0,,"Singapura, oh Singapura,
Pretty flowers bloom for you and me!

I brought my wife on her birthday and she had an amazing time. As a flower lover, she took numerous shots of and with the flowers.

Good that there was good air-con.

The theme was nusery rhymes and that was the part I enjoyed. All in all, it was a good time at the Flower Dome."
,,Domed greenhouse featuring flora from across the globe,5.0,,"Together with the stroll along the waterfront, garden by the sea, and the cloud forest, this makes an extraordinary day. This massive dome host a cross-section of trees, plants, cacti, flowers from across the globe. Although a tad cultivated, it is definitely one of the top three botanical gardens I've been to. If you spend a few days in Singapore, this is a must-see."
,,Plants from over the word!,4.0,,"There is no a clear path to follow so I had to wander inside. This dome is divided in sections like succulent plants, baobabs, Mediterranean zones... Uncountable number of plants were present, most of them were very beautiful. Admist the vegetation there were some amazing wooden sculptures that integrated very well with the environment; some of them represented legends from Singapore. Huge transparent frames that looked like postards were present so the tourists could take photos. A lot of effort was put on alerting the visitor that many of these plants are endangered by the man's activities."
,,My fave place in Singapore to date!,5.0,,"Our trip here saw us amongst a plethora of fairy tales - the theme in the Flower Dome for July is Nursery Rhyme Land. It is brilliant! Colourful, whimsical and we found ourselves humming nursery rhymes long forgotten (kids are all grown up now).

Really bought a smile to our dials and was our fave area of Gardens By The Bay."
,,Beautiful..,4.0,,Great attraction to visit while in Singapore. Also a great place to visit if its raining - like it was when we went.
,,Expensive.,1.0,,"Impressive and beautiful. However, it is very expensive. Everything from entrance fee, transport, drinks, snacks are expensive."
,,An interesting experience even for smaller children,4.0,,"Try to see this exhibit as part of a twin ticket with the Cloud Forest. Personally, the latter is my favourite of the two but this one is still very much worth the visit. It's more open than Cloud Forest and lots to see for even smaller children. Some unusual statues amongst the plants are worth looking at for themselves. All nicely done and perfectly ordered as one would expect."
,,Enjoyed immensely,5.0,,"A must along with the cloud walk, reasonably priced, great value for your money...... so well thought out...really enjoyable"
,,Fower Dome- Natures beauty under one roof,5.0,,Flower dome is a huge dome with many exotic species of plants and trees from all over the world under one roof. The whole place is temperature controlled. I have never seen so many exotic flowers in one place. Takes atleast 3 hours to see the whole place.
,,Looks and Smells great!,5.0,,Lovely lovely place. Its worth the trip and price of entry. Its air conditioned and and you can browse and visit in comfort. The scents of the flowers alone make the visit worth the time and money..
,,Beautiful flowers.,5.0,,Beautiful flowers which we really enjoyed together with the cloud forest. Gardens by the bay is a must-visit.
,,Not the typical botanical garden,5.0,,"Check to see what the theme or event is prior to going. We went to see the tulips, very pretty and interesting to see how they can plant and change the theme of the flower dome within days. Everything is labeled really well and flowers were from all over the world. Bring a shall or scarf, it gets chilly in certain parts if your wearing shorts and a tank top."
,,Paradise,5.0,,I was smitten by this beautiful place. Quite close to childhood fantasies. Do visit this beautiful dome having the most beautiful and diverse flowers from various continents put together. Visit during day light hours for the best view.
,,Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,"Even if you have a 6 or more hour stopover and want something to do - Gardens by the Bay is a must visit - there are over 700,000 plants from around the world. Even an Aussie garden"
,,A great activity for all ages,5.0,,"Flowers everywhere! This will appeal to all ages, not just those with green fingers. Our children were hugely engaged and loved the visit."
,,Great Potential but somewhat disappointing,3.0,,When you arrive at the FREE Gardens by the Bay site you have to buy two tickets for the entry into the two domes - the flower dome is the cheaper so I suppose it is wortrh it but it was somewhat under whelming- I thought I was walking into some great green house but its not - Its a display of garden plants from around the world - AUstralia / South Africa / Mediterranean / South Americas and California - It was ok - the plants are not permanent as hey are mostly in pots and so they die and are replaced - Saying that The flowers were very colourful and the cacti and succulents were very interesting - what I found amazing was the wooden tree branches moulded into animal shapes. I think this place could be more amazing than it is with a little more thought - but in saying that- we did enjoy it and its worth doing as part of the tour of the CLoud. as well.
,,Nice,4.0,,Didn't like this as much as the cloud forest but definately go see it. A wedding here would be great if possible.
,,amazing flower dome,4.0,,"amazing and wonderfull flower dome to see., you must seeing by your self cause a lof of beautifull flower."

,,Worth a visit,4.0,,This is a part of the gardens by the bay. Definately Worth a visit. Many plant and flowering species here
,,Flower Power!,5.0,,"Full of flowers and other flora species to be amazed by, and the according to various seasons, thematic displays of flowers are made throughout the year, so you can easily re-visit this place again. Also, it is a great respite from the heat, outside the Dome! haha! Do get a good camera, and snap away!"
,,Wonderful place...,4.0,,Must visit for botanists and children. The variety of flowers and hues are amazing. The place gives you a feel of being in physical garden except that you can visit seamlessly all the continents except Antarctica!!!
,,Worth a visit if unusual flowers are your thing!,5.0,,"Fantastic flowers of all kinds and colors; endless kinds, colors, sizes nod many unusual flowers. It was air conditioned so it was comfortable moving around the gardens."
,,Different,4.0,,"Well laid out with some nice themes, interesting to see some plants and flowers from other parts of the world that you are unlikely to see yourself."
,,A must see,5.0,,I have been at various times for the different displays. The tulip display was just beautiful and the perfume of the other flowers was overwhelming.
,,"Flowers, trees and plants of the world",5.0,,"A wonderful place to see lots of different flowers, plants and trees in beautifully designed area. Make sure you see this during the day as the lighting at night makes it hard to take photos."
,,Fantastic Building,4.0,,"For me the building was the attraction. However, the Flower Dome is filled with collections from around the world. I found the soundtrack of high pitched voices singing nursery rhymes irritation. Others however, may not! It is lovely and cool inside and an escape from the heat outside. $28 for entry to both domes. There does not seem to be the option of purchasing a ticket for just one unless you are resident."
,,Beautiful displays,5.0,,On the day of our visit the theme was Nursery Rhymes and the displays for this were absolutely wonderful. Each area of the flower dome was well kept and beautifully presented. The cacti area was exceptional

,,Lovely for Kids,4.0,,The flower dome is beautiful for children as it is nursery rhyme themed. Definitely take your camera and a light jumper as it can get quite cold in there.
,,Spectacular Display,5.0,,"The experience of walking through an array of plants and flowers from many parts of the world is simply stunning.
The Domes are air conditioned and quite cool, a jacket is preferable while wandering around.
Allow a minimum of 1.5 hours for a visit. longer if able.
The layout is superb with many unusual species but the crowning glory is the flower display along with the children's nursery rhyme music.

Anyone would love it"
,,Spectacular and innovative,5.0,,"Step into the world’s largest column less greenhouse the Flower Dome, and you’ll be standing in awe of nature. Spectacular and innovative in design, it is one of the icons of Bay South Garden. The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like South Africa, California and parts of Spain and Italy. Home to a collection of plants from deserts all over the world, it showcases the adaptations of plants to arid environments. Stop and smell the flowers in the colourful changing displays of the Flower Field, which reflects different seasons, festivals and themes.
Enjoy a cooling and leisurely stroll through the Flower Dome and experience the eerie profile of the baobabs, surrounded by fascinating succulents. Immerse yourself in the spectacular view of the Marina reservoir skyline, as you embark on your journey through the Mediterranean Basin, South West Australia, South Africa, Central Chile and California. You'll discover amazing plants and flowers from different corners of the globe, and you'll be amazed by how different parts of the trees are used in daily lives across different cultures. To avoid the long queues, I would recommend booking your tickets online. It’s worth the visit."

,,"You don't have to go travelling to see flowers, just come to the Flower Dome",5.0,,"Yes, that""s right! The Flower Dome contains almost all the flowers in the world! An experience there would be unforgettable."
,,Cool flowers,5.0,,"We visited the place last week and I'm loving it. The dome is cool with the temperature around 18-20 degree Celsius . The flowers are pretty and they are changing theme every season. I want to see the tulips but I guess this is not the season for them. I see a lot of beautiful summer flowers and enjoying the cool temp inside. Do bring a jacket if you're not a fan of cold.

The area is not big but not small too. Flowers from many parts of the worlds are here. It is a great place that offers different sides of Singapore."
,,Time well spent,5.0,,"Did both Domes at the Gardens at the Bay and spent many happy hours viewing all the plants and flowers, excellent displays and took several hours to comlete"

,,An Amazing and Very Different Garden,4.0,,"Even from the outside, one would be awed by the architecture of the Flower Dome. Upon entering, one immediately appreciates the welcoming cool air that pleasantly contrasts with the sweltering tropical heat of Singapore. Environment and architecture aside, the floral arrangements and varieties on display...More"
,,A must see with its counterpart the,4.0,,This was fabulous but the Cloud Forest (its counterpart) was our favourite of the two. There was a special exhibition on at the time with nursery rhymes and very clever plant and flower themes set up with nursery rhyme characters.
,,spectacular time for the whole family,5.0,,"I would love to take my grandson here. there is something for everyone and even those lovely childhood nursery rhymes featured are fantastic for adults. The driftwood sculptures of animals, dragons etc are so clever."

I thought it was well set out with lots of variety, beautiful plants and interesting sculptures. It's definitely worth paying the entrance fee.
We also visited the restaurant called Pollen which is located inside the dome and had a lovely lunch."
,,Cloud Forest is Ok but the Flower Dome is Exceptional,5.0,,"So of the 2 domes, this is the one that I think is something any visitor to Singapore should strongly consider if you are here a few days. The Flower Dome is massive and the plants are just beautiful. There is such variety and so many intricate and unique flowers. We were taking pictures of all kinds of cool flowers. I've been to a couple of exhibits of flowers before and nothing compares to this one. It was well worth it for us and we just loved it. And the dome is a nice climate controlled area to spend a couple hours in."
,,Great displays,4.0,,"Expensive but very well done. The flower displays, plants and themes are very colourful but the plants are common to Australia so there was nothing really unusual or rare to see."
,,Visit Both Domes,5.0,,Not sure which one is my favorite both domes are excellent and the whole are is just beautiful and well maintained. Stay for the light show at night
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,We were here during Chinese New Year and the flower dome had put on a beautiful display. If you have the time to spend here you can easily spend half a day just wandering around and drinking in all the beauty.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I can't believe they made all these things out of flowers. It was so fun to wonder through here. To our surprise, it was air conditioned!!"
,,flower,5.0,,"Beautiful flowers....feeling cold inside, lovely flowers. shes cover all around. great place, and great service."
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"I recommend coming to the Flower Dome...and touring all areas of the Gardens at the Bay. During this visit, they had flowers and topiaries on display in childrens' nursery ryhme themes, Touring the dome took about 2 hours; I recommend visiting during the warm afternoon hours to escape the heat/humidity outside. (The dome is air conditioned.)"
,,Pretty but artificial,3.0,,Nice to see all the plants in one place... but everything feels contrived. May be worth one visit... but not sure if I'd go back.
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,This was excellent in the top 5 things to do and highly recommend. One display was children's nursery rhymes with the most beautiful flowers. The other was plants from around the world. So well done
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A part of Gardens by the Bay, its well worth looking at and paying for a ticket, its amazing to walk around, and good for getting out of the humidly"
,,Smells like home,5.0,,"Great variety of plants, well presented. Walking amongst the eucalypts reminded me of the smells of home"
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,Was easy to get to from the MRT. Was cool and relaxing walking around the garden. It was well worth it
,,A great morning outing,4.0,,"This is 1 of the 2 greenhouses at Gardens by the Bay. Whilst I felt Cloud Forest was more for me, this wasn't too bad either.

For me, this was more of a traditional greenhouse with recognisable plants and trees. The greenhouse shows off plants from all over the world. The most enjoyable part for me was the section in the middle of the greenhouse that had flowers showing off nursery rhymes. The had giant flower wasps, cows, spiders etc. Spend a few hours wondering around and taking in the sights."
,,Beautiful and enjoyable walk,4.0,,"The price online is including entry to Cloud Forest are $28 for Adult and $15 for Children. However, you will be able to get cheaper tickets if you were to buy it from the travel agents located in Chinatown area. As the whole area is air-con, there is no problem in visiting during the day and enjoy the walk in the sun minus the heat."
,,The Dome,5.0,,Not to be missed some very exotic flowers very much worth a look. Buying one ticket gets you into the three attractions.
,,Awesome place to visit,5.0,,"Quite big crowds when we went so next visit would go in the morning, check online to see what displays are on as they change every couple of weeks, take a walk to stay on the bay after for the best ever lunch"
,,An enjoyable morning outing,5.0,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay two years ago, but did not go to the Flower Dome, as there were long waiting lines at the ticket counter. This time we took a taxi from our hotel to arrive early, there were no lines at the ticket counter and we enjoyed our visit immensely, not only because the temperature was cooler than outside. Access and walking around the dome was easy. The Flower Dome had many displays on Nursery Rhyme themes, which were a joy to photograph for our grandchildren. We also visited the Cloud Forest Dome. We stayed for a light lunch and a coffee at the restaurant near the souvenir shop before taking a taxi back to our hotel – a very enjoyable morning.
Be sure to arrive early and check that schools are not on holiday, as it can get very crowded at times."

,,Surprising and worthwhile,5.0,,This is an impressive selection of plants separated into different geographical regions... Everything from tulips to Baobabs. It hasn't been open for that long but you could never guess. Some of the trees are massive and you wonder how they got them in there.
,,Cool and beautiful,5.0,,"Definitely a ""must"" to go inside the dome where the tulips are displayed. They have done all different themes with so many varieties of tulips and other flowers. It is a real delight to walk around and view."
,,"Nice, but pricy",4.0,,"You may add a visit to the Flower Dome, while strolling through Gardens by the Bay, the entry is a bit pricy. Foresee more time at the more impressive Cloud Forest."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,So many different plants from all continents. Air conditioned under the dome so great to be there on a hot day outside. Had a special display on Tulips and fairytales when I was there - an absolute delight for children of all ages (and the young at heart). Cafe and restaurant inside the dome so great places to sit and relax with flowers around. Great views outside the dome as well.
,,"not worth it, overrated",2.0,,"almost all the flowers and plants were green when we visited! i could have walked outside and i would still see the same green boring plants. there were no vibrant colors and exotic flowers as they advertise on the brochure, at least not when we visited in june. i was hoping to be mesmerized by beautiful flowers but instead only few types were interesting. definitely not worth it. very overrated."
,,"An amazing array of flowers, so beautiful",4.0,,"This place is an absolute must for any gardener, it has every conceivable flower and plant from around the world, beautiful statues and colour galore! We spent hours there just wondering around and taking it all in."
,,Beautiful colors,5.0,,"This dome is artificially cooled and enclosed so it's never too warm. So many species of plant life thriving inside. Sometimes it tulip time sometimes it french flowers. There's also many varieties of orchid and fern, exotic plants like bottle tree. Good place to shoot pictures."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Never knew so many different flowers existed! What an education! Wonderfully set up, we found it to be great!"
,,Great Gift Shop,5.0,,"Its worth a visit and the gift shop is great. There is a 2$ ""taxi/lift"" to get you to and from the domes. You can get the ""taxi"" from the entrance either from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel walk way or at the end of the underpass from the MRT station"
,,Awesome display,5.0,,The flower dome conservatory was just magnificent- displays were informative and intriguing. My favourites were the wooden sculptures of the dragon and eagle
,,impressive,5.0,,"So good, gardens of the world and also a nursery rhyme world. My grandkids would have loved it. They played the nursery rhymes of the gardens shown and it was hard not to sing along."
,,The Flower Dome,5.0,,"I take been taking visitors to the Flower Dome ever since it opened. It has been wonderful to see the 1,000 year old olive trees come to life. Usually each month is a different theme in the flower dome and I think the best months to go are when the tulips are in flower which is usually in April/May. It is magnificent and a must to see if visiting Singapore."
,,Beautiful Architecture,4.0,,This attractions is located near gardens by the bay and cloud forest. Girls will love this place as they can take pictures with all the flower decorations.
,,Full of flowers everywhere!,4.0,,"Please do not bother to go if you are not especially keen on flowers, you may end up bored. Instead choose cloud forest, it gives you a waterfall experience. However, if you are interested in flowers this is where you belong. Its huge and beautiful with every breed of flower you can imagine. Its clear and so well maintained. Quiet cool way of showing nature."
,,Beautiful award winning tourist treat,5.0,,Located next to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark Towers and sharing the second half of an amazing glasshouse construction curiously reminiscent of an giant size glass brassiere when viewed from the Skypark these gardens are a constantly evolving international theme park of horticultural inspiration and colour. Definitely a 'must see' tourist stop.
,,Surprises!,5.0,,Brilliant is the best word here for colourful and imaginative displays. The Nursery Rhyme music added a wonderful atmosphere for adults and kids alike.
,,Fantastic experience in this amazing dome!,5.0,,"A dome filled with beautiful gardens - plants, trees and flowers from around the world. The dome is air conditioned so you can take your time to wander. The most fantastic collection of cacti and succulents was a highlight"
,,Interesting vegetations,5.0,,"The first thing that I liked most was the unique vegetation from around the world which I had not seen before, especially the non-tropical ones. I also liked the aircon but only in the afternoon. In noon, although the aircon was the same temperature, I could still feel the heat of the sun and the light was felt too bright to appreciate the vegetation."
,,Beauty of Flowers,5.0,,"Attached to the Gardens by the Bay, the Flower dome has so many varieties of flowers and plantations, that its difficult to visit all. An entertaining and learning experience rolled into one, it is even better when you leave the humid environs of the GBB (because of the large scale greenery and Singapore's famed tropical weather) to the wonderfully chilled Flower dome. It is refreshing. There are may places with flower installations, its just the way the presentation has been done that it looks interesting to all age groups.

They keep on running new themes time and again as well. During my visit they had the Nursery Rhymes theme going on and the kids loved it.

Must see!"
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,"Definitely worth the small entrance fee to visit the Flower Dome and see different plant habitats from around the world.

Didn't appeal to me as much as the Cloud Forest but that's because it's more geared to be child-friendly, with nursery-themed garden displays-still extremely well done and stunning though- and nursery tunes playing.

However, if it nourishes a child's interest in gardening, that can only be a good thing!"
,,A very pleasant way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"It is a long walk to get here from the train station, there is a shuttle bus but we missed it. It is a fun and informative way to experience plants from a variety of different climates. The displays are grouped by geographic region so you get to feel like you have travelled to landscapes all over the world without leaving the comfort of the indoor dome."
,,Beautiful !!,5.0,,"Lush greenery in the centre of the gardens..spectacular views of flowers...A great walk, entry fee is there.."
,,Very Beautiful,5.0,,"The variety of plants and flowers they have in there are stunning, we went when there were some special exhibits for nursery rhymes and the place was beautiful, definitely worth going with family."
,,Will not pay to go here again,2.0,,"Pretty, but way to expensive for what it is. If you LOVE flower and plants and would like to see different one from all around the world, maybe you will appreciate this place more than we did."
,,Just do it,5.0,,We had a lovely day here. Cleverly set out and a pleasure to visit. Coupled with the other dome and the gardens this is a big day though.
,,Boring,3.0,,"the wife loved this place as she loves flowers , for me it was boring , but when on holiday keep smiling"
,,Nursery rhymes was the best!,5.0,,The flower displays around nursery rhymes was the best! Beautiful and creative! The other displays had flowers I have never seen before!
,,Loved the cacti!,5.0,,"We visited both the conservatories at Gardens by the Bay, and although I preferred the Cloud Forest, the Flower Dome was still very impressive. I loved the succulents and cacti section, the size of some of the plants was pretty impressive. It got pretty busy in sections (visiting on a weekend) and dodging through people taking selfies was tricky - but definitely worth a visit."
,,Story Time Theme - A Photographers Dream,5.0,,"The Flower Dome has recently used a range of English and Asian nursery rhymes in the layers gardens with wonderful props and animals to tell the stores. From the entry to the garden, you walk in an upward spiral via waterfalls and through levels of flower beds and this replicates what the forest would be like based on filtered light. A cool escape from the hot Singaporean temperatures for both young and old visitors."
,,"Temporate flowers in multitude, some added plastic",2.0,,I found this disappointing after the Cloud Forrest. Mainly flowers which you can see in any temperate botanics. Some added plastic for colour.
,,NATURE <3,5.0,,"If you love flowers and are found of nature , do visit here ! my sister liked this place and its a nice place for photography also :)"
,,Good for families.,4.0,,"Good for families to go and see, especially the tulip exhibition that was on but really you could have been anywhere in the world."
,,Amazing,4.0,,Various plants and trees collections were put in air conditioned dome. Collection itself did not look great but we were made so comfortable to spend a lot of time here.
,,Beautiful Garden!,5.0,,"Love the garden, especially when my children enjoy it. The theme was chinese new year. Beautiful decorated with all the CNY theme. Need a charging location for phone, took too many pictures till my camera phone went flat. It is worth your time and money!"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,The flower dome was well laid out and well worth going to see. It was also a very pleasant oasis out of the heat. The Pollen café/restaurant inside was good for a quiet drink. It is also worth going to the cloud dome next door. They are good value.
,,Do it!,5.0,,"A truly sensational experience, the culmination of man made marvel and nature at it's best, this attraction certainly showcases what Singapore has to offer."
,,Not very exciting,3.0,,"I was really looking forward to the Flower Dome, it was high on my list but walked out really disappointed. There really wasn't a lot of flowers and most were typical standard flowers, nothing fancy or exotic which i was more expecting to find just due to the name.
The lay out was confusing and we found we were walking around in circles a lot.
The only good part was the tulip garden and gingerbread house in the very center.
Entry was $28 which included the Cloud Forest for an adult. Kinda glad that the 2 places are included in the one price, otherwise paying for just the Flower Dome I feel would be a waste of money."
,,festival flowers are fantastic,5.0,,best part of flower dome is they hv theme based set-up for festivals and events...and its quite a enjoyable place for nature lovers.
,,A delight for everyone even if they do not have a green thumb.,5.0,,"This was my forth visit to Flower Dome and I am never disappointed, as while most of the display is permanent, one area is themed and always fabulous
The gardens showcase flowers, shrubs and trees from Mediterranean climate areas around the world. Regardless of the time of the year you visit, there is always something flowering and if you are serious you can do the audio tour to enhance your knowledge.
Looking at 1,000 year old olive trees which have been transplanted here makes me wonder why I can't get potted seedlings to take.
From lush trees, to flowering shrubs and cacti, there is something for everybody."
,,for nature lovers!,4.0,,always nice to visit and see the different displays throughout the year! Flower dome has different themes for their main floral display that changes once in a while
,,Good for family,5.0,,"We went there on Mothers' day. My Mom love it so much. Singapore is a very hot place and we can stay long in outdoor, and inside the Botanic Garden, we can enjoy the sun and smell of flowers in the cooler place."
,,Man Made Natural Wonders,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay , Flowers Dome , Cloud Forest , Sky walk are to be seen in Conjuration with each others. Reviews to also be read in conjugation with each other.
This is a Visit ""one Place and Seen the Whole World"" kind of place. Must Must Visit , ideally just before sunset"
,,Flowers and Landscaping,4.0,,"Decent price for entry ticket, good place to enjoy pretty flowers in an air con environment. Different feel and sights during daytime and night."
,,"Can be very enjoyable, depending on period",4.0,,"Depending on period, different displays of flowers come on. I went while the flowers weren't that interesting but still it's a nice pleasant place away from the heat."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I visted this in Apr 15 and really loved the tulip show that was going on. There was a theme of fairy tales and it was beautifully decorated. This is a must visit place in Singapore to see the huge greenhouse nursery.
,,Magnificent,5.0,,This attraction was amazing.With the outside temp in the high 30's the temp on the dome was a dream. The way the dome is set out enables you to explore the various climes of the world.
,,Absolutely beautiful,4.0,,"While expensive to enter, being over sixty is a good thing. You can get cheaper entry to a beautiful park that is fully self-sustaining. Enchanting flower gardens and pleasant walks are worth the price. The restaurants were closed on the Monday we visited, but we went back later and ate at the Supertree, which offers very good Asian fusion food. Take a taxi when you visit for less troublesome visit."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"A must do, even if not into gardens this is a great visit. Get tickets before you go as there can be a lot of people waiting in line for tickets."
,,Magical!,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is absolutely amazing! I loved the nursery rhyme themed gardens, it was mind blowing!! I definitely recommend coming here if you have young children that are into nursery rhymes."
,,Travel the world of flora all in one place,5.0,,"Situated within the Garden by the Bay the Flower Dome is an enchanted place. Plants and trees from around the world greet you at every turn. There are identification signs to denote the country of origin. Children will be spell bound by Mary's flower garden, with Humpty Dumpty watching over proceedings. This is by no means just a children's area but an eclectic collection of flowers, shrubs and trees. There are plenty of bench areas for seating to take in the surrounding flora. Not to be missed. The entrance fee includes both Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome."
,,Tulipmania 2015,3.0,,"It is pretty fun. But since it is called Tulipmania, maybe can bring in more variety of tulips and special kinds. Because it is quite disappointing to see that tulips only occupied, maybe 15% of the Dome."
,,A beautiful and cool haven...,5.0,,"How they've managed to rear plants from all over the world, is commendable. Our son loved the flower exhibit. They should mention that it's the world's largest free standing greenhouse. Quite lovely on the whole."
,,A Treat,5.0,,"This air conditioned conservatory is well worth a visit. It is superbly set up, bright, colourful and very creative. The children's nursery rhyme themes are very cleverly done. Set aside a couple of hours to enjoy it all."
,,Great place for a nice walk when you are at Garden by the Bay,4.0,,"Great place for a nice walk when you are at Garden by the Bay. Do check it out if you are visiting there. Together with cloud forest, etc."
,,WOW,5.0,,"WOW is the word. For kids, especially - representation of many fairy tales and nursery rhymes....great gardens"
,,Bloomin' amazing,5.0,,A lot to see & the displays change through the year. It was all very nursery rhyme while we visited & definitely brought a smile.
,,AWESOME,4.0,,Had a great time and will surely visit again. the best part was it was a bit hot but the walk was all worth. It was an exclusive experience and atmosphere.
,,Scenic and enjoyable!,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is an impressive structure, and I found the area showcasing native plants from other parts of the world very interesting. However the highlight for me was the Nursery Rhymes section, where they had flower and plant arrangements based on popular nursery rhymes. It was colourful, beautifully maintained and such fun to see. Definitely bring a camera and maybe even a selfie stick to capture the flowers!"
,,A cool garden oasis in Singapore,5.0,,"I love walking in parks in the afternoon. However, our Singapore weather usually doesn't allow this.
The Flower Dome is a brilliant alternative. Always cool at about 24 C. The dome is high enough to still feel like you are outdoors and their are all those beautiful flowers and plants to admire and smell. At non-peak times, there are even little quiet corners that you can sit at and just relax.
I usually combine it with a visit for tea at Pollen."
,,Impressive,3.0,,"Not as fantastic as the Cloud Dome, but an enjoyable place to wander through none-the-less. The scent of all the blossoms can be a bit overwhelming at first, but one quickly adjusts to that."
,,Fairy Tale in the Garden,5.0,,"Beautiful flower dome, constantly change the theme, the set up and the look so many beautiful flower and live !! My fav definitely annual tulip flower, roses"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is in the Gardens by the Bay. You pay to go in but once inside you are met with a riot of flowers in the various world gardens. There is plenty for children to see, with enchanted gardens and gardens with insects and birds made from flowers. Fabulous!"
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,It's a beautiful place to be... Makes you feel alive... Very pretty displays.. Worth the money.the cloud forest was closes for maintenance so make sure you check the website before you plan your visit.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Great attraction to visit - all under one roof, so it is convenient should the Singapore weather turn for worse. Don't forget a jumper though, its cold in there!"
,,Heavenly,5.0,,"The Flower Dome was so beautiful. Like you can sit there and relax. Seeing those plants and flowers from all over the world was amazing. Oh, those cute little girls that performed a ballet number were so cute. But even without them performing, the garden was so beautiful."
,,Beautiful place to appreciate flowers,5.0,,The flower dome is set up by climate and geography. It is a lovely place to appreciate flowers from all over the world. Lots of places to sit and take a break. The structure itself is unique and beautiful.
,,You will make flower a part of your life...,5.0,,You see flowers from every part of the world so are the plants. Again all in a covered dome. Escape from the heat in to the Flower dome and the Dream flowers becomes live.
,,Very happy place.,5.0,,"The day we visited the Flower Dome there were a lot
of pre-school children attending, they were so happy and excited at the exhibits e.g. the bumble bees, animals, pot people etc.it was just delightful to watch. It was also extremely interesting even if you weren't an avid gardener."
,,So beautiful,5.0,,This is a definite must see - the flowers are incredible - have lots of memory space on camera cards as you will take many many photos - a real credit to designers and gardeners - loved our time there
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Will change the way that you think of public gardens and parks. One of the greatest attractions that I have ever had the opportunity to see. Singapore can rightly notch up an other new wonder of the 12 century
,,awesome,5.0,,"awesome flowers from all over, and the aircon is very nice on a hot day. lots of kids there too, so can get crowded, but worth a visit"
,,Beautiful Blooms,4.0,,"Good signage, labels, layout. ""Regions"", countries, theme are well represented. Spent about 1.5 hour here, but we read most of the material and took lots of pictures. I was here in Feb 2015 and there were more plants in bloom this time. Well worth doing if you are into trees/plants/flowers and/or if it is raining."
,,Slightly Disappointing,3.0,,The flowers were the main attraction but most of the colourful flowers were daffodils and tulips which are not exceptional if you come from the United Kingdom. Perhaps this was more exciting for the locals as their flora is so different from ours.
,,beautiful !!!!,5.0,,"you will find your child very happy and excited as it is dream come true !!!
all the poems that you keep on singing for kids can be seen on display here and most astonishing part is that these are made from flowers
entire area is covered with glass and air conditioned so even its noon you can still visit the place without worrying about the heat and humidity !!!"
,,Cool on a hot day,5.0,,Don't miss this. Children will especially love the Nursery Rhyme Gardens. My camera was working overtime in here. Beautiful flowers.
,,Overrated perhaps?,3.0,,"Firstly as a non Singaporean - you pay more to visit this attraction. We found our time might have been better spend elsewhere so while it was okay, we wouldn't go back and cannot provide a glowing recommendation."
,,Flowers Everywhere,4.0,,Best botanical garden or conservatories I've ever been. The climate in there is perfect for whatever flowers or plants imaginable. The Tulipmania festival offered rare chance for people who don't have resources to go to their native countries. We can enjoy the tulips nearer to our place.
,,Unique Place,4.0,,"This is an architectural marvel. It is enjoyable with kids, friends & families. Flower lovers will enjoy this place. You may find diverse variety of flowers under one roof."
,,Worth Experiencing,4.0,,"This is an architectural marvel. It is especially enjoyable for flower lovers. This place can be enjoyed with kids, friends & families. It is all man made, however, the whole concept is presented is too good. One may appreciate efforts taken by local authorities to build & present this concept to the world. Staff is polite & always accessible, if you need any help."
,,For flowers lovers,5.0,,"Flower Lovers shouldn't miss this. Great display of flowers, we enjoyed it ... Surprisingly my kids loved it too. Photo-taking will need to queue as there were many people busy taking photos using camera stand."
,,A Must See,5.0,,"If visiting the Gardens by the Bay, pay the extra to see both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest at a combined price of $S 26. An amazing display"
,,Refreshing!,5.0,,The Flower Dome offers a spectacular array of flora for nature lovers. If you coming here be sure you are wearing comfy footwear because it has a lot of sights and walking involved.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"First time experiencing the Flower dome and i still cant believe how such a clean, beautiful and huge dome was created. The entry price is worth every cent for the time you spend inside. Its worth bringing a camera to keep record of it all as you find yourself looking in every direction amazed with it all."
,,Pretty but not impressive,4.0,,"My mother wanted to see flowers. And this was closer to the city than the Botanical Gardens so we chose this. The flowers displayed from all over the world. It was pretty, but not impressive."
,,Amazing,5.0,,do not miss out on this wonderful place young or old the complete planning of it is just wonderful. You will not only be amazed you will come home with beautiful photos.
,,nice experience - for the whole family,5.0,,Like the Cloud Forest the hall is air conditioned which is necessary for the plants. Apart from permanent exposures of plants from all continents they always offer special exhibitions which are pretty amazing. As it is always hot and humid in Singapore you will enjoy this visit in a cool surrounding.
,,What a Gem for families,5.0,,Actually we're nearly 60 and both loved the walk through the nursery rhymes. Beautiful arrangements in the gardens and your photos will come out fantastic in the natural lighting.
,,If you like nature...you will love this!,5.0,,"A very relaxing stroll through the park. Well laid out, labelled, decorated, etc. Love this place....Strongly recommended. I did the cloud and forest domes. Should have stayed late evening and enjoyed the lights. Its not really that cold so don't need any jackets etc. Took a cab to the location. Can also take MRT. Wear proper walking shoes and note the ground is wet so have proper rubber soles."
,,Beautiful and amazing,5.0,,If you like to look and remind yourself our planet is amazing and full of beauty don't miss it. You will find great combination of natural resource and human art.
,,WOW,5.0,,"Could not believe it exist. Planed a quick visit after visiting Marina Bay Sky Park, but ended up spent hours admiring all the beautiful flowers. My wife, daughter and son made the most out of the park. Amazing ....."
,,fantastic,5.0,,On par with the orchard dome. A real treat tl see so many planfs so beautifully tendered. A treat the whole family would enjoy
,,Very cold here but worth to come,4.0,,"Flower Dome is another park inside Garden Bay The Bay. It also need extra charges. But the plants are very unique and beautiful. As it has air conditioner, it helps you cool down in Summer."
,,Technology + nature + beauty combined,5.0,,"This site is very impressive and deserves being included in a visit if Singapore, when you walk around the entire Marina Bay area. It is impressive and beautiful."
,,Another part of Gardens By the Bay,5.0,,"Very very beautiful, plants and flowers never seen anywhere else, you can't miss visiting the flower dome, it again is unbelievable. You will spend several hours here."
,,"Great assortment of plants, horrific Disney/kid-focused environment.",2.0,,"It seems they've decided that the Flower Dome is to be focused on kids, and the Cloud Forest Dome focused on environmentalism/adults. Loud children's nursery-rhymes oozing out of hidden speakers everywhere absolutely ruins the Flower Dome's appeal for any grown-up. Uncouth families staging Bollywood-style video shoots of themselves. Sculptures of flowers instead of actual flowers - insulting to entire point of this garden. Overall, an insipid, Disney feeling where there should be reverence for the incredible assemblage of exotic plantlife which has been brought in. They're catering to the lowest common denominator here and it's inappropriate. Cloud Forest Dome is vastly superior/more enjoyable."
,,Huge Futuristic Dome,5.0,,"Wow ... first impression when step in the dome, smell good and cold inside. Sunlight shine tru dome futuristic roof - impress with shadow created from roof. Loves the architecture of dome and design of garden. See many lovely flowers, different type of garden, even have collection of flowers shape like rock...."
,,A favourite,5.0,,Wonderful gardens inside the very very large dome. although its very hot outside its very cool inside you may need a jacket.
,,Go in daylight if you like to look at flowers,4.0,,"Not quite as interesting to us adults as the Cloud Dome, but it is typically well done. Just don't leave it too late, as although it's lit after dusk, it's too dark to look at the individual plants. But if you have small kids, that's a good time to go as it's lit up like fairyland and there are play areas for the littlies."
,,Awesome...,5.0,,"This is a must visit, if you are in Singapore even for a short time. Very well done, so much of beauty. Cant stop praising and being in love with this place."
,,Top 10 Places to Visit for Flower's Lovers in Singapore,5.0,,"It is very innovative in design. You can visit the Mediterranean garden, Californian garden, Australian garden, etc and you can get to see various tulips from the end of March to the middle of May without having to fly to Keukenhof.

You can see beautiful flowers and plants associated with Chinese New Year during Spring Festival."
,,Camera and wind cheater Must,4.0,,"This place is heaven on earth, pls dont forget to take camera and its chilling inside so wear something warm to enjoy the place. The average temperature inside is 18C."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Outstanding display from around the world. Incredible sculpture (I especially like the fighting jack rabbits and the metal family with luggage and missing middles), old olive trees and comfortable temperature. Do not miss!"
,,A beautiful inside garden,5.0,,"This is the second dome in the gardens at the bay. All about cactus, fliwers and trees. The landscapes are wonderful and its easy to follow the paths. A not to miss part of Singapore."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"If you haven't been this is well worth a visit, flowers and garden settings from all around the world, brilliant place to chill out during the heat of the day, great restaurant below if you like Dim Sum!"
,,Winter at home but SPRING in the flower dome,5.0,,"We walked into the flower dome and it was a blaze of spring colours with 30,000 plants from 150 species across 9 gardens. The dome is climate controlled and was pleasantly cool inside compared with the high humidity outside. You can stay as long as you like in here and have your ticket stamped to re-enter if you wish to leave for a while. They have a section for chidren with humpty dumpty, animals,play houses and many other beautiful characters all made from growing flowers, a beautiful tranquil garden in a dome with seating to sit and rest and just take in this stunning garden, once again well done Singapore a must do while there, along with the Cloud Forest."
,,Not nearly as good as the Cloud Forest,3.0,,"The Flower Dome has a few interesting plants, but overall it is just an average display of plants and flowers. Not worth the entry fee compared to the Cloud Forest."
,,Great variety of plants from all over the world,4.0,,Great variety of plants & trees from all over the world. Ticket for both Flower dome and cloud forest are 28$. Worth the visit
,,"Splendid, beautiful, memerising!",4.0,,"An amazing experience of a great variety of plants and flowers, some of them very exotic. Its a nice education for kids too. The temperature controlled (sometimes downright chilly!) dome is a delightful place to visit."
,,Very much Liked it!,5.0,,A must visit when in Singapore! Lots of variety of flowers and they have some theme based decorations - its was nursery rhymes when I visited!
,,Exceptional place,5.0,,"You will have to visit the place to believe this. This flower dome garden is so huge that it has a 7 story water fall inside it. It has so many plants and flowers representing all the regions of the world. The whole place is air conditioned and extremely beautiful. One must visit the place around 4:30 - 5 pm, so that you can come out just in time to see the evening laser show and light display in the outside gardens."
,,A blast of cool air,5.0,,"This place is a must-see when visiting Gardens by the Bay. It gives tourists a respite from the hot and humid surroundings, haha. The plants are very pretty (too bad we missed the tulip showcase). One can exit quickly through the café at the ground floor (I think purchase required). Perfect place to relax and unwind."
,,Fascinating Arena Of Colourful Flowers,4.0,,Attraction was full of visitors even during 5+pm. It was simply beautiful with a kaleidoscope of different colourful flowers. Whole place was air-conditioned which was a cool respite from the scorching afternoon sun outside. You can take many photo shoots at different angles with the wonderful array of different species of flora around. Highly recommended.
,,Really cool,4.0,,"Really cool - literally - a great escape from the heat. Like the botanical gardens (which are also good) but with a/c. I know, not natural, but it really helps you to take your time and enjoy it without needing to rush for the shade."
,,Definitely worth a visit if you are at Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Definitely worth a visit if you are at Gardens by the bay. Beautiful and cool side, great floral displays, we were lucky enough to be there for the fairy tale theme. They have different themes throughout the year."
,,wow.. dreaming place,5.0,,"we go there in the evening to till dark so we get the great beauty of flower dome.. so many verity of different plants and flowers around you will give a feeling like dreaming,,."
,,Marvelous creation,5.0,,"Like cloud dome, its another marvelous piece of work in the Gardens by the Bay. Amazed with variety of flowers and inturn, enthrilling experience..."
,,Such a beautiful view!,5.0,,"Getting here is through BAYFRONT MRT, upon exit, you will already see directions going to Gardens by the Bay.

You can purchase just CLOUD DOME or FLOWER DOME. I suggest you get both or absolute experience. It's more cost effective too if you get both.

Flower dome are all sorts of beautiful flowers all across the world. This year is Tulipmania. Last year we have been hear May 2014 and it's also Tulipmania. You will see All sorts of tulips. On the other side of the flower dome. near the exit, showcases all sorts of Cactus.

This year they have like a renown character theme.. The likes of Snow White, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and etc. Theres also candy house displayed in the middle of the tulips.

Last year they got free photo op. Sadly this year, it's not offered anymore. That was actually fun and nice memorabilia of the Flower Dome.

I recommended Gardens by the Bay. Such a beautiful garden within the metro of Singapore."
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"Beautiful assortment of flowers from all over the world, with a central exhibition of different themes throughout the year. We are members of Gardens by the Bay and while we love to take a stroll in the Dome whenever we needed a cool Mediterranean respite from the hustle and bustle of city life, the best time to come is during the Tulipmania festival in early May. It can also be the busiest time though, so time your visit strategically. I personally love the late afternoon early evening...when the golden hour comes upon the Dome, it's a magical feeling. :)"
,,Tulipmania!,5.0,,"There was a tulip exhibition when I visited in April 2015. While it was very crowded (tulips are pretty, so naturally everyone is attracted to them), the tulips were very colourful and vibrant. It reminded me of the open tulip fields in Dandenong, Victoria, during spring time."
,,Impressive Nursery rhyme presentation,5.0,,"The nursery rhyme flower beds were a riot of colour and texture, providing a visual delight for children and adults alike. Not to mention the photographic opportunities. Well displayed with good walkways, signage and viewing points we easily spent two hours with camera in hand."
,,One of the Must-See places in Singapore,5.0,,"The Flower-Dome has a lots and lots of different flowers that are a pleasure to see and shoot a picture with. I recommend you visit this place in the day time as the place is poorly or rather dimly lit at night.

The information center at the 'Canopy' (Ticketing Area) offers wheel chairs on rent for $2 (they keep your passport as a deposit)."
,,Flowers. Flowers everywhere :D,5.0,,Came here with my boyfriend. Absolutely loved it. The flowers and the display of them are stunning. Great photo opportunity time. :)
,,We loved it,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is fabulous. Think The Chelsea Flower Show meets the Eden Project and you have the general idea. It is one of two domes, part of the gardens by the bay and features 1000 year old olive trees as well as gardens from California, South Africa, and Australia, children's gardens, baobab and bottle trees, succulents galore and lots more besides. It is a wonderful – and cool – way to spend a couple of hours in the beautiful gardens by the bay."
,,Gorgeous and awe inspiring,5.0,,"First off, that Dome. That amazing feat of engineering and architecture, that Dome. It was the first thing I noticed the minute I walked in, and it looked more amazing from the inside than it did from the outside. I spent a good 10 minutes just sitting on a bench and staring appreciatively at that Dome.

Secondly, I appreciated the fact that the whole Dome was air-conditioned and humidity-controlled (due to some of the floral species). It was a relief to get out of the muggy Singaporean heat.

Thirdly, that place smelled amazing.

I also really enjoyed the different themes throughout the Dome. I think the succulents and desert flora section was extremely under-appreciated. As someone who doesn't come from that climate, it was great to be able to view them in more ""natural"" environs (vs. previously only seeing them in thumbsized plastic pots, sitting on my desk).

Do allocate a lot of time in your schedule to fully enjoy the Dome's displays. It would be a waste of experience (not to mention the hefty price of the ticket) if you ended up having to rush through the Dome, just to get to somewhere else.

All in all, while the Dome is definitely not the cheapest diversion the area has to offer, it does make for an enjoyable experience, and is well worth at least a first visit. Don't miss out the awesome Cloud Forest attraction either."
,,Amazing place to see many flowering plants that like a cooler climate,5.0,,"The large Flower Dome and nearby Cloud Dome are easy to locate in the ""The Gardens by the Bay"" complex by their sheer size. The flower dome contains plants from many parts of the world that do no like Singapore's humid weather, so the entire dome is air conditioned to suit the plant's needs. (For us human's it is a wonderful way to spend time out of the humidity too). The dome has flowering plants of varying sizes (from just visible to metres tall), amazing sculptures (including a dragon), seating areas and wide gently sloping paths across the dome's three or so stories. Naturally not all the plants flower at the same time, so the display is varied depending on the time of year. Currently there is a nursery rhyme exhibit that is impressive, with a range of story scenes presented. Inside the dome is a cafe, function hall and gift shop. There is a cost to enter (tourist price - $20 SGD for the flower dome or $28 SGD to access both domes - ticket are valid for the day only). The domes are well worth a visit, and if you enjoy natural attractions allow plenty of time in your itinerary. Outside the Gardens by the Bay complex has a free light show each night which you may like to visit as well. (Check their website for details). The Flower Dome / Garden by the Bay can be easily accessed from the Bayfront MRT Station (clearly signed with which exit path you will need).There is a shuttle ""mobile"" that is available if you wish to avoid the 10 or so minute walk from the MRT station exit through the gardens to the domes ($2 round trip). During the visit I utilised a light shawl that I was carrying, as it did get a little cool inside the Flower dome."
,,Awesome !,5.0,,This place is so beautifully done! Enjoy every moment when I was inside the flower dome. I will definitely come back again when I visit Singapore.
,,cool,4.0,,"we can see a lot of flower in here,, and a garden from all around the world.. its a very nice place to take a picture :)"
,,Flower Dome is nice but a bit expensive,4.0,,can say all the same the others said. Nice place to spend a few hours. Cool and nice! We went there in November last year on our stop over in SIN.
,,Nice for a stroll when the day is warm,4.0,,"A lovely contained dome of beautiful flowers and plants. A good place to come after a walk in the gardens or before a visit to the shopping centre at Marina Sands.

If you are in the area later, a re-entry stamp will let you see this when the dome and plants are lit up."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"This is my first time to visit the dome, it was smaller than cloud forest but overall was a great experience. The dome has a special timing for a certain theme. I was there on princess-inspired theme, so the tulips were arranged to match a certain fairy tale. It was lovely. On weekend, it tends to be crowded, so a bit difficult to find a good photo spot"
,,Lovely...,4.0,,"Their ""Nursery Rhymes Garden"" exhibit were lovely...the hydrangeas and foxglove flowers were all sweet-looking...though, iam not a fan of cactis but they have a wide range of it...but the most eye-catching of all are the gigantic gumamela flowers"
,,Flowers with a twist,5.0,,Beautiful displays of varying types under one roof giving a smail of pleasure to the faces pf all ages.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Take your time to really explore the flower dome. This is delightful for adults and children alike. There is so much to see, trees from all different locations, flowers, structures, carvings. and gardens arranged in such a beautiful fashion. It is cold, bring a sweater!"
,,Dome with full of flowers!,5.0,,"When we visited the dome it was Chinese new year, so they trimmed some flowers resembled several animals representing Chinese zodiacs. I saw quite a lot of collection of Dahlia, its lovely! I never saw different type and color of Dahlia as many as there."
,,Just loved the idea,5.0,,Flower dome is made beautifully. Habitat and region wise placing of plants makes it knowledgeable and interesting.
,,Great place for flower lovers,5.0,,"This place collects and beautifully displays flowers and trees from different ecosystems around the world. Very beautiful, it would take your breadth away. Plus its fully air conditioned, so great way to beat the Singapore heat."
,,well worth a visit even if you dont like plants,5.0,,There are 2 flower domes. One with a permanent 7 story waterfall rainforest ( stunning by itself) and a second display garden which seems to change for occasions. We have seen Chinese new year display and orchid displays on another visit
,,WOW,5.0,,"A must see, How to they maintain all those plants, It was so wonderful to see plants from all over the world, together and in such amazing walkways."
,,beautiful garden,5.0,,i like the garden there so many tree from around the world. the weather is cold and it very comfortable to relax in there.
,,Tulip Mania was great,4.0,,"They had Tulip Mania (festival of Tulip flowers?) . Was spellbound to see all those beautiful tulips laid-out to depict various stories lilke snowwhite, Littl red riding hood etc., Wife got some free tulips to take back too !!! Though we know it is artificial they have taken care that we don't feel that way !! Must visit."
,,Pretty,4.0,,"It has many beautiful flowers and plants. And if you hate the hot and humid, the flower dome is cooler"
,,Must visit attraction,5.0,,"This place is incredible! It is a must visit in singapore.

The closest mrt station is bayfront station. But it takes like 20 minutes walk to get to the dome. I suggest that those with walking difficulty to take taxi there.

Nearby attractions: marina bay sands. There is a daily free light show at marina bay sands. I think there is 2 shows daily. One at 7.30pm and another at 9.30pm. You need to check on marina bay sands website for the actual timing. You can go to the garden in the afternoon and then go and watch the light show at marina bay sands at night. Bayfront station is linked to marina bay sands."
,,flowers lover,5.0,,"What a mesmerizing place to see all different kind of flowers. And when I came there, there was a Tulip festival which was lot of colorfull tulips showed. I can find my most fave flower, Peonies. Too bad couldnt bring it home.. LOL"
,,Nice place to see flowers,4.0,,Overall a very nice place to see alot of flowers and plants here. Too bad misses the tulip ones. When i get there it already change to the Paris theme.
,,Awesome,5.0,,I visited in a day of May when there was Tulipmania here. Flowers and tulips every where. It was so cold but nice atmosphere. A very nice and unique place to enjoy flowers with super size.
,,Great experience,5.0,,A beautiful space filled with flowers and trees. Spring flowers and flowering shrubs were in full bloom. Well worth the time.
,,Nice but not amazing,3.0,,We didn't have to pay to get in as we'd had a meal in Pollen. Overall okay but I've been to better indoor gardens. Not very big so won't take you long to walk around.
,,Excellent collections of plants from various countries,5.0,,"Loved the choice of plants from various countries e.g. Australia, South Africa. There are some wonderful sculptures using driftwood and some in metal. Designing for children has been taken into account, also for people who have difficulty in moving around. There's a similar feeling to the Eden Project in Cornwall, UK. It's also a great place to cool down after the heat outside."
,,incredibly beautiful,5.0,,"Where else can you see trees and plants from all over the world...Australia, South America, Africa, etc thriving under controlled temperature and humidity under a enormous glass dome? Where else can you see tens of thousands of tulips in all manner of shapes, shades and colours? Nature, science, modern technology and creativity in full blossom. Wondrous, incredible and awesomely beautiful!"
,,Stunning atraction,4.0,,"What a flower dome! probably one of the biggest-sized indoor flower gardens I've ever been to. I enjoyed the experience. The indoor temperature was perfect, too"
,,Little disappointed,3.0,,"Yes most of the flowers are stunning, but i found the tulip theme a little tacky, we had a meal at one of the restaurants in the flower dome, this was very expensive even for Singapore standards. Staff were not very frienldy"
,,Fantastic,4.0,,"You cannot miss this. Try to get combo tickets with this and cloud forest and the Gardens.
Its air conditioned and very relaxing. Ideal for kids and oldies alike. Toilets are nice and clean. Not much in refreshments though. Ideal time would be late afternoon and then catch the light show at the super trees."
,,fantastic garden,5.0,,we couldn't believe the plants in the dome could survive in the air condition yet they thrived. There is a very big range of plants to see
,,What imagination.,5.0,,"apart from the fascinating plants from all parts of the world, including an absolutely huge Australian Blackboy. The flowers were outstandingly awesome, the colours, the variety, the Tulips.. Tulips in Singapore! The fantastic wooden animals, dragons, eagles, mountain goats ..superb, and the fairy tale features gorgeous."
,,Little like Home,3.0,,visited during the Tulip festival. Being from the UK it didn't really inspire us but eh Asian element definitely loved it. if you must pick one of the two domes go for the Cloud dome
,,Another amazing attraction,5.0,,"This place is a little less better than the neighbouring cloud forest, though it is amazing. Once you enter, you are surrounded by, like all the flowers in the world. Yes trust me, the feeling is awesome"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"One must visit this place. Beautiful flowers, your camera must be ready to capture numerous opportunities."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,The colours and variety of the different gardens and plants here are spectacular - well worth doing!!
,,A perfect place for the horticulture lovers,5.0,,Flower dome is a part of the Gardens by the bay. It provides a good collection of rare and exotic flora. A must visit place for he people who have interest and knowledge of plants
,,Nothing new for Western travellers,3.0,,Flowers on show are fairly common in Western countries so not worth visiting flower dome if you come from Europe
,,Colourful,3.0,,"Colourful display of different kinds of flowers . Better to be visited late evening. Tulips were awesome. Make sure , you dont visit in the night, you will miss out on reading the information about the flowers. Good airconditioning too."
,,BREATH TAKING VIEWS OF FLOWERS.,5.0,,Friends please dont miss this. If you are in Singpore this is must visit. There are two domes of Flowers one Dome exhibits all species of plants and vegetation and it is maintained in very high standards. Other dome is like forest Cloud walk and top tree walk is great view within the dome.
,,Flower Show-Case in this Dome,4.0,,This place is an amazing experience. This is a classic example of proving that maintaining flowers does not always need to be in a cooler atmosphere. The variety of flowers are amazing and one shouldn't miss this opportunity. The cooler atmosphere maintained within the dome is a great experience
,,Delightful experience,5.0,,"This dome is well worth seeing of the two that are on site. There are plenty of plants and trees to see and it is easy to walk around, as the light fades the area is illuminated adding another atmosphere to delight."
,,Great for flower lovers.,4.0,,Tulips in bloom in Singapore. Amazing. There were other flowers like the ubiquitous orchids that Singapore is well known for. A nice way to spend an evening on your own wandering around the dome. Of course you will see more during the daytime as the lighting is more subdued in the evening!
,,Sensory Explosion,5.0,,"By far a better experience, the Flower Dome outdoes the Singapore Botanic Garden in scope and ambition. Beautifully manicured and innovative, the Flower Dome is an absolute joy to explore. My favorite spot was the California Garden, with smells that took my back to my childhood in Los Angeles. Go at twilight to really experience a unique side of Singapore."
,,amazing detail,5.0,,"*beautiful smells throughout this
*diverse biomes from most countries

the flower dome is very well set out from when you enter to the time you leave

various things appealed to me and are as follows
- wooden sculptures all over the gardens
- themed of most Disney movies
- diverse plant life"
,,Again air conditioned luxury.,5.0,,"The dome has three months of special features it was Tulipmania, last month and this. Loads of Tulips, Daffodils and hyacinths. Not so keen on the Hansel and Gretel childish themes."
,,Tulips in Singapore,5.0,,Visited the flower dome when a tulip festival was in progress. Brilliant collection of tulips on display. Must visit for anyone who loves to see flowers from all over the world.
,,Nice to walk through,4.0,,"This was a very pleasing experience, as the Tulip Festival was on going. It was great to see a variety of Tulips here. This was the third place where you can now see tulips after Amsterdam and Kashmir."
,,Feels Like in Heaven,5.0,,"Just come to this place, you can see flowers from around the world. The colors, sizes, variety, and also the smells... You will feel like lying in heaven."
,,Beautiful Flowers,3.0,,"When we visited the Tulipmania was on and saw a wide variety of tulips. The overall experience was dampened by the crowds. The place was overflowing with holiday crowds and we could not get time to take in the beauty of the flowers.
For the crowds being attracted they should provide more space and more one-way tracks.
My rating is 'Average' only because the place was crowded, though I must say the Flower Dome itself was beautiful.
Take care of the crowd movement / management and the Flower Dome would be rated excellent.
First time visitors should plan to avoid going there on public holidays or weekends."
,,Really worth a couple of hours.,5.0,,"An amazing set up where you can see so much while walking down a gentle slope. The most beautiful and comprehensive display of flowers I have seen. Also, you can escape Singapore's humidity."
,,Tulipmania ROCK,5.0,,I came on 08 May 2015 which is really near of the closing Tulipmania event. I am really lucky to see so many kind of Tulip God ever created and it is so beautiful. It really feels like I am in Europe.
,,Air conditioned walk in the park,4.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay, the Flower Dome is one of two very large glass enclosed air conditioned buildings which made it a lovely place to visit and get out of the heat. It is like walking through a park with beautiful trees and plants, sculptures, and special themes. When we were there, it was a tulip celebration and there was a plethora of tulips in different colors and visitors were given tulips at no charge. It was one of the more pleasurable experiences we had in Singapore.

There is also a restaurant by the Flower Dome that has a lunch special that is both affordable and very good. There are six choices of a main course, plus salad, plus a Snapple for $15 Hong Kong dollars. I can highly recommend the baked dish with lamb. It was outstanding."
,,OK,4.0,,"Not as impressive at I thought it would be. May is a tulip month, until 14th. I believe the flower theme changes every few months. The Baobabs and bottle trees are impressive. Combine the ticket with Cloud Forest and you will get the discount."
,,Gave me ideas,5.0,,"We were very lucky to have chosen a quiet time to visit, I found it very impressive and the fragrances were sometimes a little overpowering, the displays were meticulously maintained and so colourful, areas were divided up and at the time there were displays depicting fairy tales.
I love gardening and to see so many plants I have gave me other ideas on how to display them.
All up it was very colourful and fragrant and extremely well laid out."
,,Absolutely worth a visit,5.0,,"I am not much of a gardener, but I was just knocked out by the Flower Doom as it did exceed my expectations. It is a great concept, and there are several gardens that are representative of various places around the world. The displays are huge, and the special feature when I visited was Tulipmania in which thousands of tulips were set among popular fairy tale themes. Flower Dome was so interesting I spent much more time here that I anticipated."
,,Wouldn't go again,3.0,,"If you only have time to do either the Flower Dome or Cloud Forest, I would do Cloud Forest. Flower Dome was very underwhelming after the Cloud Forest"
,,Tulip display in thematic fairy tales,4.0,,Appreciate the designing work of the displays n painstaking labour to arrange n plant the wide array of plants/ flowers / props/ etc... into thematic n colorful spread. The beauty further supports acknowledgment of Singapore as a Garden City
,,Stunning display of flora from around the world,5.0,,"Defintely worth a trip to The Marina Bay Gardens when you visit Singapore. The domes are magnificent , breathtaking and make you appreciate just how special this place earth is ... Don't miss seeing both domes and the tree Forrest ..."
,,Nothing special especially if you're from the UK,3.0,,"The best part of this place is the air-conditioning. However, if you're from the UK and used to seeing beautiful flowers and plants, this place is no better than one of our National Trust gardens."
,,An olfactory sensation as well,5.0,,The doors open to enter and suddenly the most beautiful flower perfumes hit you. Its amazing and just draws you in to explore every part of this magnificent venue. Visually of course its beautiful and a great place for photography. And a source of other entertainment - look at what people look at and take photos of. There are cultural-based preferences it seems. Highly recommended.
,,"Beautiful ""Tulipmania"" in season",5.0,,"The place is certainly worth the visit. The whole area is well planned and organised. It was good to see the flowers around the world in 1 location. Since it was Tulipmania time, varsities of tulips were on display and it added to the excitement."
,,Calling all flowers enthusiast,4.0,,"With a ticket of $28 it allows entry to both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. This is calling for all nature lovers (more of flowers enthusiast). There were many types of plants and flowers that I might not even remember what's what after taking photo of it.
You will also be able to see all the tulips there (probably the only flower that I remember and know off!). It would be perfect if they have dandelions there. A pretty cool place, also crowded as we went during the labours' weekend holiday. Overall it's a good experience there. Check out Cloud Forest too!"
,,Tulips Mania,5.0,,Awesomeee..good timing to see the tulips in Singapore..end of June till early of May..awesomeeeenesss overloaded!
,,Magical conservatory of plants and flowers!,5.0,,"Climate controlled, air-conditioned and abundance of tender loving care! Plants, flowers and trees can't get a better habitat than Flower Dome! What a sight! From the tiniest cactus to a blooming 1000 year old olive tree and the 32-ton African Baobab bottle tree, everything is well laid out by zones.

We were enthralled by the variety of plants and trees. Flowers and their colours beckoned from all directions, drawing our eyes to them like butterflies. Leaves were equally interesting with their different shapes and textures. Nature is indeed beautiful. Inside Flower Dome, tender leaves and flower petals are not singed by the sun and hot weather but displayed for our enjoyment.

A wonderful visit and certainly worth returning and returning!"
,,Very pretty - great seasonal displays,4.0,,We visited in late November and the Flower Dome had a Christmas themed display which was actually really neat. Great place to take your partner but be warned they may develop a strange obsession with succulents or foreign flowers that are very difficult to obtain in your home country and may lead to endless quests to various nurseries in order to sate their desire.
,,Party Night,4.0,,"I came to the flower dome on a conference party night, where the dinner and dance was held in the large dinning hall in the middle of this lovely location. The indoor flower dome is a wonderful space for such an occasion. We got to explore inside the flower dome and I was amazed at the wide array of tress, plants and flowers on a world tour of flora."
,,Gorgeous mix of flowers and plants,4.0,,"We visited for the annual tulip display in spring. Beautiful flowers and all themed to fairy tales this year. Lots of wonderful plants from all over the world, planted in clusters by locale."
,,Gorgeous and very worth the price,5.0,,"If you love flowers, this is a must-go place for you in Singapore. There are thousands of types of flowers. And omg I love the tulips! The best thing here is the way Singapore combines entertainment and education."
,,Lovely But Rushed (Tulipmania),4.0,,"The Flower Dome was not quite as impressive as Cloud Forest, but it was still a lovely spot to visit. We went during Tulipmania, which I think was part of the reason I was AND wasn't impressed. The whole top floor was zoned gardens in sections like Cacti and Boabs, where the plants were separated within their species and then moved on to areas separated by continents like Australia, South America, etc. Up there we had all the time in the world to do what we liked and the statues among the plants were fantastic (especially the animals that were shaped out of twisting roots and branches). My problem was with the lower level where the Tulipmania event was set up. The fairytale themed garden beds were gorgeous in their displays, but there was a thin one way path which was absolutely packed and anytime you tried to pause to enjoy a display, you immediately had a security officer or staff member step in to hurry you along telling us all to ""keep moving"". Which really made enjoying any of it a problem. We were there to enjoy the displays but we weren't allowed to stop and do so, which was rather disappointing."
,,Gorgeous flowers,4.0,,"Visited during the ""Tulipmania"" , The tulip festival 2015. flowers were just too pretty and they were displayed in a way that you feel like you are living in a fairy tale. Really enjoyed the time spent there."
,,Impressive collection,4.0,,"An impressive array of plants from across the globe from palm trees, to orchids, to bushes to cacti. Also a nice escape from the humidity outside."
,,Tulipmania,4.0,,We enjoyed looking at all the tulips and the imaginative way they were displayed. Going to order red princess!
,,Always worth a visit,5.0,,You can't visit it enough. There is always a new and usually large display there that was not there on previous trips. Very relaxing place to visit
,,Truly Excellent,5.0,,"We spent almost 3 hours just wandering around looking at all the plants and trees inside the dome. Its part of Gardens by the Bay, plus you can walk through a tunnel to Cloud Mountain. All up a beautiful morning spent just gazing at natures beauty. A definite must see when you're in Singapore."
,,What a garden!,5.0,,"The heat in tropical Singapore can be somewhat exhausting but I would recommend the Gardens by the Bay say around5 p.m. and moving on into the open Garden after. The Flower Dome is nice and cool but the gardens are a real winner in the evening. The ""supertrees"" light up every hour and the view of the Marina Bay area from the Gardens outstanding. And there is a lovely breeze when you are near the waters"
,,Appreciate its building design,3.0,,"I visited the Flower Dome on two occasions, once on a weekend day in March 2013, and recently for its Tulipmania Floral Display on a public holiday in May 2015. I liked the idea of a garden in the Central Business District of Singapore and adored the design and building concepts of the Flower Dome. This was especially so after watching a documentary on the construction of the Flower Dome on television. The garden also showcased a collection of plants and flowers from different regions and allowed me to appreciate their existence in a climate-controlled environment. However, the Flower Dome did not make me go “WOW” when I first stepped foot in it. It lacked the natural feel of a real garden and it was always full of visitors. Nevertheless, I applaud the hard work and efforts put into creating the Flower Dome and recommend interested parties to visit it on a weekday to avoid the crowds and queues."
,,flowwers trees flowers all indoors,5.0,,"when you get in you are amazed to see thousand of flowers , gigantic trees , and specially the cactus plants which are like trees growing. great well done"
,,Over-hyped,3.0,,"I found the flower dome to be a over hyped place. Its small and since it is under a dome, it doesnt have the aura of some places like valley of flowers, kaas platu in India. I found it average place and can be given a miss."
,,Pretty,4.0,,A lot of variation in flowers and floral species. Very colourful and the theme changes every year. The plants are very well taken care of.
,,Fabulous variety of flowers. Well designed,5.0,,Another perfectly designed massive dome filed with flowers from all over the world. Must visit if you have the nature bug in you. It can get a bit cold in there as it is temperature controlled so would recommend a light jacket.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We visited after a long day at work expecting to only browse quickly and depart. When we arrived we loved it so much we could not hope to just browse briefly. a beautiful wide-ranging stunning display. Definitely worth doing this.
,,spectacular,5.0,,the way it was set out with all the plants from around the world was just so good but the best thing was the fairytale setting of tulipmania it was just breathtaking and will recommend to all my friends thinking of coming to singapore
,,Spectacular succulent garden &unique dome,5.0,,Loved the succulent garden with unique plants and wonderful displays with great identification signage. Don't miss this fabulous day trip!
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"Not to be missed if you love flowers. Wonderful even on a hot day as it is totally air-conditioned. Do bring a jacket though, especially if it were a hot day outside."
,,wow wow wow,5.0,,"I could spend all day here, the flowers were truly spectacular. I am a amateur photographer so enjoyed the opportunity to take some great pics. The dome is climate controlled so it was also nice to get out of the SG heat for a while."
,,Flower dome / not to me missed,5.0,,"Amazing area, not to be missed. The different plants species on view was huge. The gift shop was well stocked and had good prices"
,,Excellent display. Very informative.,4.0,,"We spent about 3 hours inside the Flower Dome viewing the Tulipmania exhibit and reading the various information about the plant display. We found the Succulent section very interesting as there were a lot of plants we were not familiar with. The tulips, though colorful, was a bit of a lowdown becasue they were not yet all in bloom. There were patches in the display where the bulbs were still not fully out and no flowers could be seen.
Still, the Flower Dome is a good site to visit especially for those who love plants and flowers."
,,3D2N Working Trip,5.0,,Wonderful Places with lots of Tulips. I was here for the Tulipmania. The guide told me that they will change the theme often. Lots of plants inside and you will see different type of cactus. Get to know lots of plants species.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,The colorful flowers are fascinating. Loved the cool leisurely walkays around the dome. It was indeed a never seen before experience. We reached late in evening and were short of time. Next time would like to visit early to be able to spend more time in this fascinating environment.
,,Flowers Paradise,5.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay, this is a paid section along with the adjacent Cloud Forest. There is riot of colours and the fragrance of flowers transforms you to another land. There was an orchid festival which added grace to the this superb indoor garden. You are humbled by the natures variations and every flower is a masterpeice.
It gets quiet chilled at times so do carry a pullover. Good to visit at any time as it is indoors. Huge and well kept it is a marvel of human enterprise. Don't miss it !"
,,Fairytale magic in the Gardens,5.0,,"Buy the three attraction pass - the Flower Dome is well worth the visit, even if you hate gardening. This tranquil oasis has been beautifully laid out with an interesting assortment is stunning plants from the lushest rain forests to desert plants. At the time we visited the theme was Tulips and Fairytales and walking through this section, the colours and perfumes were amazing."
,,Also part of the Gardens,5.0,,"As with the Cloud Forest, this is one part of the huge Gardens by the Bay complex. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit which was well run and stocked with a large variety of plants and flowers in different arrangements. Great for keen gardeners. Not sure how long kids would be interested but think there is enough for them too, especially as the tulip displays were all arranged with fairy tale props. A lovely cool break from the heat and humidity outside."
,,Beautiful Gardens !,4.0,,We visited Gardens by the Bay and were not disappinted. We spent half a day there but could have spent longer. The Flower Dome is lovely! Worth a visit and worth the nominal charge to see it all.
,,Good but cloud forest better,4.0,,"If the price of flower dome + cloud forest is to much for you. Choose flower dome, that more spectacular."
,,Nice place to admire beautiful flowers and interesting plants.,4.0,,"Walking in the flower dome on a weekday is a bliss. One can admire beautiful flowers and plants in the comfort of cool air and in peace.

I love the cactus section the most, never fail to be fascinated by the shapes of the wide variety of cactuses, so unique and beautiful. It is a pity that there is very limited information about the different species of cactuses.

Apart from cactuses, there is a wide variety of colourful flowers in the flower dome all year round, which is a feast for the eyes

Now the flower dome is having a Tulipmania floral display. It is said to have a wider selections of tulips compare to the past years. To me, i cannot really tell the difference in the selections, but it seems that there are fewer tulips this year.

As for the concept of putting the tulips in a setting of fairy tales, i feel that the idea is not well executed. The little red riding hood and the mermaid that are in the midst of the tulips look a bit errie and the empty carriage is not nice. Maybe, more emphasis should be placed on the flower arrangements rather than on the distractions.

But no matter what, the tulips are still beautiful and the flower dome is worth visiting :)"
,,Nice Christmas theme,5.0,,"It's christmas when i visit and it has an amazing theme ! Christmas tree, snowman, snow, and it's really cold inside. Many unique decoration and statue. Love it !!"
,,Lovely & Cold,5.0,,It was freezing cold inside but we loved it. Nice variety of flowers and beautifully managed. Loved it.
,,a must see/do,5.0,,Something out of the space age. Just walking around ground level and up high is jaw dropping experience.
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,Beatifull and colourful well landscaped some of the exhibits can have a very strong perfum. Well worth avisit though
,,Amazing,5.0,,"You have to visit and see a great collection of flowers and trees from all over the world. Amazing place, great collection and awesome decoration ."
,,"Nice retreat from scorching heat, a must visit",4.0,,"Flower dome is one of the two conservatories of Gardens by the Bay. As a visitor, you get a combined ticket for these two conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) but if you are a Singapore citizen then you can buy ticket for individual conservatory.
Gardens by the Bay is a free access for external gardens, but you need to buy ticket to visit these conservatories.
Changi Recommends at Changi Airport provides discounted tickets for these conservatories.
During my visit, Tulipmania was the these of the FlowerDome. It is a temperature controlled garden, thus provides a retreat from outside scorching heat. Tulipmania was designed across Grimms brothers fairy tales, Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, Snow white and seven dwarfs etc. The theme provided many photographic opportunities.
Tulips all around the world were on display, and being one of the most sough out flower, presence of tulips added into value for money.
Overall, you will need 1-2 hours to complete the round, photographing included.
There is a gift shop at the exit, you can get souvenirs and other gift items.
There is no eatery inside the dome, you can get snacks and ice creams outside."
,,Really interesting,5.0,,"I would not classify myself as a flower-lover, but I really enjoyed visiting the flower dome, and seeing the displays from all corners of the world. They also organise themed displays which were great. Definitely worth a visit."
,,flower fanciers heaven in a stunning building,5.0,,"Flower dome is worth visiting for the building alone, which has taken out lots of architectural awards. Tulip display was in progress when I visited- a feast for the eyes & a heavenly smell because of all the hyacinths. Flowers from many different gardens types are represented- Mediterranean, succulent Australian etc all easily accessible & well laid out. Worth the fee & you can see what your entrance money is used for by the displays"
,,Paradise for Flower Lovers,5.0,,"Before I went to These Domes i.e Flower and Cloud, I read about their reviews, some of them it is waste of time & waste of money, and go there if you have time, and that it is ok place, and can spend 2-3 hours. I respect their views, as everyone has different liking and preferences.

Everyone will say they love Flowers, But This is Place of Genuine Flower Lovers, When I went to Singapore, one of my hand had fracture, and was recovering from it, as soon as entered the flower dome, i forgot my fracture, picked up my DSLR and started clicking pictures and end up taking 150 clicks, This was the best place for me in the entire trip, The flower dome is Air-conditioned, So many beautiful flowers.

It has Flowers, Flowers and Flowers.....You will like Your Loved One being clicked with these Flowers. The other name of this can be ""Flower Paradise""

So eat well before you go inside and you can spend as much time you want, I spent nearly 6 hours."

,,Magic,5.0,,"Fantastic! If you are a flower lover don't miss it. Once there go also to the cloud forest. In case after all this nature you need to shop, go to the near Marina Bay."
,,Absolutley beautiful,5.0,,"You won't be disappointed! Every flower you can think of, in every colour! Beautifully designed and air conditioned. You must see it to believe the thought and attention to detail given to this masterpiece!"

,,beautiful,5.0,,Extraordinary displays with Boab tress and cacti and flowers from around the globe. stunning place. Part of the Gardens by the Bay area
,,Oasis in the city,4.0,,"Lovely cool environment to walk around and see flower and gardens from all over the world. A tulip exhibition was on, with many fairytale type displays and we all were very impressed with it - well maintained gardens and it was very clean."
,,Combine with Cloud Forest,5.0,,"Visit here on one ticket with the Cloud Forest. The flower dome is equally as lovely and worth spending time in. While we were there they were having a tulip festival combined with a fairy tale theme, so there were nice sets eg Cinderella, Rapunzel, Snow White, the Little Mermaid etc with appropriately named tulips planted around them. There was also an interesting display of baobab trees and cacti from around the world."
,,simply beautiful!,5.0,,"I love this place. It is cooled so you can enjoy everything comfortably. There are many spots to just sit and relax. It feels like you are in a living museum! If you combine that with the outside view, simply beautiful."
,,Fantastic,3.0,,"In the night time, it looks like an alien planet. After a few minutes walk, a famous BBQ site, Satay by the Bay, is there. Easily to get delicious local food."
,,Gorgeous Flower Dome,5.0,,"A must-visit. Gorgeous flowers and plants within an enclosed dome within the city, and at the moment they are having a gorgeous tulip exhibition that everyone should see!"
,,worth a detour,4.0,,"Although built next to the Cloud Forest, this attraction is slightly less organised. But, nevertheless, definitely worth your visit. The olive trees are stunning, by the way."
,,If you love gardens and flowers,4.0,,"We were there when they had the tulip show on and it was stunning laid out in fairy tale themes. Cinderella, snow queen, etc. very beautiful but of course have to compete with all the others to get photos."
,,Tulip Heaven,5.0,,"Tulipmania was very impressive. It was theamed around fairy tales. It was spectacular. Eater pictures are a must, in this beautifully creative tulip haven."
,,Family friendly,5.0,,I wish we had had our grandchildren with us to enjoy the fairy tale themed tulip displays - very impressive. It was nice to see that there were places in Singapore that were very much tuned in to families with young children.
,,So Beautiful,5.0,,"The tulip display, with a fairy tale theme, was on display here. The whole building was fabulous. Can you believe that they have ancient olive trees? Enormous in size, they were amazing to see."
,,"FLOWER DOME,SINGAPORE",4.0,,LIKES 1)The overall structure 2)The wonderful selection of plants 3)The excellent layouts Dislikes 1)High entrance fee 2)Long walking distance from car park or public transport bases
,,Loved Tulipmania!,5.0,,Don't miss this if you go to Gardens by the Bay! The trees and plants and the way they are displayed is first class.
,,great educational garden,5.0,,"the whole place surrounded by flowers and plant around the world, it's a place for people who like the nature beauty. When i was there, it was time for tulipmania, so i enjoyed it so much, with different variety of tulip with thematic story, it's so beautiful. Don' t forget to bring your camera and be prepared to feel a little chilled coz it cold in there. But it's a place you can enjoy walking around the garden without melting. For travelers with children, it's a good place to introduce them about plants."
,,Botanic garden in a glass building,3.0,,"If you like to discover new plants or flowers, go to the flower dome. It's a relatively small botanic garden with a lot of plant species from different Mediterranean places on earth brought together.
If you're already used to the Singaporean temperatures, bring a jacket. It's around 20 degrees (celsius) inside."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,Stunning views of town well worth taking a spin. Priced well and very informative. Fantastic for panoramic pictures of the city.
,,Very pretty and well-organised,4.0,,"It feels like a cop-out to say that a large part of my time in Gardens By The Bay was spent in here, but simply because strolling around while admiring flowers from all over the world is AIR-CONDITIONED COMFORT is simply marvellous."
,,Amazing attraction. Must see!,5.0,,"A must see for nature lovers. There are thousands of species of plant life from all across the globe, as well as many types of professionally designed displays. The inside is climate controlled as well, which is a plus. Would love to come here again!"
,,Fantastic flower dome,4.0,,"The domes themselves are stunning examples of modern architecture, the flower dome had an array of plants and flowers from around the world.
Including Mediterranean, Australia and Africa its an interesting walk. The dome is cool and a relief from the Singapore heat. Buy a combined ticket it's cheaper, if you fly to Singapore with Tiger Air, your boarding pass gets you a discount. Combine with the other dome, the gardens and the skywalk for a fantastic day"
,,Chinese new year flowers extravaganza,5.0,,"Feel quite entertained by the special goat year in CNY celebration.
The flower show is fantastic. Not to crowded but expect a bit of photo bomb everywhere.
The mood of peoples seems relax and overjoyed. Very recommended,

But the building's air condition had saved the day."
,,English gardens in Singapore - who'd have thought it?,4.0,,"Beautiful European gardens within the air-conditioned dome. The setting were magical and the quality of the gardens excellent. As you'd expect in Singapore, very clean, excellent toilets, good value for money."
,,VERY INTERESTING AND UNIQUE!!!!!,5.0,,"Another interesting thing to experience on a trip to Singapore!

I was straight away amazed at the concept of housing plants from all around the world under the one roof.

There were sections with trees like the 'Ghost Tree' from Madagascar.

There were sculptures like this huge dragon made out of heaps of natural different shaped pieces of wood stuck together.

I'm very disapointed to read some of the negative reviews, like people complaining about the large concrete paths??
Should the paths be made of dirt, so people in wheelchairs dont get to enjoy the amazing plants or something? The paths are quite wide as the builders must have cleverly realized just how busy this place was going to get. And with Chinese New Year just a week away when we visited, this place was VERY busy.
I didn't realize that people who can't appreciate beautiful plants/flowers, would bother visiting a place like this in the first place. Just look at my photos! I fully appreciate the work that has obviously gone into creating this place.

One of the highlights for me was the bronze statues of people, that were only half there, but the parts of their bodies that were there, were in perfect proportion. They looked almost ghost like?!

Well worth visiting, esp when you get the combo ticket that allows you to visit both domes.

Tip - If you visit late afternoon (approx 4-5pm) then you will be able to head outside and watch the amazing show at 7:45pm when all the man made trees light up all different colours, which is a free show.
Though you may need to go earlier soon, judging by the rate of expansion of the outdoor garden area, which is already huge :)"
,,Amazing scents,5.0,,"Went for the Tulip expo. What an amazing place - chilled atmosphere (temperature) was a welcome relief from the humidity, and for the tulips to bloom. The Flower Dome is amazing with the different gardens from around the world. Combine with a trip on the Singapore Flyer."
,,A pleasant stroll with a camera,4.0,,"It was tulip time, and there were thousands of the photogenic things. I love the character of old olive trees and boababs, so pleased to see these feature. The various bits of 'driftwood' sculpture were interesting, although my travelling companion suggested a Chinese dragon might have been more appropriate than the Western version :-). It would have been easy to spend more time soaking in the genuine majesty of flowering plants."
,,Beautiful space,4.0,,"This is such a lovely dome to explore some beautiful flowers. Exhibits appear to change from time to time, and at the time I visited. Exhibits were arrange geographically and had some beautiful flowers. Structure is a feature on its own and is amazing. This is a temp controlled environment so its much cooler than the outside which is a relief at time.
Tickets can be combined with the cloud forest and is much cheaper then. However as an international visitor you must pay a bit more than the locals."
,,Wonderfull display,5.0,,"Well worth the entrance fee,brilliant display that aparantly changes with the seasons recommended day out"
,,Loved it ... cool and beautiful,5.0,,"A great space with some wonderful vistas. Like many things in Singapore, very well organised, clean and good value. Tulip fantasy a bit Disneyesque - but the Singaporeans were loving it and so did we. Do not miss it."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"A beautiful arrangement of flowers, plants & tree carved statues, all in a wonderfully cool environment, could have stayed in here all day! So glad we took the time to visit, a short walk from Marina Bay Sands, absolutely loved the tulips!"
,,"Wow, fantastic show.",5.0,,"How lucky that we came by when they were promoting tulips and fairy tales. I didn't think that Tulips were my thing but gee they were stunning, especially the way the colours were laid out. The fairy tales (Cinderellas carriage, little red riding hood, the snow queen etc) were all on show and added another great element.

Also loved the Baobabs, cacti and especially all the wonderful little sculptures everywhere. Some were well camouflaged but they were very well done. We loved our time spent here and highly recommend a visit."
,,Just as lovely.,4.0,,"The flower done is another highlight of the gardens area. Full of tulips and flowers throughout the world, the sculptures are amazing. Such a delight to visit. Surely a great way to spend a couple of hours."
,,Cool and relaxing in the heat of the day,4.0,,"This was low key but interesting, lots to see and well set out with plenty of explanations for those who love information and detail. Relaxing in the middle of the day when it was really hot."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"When we entered the Flower Dome,if jaws could drop ours must have done! We started off strolling amongst the collection of Baobabs before moving on through the subtropical and Mediterranean sections. On our visit the floral display was based around tulips and whilst not tulip fans we couldn't help being impressed by what was on view. Suffice to say that we would be happy to visit again if we happened to be in Singapore"
,,Attractive!,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is beneath the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and it could be seen from everywhere, a genious architectural wonder, which must be seen when in Singapore."
,,Lovely Visit,4.0,,"Never thought it's such a pleasant visit coming here. The management is currently displaying Tulips, many kinds of them. There are still lots to see inside though, as they are making the glass house's mapping as if we're going to zoo, clear explanations of the plants & spacious path for the visitor to walk. Lots of varieties to see inside, no wonder if Flower Dome is being called the largest glass house in the world. Better bring some shawl or thin jacket because it's freezing inside."
,,Great displays of exotic plants and flowers!,4.0,,Beautifully designed and arranged landscape gardens with great many plants and flowers. Fantastic for a photography trip! We had to pay a entry fee to enter both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and so glad we did! It was an enjoyable visit.
,,Climate controlled and colourful,4.0,,The dome is air conditioned at a comfortable temperature and is a so colourful with amazing varieties of flowers from all around the world. This is a great place to go once you have wandered around the gardens and are ready for a bit of a cool down.
,,Such thought in the planning,5.0,,"Hardly the first enclosed garden in the world, what distinguishes this one is the size and planning. It's well-maintained, easy to navigate and delightful. No wonder everyone looks happy. There are segments devoted to different parts of the world including Australia and Africa. Some displays change regularly. I think this would please people who don't normally like gardens. A combined ticket can be purchased for this place and the other enclosed dome in the gardens area."
,,Fairyland,5.0,,"The most beautiful display of flowers, colors and fairy tale characters all in one place. The best time to see it is just before sunset, as you will be able to see the place in a natural day light and after the sunset in a very soft artificial light. which creates a magical ambiance"
,,Gorgeous - don't miss it!,5.0,,"This is part of the Gardens by the Bay and of the two domes I like this one better. In addition to the trees, plants and flowers, there are sculptures and art pieces intermixed. When we were there they were washing the dome and that was kind of interesting to watch. Also, it's wonderfully air conditioned, which you will appreciate."
,,Tulips and fairy tale,4.0,,"We visited this place on Easter eve. Theme was Tulips and tulips and tulips. Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, snow-white and dwarfs, beauty & the beast, wind mill etc were so nicely decorated with flowers. The entire garden was full of flowers and greenery. Many sculptures were enhancing the decor. There was a cafe serving food and beverages.

A wonderful experience. Our kids were busy taking pictures of various kind of flowers and trees."
,,I liked it,4.0,,I really enjoyed it but the rest of my family got severe hayfever within 5 minutes of entering. If you have allergies to flowers or cant stand strong perfume don't go here
,,ok,3.0,,if you are a gardener and like flowers this is great but if like me you can only look at flowers for so long didn't think it was worth the money.
,,It was Tulip time when I visited!,5.0,,A pleasant and cool way to spend an afternoon. Flowers on display when I visited were tulips and hyacinths which gave a lovely colourful display. They will be there until May. Make sure you take your camera!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Loved this, have to see when in Singapore !... Amazed us both with the colours and displays they had."
,,Flower world,5.0,,This is an awesome place if you like flowers. Never seen any other place with so many flowers and different flowers. It has got all the flowers you can ever think of. I was happy seeing my wife happy.
,,Tulip Flower show,3.0,,"Visited Singapore over the Easter period and the #tulipmania advertisements caught our eye.

Personally speaking, the small selection of tulips were past their best, and the S$16 entrance fee didn't (for me) meet the high expectations that I normally associate with such events in Singapore.

The other varieties of flowers from other parts of the world, especially the desert regions of South Africa & California were interesting though."
,,Beautiful flowers but some tacky presentation,3.0,,"Magnificent tulip display and some interesting varieties of flowers. However, some equally tacky displays. Personally, I found the visit disappointing as the environment is so artificial."
,,Beautifully done!,4.0,,"Directly in front of cloud forest, easy to enjoy since you are right there. Like a botanical garden, but inside climate controlled. The succulents section is very beautiful, the place is organized by world geographies, so it puts the flora in perspective where they grow naturally. The place was decorated for the upcoming Easter holiday theme, it was well attended but not crowded. We had afternoon drinks at the cafe near the California section named Pollen, very good food and service!! Glad we went."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Buy tickets for both the cloud forest and the flower dome. In the flower dome look out for the sculptures. So creative.
,,beautiful garden,5.0,,"lovely place to visit, a beautiful garden right at the center of city. Do not miss this if you visit Singapore!"
,,Gorgeous!,5.0,,The many gardens representing gardens throughout the world are very true to their countries and very beautiful.
,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,"If you love flowers you will love this. I have never seen so many different flowers and vegetation from all over the world. Very well laid out, very interesting."
,,A nice place,4.0,,"I liked the other dome - Cloud forest - much more. However, if you are visiting the place, then worth to walk through the collections of flowers and flower shows. It has plantations - spread over a large space indoors - so you can walk through in day/sunny time without feeling the heat."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,Greenhouse within Gardens by the Bay should not be missed. Recently the tulip exhibit in addition to the permanent exhibit really impressed our whole family. Make sure to bring a sweater as it is quite cold.
,,Oh My!,5.0,,"What a glorious place - so many and different flowers and displays. Loved the wooden woven/sculptures horses, dragon and other animals, the ponds, the walking paths, the perfume of the flowers, the tulips...."
,,My Fair Garden,5.0,,"The Flower Dome and Cloud Dome, being side by side can be completed in a day. A bit tedious, with all that walking around but a sight for sore eyes. The flowers are gorgeous and you can come across suddenly on a bridal party who love to pose among the beautiful gardens. Definitely a trip for visitors !!! Don't miss out on this !!"
,,Perfusion of smells,5.0,,"Visited this as part of trip to Gardend on the Bay and Cloud dome. s$28 entry fee (£14) which gets you in both domes, gardens are free and a must see. The flower dome currently has a Tulip display on, brilliant, as well as the tiered gardens."
,,A great dome and features not to be missed,5.0,,"What a brilliant idea. We saw the Tulip exhibition, just spectacular and brilliant. A real credit to the organisers who have worked so hard. 5* and not to be missed as part of the Gardens by the Bay. Just superb"
,,Magnificent Dome,5.0,,What a wonderful variety of flowers on display. This time it was tulips and they were just gorgeous.
,,Need lots of time,3.0,,It takes a while to wander through this dome. Taking everything in and finding sculptures popping up where you don't expect it. The flowers are magnificent and you can find that time gets away
,,Nice giant green house,4.0,,"If you love plants and flower, you'll love this place. The tulips are beautiful, so are other flowers. What I like most is the baobab trees and the cactus garden. What I dislike: nothing in particular, it's a good place to spend with your family"
,,Refreshing & Relaxing day,4.0,,"Not a big fan of flowers, but the smell you get as soon as you walk in was amazing! I also got the audio guide which was only $4 and packed full of information on all of the flowers/trees/architecture"
,,100% spot one.,5.0,,"As I am from South Africa I saw a various plants, flowers and shrubs from home. This was the most accurate portrait of plants from my country I have ever seen, so I would imagine that the Australian and Mexican exhibitions will be just as accurate. The detail given to showing off all plants was outstanding. Must go."
,,Lots and lots of Flower and Plants,4.0,,"When we came, there was a Tulip festival. Beside the Tulips, there is also many plants from around the world. Like the Baobao trees from Africa."
,,wonderful air conditioned garden,5.0,,"Its a nice place to visit. In such hot weather of Singapore, it gave me cool experience after walking for around 30 mins in Gardens by the bay. the dome was well decorated with lots of monuments and collection of different flower was also good. if you love green, if you love flower....have a visit."
,,good enough,3.0,,it's good and beautifull but u could find s.th like this all over the world but other dome is special
,,Beautiful for eyes and nose,4.0,,We went to the new exposition tulipmania in flower dome and was great... the smells perfect from all flowers together and the vibrant colors made me crazy. The price is expensive. My tip is bring a coat because its cold and just go if you really like flowers.
,,Nicely design,5.0,,"I like this place, nice good spot for photos, and selfie here in singapore there are many nice recommendation place for"
,,Beautiful collection,4.0,,"Visited this afternoon. Lovely plant collection from all over the world. I did prefer cloud forest, but that's not to say this wasn't worth it though."
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"We visited here during our trip to Gardens By The Bay. Beatiful plants and lots of different themes to see. I agree with comments posted earlier, you do seem to battle through crowds of selfie stick users that like holding peole up but I encountered this in most places. A lovely place to visit a showcases Singapores love for lush beatiful green gardens"
,,Tourist trap,1.0,,"I didn't enjoy this at all, the price of entrance wasn't worth it for me except as a spot to escape from the torrential rain for an hour or so. The arrangements are quite sparse and artificial (of course they are man made but it could have been done better) and the area themed around European fairytales was tacky."
,,Breathtaking,4.0,,"I didn't expect much of the Flower Dome in the beginning but once I entered it, it was really something. I went there during Chinese New Year and the display reflected the Year of the Sheep and the other 12 zodiacs. Each floral arrangement was intricately structured, especially the sheep and crane made out of wood; stunning pieces!

For those who want to get great floral shots of tropical flowers and sculptures, this is the place to be!"
,,"Nice, but...",3.0,,"Nice for the photographer who also doesn't know much about the plants you are taking pictures of. They have signs with names of each of the plants. But, I live in Japan which does the same thing but outside in much larger area. Not to take away from what they are trying to do, but if you are used to seeing very large gardens, consider skipping."
,,Don't worry too much if you miss it out,3.0,,"These gardens were a bit of a disappointment, partly because a lot of it is in my own garden! However, there are some interesting sculptures and the range of cacti was quite good. The Californian citrus tree decorations were a bit tacky, but maybe there is a subtle (or not-so-subtle) message there! Not really worth the entrance fee."
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,Lovely place and beautiful flowers from around the world. Do not miss this if you visit Singapore. The fragrance of flowers fills this dome and it is a great experience.
,,Amazing and significantly better than the UK Eden project,5.0,,"A brilliant tourist hotspot, enjoy a cool stroll around amazing diverse gardens from around the world, see plants, shrubs, trees and flowers of every colour & size. My second visit and still a big wow!!. Plants are very neatly displayed in well manicured gardens so that you can photo and see up close these amazing plants. There is a cost per person but for a tour of both domes and the cloud forest this is a must visit when in Singapore."
,,Land of the Selfie Zombies,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is an amazing piece of architecture containing a stunning collection of plants from many parts of the world. I especially enjoyed visiting the corner containing plants from my my native Australia. As the Dome is air conditioned it is a respite from the oppressive heat and humidity outside.

Those were the positives.

The plants are stunning and plentiful, so do we really need Cinderella's carriage, and Little Red Riding Hood lurking in the shrubbery? And how about the full-size Gingerbread House? The added commercialism detracts from the marvelous efforts of the botanists, architects and engineers who created this Dome.

The ""Selfie-Zombies"" converged on the cheap attractions in droves, selfie-sticks in hand, and brains in off mode. Everywhere within the dome, visitors wandered in self absorbed states, blocking pathways by forming groups with plastic smiles and cell phones on extended sticks. These brainless hordes greatly detracted from my experience of this marvelous facility.

I did stop for a cold drink at the Pollen Cafe, and wholeheartedly recommend that you do the same if your manage to get past the hordes in their altered states."
,,Nicely arranged sunny place,5.0,,Flower Dome is a must go for every flower fan. Very well maintained. The place is relatively small so you will walk around it in no time. I suggest 30 to 60 min max for this attraction.
,,boring..,2.0,,Boring. Nothing special about flower dome and the so called natural air really turns me off. Smells weird. This place sure wasn't worth the money spent.
,,"Interesting expo of flowers, trees and plants",5.0,,"Nice expo of a wide variety of plants, trees, and flowers. Even if you're not a plant person, it's interesting seeing such a wide range of plants and trees under the same roof. You can feel the air and moisture change once you're inside. A nice place for a walk with family. It's fine to bring strollers/wheelchairs here as well. Definitely worth a look."
,,Very Nice,5.0,,This is part of Gardens by the Bay. They have different variety of flowers growing under the glass dome.
,,Amazing even if man-made,5.0,,"The time, cost and effort must have been immense. The size and variety of plants on show is amazing. Being just after Chinese New Year there were still lots of decorations up that gave it plenty of extra colour. To transplant some of the very old olive trees is a feat on its own. The succulent section is extensive. Well worth the entrance fee."
,,A gardener would love this,4.0,,"I'm not a gardener, and thought it was very pleasant, but a gardener would truly love it, as it would mean so much more. There were some amazing artworks."
,,"Flowers,flowers flowers",5.0,,The selection of flowers were wonderful under the carefully controlled air flow in the flower dome. I'd recommend it as an enjoyable way to spend some time in Singapore. The plants are in prime condition
,,Well presented and maintained,4.0,,"You have to pay a fee to get into the Flower Dome but you are then treated to a magnificent display of flowers.

Beautiful setting, well laid on and pleasant to walk around. If you're big on plants and flowers - heaven. Good for everyone though."
,,Pretty but a bit artificial,4.0,,A lot of time and effort has gone into this place. It is very good at covering the world's flowers. I would definitely visit again.
,,nice place,5.0,,"psoitive you can come anytime, cos inside so nice athmosfer and nice temprature negvativve no negative thing"
,,Paradise for Plant lovers,4.0,,"Compared to Cloud Forest, there are more plants( flowers) to see in the flower dome. Detail description are available to educate visitor on the origins and habitat of the plant. The plants are also well arranged according to the country / continent. Definitely a MUST -VISIT place for plant lovers. For tourist, the ticket to flower dome are usually combine with ticket for cloud forest."
,,Great Indoor Flower Gardens,5.0,,"You can find any flowers and trees in the world here, from native american trees until african trees... if you are a tree and flowers lovers, this is your heaven on earth..."
,,awesome must see,5.0,,One of a kind experience that is tranquil and stunning. Great for adults and kids. A great way to spend a hot day in Singapore as it's cooler in the dome with mist and water features.
,,Great place for photographers and flower lovers,5.0,,"It has a collection of different continents' plants. It also displays different flower themes throughout the year. i.e tulip, perisian, chinese new year theme etc.
Its indoor with air-conditioned so dont need to worry the heat outside the dome!
I can easier spend hours just taking pictures of these beautiful flowers"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The christmas decorations were excellent. One gets to see plants and trees which one would not get to see otherwise cause you need to travel all over the world to do that. Simply amazing.
,,The dome of flowers and plants,5.0,,"Flowers from around the world , South America and Mediterranean and North America and Mexico and Netherlands etc have linked together as 1 spring 1 mind and 1 harmony."
,,Great collection of flowers & dessert plants under one roof,4.0,,"Quite interesting to see the collection of various continents dessert pants under one roof, overall all landscping & architecture of the dome is amazing,...
although one has to walk quite a lot to cover this place,...
bit disappointed as i could see the collection of tulips (guess its not so much as they advertise in their promotional campaigns)...
also, wide varieties of flowers make you mesmerised iwth the sheer beauty of the nature...
overall an enjoyable walk-thro... in flower dome...
if u r there for a week or so then include this one in your schedule else nothing much to miss"
,,A very relaxing and pleasant experience!,5.0,,I have nothing but praise for this place. Highly recommended for garden enthusiasts. Beautiful place we could visit it again.
,,Lovely,4.0,,"Came here on March 10th only to find the dome was closed for maintenance. So came back 2 days later and im glad i did! I found the enrty fee acceptable. I absolutely love nature and flowers so i was really excited about visiting and i wasnt disappointed.

The highlight for me was the succulent area with so many different kinds of cacti. I took many amazing photos. The dome is a decent size and didnt take too long to complete. I would happily visit again. Really had lots of gorgeous flowers on display. As i recall the dome was airconditioned too."
,,Nice time,5.0,,"I came here with my 2 teenagers and we really enjoyed ourselves. Yes, it is just a bunch of flowers, but they are beautiful and presented so well! The Chinese New Year display was very nice. We were prepared to go in and be warm (thinking of some type of arboretum/indoor garden), but it was quite chilly in there. It wasn't that hot of a day, but if it were hot outside, this would be an even better place to visit! We were probably only there one hour, but we felt it was well worth the money."
,,Splendid,4.0,,The flower dome is worth one visit. But please carry a jacket... it was soooo cold inside. I was disappointed to see the staff wearing jackets and visitors shivering in the cold. The plants and flowers were beautiful.
,,Great Flowers,5.0,,We visited in the lead up to Chinese New Year and the dome was festooned with floral tributes to the new year. The dome is well designed and laid out in different climate zones.
,,Beautiful flower collection,5.0,,"Flower Dome is situated next to Cloud Forest and is a part of Gardens by the Bay. Variety of flowers and plants could be seen in several gardens, some being country specific. Had a wonderful experience. Landscape inside is very spectacular. A place to spend about two hours. A good place for photography lovers and people having interest in botany. Joint ticket with Cloud Forest is available for visit to this dome. A must visit place while visiting Singapore. Visit for refreshing memories and have fragrance of different flowers."
,,Too good to be true,5.0,,Beautiful place just beautiful. I was speechless when I entered. It is a memory I will cherish till I go to my grave. It doesn't matter if you are a nature lover or not you will love it. And nature lovers this will be like heaven to you guys. I recommend that everyone please go here if you go to singapore
,,Well organised Attraction,4.0,,"Was there during the CNY period, and it is kind of pack, however, despite of huge crowd, but still have sufficient space to move around (except small portion of area is kind of congested - wait for other to take photos)

Have seen vast amount of flowers, and certainty learnt a lot about it, it is kind of addictive to take photo on every flowers you see"
,,Very Impressed - Well Organized!,5.0,,"Incorporated a visit to the Flower Dome whilst on an exercise walk through the Gardens By The Bay. A ticket needs to be purchased at the close by ticket booth and we were delighted to walk into a very climatically controlled air-con facility.

We enjoy walking and exercising whilst traveling and there is plenty of that to do, even in the Flower Dome. The overall impression was very organized, exceptionally clean facility with beautifully presented plants and flowers from all over the world. Got quite excited when we found plants from countries that we had visited and where family live.

Their orchid display was absolutely gorgeous as one would expect with this being Singapore's national flower!

There is a huge gift shop and there is easy access to restrooms/toilets. There is also a few places to purchase refreshments outside the Flower Dome.

We purchased a combo-ticket to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and were very impressed with both of these attractions."
,,WOW a engineering wonder!,5.0,,"GO and bring the whole family to this great attraction, fun, educational, inspiring and you will have a WOW moment!"
,,"So many flowers, so many peaceful moments despite the crowds",4.0,,"In some ways it is easy to wander the Flower Dome and feel like you're alone with the plants. Each species is identified by scientific name and place of origin, and it is amazing that all parts of the world come together and live in harmony (despite coming from rainforests and deserts, etc.) all in one place. Interesting art is mixed througout the Dome. The place is a riot of color and texture and scents. What a wonderful place to spend a few hours meandering through the plants and resting on an occasional bench or in the cafe when one needs a break."
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,"This is a wonderful place to spend a couple of hours viewing the flora of other countries.
I visited two years ago when it first opened and it has now matured beautifully.
The cacti are huge, and the flowers glorious
It was strange, though, to see flowers from the UK as a foreign exhibit - beautiful dahlias and geraniums amongst the orchids
The centrepiece changes and next they are planting thousands of tulips for display in April"
,,Amazing variety of flowers,5.0,,Its just amazing. We travelled with family to cloud forest and flower dome. Both the places are worth visiting. Collection flower is extraordinary and the landscape inside is simply spectacular.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,It was wonderful experience We have been to many gardens around the world but this blew our minds away. The variety and way it was set out was outstanding Each flower shrub and tree was named. Each garden was set out in different sections well worth a visit.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Visited the Flower Dome based on friends recommendations. Wow. The range of flora in flower was amazing. The dome is segmented into different areas or countries, so you can walk through succulents and then find yourself in Australia. Very well maintained facility and a great source of flower photo opportunities."
,,"If you only wish to visit/pay for one Dome, you can",4.0,,"We could see that it would take an hour plus to look around either of the Domes, so we enquired and were able to pay half the charge and just go into one, we chose the Flower one. The centre has a changing section according to season or event. As it was Chinese New Year, all the signs were illustrated. I was the Dog, my wife the Rat! This is the largest green house in the world it seems."
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"A great day out, definitely worth a visit. Buy the joint ticket with the cloud forest (which is truly outstanding). Easy to get to on the MRT."
,,Cool if that's what you're into,3.0,,"We aren't into flowers and cacti, therefore found it boring. We hoped it would be more breathtaking but it was sort of like any other garden. If you're not into flowers, maybe just pay for the Cloud Forest and get your fill."
,,good to visit,4.0,,always visit flower dome first and then cloud forest. other wise you will be disapppointed. i personally liked both places
,,Superb,4.0,,"I had been wanting to see what the Flower Dome was about and it was worth it. The place is the perfect fresh escapade you look forward to whenever you visit Singapore.
Besides it is relatively affordable and if you are lucky you may want to see some temporary exhibitions."
,,A must see if you like flowers,5.0,,Great way to escape heat! Incredible architecture and display of flowers and plants from all over the world. Go on weekday for less people and pay cash to avoid long lines.
,,Worth the experience,5.0,,"This was rated as a top attraction in Singapore and I must say it was worth the experience. Even thought I'm not much of a flower/plant lover, I thoroughly enjoyed walking around. It's a nice place to take pictures and learn about the different kinds of flowers/plants. I spent about an hour or so. Combine it with the Cloud Forest ticket."
,,Definitely worth a visit when seeing the Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,The displays inside the Flower Dome change with the seasons (such as they are in Sg!) and depending on what local festivals etc are taking place so it's always worth a visit. Get the duo tickets for the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest and save them until the heat of the day gets too much! There are loads of places to eat at the Gardens (Satay is one of the best) and plenty of facilities dotted around so really a very pleasant day for everyone.
,,An enjoyable experience,5.0,,"An enjoyable experience, supporting Singapore's idea of the garden city or city in a garden. Not expensive and all the other visitors seemed to be having a good time"
,,Excellent way to spend a hour,5.0,,"loved it, great setup easy to walk around, nicely cooled down, great place to take some pictures, and buy the combo ticket so you can also see the flower dome."
,,For flower and plant lovers,5.0,,"If you are not interested in plants, there's not much here for you. The flower beds and trees are excellent for taking pictures. Look out for special themes, try to plan your visit while these themes are in effect."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Beautiful, colourful flowers throughout the Garden.... displayed magnificently. Small cafes are available in various spots in the garden."
,,A must see,5.0,,One of the indoor facilities within the Gardens by the Bay - where you can experience eternal spring! Don't miss it
,,Better than the Cloud Forest?,5.0,,We visited both domes on different days as the Cloud Dome was closed one day a week. Of the two I preferred the Flower Dome. It seemed bigger and had a great range of habitats. Both domes are worth the visit. Pick your favourite.
,,nice place,5.0,,"Flower dome is such a lovely place;display of different kinds of flowers are great when you have a problem just go there and automatically it will gone,it will refresh your mind and soul the beauty of nature."
,,Flower displays too gaudy,4.0,,impressive collection of shrubs from around the world with some large shrubs and trees. Overall collection marred by over bright flower displays. Some impressive status amongst the displays. Pleasantly cool inside a relief from the temperature and humidity outside.
,,For flower lovers,5.0,,The climate-controlled dome is home to flowers and plants from cool and dry areas throught the world. One of the exhibits features a thousand year old olive tree.
,,Wow,5.0,,Flowers from around the world with full information on each. A fascinating insight into the botanic history and origins of each variety. Get the headphones for full value.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Why can't I grow plants like that?? Amazing display of plants & carvings!! Definitely worth the admission fee!!
,,Try to visit in daylight,3.0,,"Don't miss to smell the roses towards the exit. The blood maroon roses at end are full of very nice sweet smell.

Accessible by road or via BayFront MRT station, Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful garden within the central business district of Singapore. Entry is free, except for the 2 observatories (flier dome and cloud forest). Tickets for both observatories are required to be utilized on the same day.

Flower dome showcases flora and fauna in different parts of the world. There is an audio guide that can be purchased at extra cost. You can read yo the explanation beneath the plants.

Also, there are discounts for certain categories like sr citizens and free tickets for young children. Take vendor of these instead of just paying tickets based on headcount.

Try to visit observatories in daylight as they are too dimly lit for you to observe the plants or read the explanation."
,,Well kept and beautiful,4.0,,"My mother and I have never seen so many different flowers under one roof before! They were all displayed beautifully and well arranged, the area was clean and easy to navigate. I loved how it was all separated by country as well.

Note: Getting to the flower dome may be a bit tiring for older people but my mom managed very well with the help of the shuttle which will bring you right up to the flower dome/cloud forest ticket counter from the beginning of the gardens."
,,What a great way to spend the morning!,5.0,,"A cool & calm atmosphere, educational about the different plants & separated to different countries / origins. Fantastic wood sculptures, defiantly worth the visit."
,,Beatiful Peaceful Place,5.0,,If you like Flora and Fauna then this is a must visit whilst you are in the Gardens by The Bay area. The flowers are absolutely amazing.
,,Part of gardens by the bay EXCELLENT,5.0,,"VERY GOOD well worth the extra money to go there, lots plants from all over the world, amazingly they grow there, lots time spent on gardens, see plants from other countries all set in lovely displays."
,,interesting displays,5.0,,Second visit but each visit is unique because they update the displays and they are always great! Gets a little crowded by some of the displays but still worth the visit.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"It was like being locked in a forest,garden and desert at the same time everything catches you're eye and excites you just want to find out what's around the conner."
,,Average,3.0,,"Expensive for what it is, gardens inside an air conditioned dome. Only took me 15 minutes to go through. Lots of photo opportunities though. I think his should be free"
,,Wonderful collection,5.0,,Nicely done - and a good collection. Will keep one interested even without any particular knowledge of flowers - it is very pretty
,,Not only for plants lovers!,4.0,,"I visited the Dome 3 days after the Chinese New Year, apart from the usual exhibition of thousands marvellous species of flowers and plants they had a special exhibition for Chinese New Year, it was beautiful! Totally worth seeing."
,,Magic,5.0,,"On such a hot day it was wonderful to get the shuttle bus, it dropped us outside the Flower Dome & Gardens by the Bay so cool inside & colours for Chinese New Yr just stunning, well worth a visit we also did the sky walk well worth the view for $5 & very different although outside there was a little breeze, good tip buy your tickets from hotel as it saved so much time than lining up for tickets when you get there.$2 on shuttle Bus 2 ways saved a 15 min walk from station a must to see in Singapore a little far to walk to get food but cool in side & enjoyed our meal.."
,,Amazing,4.0,,This dome is simply amazing as it gathers under the same roof plants from all climates from all over the world. It is really worth a visit
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"This includes both the Flower Dome, the Cloud Dome and the surrounding gardens. Incredible, amazing - we went back for the light show at night. The elevated walkways are easily accessed with wonderful views. There is a shuttle which takes you on a spoken tour of the gardens and is usefulness for the less active. You can allow 2 days to take this all in. Singapore doesn't take things by half!"
,,Stunning,4.0,,"Having previously visited The Eden Project in the UK a while back, this was a lot more what I was expecting.
I love the way that the zones are broken up by continent (I loved the Australian zone) and the fact that the place is contoured, making it visually exciting.
The whole place is fascinating, there seem to be an army of people looking after all of the plants and flowers, and the variety and colour of the plants is simply amazing. Worth a look - buy the ticket ticket that gets you into both this and the Cloud Forest, amazing value for money."
,,A profusion of color!,5.0,,The dome is fascinating with plants from all over the world and a riot of colorful blooms. It was made even more colorful when we visited by all the red and gold decorations related to Chinese New Year. And the cool temperature makes it very inviting if you're tired of the outdoor heat and humidity!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Amazing displays of flowers of all colours and this was only heightened by the additional displays that were in place for the Chinese New Year.
,,"If only time for one dome, choose this one",5.0,,The flower dome was well designed and had an interesting collection of plants. The decorations for Chinese New Year and the year of the goat were spectacular.
,,the less interesting of the 2 domes,4.0,,"I got the chance to visit the 2 domes and as much as the flower dome was interesting it was for me less magnificent than the clouds dome. some special decoration for the chinese new year, lots of plants being presented, but was lacking a bit of the wow aspect for such an attraction."
,,Astounding Garden,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens By The Bay, an indoor garden full with various flowers from various places you may never seen before. I dont know where this came from, but i feel the air was so fresh inside the dome."
,,"Flowers, trees, and baobabs.",5.0,,Where else could you see baobabs! Flower displays are artistically displayed. I've seen flowers that I've never seen before. Flowers are arranged in gardens that represent different corners of the world. Not to be missed!
,,Flower Dome : an enjoyable place in Singapore,5.0,,"When I was at the top of Marina Bay Sands, I was amazed to see those two scallop shells in the gardens. And curious to see what they sheltered. One of those two scallop shells shelters Flower Dome. I could see a lot of trees and flowers species inside this dome. Palm trees and orchids are the most beautful species I could see. A really enjoyable moment."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We went during Chinese new year and it was nicely decorated. They have much more flowers than a normal botanical garden. The wide range of vibrant blooms was beautiful and the stone plants was nice to see. This is a great place to take pictures and we took plenty! There are the flower and Cloud Forest. It was well worth the $22 USD per person to visit the two Domes. I enjoyed visiting both but I prefer the Cloud Forest (The Falls). The water fall was spectacular. It is a nice escape from the heat. The walk up and the views was breath taking with a lot of unique plants and flowers.
,,gardens by the bay flower dome,5.0,,"Went during christmas and the flower dome was tastefully done up with christmas decorations a make believe fire place, the dome itself is aircon. Those who is going with an elderly person its advisable to bring a shawl or cardigan. The dome was brightly littled up and u feel as if u are in a christmas wonderland. A huge christmas tree was put up. It was truly a beautiful sight to see. Those on wheelchair was able to navigate their way through place as it was wheelchair accesable. By the way you can rent a wheel chair for those elderly or people who have difficulty walking by renting a wheelchair at the entrance of gardens by the bay at only 2 singapore dollars for the whole day but return is a must by 8pm.u have to produce some sort of identification like ic for locals and m. aybe passport for foreigners. They will return your identification passport or ic upin returning of the wheelchair, so no worries as elderly people can visit this attraction and those with walking difficulties. The flowe dome is always transformed into a wonderland of lights and beautiful decorations according to the theme of the occasion like christmas and chinese new year where the whole of gardens by the bay is transformed into a magical sea of lights and decorations to suit the occasion. Its a must see place to be even if its not an festive occasion as the flower dome and other attraction is worth visiting."
,,An amazing place,5.0,,"Kept at a constant 20 degrees C the Dome is an ideal place to visit and escape from the steamy heat of the city. The gardens depicting different planting from around the world are indisperced with some wonderful sculptures in metal, stone and wood. The Dome should be visited along with the Cloud Forest when in the gardens. We were lucky to see the display for the Chinese New Year it was stunning."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It's the year of the Goat, so there were lots of flower goats in the dome. Well worth a visit, plenty of flowers, carvings and interesting sculptures. A must see!"
,,A great display,4.0,,We went over Chinese New year so that was the theme. It was a tremendous display but the walking route was not as well organised as the Cloud Forrest. We thoroughly enjoyed the show which is clearly regularly changed and like the Cloud Forrest the coolness in here was very welcome.
,,Spectacularly beautiful,5.0,,"It was Chinese New Year when we visited the Flower Dome so the them was oriental and how magnificent it was, I could hardly believe my eyes. Masses of wonderfully beautiful flowers & themed displays. This is a must see attraction no matter what time of the year you visit."
,,"Nothing special, just like a small botanical garden.",3.0,,"Gardens by the Bay has two domes- Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. if you want to skip one, I will suggest you to skip Flower dome. Here you will find a wide variety of colorful flowers and decoration. Nearly same as any botanical garden. There is nothing special in this dome."
,,Wonderful!,4.0,,"If you wanna experience something new and exotic, this is the place to be! Well managed and lovely place. Went there during my anniversary outing to Singapore. If you are in Singapore, this is a Must watch place!"
,,Nice variety of flowers,5.0,,"Try to reach Gardens by the Bay around 3-3.30pm if you are a nature lover so that you get ample time to view both the domes (Cloud forest and Flower dome) before sunset. You will get to see a wide variety of colourful flowers in the flower dome and good rainforest and waterfall creation in the Cloud forest dome. Once you are done with both the domes, make sure you take the OCBC skwalk which requires a seperate ticket (both the domes and the skywalk ticket costs around SGD33). They mention you can stay on the skywalk for about 15 mins. Though you can stay longer if you want to, but 15-20mins is pretty much enough. Once you are back from the skywalk, you can just sit and enjoy the lights show which happens there around 7.45pm. Same show is repeated again after an hr or so, but I am not sure of the timing of the second show."
,,A place to cool yourself down!,5.0,,"It's quite picturesque inside this Dome and would be interesting for anyone, whether you are a botanist or not. Come here in the afternoon when outside heat has almost got you. The temperature here is quite nice fo cooling down, it's even a bit too cool on the upper level where all the cactuses are. Here you find a variety of different plants grouped according to the geographic areas where they are found."
,,Sensational!,5.0,,"The flower dome is just amazing.How anyone can compare the Botannical gardens selections(not talking Orchid Garden) to this, is just talking through their pocket. Beautiful Year of the Goat arrangements plus plants from around the world.Just breath taking."
,,A Beautiful Hour,4.0,,"Bring your sweater or light Jacket as it was quite cool inside. We visited at a wonderful time - just before the Chinese new Year Celebration, so it was decorated beautifully. It is a very educational and impressive gardens. Well worth the hour or 2 you spend there. It is best to buy tickets to both the Cloud Forest and Flower dome at the same time. They are connected via a gift shop in the basement and best done back to back. They can bother be seen in 2 - 4 hours depending upon how much you read and take photos. They are located in the Marina Bay Gardens and the closest MRT is BayFront."
,,Flower dome,4.0,,This is so lovely and air conditioned so on a hot day you can go and see this lovely display and escape the heat. While you are there go and see the mist mountain as well.
,,Lunar New Year Events,5.0,,Many of the exhibits were shown decorated for the Lunar New Year - very beautiful. Climate controlled for enjoyment in Singapore's Heat.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The flower displays were incredible. The Chinese New Year arrangments were really nice. It was a great visit and totally recommended.
,,Beautiful but cold,5.0,,Well worth a visit if you like flowers etc. Just be prepared for the cold temperature inside the dome (compared to the outdoors).
,,A definate must see.,5.0,,"It was brilliant and very well layed out, The flowers were unbelievable, spend the time a take ur time."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"We were fortunate enough to be visiting during Chinese New Year, so there were beautiful displays relating to the chinese horoscope symbols as well as their usual displays. Beautiful and cool inside and quite fascinating seeing the plants and flowers arranged into climate groupings. A must see."
,,Really lovely for Chinese New Year,4.0,,We went during Chinese New Year and the display was fantastic. Loved walking though here. Perhaps not as good as the cloud forest but still very fun.
,,Cool getaway,5.0,,In the midst of the stunning Gardens by the Bay is another Cool Oasis that offers an escape from the heat and humidity while providing a beautiful way t see a stunning collection of flora from around the globe. The developers have tried to show what the plants native habitat looks like and grouping them within geographic regions. As part of the stunning garden complex it also provides a way to escape not only the heat but shelter from the rain so plan your visit so that you see the open air sections while it is dry then you can quickly take shelter and continue your tour. As with the rest of the gardens this will also get better as the exhibits mature.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,This is the smaller of the two giant greenhouses. The signposting wasn't as clear here but we managed to get around and really enjoyed flora displays. There's also some very interesting statues. A great garden show to visit and really pleased we did so.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"We visited the Dome during our visit to Gardens on the Bay.
Unfortunately the Cloud Dome was closed. The flowers were amazing. I have never seen so many varieties & colours of dahlias ever. With the Lunar New Year there were many beautiful displays.
Don't miss a visit there."
,,Nice flowers,3.0,,"The flowers are nice but if you don't have enough time, this is not suggested to go. Because it is not that worth it I think."
,,The entire world,5.0,,"Here you have the fauna of the entire world under the same glass roof collected to small wholes from all around the world. Walking around in the dome it is hard to believe that the indoor park is just a few years old as it is filled with full size trees and palms, and the olive trees that you find in the “Mediterranean” part of the garden have to be hundreds of years old. Unbelievable!
Also in this dome is fairly “cool”, so it is wise to have something on your shoulders if you are sensitive to cold and intend to stay inside for a longer period."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"And totally captivating, even from afar, it was already quite a sight, but up close, you would love it even more...."
,,Flora Heaven,5.0,,I felt like I died and went to flora heaven. It showcased so many flora from different parts of the globe. What stood out for me were the Baobab and Ghost trees. This is a place for those flower enthusiasts and those who are just curious. Bring a jacket if you get easily as the inside of the dome was cold. #floraheaven #flowerdome #singapore
,,Wasnt impressed,2.0,,"If you're going to the Botanical gardens and Orchid gardens (inside the botanical garden), skip this one. Botanical gardens is much better quality and free."
,,AWESOME,5.0,,Chinese New Years and there were some special exhibits which were stunning. This dome is truly amazing. A must see while in Singapore!
,,go at night.,5.0,,brilliant sight at night. we got taxi there and one back. cant explain how well it is all done. no charge to see this at night.
,,Great in outlook,2.0,,Gerat in outlook. But poor in varieties of flowers and area size. Very expensive.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"I loved this place. Lovely, colourful and so much to look at. So peaceful walking around and checking out the displays. It's much better than the Cloud Dome."
,,Airy and Interesting,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is airy, cool and has examples for flora from around the world. It is great for a stroll around and feasting the eyes. You can take a break in a Mediterranean garden or relax in an Australian landscape."
,,Perfect for avoiding humidity,3.0,,"If you're tired of the hot humidity, then visiting the flower dome is perfect. The walkways are reasonably wide, so it doesn't feel overcrowded even when visiting during a peak time. There is a wide variety of flowers and plenty of resting opportunities."
,,A cool climate in hot humid Singapore,5.0,,"Outstanding place, and not that expensive. You can chose to just do the flower dome or buy a ticket to do the other dome with the Waterfall in too!"
,,Artificial landscape but it is very good,5.0,,"Lots of plants and flowers from countries all over the world. Nice cool surrounding, beautiful flowers, and some nice plants and trees."
,,Every flower you can imagine!,5.0,,"We loved everything about this place! So much work goes into their creations! And maintaining the beautiful displays must be a lot of work! This dome is huge!!! You have to see it to beleive it, truly amazing!"
,,Stunning view inside,5.0,,"From the very first start we had been really impressed with the view. Feels like the ticket is worth to paid. We love how we come just in perfect time, Chinese New Year! They put many Chinese decoration to celebrate the Goat year. The conservatory has been merrier than before. We almost take photo on every corner as we met so many friendly people there to help us took photos. We don't have so many impression at flower before, but coming here makes us excited looking at each plants as they are coming from so many different countries."
,,World of flowers under one roof!,5.0,,"Loved the visit to the Flower Dome, especially with the Chinese New Year exhibition in place. Great to see the different areas of the world represented. The sculpture of the Dragon was particularly impressive on the top floor!"
,,Good for an afternoon out,4.0,,"Pretty, air conditioned and a manageable size. This place has multiple photo ops and educational signs for kids. The displays change - there was one with the Eiffel tower when we last visited. The first time round there were hot air balloons! It's not limited to tropical plants and flowers but includes Baobab trees even. Goid way to escape the heat at Gardens by the Bay."
,,An ever-changing paradise to relax (and escape!) in,5.0,,"This stunning place is constantly being updated so it is ever-fresh. Last week it was all set up with Lunar New Year additions, and there were blooms everywhere.
It's such a great attraction to relax and get away from everything in, and the walk across from Marina Bay Sands is easy too. Enjoy!"
,,"Nature, flower lowers go crazy",4.0,,"Promise that if you're a nature lower and photography is your passion, you're spending 3 hours minimum in this exceptional place. Delightful experience"
,,Massive greenhouse,4.0,,Plants from many countries - organised into gardens spread around the interior - give you plenty to look at. This is a big space and it takes quite a time to walk round it. Less wow factor than the other dome - nevertheless well worth a visit.
,,Don't bother after dark,3.0,,"Even though the flower dome is indoors, they really don't light up the flowers when the sun sets, making them hard to appreciate. However, since the Lunar New Year is days away, the place is currently decked out in beautiful Chinese lanterns and gazebos. Very pretty and romantic, but probably not worth the price tag (just head to Chinatown instead), and you won't be able to see the fine details or spectacular colors of the flowers like you would during the day."
,,You don't even have to love flowers to think this is amazing!,5.0,,Flowers and flowering shrubs of every kind! Lots of orchids and other tropical flowers. Not to be missed!
,,Spectacular,5.0,,If you want to be immersed amonst flowers and plants from all over the world this is the place to visit. We were amazed at the design and beauty and would love to know who the planned the whole place. Don't miss it.
,,"Expensive, but worth a visit",5.0,,"This technological marvel is located at the Gardens by the bay. You have to pay a rather hefty fee to get in, but once you go inside, you forget that fee. The thing is a huge glass dome, which is totally airconditioned. Lots of flowers, and really fancy flower arrangements are on view. You can take lots of beautiful photos. Also, a really good place to spend the hot part of the day. You can also go out and comeback later, they give a re entry stamp. Also , you can get tickets for this place as well as most other attractions in Singapore from the travel agents at a cheaper rate, especially if you take several tickets together. Really saves some $$$"
,,Not for the disabled,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful gardens, but if you are disabled go to the other dome as it is a bit easier to get around with more lifts etc. Would definitely go again though."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,The flower dome is one of the two domed conservatories at Gardens by the Bay. It's beautiful to walk through with an enormous range of flora. Good for all ages.
,,Over priced,2.0,,"Beautiful garden with high technology, however for $30, we all felt it was over priced. Bring a jacket if you can't be in a cold room."
,,It depends on what you want...,2.0,,"We went to the flower dome with friends visiting from overseas, and this was the only reason, for we usually do not go for touristic sites. I expected to see something more impressive, like a real garden. But instead what I saw was a bunch of plants in vases and areas that resembled gardens, but were not real gardens. Our friends were not impressed and neither were we. The Botanic Gardens of Singapore are much, much better and absolutely memorable, probably one of the best in the world. And it is free!"
,,Beautiful place to visit especially if you want to avoid rain!,5.0,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay in early January 2015, choosing to visit the Flower dome. It was all decked out for Christmas and frankly it was very cool at 59 F perfect for a hot humid day for me but cool for Ken. We walked through the dome, amazed at the wide variety of plants and surprised that there was cactus, Mediterranean climate flowers, and no tropical flowers at all. At the very bottom of the dome was fake snow and a pretty snow scene, snowmen, and several large Christmas trees. Of course at the end it led right into a gift shop, which we browsed through but bought nothing."
,,Great place,5.0,,"Must visit this place, they have all types of flowers from all around the world. Worth more than the ticket amount. Atmosphere in Dome is maintained like a jungle, cool and humid."
,,amazing,4.0,,It's unbelievable that there's so much to see in one place. Get ready your camera! It could get quite cool inside so bring a jacket. You need that for the Forest Cloud observatory anyway.
,,very nice,4.0,,"This was very nice. Our entry ticket was about $28 singapore and included both this dome and the cloud dome. We went thru the cloud dome first, so by the time we got to this one we were exhausted from the heat and didnt spend the time here that we should have.would love to come back and visit again one day"
,,awesome,5.0,,I love flowers and that's why this was fantastic for me. Moreover decorated for Xmas and new year. It has re entry option for those who wish to visit twice in a same day. We went during day time and then by late evening.
,,Dahlias in the Tropics,4.0,,"Colourful construction of an extraordinary array of flowers but very unnatural, unlike the excellent Botanic Gardens. Nevertheless an undoubted tourist attraction. Enhanced by the decorations for Chinese New Year."
,,Go when there is a holiday,5.0,,Whenever there is a holiday they really decorate it out. Then it's really worth the visit. I went around Chinese new years and it's so beautiful inside with plenty of activities for the kids.
,,Quite nice but very expensive,3.0,,"Well managed, and a nice (not great, just nice) display of flowers. Watch out for cheap deals, especially multiple deals with other sites, which can make entrance more economical. I wouldn't pay the full fee (especially as they charge tourists much more than locals)."
,,Feast to eyes,5.0,,"Flowers flowers everywhere,variety from america to Africa and asia.It is part of Gardens by the bay.Reach by bus 400 from International plaza at Tanjong Pagar MRT or walk from Bayfront MRT for half a Kilometer"
,,Go to botanic gardens,2.0,,"Was not really impressive, rather hit to the botanic gardens, which are mostly free and more memorable."
,,Beautiful flower-Nice exhibition,5.0,,"I like many kinds of flower in this dome. The corner for the ""Goat"" year is very interesting. The flowers are very beautiful and some are strange."
,,Themed gardens!,4.0,,We visited just when the Chinese New year started and the whole garden was transformed into yellow and red theme. Goat shapes were designed and decorated out of flowers. They have a country specific garden too but i enjoyed the central theme garden the most! must visit to click beautiful memories!
,,The Disney of Botanical Gardens,3.0,,"It is an amazing sight and I have to remember it is billed as a flower dome. There are some great specimens, particularly succulents. But the planting is spiced up with sculptures and wire frame animals covered in blooms. So for me it was a bit gimmicky. It
Was close to Chinese New Year so the decoration was quite over the top. But this is really a park and not a tradition botanical garden. I didn't thing the 14 Singapore dollar entrance fee was too bad. Well worth a look if you do go visit here first and then the cloud walk."
,,Flowers from everywhere,4.0,,"There is a very interesting variety of flowers and plants from everywhere. Those who like The Little Prince will love to see the baobabs. Prepare your camera for lots of beautiful macro pictures of the colorful flowers. Once the areas are divided according to the region from where the plants come, it is very didactic to bring the children to learn a little of Botanic."
,,Amazingly beautiful,5.0,,Do visit this attraction on your next visit - there is ample variety of flowers and trees planted in a controlled environment and the theme keeps on changing as per the season. Visited last during Christmas month in December and could feel the North Pole was at our feet. Need to spend the entire day to breathe in the stunning display of flora and fauna - all under 1 roof.
,,new attraction in singapore,5.0,,"If u are fond of flowers and plants , u have it all under one air conditioned roof. Plants from Africa , South america , south asia , amazon area. Since Chinese new year is round the corner, there were lots of flowers in chinese settings."
,,Bring jacket. Probably the coldest place you'll find in Singapore,5.0,,"Another nice little venue to go and see all the wonderful plants and flowers. Nicely organised venue. However, the a/c is probably set to ""morgue"" setting or perhaps they've watched ""Frozen"" too many times. Bring a jacket! it's freezing inside."
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,I love flowers of any kind so really enjoyed my visit here. It is a must if you visit Gardens by The Bay. It was all beautifully decorated for the Year of the Goat and there was many yellow(gold?) goats around the gardens. Spectacular.
,,Enchanting,5.0,,"Been there 3 times atleast
Different festival
Pumpkin soo cool
Orchid very mesmerizing
Christmas so white and bright

A good place to have fun if you like flowers.
Bring your family for great experience.
Come every different festival and find the magic of the flowers.

Cant wait to come again."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"My husband and I didn't think much about visiting the place, we thought it would be just like one of those botanical gardens. We were so wrong! The Flower Dome contained some of the best species of plants and flowers from all over the world. There was an Australian garden, an African garden, complete with baobab trees, a Mediterranean garden with hundred year old olive trees and in the middle was a flower garden decked out with goats made of flowers ( in time for Chinese New Year). There were lots of orchids and unusual plants and flowers. All in all, a very novel place to put up right in the middle of the concrete jungle. Recommend everyone not to miss this place. A must visit!!"
,,Good if you like flowers,3.0,,"It is a big dome, go only if you like flowers else go to Cloud Forest. The sculptures made out of flowers is the attraction."
,,2nd visit just as memorable and exciting as the first,5.0,,"We visited on New Year's Eve, the Christmas display ' winter wonderland' was spectacular and ensured we had a very different experience to our 1st visit. We visited at night and enjoyed not only the flower dome displays but the views from the dome to the flyer, and gardens outside. The gardens are beautifully displayed and the plants from all corners of the world make this an enjoyable experience. Nighttime may not be the best time to visit if there is not a Christmas light display as some of the outer gardens were quite dark....if you plan to visit in December 2015 then pack a jumper, the temperature in the winter wonderland display was set to really capture what it would be like in the snow. This attraction is well priced with excellent opening hours which allow you to spend as much time as you like in the dome. Seating is available in the dome, and a cafe is also accessible whilst in the dome."
,,Cool and flowers,4.0,,"The cool and dry interior was a great escape from the scorching heat of the sun, especially during noon. There are a wide variety of flowers and plants that can be seen inside. It is divided into sections depending on geographic origin of the plants. There is a cafe, and some benches where you could just sit down and marvel at the plants."
,,Beautiful and festive,5.0,,The flowers from all over the world. Specally the cactus collection is excellent. Festive decoration for chinese new year was excellent
,,Tons of blooms and color,5.0,,"Pay the admission to get in, it's totally worth every penny (or Sing-dollar, as the case may well be). It's a riot of color, well laid out and perfectly maintained. Not a weed or a wilt in sight! GREAT photo place!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,This is one of the 2 domes within the modern Garden on the Bay. It was fascinating to visit and very well laid out. There was a special display while we were there because of the forthcoming Chinese New Year which was exceptionally beautiful and colourful
,,So So.,3.0,,"It is not so specially to me. so I have short time at Flower Dome. In my opinion, Forest Cloud is more exciting."
,,Nice afternoon,4.0,,"We liked the way the gardens were set out and even my adult sons were interested in the range of different plants. Colourful, but maybe more of an environmental message could come through as in the Cloud exhibit."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I was really stunned by the amazing display of flowers, I liked it so much that I went back there again after some months."
,,Just as expected,3.0,,"The flowers and plants are well cared for. At this time, it's the Chinese New Year scene which really shows the prosperous and joyfulness of the season. However, My daughter and I did not find it exceedingly interesting. I'd have to say it hasn't quite reach the money value."
,,Pales in comparison to the Cloud Dome.,3.0,,"Although this is an interesting place to visit, I felt it was not as memorable as the Cloud Dome which we visited just before our tour of this Dome. Whilst there were some attractive flowers on display, there was nothing which took our breath away whereas we were really impressed with the beautiful plants displayed in the Cloud Dome. We did think the floral decorations displayed for the forthcoming Chinese New Year were pretty but overall, we felt this Dome runs a poor second to the Cloud Dome."
,,Don't go at night!,3.0,,Don't bother going to see this when the sun has set. It is not lighted very well so you will not be able to see the flowers. Yet the staff will still sell you a ticket.
,,If you're nearby,3.0,,This place is nice but it was below my expectations. There are many types of flowers and plants but nothing out of the ordinary or breath taking.
,,Beautiful and relaxing.,5.0,,The decorations are uplifting and the flowers are gorgeous. There are also exhibits of plants from different countries which is both interesting and edifying.
,,skip it,2.0,,"I think this dome was not worth the money. It was nothing that you couldn't see in nature. Everything looked beautiful and well designed but i just don't think it was a ""wow"""
,,Excellent Location,5.0,,"Just opposite the Cloud forest and well within the Gardens by the Bay, an excellent location not to be missed. Take time, do not make a trip in hurry as the visit here is expensive."
,,Nothing much to see here,1.0,,"There was Christmas theme when i visited this place, Christmas trees, Santa and snow fall. I was wondering how this place would look like on other times of the year. The place didn't have much to display."
,,Nice attraction,4.0,,excellent place. Its a new concept and we all loved the way they have created a sustainable ecosystem.
,,Worth Going,4.0,,"A huge glass dome housing flowers of all kinds, this attraction is a heaven for plant lovers. Due to Chinese New Year approaching, a lot of floral arrangements were done based on the theme. There were depictions of gardens of different types like Meditteranean, Californian, South American etc. You can have a nice stroll clicking pictures.

There is a hall in the end where a private function was going on. The decor visible from outside was amazing!

Just FYI...these guys give you an option of having your pre-wedding shoot done in the flower dome or cloud forest.

This dome won't take more than 30 minutes. If you are falling short of time, skip the place esp when you have visited the Cloud Forest cuz that is much more impressive. This is a pretty display of different flowers."
,,Excellent,5.0,,As stated in comments about Cloud Forest - excellent value for money. Food venues available at reasonable cost
,,Nice but the Cloud Forest is better,4.0,,"You must visit while in gardens by the bay, probably get the 2 tickets together (Flower dome and Cloud Forest).
Its very nice to visit and spend sometime, I thought its bigger. There is a restaurant inside which you can enjoy a sit there but its over priced."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We really enjoyed our trip to the Flower dome, combined with the Cloud Forest. The flower displays are well cared for and very attractive. It's easy to get to on public transport. The Botanic Gardens are well worth a visit for some peaceful time in a very busy city."
,,Stunning flower displays,5.0,,"Under a spectacular glass dome like the Cloud Forest, the Flower Dome offers an impressive range of flower and plant life that is usually found spread across the planet. The international gardens include Australian, South African, Californian, South American and Mediterranean exhibits as well as the amazing displays of baobabs and bottle trees which I found most intriguing. There is also a flower display in the centre of the attraction which changes across the seasons. There is easy and accessible access around the attraction and everything is well constructed providing the most pleasing and informative experience. The cool atmosphere (a bit warmer than the Cloud Forest) is a great way to escape the outdoor heat of Singapore. By itself the Flower Dome may be a bit pricey but combined with the Cloud Forest admission, both are definitely worth checking out."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The place, as suggested by the topic, was immensely beautiful. The flowers were magnificent, and arranged in a lovely fashion."
,,Brilliant Garden,5.0,,"I absolutely loved the Flower Dome, by far the best attraction in the City. The layout of the garden is beautiful, if you love gardening a must visit."
,,Cool thing to see if you have time to spare,4.0,,"Nice gardens areas, uniqe setting. Not a must see in Singapore if you're not extremely interested in botanics, but a nice place for an outing."
,,Spectacular and beautiful,5.0,,Wonderful arrangement of international trees and flowers in a spectacular indoor dome Entrance fee for foreigners 28S$ it's good value for money All time of the day is good no matter if its at daylight or night
,,Colourful,5.0,,"Out of the 2 domes this was my least favourite, the flowers were more like we see in the uk, but having said that they were pretty impressive, when we went it was just after new year and xmas displays were still up which did seem a bit odd"
,,Flower dome impressive plant displays,4.0,,"We were impressed by the plant displays provided here, along with the organisation of the plants into different sections. The plants are flourishing here, and there is a lot of information on display to educate the visitor.

There are conservation messages on display. I'm concerned that some of the plants here are very mature, and have obviously been removed from their natural habitat. Perhaps this is in conflict with the messages.

Its nice a cool inside, so it makes a break from the weather if you're feeling hot."
,,Impressive and Very Creative,5.0,,"Spent an afternoon here it was amazing. The clever combining of colours and different plants is stunning. Definitely worth an award. Careful attention to detail is obvious as well as the devoted staff. Well worth a visit.

Tip - selfie stick, good camera, extra battery and Sd card, if using smartphone power bank"
,,Just nice,3.0,,"Nice if you 're with children. A lot of things they can learn from it. For couple, hmmm not so recommend. But the view and garden arrangement is really nice and refreshing"
,,Nothing special,3.0,,Maybe visited during the night so cannot really read the description. The whole place is too dark. The flowers for Chirstmas is already wilting and for Chinese new year is not ready. So maybe when I go is just bad timing.
,,Have seen many better displays,3.0,,Chintzy christmas decor. Some mass plantings created interesting arrays but generally it was a bit of a let down. More fun at the Botanic gardens.
,,Impressive,5.0,,Visited the flower dome in April and were positively surprised! We liked the concept of the two domes and were impressed with the many varieties of plants and the information provided! Would definetly recommend!
,,Stunning,5.0,,The gardens are kept in great condition and are a must if you are in the area. Got some great photos here too!
,,Fun Times with Flora & Fauna,5.0,,So many different flowers and plants to take pretty pictures with. There was also still a lot of Christmas decoration even though I visited in January which I enjoyed as the decorations were amazing. Definitely worth the trip!
,,Dome of wonder,4.0,,"Absolutely loved the cactus garden here, teenage kids did too, was not as good as Cloud Forrest but still impressive."
,,Boring,3.0,,"There are two conservatories in the Gardens at the Bay complex. One is amazing, breathtaking and very interesting, whilst the other is a bit of a bore with not much thought put into it. That's the Flower Dome. It's nice, but that's just it. No special plants to be found there compared to other botanic gardens, too wide walkways making the area more gray than green and quite a boring selection of flowers. If you wish to spend your money on only one conservatory, the Cloud Forest is the one. If you're visiting both, go to this one first, because it would be a disappointment after the awesomness of the Cloud Forest."
,,Diffent country plant species,4.0,,A good variety of plants from many countries. The baobab area was most interesting. Good space between planting areas.
,,Flowers everywhere,3.0,,"The Flower Dome showcases assorted flowering plants from different parts of the globe. We visited in mid-Dec and the floral display featured a winter wonderland complete with giant snowflakes, reindeers, a bear santa on a sleigh, snowmen and fake snow. And let’s not forget the poinsettias, hundreds and hundreds of them. Not really my cup of tea but a cool and relaxing time after a hot and humid day spent outdoors."
,,Flower Dome - Singapour,4.0,,"Another extraordinary feat of architecture, design and tropical inventiveness built in the Garden-by-the-Bay, with beauty and educational purpose. Another must see!"
,,Beautiful Indoor Garden,4.0,,The dome is beautifully laid out and since we were there in late November the Christmas decorations were lovely. The various sections have interesting plants and descriptions and the wooden sculptures add to the garden.
,,my views,4.0,,Well made but only a portion was open. The flowers were ordinary and not much exclusive as we thought or were looking for.
,,Great trees & displays,4.0,,"Flower Dome has very interesting botanic displays for different geographic regions - Australian garden, Sth African garden, Mediterranean garden etc. Some fantastic trees on display - including Qld bottle trees & ancient olive trees. Interesting & educational garden displays with nice sculptures dotted around the gardens - well worth a visit."
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,"A pleasant few moments in the Flower Conservatory , but nothing special , most of the plants are found in English gardens and so we found the displays disappointing. The paths have very little flow and so you find yourself back at familiar places from time to time. I would not rush to go back for another visit."
,,average,3.0,,"for the $14 entrance fee, this was a disappointment.
the architecture was awesome, but the diversity and quality of the exhibition was very average. there were different gardens but they all kind of meshed into one. the name was a misnomer for us as there were more trees than flowers.
it could have been because it was christmas time and there were a lot of christmas themed gardens which weren't all that exciting!"
,,Flowers from around the World,5.0,,Amazing to see so many species from around the world under one dome. Enjoyed the Christmas scenes and explanations about the different traditions.
,,Beauty at its best,4.0,,"This is another awesome place to be. Beautiful and bountiful...such colorful splendor, even for a person like me who do not really know how to appreciate flowers...I really enjoyed being here. Atmosphere was great, landscape is such a wonder. Never stop clicking away beautiful shots with my camera. Hey, it was quite cold in here, be sure to carry a jacket at least, never come here in light clothing. We just wanna come again when ever we come to Singapore. Cheers."
,,Speechless!,5.0,,We spent hours inside the dome and didnt even realize the time! This place is overwhelming. Such beauty in a gigantic dome for all to appreciate. Well done Singapore! A must visit.
,,Was not too impressed,3.0,,"The plants in the flower dome were not too exciting for me as I've seen quite a number of them of them already. But if you're not an avid garden-goer or whatever they call it these days, then you would enjoy it more."
,,For that glimpse of flora,4.0,,"Best time to go is near evening. Take in slow and return when the lights are turned on for that night look. While the place reeks of interesting plants and flora, what is lacking is the sweet scents of each flowering plants. Yet, I fell in love with the Japanese Cedar trees that you could smell the scent up close.

For the elderly and wheelchair bound, dont worry, there are elevators for you to use. Otherwise, that climb of stairs is a good exercise. LOL... The best time to visit is when they have the International flower festival."
,,Modern natural wonder.,4.0,,"Very impressive multi regional indoor gardens. Well signed, good paths, gorgeous greenery. Recommend."
,,Excellent display,5.0,,"Visited this venue in December and the theme was very Christmas oriented, with lots of red poinsettia, Xmas trees, fake snow and Xmas carol playing. A photographer's delight. Slightly expensive to visit, but offered a great visual experience."
,,Vast,5.0,,A great opportunity to see plants from other continents all in the one place. Many unusual species thriving in full-grown condition are testament to the skill of the botanists and gardeners who arranged this amazing display.
,,What a beauty,5.0,,"Entrance to the Flower Dome is SD 28 per person (if you combine it with entrance to the Cloud Forest Dome) money well spent since it is stunningly beautiful in there. They had a special Christmas disply called yuletide when we were there and it was simply beautiful. Huge variety of different flowers, plants and trees from all over the world. It was a bit chilly in there so take a light sweater if you tend to freeze easily."
,,Flower Dome Okay,3.0,,Perhaps because it was dark and crowded so we didn't really get to see much of the flowers at the Flower Dome... I guess cloud forest is still my preference over Flower Dome. The 'snow' which they featured for the yuletide season wasn't very impressive and can cause allergies if you're sensitive to such (note: can cause sneezing!)
,,Informative visit,5.0,,My wife like plants & flowers. So we were told that this flower dome complex has an excellent collection of flowers & plants. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the complex more than lived up to our expectations!
,,Only Flowers,2.0,,"Well maybe it was my expectation too high, we can only see flowers, and as I am not a big fan for flowers, I am not really enjoying my time here."
,,After Christmas is not a good time,2.0,,"As good as the Cloud may be, the flower dome was a waste of time. Partial Christmas decorations were up. Most blooms were past their time. I could have easily missed this. Check the outdoor Botanical Gardens for the real McCoy in a natural setting. At least in early January this was a waste of our time."
,,Literally Cool and breath taking,5.0,,"Went to the flower dome for an afternoon out with the family. The first thing that hit us was the very cool atmosphere. (Temperature wise).

The whole place was chilled to a very comfortable temperature to cater for the very different kind of plants that were housed in the structure.

Thoughtfully laid out with more then ample description of what your eye is feasting on.

With Christmas season, the whole dome was decked in a very tasteful Christmas theme.

What impressed me was the level of maintenance that was very evident. During the time we were there, we say gardeners removing withered leaves and flowers. Overtime there was a piece of trash on the floor, someone came along very quickly to remove it.

Highly recommended for tourists and locals alike."
,,My dream garden,5.0,,Besides the cool Melbourne-like weather the garden is just breath-taking. Most of the plants in the dome can grow in my yard but they were arranged so beautifully. It is a 'must see' if you are into plants. I could not stop myself from taking photos. We did not book. We just purchased the tickets as we got there. No big deal.
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"We visited the Flower Dome while on vacation in Singapore. It was a simply amazing experience! The dome itself is breathtaking and includes many varieties of flowers, trees, and cacti. It is a great location for any photographers or families. Definitely recommend visiting this as well as the Cloud Forest Dome."
,,Christmas setting,4.0,,"Because we were there Christmas week the usual field of flowers was replaced by a snowy Christmas setting, and it was beautiful. We had a snack and drinks in ""Pollen"" , not cheap, but we enjoyed it."
,,Step inside a cool oasis of flowers and more,5.0,,"See this attraction in the middle of a very hot, humid Singapore day. Enjoy the flowers, stroll, and take in the sights. At Christmas time, which is when we went, the decorations are also enjoyable.

See also the reviews for Gardens by the Bay and Cloud Forest. We went to all of the attractions and had a terrific time."
,,Over rated and expensive,3.0,,"Cost SGD 28 (non locals) to visit the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Nothing too special about the Flower Dome - lots of cactus species, Australian succulents and flowers. We had afternoon tea at Pollen Restaurant inside the Dome. Recommend booking a table in advance as some customers were turned away without booking. Ordered a piece of pineapple and mango cake, deep fried calamari and cheese with biscuits. Serving is very small, more like child size For example, only 4 biscuits came with the cheese . Also ordered 2 coffees and a pot of tea. Bill came to just over $100 SGD. Ouch! Take a light jumper with you, it's cold inside the Dome."
,,A great visit for the Family,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is a great place to visit in the Botanical gardens with a superb variety of Plants and Cactus, small trees and wood carvings. Our visit co-incided with Christmas Decorations around December within the Flower Dome so this is a must for the Children"
,,Even if you don't like flowers...,5.0,,"This is an experience that is at once unexpected and immersive. Beautifully designed on multiple levels, you can retreat from the outside heat into another world where the plants, flowers and environment create something truly memorable."
,,Pretty average experience,3.0,,"I am Not overly impressed with this. Yes there are some different plants from different areas in the world, and It's quite easy to go to, but I felt a little ripped off at that Price. (14SGD 1/2 the Price of a combiticket flower dome/cloud forest). My boy was bored (9 years), but thats ok. Not everything has to be thrilling and exiting for a child."
,,Flowers Galore,4.0,,"I super love flowers so that the flower dome is truly one of the best concepts for me =)
I like that it was a lot of flowers from different parts of the world.
It was well-designed and every section has a write-up and each region has its own unique characteristics.

It reminded me a lot of creation and how wonderful the world is! =)
At the same time during Christmas period there is a luminarie outside which is free. That is extremely beautiful and reminded me of Kobe Luminarie."
,,excellent,5.0,,"Must visit the flower dome while in Singapore. For families, or groups, or even for solo travelers. It is an indoor, interactive space with lots of cactus species, seasonal flower displays that change each month. Wheelchair friendly."
,,"Nice, but not worth the entry fee",3.0,,"This is nice, but totally overrated. The air conditioning is freezing and the gardens are little more than those on show in any free city Botanical Gardens. Save your money and go there."
,,Quite small but well signed,4.0,,Not a good place for your to gain knowledge however this place is special. Quite small but well signed.
,,Beauty and comfort,4.0,,It's a covered and air conditioned dome in the park near the Marina Bay Hotel. It's nice dry and cool walk through different flower gardens with a world variety of flowers and plants.
,,Christmas,4.0,,They advertised snow but the children were not allowed to touch which was a little disappointing but the actual flower and different continental exhibits were fantastic. Large examples of baobab trees and large cactus.
,,Something different,5.0,,Great place to visit for flower lovers. Venue does regularily change the layout so able to visit throughout the year. Good place to get out of the sun or the rain
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,It's a very beautiful place with lots of different plants from all the world. You can also find some nice art crafts between the plants. It's a must see attraction.
,,Green thumb,4.0,,"Great place to spend a few hours away from the Singapore sun. The place was decorated with Christmas decors and it was just amazing. The waterfalls was fantastic and the place is well looked. Flowers from all over the world adored the dome - spent 3hrs and we didnt even notice it...,"
,,amazing,5.0,,"Flower Dome and Cloud forest are just adjacent to each other, wonderful experience, kids njoy the most very chilling AC inside colorful world of flowers"
,,Christmas visit with family,5.0,,"Very well decorated during Christmas time, every aspect showed the blend of nature and decoration. You will click so many pix there. Ensure you wear a warm jacket it can get cold sometime."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We visited flower dome several days before christmas and they already decorated the whole dome with christmas decoration. walking among different vegetation with beautiful christmas decoration was very calming. we really enjoyed our visit
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,Very interesting as part of my day at Gardens by the Bay. Such a great job has been done. Would recommend.
,,Not as interesting as the Cloud Forest,3.0,,If we went again we probably would give the Flower Dome a miss. The Cloud Forest is the star of the visit. It was a nice walk and a good way to get out of the heat into the nice cool air however still not as amazing as the Cloud Forest.
,,Eye-catching.,5.0,,"A breathtaking experience—especially during the Christmas period. The flora is diverse and assorted; each section is nice-looking and very well maintained. (Beware, though, there are little to no [affordable] dining options for vegetarians at Gardens by the Bay/Flower Dome! It might be a good idea to bring packed lunch or plan to eat elsewhere.) The Flower Dome is a must-see for all nature lovers!"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Wonderous, but I've never seen Australian plants looking so healthy! Beautiful. A great display of interesting plants from around the world in an amazing setting."
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,Really enjoyed it well worth the visit. An absolute stunning display of plants from all over the world. Being Christmas the Christmas displays and lights were amazing
,,LOVED it! Check both domes are open before you visit though,5.0,,"Amazing place if you love horticulture - when I went to visit one of the domes was closed and as I only had one free day I was a little disappointed, but it just gives me a reason to go back! Take your camera, batteries and an empty memory card, I took about 600 photos!"
,,Ahhhhhhhh!!!!,4.0,,"This place is noted for its flowers so I will spare you the regular details. What is the best part of this place? The air conditioning. Simply put, it is delightful to walk thru an open space with flora and fauna in the cool air after enduring the warm and humid Singapore weather. Makes me think of Genting highlands."
,,Good place,4.0,,"The place is nicely designed and well engineered. Good for tourists amd locals as well. However, you got to be a fauna lover so you appreciate the whole venue"
,,Stunning Nature tree,4.0,,"Came here around christmas and they have this christmas theme with wonderful landscapes. They set a really cold temperatures so it gives you the feeling of a snowy day. You should explore all the areas, there are lots of variant of flowers and trees."
,,very nice place,4.0,,"this ia flower heaven......my wife love it......all the staff are very friendly, warm and so professional.. surely this is not my last visit...will back here very soon"
,,Innovative,5.0,,Want to see rare botanical species from across the globe at one place. this is the right place for you. I marveled as to how the balance is maintained to nurture the trees/plants that grow in contrastic climatic conditions. Really worth the time spent.
,,Stunning floral displays,5.0,,"We have family in Singapore, so visit quite regularly and I never tire of visiting the Flower Dome. The displays are changed constantly and follow a theme for the season. We have just visited and enjoyed the stunning Christmas scenes, settings and lights, plus all the absolutely glorious floral displays. A must do in Singapore!"
,,Beauty and tranquility in the city,5.0,,A perfect way to spend a lazy afternoon. Tons of exotic flora and contemporary art to tickle your senses. If you have more time there's a shop to have that perfect cup of tea in that perfect place.
,,Lovely Place,4.0,,Full of flowers. Air-Conditioner was strong. It is a comfortable in-house spot to visit when it was terrible hot outside.
,,A bit of every continent,4.0,,A wonderful selection of plant life from the various climates of the world. Very impressed with the selection of cacti on the upper level.
,,Interesting!,4.0,,"There are displays of the different types of plants that grow in different regions of the world. It was interesting, but a little disappointing after visiting the Cloud Forest."
,,For Flower Lovers,4.0,,The Flower dome is along with the cloud forest a new attraction within the Gardens at the bay Worth a visit if you like flowers
,,Could be so much better,3.0,,A superb facility which I'm sure could be significantly improved with a much better 'flower display'. It may have been because we were there shortly before Christmas but we were very disappointed with the flowers/plants on display.
,,colourful,5.0,,A good attraction for flower lovers and the little ones alike.It was very pleasing. The area inside the dome is airconditioned.
,,Must see,5.0,,The Flower dome is another attraction which should be seen along with the cloud forest. both are really great and and among the best attractions of singapore. Preferably go at evening and enjoy the lighting of the domes
,,Lovely and serene,4.0,,"I didn't expect to enjoy the Flower Dome more than the Cloud Forest, but in the end I did. It was a blissful walk through the dome, the temperature was perfect and the plants made the air crisp and clean. I really felt refreshed, and it made my day."
,,Very pretty,5.0,,This is a truly remarkable experience. We really appreciated seeing the flower dome before heading to the cloud forest.
,,lack of flowers,3.0,,no comparison to the Cloud dome. While Christmas was the theme - and Christmas music all that played - seems a missed opportunity to show off flowers from around the world.
,,Must Visit Dome,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is simply spectacular. The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like South Africa, California and parts of Spain and Italy. Home to a collection of plants from deserts all over the world, it shows the adaptations of plants to barren environments.
 
The changing theme at the Flower Field reflects different seasons and festivities. When we were there,it's winter wonderland. For someone who grew up in a tropical country, it was a sight to see their recreated gardens with snow.

We saw some baobabs and bottle trees, drunken trees and ghost tress, succulent garden, the 1000-yr old Olive tree from Spain and other amazing plants and flower from around the world. Not to miss when going there. The temperature inside is well below what we used to so if you get easily cold, bring a jacket with you."
,,Nice and cooling,5.0,,"The flower dome is temperature controlled, which means it remains cooling no matter how ridicoulsly hot the rest of Singapore is. The exhibits change every now and then, so frequent visitors like myself are never bored with the place."
,,Some lovely flowers,4.0,,I think this will improve with age as the plants get more established but there were some great flowers on show here. A little too many pontsettia on display in the Christmas exhibition for my liking! I look forward to seeing it again in a few years time.
,,Flowers beyond the dome !,4.0,,Cloud Forest then Flower Dome and dinner at Pollen was my agenda for Singapore Bay front visit . One among the two domes in more than 100 hectares is encouraging . Flowers from all over the world. Well arranged in different slopes and levels . Christmas floral arrangements was an added attraction. Amazing. I simply loved and enjoyed the moments ....
,,Peaceful,5.0,,If you love nature...must visit...you can spend nearly 3 hours just listening to the brief description about each plant...the music was awesome (Christmas season)
,,PAY to see..do your self a favour !!!,5.0,,...what an expensive leap in faith by the authorities to accept this outrageously futuristic...almost AVATAR quality in parts... but Brilliant concept!!!
,,Had that Christmas Feel!,5.0,,The Flower Dome inside the Gardens By the Bay had been fitted out especially for Christmas and was very well done. The normal display of plants were very impressive and we spent quite sometime in here walking around.
,,Miffy@Yuletide in the Flower Dome,4.0,,"Visited on 14thDec2014 w family. Just brought single dome $12 per Adult for local(showed IC) or Work permit for foreign workers. There is a 10% off for ntuc U plus card. Last day of taking photo w Miffy n so was very crowded.Reached there 2pm n was already 8th in the queue. The photograph session is located right infront of the entrance n is decorated w a big christmas tree w many teddy bears(specially designed by GTBT n is sold $24.90 each at the gift shop)=cuteeeee!!! Next to it, is a big standing teddy big w a spect.We waited patiently n at 2:30pm sharp, Miffy arrived, is so cuteeee, a chaos from behind queued, screaming n yelling:""awww!!!Miffy"".haha!!! I must gave a thumbs up for the management, as they managed the session well,was speedy n smooth n the staff (Indian boy), he was thoughtful, he took a far n a closed up photos for us.
The temperature in the Dome is adjusted to extra cold for the winter plants to survive.So is freaking cold around 3pm+ while there was no sunlight shine in the Dome.
A mini winter village w a big teddy on a sleigh, illuminated reindeers n a field of winter floral...e.g.Poinsettias(a red traditional plant used for decorations) n Holly(striking red berries). Get to c the commomly christmas decoration items, in real. In Singapore we can only c,feel n touch as a decorative arts.
There were many christmas trees n snowmen structures in the Dome for you to take photos. There is even a 3D fire wood stove n next to it,is a christmas tree.Mini snowmen decorated on 'snow field' w house . There was 2 big teddy bear before the exit."
,,Beautiful Attraction,4.0,,This is a lovely attraction. The dome has flowering plants from all over the world and in full bloom. It provides beautiful settings for photographs.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Flower dome at gardens by the bay is a must see attraction it is amazing place, costs $14 to enter well worth it"
,,Awesome displays of flora,5.0,,Changes the theme every once in a while. Photography addicts best indoor playground. A lot of subjects to take. A variety of flowers and plants from different places were here taking you to another place.
,,A great experience,5.0,,A out of the world experience with some exceptional moments of wow... to have such a mega-structure built for an experience which is mind blowing. I was here part of the Christmas decor and loved the snow flakes. good value for money... and a amazing outing for kids and family.
,,Do not recommend,2.0,,If you want to see flowers go next door to Cloud Forest. There were very few flowers and it was incredibly disappointing. Not at all worth the admission cost.
,,very good attraction,5.0,,a really nice place to spend a day.the different Orcids and flowers are fantastic. The water fall is a and inside the mountain is stunning
,,Wonderful International Display,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to be here in December when the Christmas display was on. Simply amazing, it complimented the display of plants and trees from around the world.

This place is a must see together with the Cloud Dome (S$24) and is excellent value.

It does Singapore proud."
,,Climate controlled dome,4.0,,"Visited Gardens by the Bay , and the Flower dome few times already.Located on the BayFront MRT exit ,walk further across the Entrance fee non Singaporean are higher than for Singaporean .
The climate inside the dome , was so pleasant compared to the humid and hot Singapore, it was an air conditioned and temperature controlled environment.
Visited Nov 2014 , they decorate the flowers as a white peacock and put some big stuffed bear dolls on the garden.The decorations changed regularly.Stroller friendly ,wheelchair friendly, interactive displays are located on the exit of the Flower Dome.
Some restaurants are within the area, but the prices are a bit expensive, you can always go to Marina Bay Sands foodcourt for a much cheaper dining experience."
,,"Enjoyable, but not as much a draw for me at Christmas",4.0,,"I far preferred the Cloud dome to the flower dome, although there is another cactus or arid climate display which is fantastic. Being North America, I did not enjoy or appreciate the Christmas themed displays, so unless you are a big fan of Christmas decor, or have little ones who might appreciate it, wintery display is lack luster."
,,Good variations round the year. Worth a visit,4.0,,"I stayed in SG for 15 months & had visited this place 4 times during each decoration. (Tulips, Chinese new year, Diwali, Roses)
Located on the bayfront metro station, this is a good 15 minute walk from the metro station. This is a part of gardens by the bay and is adjoined by the cloud forest. Completely indoor & temperature controlled, it is exceptionally maintained. A cactus section on the right of the entrance, a central (which changes every time as per the theme) & a lot of flowers and plants under a glass roof.
The best of the lot was the Tulips & Roses themed variations. They brought Keukenhoff almost to SG. During the 'Rose' theme, the centralngarden had some amazing varieties of roses.
The fee is different for a resident and non-resident. Proce difference is almost 30%.
Tripods are allowed. Rest rooms are available inside. Multiple exits and entries possible by means of a chopped seal on the hand during each exit. Not much crowded but avoid Sundays.
Excellent place to take flower photographs. Orchids, roses, tulips and so many flower variations throughout the year makes it the best place to visit in SG according to me.One can never get bored.
Restaurants around are of high class especially Pollen. One can easily spend half a day and then enjoy dining at one of the restaurants.
You will definitely appreciate the efforts in bringing this botanical marvel to SG. The price is too high & thats the only reason I have to give it a 4 star rating."
,,Magical,5.0,,"There is a charge for the flower dome . The dome is spacious, light and airy, and the flowers and garden exhibitions with the sculptures were a delight. There was a Christmas theme and it was "" magical"" with examples of how different countries celebrate Christmas with stories of some of the traditions. Before you exit the dome, there is a digital interactive display which explains some of the environmental issues and impacts and both adults and children enjoyed the display. Well,with a visit ."
,,More Than Just Flowers,4.0,,"I was a bit hesitant to go into the Flower Dome as I expected it to be only flowers which only holds a small amount of interest for me.It is actually a lot more interesting than the name suggests. There are plants and trees from all over the world and I found it very interesting.

If you are not sure about going in the dome like me, I would recommend it if you like, plants trees and flowers as I'm sure you will enjoy it."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Been there twice with different themes - Persian theme and now Christmas theme. Wonder how they do and maintain the place. Awesome. It's a must for your visitors who love flowers!
,,ok,3.0,,yet again a man made structure and highly commercial. you need to pay for everything in Singapore. more variety of flowers can be found in any natural forest.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Like its sister dome the Cloud Forest, the Flower Dome is always worth a visit. The flower arrangements change every couple of months and I have been lucky to catch 1-2 different exhibitions this year. Currently showing a Christmas theme."
,,Art of flowering,4.0,,I believe this is one of unique features within a city in the world...so much effort is put into the imaginative construction. Is pleasing to eyes and a place to contemplate.
,,Need to see in lifetime,4.0,,We need to view this point in afternoon times with the entire light effects.. ... The view from Sky point is also so cute..
,,Disappointing,3.0,,After viewing cloud forest with all of its orchids the flower dome was disappointing. Not many flowers at all- many succulents and trees. There was a large Christmas display in the centre which was very well done. But together with the cloud forest was good value.
,,Huge indoor garden,4.0,,There is a fee for going in but one can explore inside for at least an hour especially if you love flowers and photography. It is air conditioned and nothing feels as great as appreciating the flora masses in comfort. Thumbs up.
,,AMAZING,5.0,,We went and explored the two 'domes'. They both exhibit a wide array of different plants from all over the world. Here is a chance to explore by foot around the many tall artificial plants which collect the light and then open and provide light in the night. It is also a great photo opportunity if you are into natural photography. It also has a good view of the sea.
,,Enchanting,5.0,,"didn't really spent much time in there due to baby was hungry, but it was beautiful and there are lots of rare flowers, you can spend a good 1 hour inside the dome. must visit."
,,Very Christmassy in December,4.0,,"The European snow scene in the middle of the flower dome seems a little unusual in the middle of Singapore gardens by the sea but there are these scenes all over Singapore at the moment.
The carols get a bit much after a while. All the same this conservatory in the gardens by the bay is well worth the visit."
,,Expensive,3.0,,"I would skip it, save my money and go only to the National Orchid Garden next time. But go for the night show, it's cute. Also walk in the gardens outside, it's free and nice. Try to go in the morning because it gets hot in Singapore in the afternoon."
,,"not worth the money,rather goes somewhere eles.",2.0,,"not much to experienced.foreign trees,flowers.you can just got it through within 1 hour.very few orchideen and flowers.not much to say about it because it is nearly nothing."
,,Air conditioned - very pleasant,5.0,,We visited the Flower Dome as part of the package available on the One day Singapore Pass. There was a beautiful Christmas display and lots to photograph. We spent about an hour in the dome and certainly appreciated the cool environment.
,,Lacklustre,3.0,,"This is the younger sister of the cloud dome (which was awesome,) however like most younger siblings they don't live up to their older counterparts.

The flower dome was average, but was nice and cool inside. The best bit about it was the xmas decorations in the centre and the fake snow around the flower beds in the dome.

Worth a look if you're into horticulture, otherwise i would give it a miss."
,,Lights everywhere on Christmas Season,5.0,,"I went there on Christmas seasons which is on December. And they are open until 10pm which is really great! They change the theme in every season (Christmas, Chinese new year, Indian, etc) and it really great!"
,,Part of the great gardens,5.0,,"As with the gardens in general definitely worth a roam, not ridiculously expensive and quite nice and peaceful. Nice that its cool inside!"
,,Must see for nature lovers.,5.0,,"I remember visiting Singapore when there was nothing where the Garden by the Bay complex, the Flower Dome and the neighbouring Cloud Forest, the Super trees etc are located now. And what a marvellous place to stroll it is. You can spend hours in a very relaxing way, enjoying looking at colourful flowers & exotic plants. And it’s as is with everything else in Singapore: clean and well organized. It’s attractions like this that make Singapore one of my favourite stopover cities in the world when I’m travelling."
,,Awesome!,4.0,,"Take your time to visit this attraction. Lots to see and take in. Allow time for photos, because the angles can be amazing. Really worth the money!"
,,Great!,4.0,,So many beautiful flowers here.. I came in November but I could see the christmas decorations.. hehehe..
,,Much more than the name implies!,5.0,,"Naturally I thought this was just about flowers. How wrong. In fact there's a whole lot to see here, including the best (in fact the only) collection of baobab trees I've come across. All sorts of plants which live in dry zones around the world are displayed, grouped by type or country of origin; this includes cacti, other succulents, a dragon tree and much more. Fantastic range, with just the right amount of information to read.
I prefer the layout to the Cloud Forest. You select the areas and order in which you want to see things, which I much prefer to having to go round on a set route.
After the steamy heat outside, we did find it quite cold in here.
Currently there is a flower display about Christmas, which is well lit at night. Normally there wouldn't be much to see once it's dark outside, so only buy a ticket if you've got time to enjoy the dome in daylight.
There are toilets inside, we didn't use them so can't comment. The disabled should have no problems enjoying this attraction. There were ample places to sit, if you include the benches which edge the display areas.
You can buy an admission ticket to just one dome, although the website does not mention it. As you leave, make sure you get a hand stamp so you can return at any time on the same day."
,,gorgeous flowers,4.0,,"lovely place that offers a glimpse what the flora of a temperate climate is like. many interesting and informative boards around, and nicely themed. Would love to have a guided tour of sorts, without that exorbitant price tag."
,,Beautiful but nothing much,4.0,,"Maybe I am not a flower or plants lover (I do not have sufficient knowledge on flowers and plants) and may not have much interest in that so I do not really think it is a fantastic place to go. Well, to visit for first timer is okay but if I have to go back there again I would say no.. I won't spend another SGD 28 just to enter this place again ^^ once is enough.

The Christmas decorations are good and the room was very cooling especially when the sky gets darker. Bring your jacket along if you plan to visit in the evening.

They have 1 cafe inside the flower dome but nobody was seating or dining in there."
,,"If you are not from a temperate climate, it is spectacular...",4.0,,"...however, if you come from a temperate zone, the flowers are all a bit familiar. However, they do change the displays regularly, and although you may be familiar with many of the species the way they are layed out is very well done. Worth a visit."
,,Excellent Garden,5.0,,"The Flower Dome in "" The Gardens by the Bay"" features 9 gardens such as Australian Garden, South American Garden, Califonia Garden, Mediterranean Garden, Baobabs and Bottle Trees, Succulent Garden, South African Garden, Olive Grove and the Flower Displays from 5 continents Africa, America, Asia, Europe and Oceania. When we visited in November, the theme was Christmas. This is a must see Garden."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"If you have seen botanical gardens before than this will not attract you much. If you haven't then this is a good place to go with your family. There are lots of varieties of plans and cactus, well kept and maintained. It will probably take you 1 hr to go around, the Cloud Dome is right next to it. As all the attractions in Singapore do, the exit of the Flower Dome ends in a merchandise shop, which is highly priced :-)"
,,Boring,4.0,,"Wonderful building, well laid out gardens but doesn't really scream ""Look at me"". Apart form the cut away people sculptures it is bit too orderly."
,,Feels like a overgrown nursery,3.0,,"Its nice, the plants are in great shape and well laid out but there was no wow factor in it for me, its usually packaged with the cloud dome so consider it a freebie extra for the other"
,,Loved it,5.0,,The variety of plants were amazing. Christmas display was brilliant. Clean and tidy. Easy access. Worth the visit.
,,Brilliant Christmas Deco!,4.0,,The ongoing Christmas decorations are brilliant. The exhibit containing the plants of the Mediterranean belt was also very educational. The temperature in the dome was nice and cool as well but if you are sensitive to cold then a simple sweater would be good.
,,Disappointing..,3.0,,"Given the name 'flower dome' and the fact that the centre boasts that they are able to maintain plants in certain seasons so that flowers are always blooming, I would have expected to walk inside and see a heck of a lot flowers. Instead I walked inside and saw more photos of flowers than actual flowers. Most plants were trees and dessert plants.... Hardly any flowers at all. The cloud dome is a lot nicer"
,,Breathtaking space,5.0,,"This, and the Cloud Forest Dome, are breathtaking internal spaces, completely air conditioned with sustainable technologies. The exhibits here are temperate and dessert plants that would be intolerant of tropical weather. We spent an entire afternoon strolling both here and the Cloud Forest Dome, which are both highly recommended."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I visited the Flower Dome after the Cloud Dome and I would have to say that I thought that they were on a par with each other.

As Christmas was coming, the Flower Dome had beautiful displays depicting Christmas scenes and the colours were gorgeous. A lot of work has obviously gone into this special attraction.

I found it very easy to walk around and it was not at all crowded on the Monday when I went."
,,Artificial try to create an attraction,2.0,,May be in several years it will be a nice place to visit but I have not seen any improvment from 2013 to 2014. It is very artifical and no nature experience. Not worth of the entrance fee.
,,Absolutely stunning!,5.0,,"Like with everything else that Singapore does (and builds), this is a fantastic, amazing place! It's so wonderfully made out and very interesting. With the Garden By The Bay and the Cloud Dome it is a most pleasant (half)day out."
,,Love it!,5.0,,Love it here! I could spend all day in here. There's a restaurant inside that you really can enjoy yourself all day in here.
,,"beautiful place, but its not natural",4.0,,"beautiful place with variety of flowers, trees. but you can't feel it as a natural place. they maintained this place very well."
,,Tulipmania!,4.0,,"I went here to see the Tulipmania. It was awesome. Pretty colors everywhere. There were many people coming there to take pictures. However, there were some sections that were closed. Hopefully, there will be another Tulipmania exhibition next year. :)"
,,great place for kids and for couples,3.0,,"looking for a good place to bring your kiddos?

try the Flower Dome... it is nice to bring your family closer to nature...

been here last October, brought my kids for the first time and they are amazed with all the display..

Great job! i will be back with few visitors soon..

Thanks"
,,Nice walk but nothing special!,4.0,,"I did enjoy walking in the flower dome as it is a beautiful and peaceful place, but there was nothing very special there. There are flowers and plants from all over the world, but nothing caught my eye especially. I went in November and they had already set the Christmas decorations, giving a nice ambiance to the garden. It is still a good place to see, but do not expect to be amazed. I preferred the other dome that was much more creative!"
,,Comes up short in flower diversity / interestingness,3.0,,"Overall I found this dome really comes up short.

It lacks the bio/flower interestingness that the Singapore Botanical Gardens have.
Basically it just seemed lacking.

Before you know it, your at the exit - it literally feels that short.

There is a little cafe off to the side you can sit at, but it doesn't maximize the unique location or any views onto it.

You still might want to check it out if you are in the marina gardens area or you are visiting the cloud dome."
,,Flowers Everywhere,5.0,,"What appears as the smaller of the two conservatories at Gardens By The Bay, was intact my favourite of the two. And that is saying something given my dislike of gardening. Despite my dislike, I can still appreciate the work that has gone into the fabulous display gardens that make up the Flower Dome. Distinct gardens are evident, but flow into each other to make for a contiguous display of vibrant colour, feel and texture. Seeing really is believing as you wander through the temperature controlled dome. There was a S$28.00 per adult fee (which included the adjacent Cloud Garden), but I felt that this was well worth while. we were in there for about an hour. Public toilets and drinking water are both available, and it is wheel chair friendly. The ubiquitous gift shop also welcomes your exit."
,,Flora with a Christmas theme,5.0,,Wonderful plants and beautiful flowers! Shrubs were woven into Raindeers and such for the festive season. We were told that the flora arrangements change from time to time - not just for Xmas. Constant temperature is quite a relief from outside and the Flower Dome is certainly worth a visit if you are in Singapore. Take water with you!
,,Getting set for Christmas,3.0,,There was not much to see as the place was getting ready for the peak season in December. The concept is good though. Plan visits during peak seasons. Off seasons are pretty bland.
,,Not worth but forced to visit,2.0,,"As a vistor to Singapore you gave to pay a premium price (S$28 per person vs S$20 for local citizen and they can opt for one dome at S$12) for the 2 domes (flower dome and cloud forest). However except the pillar less structure of dome is interesting, it is just like walking in a garden with no planning. The flowers are not interesting or attracting at all."
,,The Giant Flower Tower,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay in front of the Marina Bay Gardens Hotel complex this entirety with its amazing conervation technology deserves time. One of the two gigantic domed strutires on site, the Flower Dome is an amazing structure, a metal mountain entirely covered with flowering plants. At the top, there are beautiful pool gardens and on one side, an exciting artificial waterfall gushes down. A delight and highly recommended. Try not to miss this and its companion as well as the entire botanical garden surrounding it dominated by the futuristic ""trees""."
,,Beauty under the Dome,4.0,,"While in Singapore for two weeks on business, I had the chance to make it to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. This was one of the highlights of my trip.

The Flower Dome was very pretty! You'll want to have your camera to capture some of the beauty.

However, if I had to choose between the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, the Cloud Forest would win...hands down. Everyone in my party would agree too!"
,,fragrant wonderland,5.0,,"the moment we entered, we were hit with the varid botanical smells of various flowers and plants. its all under an air conditioned dome and very well made. the flowers and plants are segregated as per regions like South Africa, California, Alps, etc. Must go when in Singapore!"
,,A place worth re-visiting,5.0,,Periodic changes in the display ensure that the theme is always exciting and worth the trip. Well maintained facilities and displays. The cooling environment doesn't hurt especially after visiting the outdoor gardens.
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"They do special exhibition in the Flower Dome, I went with the Orchid dispaly and it was very nice ! Overall the garden is interesting, quiet big! Don;t forget your jumper. Nice 2 hours to spent walking around."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This sure is a great place to go, either walking around or sitting among the flowers and plants of the world... it is beautifully done, a lovely relaxing time out of the heat of the day."
,,Wonderful worth every penny,5.0,,"it's crisp and cool inside, beautiful themes and sets. If you could avoid the weekend, the weekdays are very nice and empty. You can also do this in the day as inside is nice and cool"
,,Great for flower fans,4.0,,"This place is awesome for flower fans. For the average not-so-into flower people it is still very much worth a visit. There is an impressive variety of flowers, plants and trees, places in a uniquely shaped building. I would pick the cloud forest over this dome, but ideally I'd say: visit both. Do note that it can get very busy on weekends and public holidays."
,,Just Brilliant,5.0,,The flower dome is a must to see. It is like an oasis in Singapore. It is an amazing place to visit. The gift shops are not that good. You could not bother to go there. Spend your time at the dome instead. Plenty of places to eat. Good food not too expensive.
,,Amazing!,4.0,,We had clubbed this with the cloud forest dome. Both these areas are located in the same premises. I would suggest attending this first followed by Cloud Forest. An audioguide is available for a nominal fee and it takes you through the place. The decorations in the podium level are beutiful. Must visit!
,,Good boabs and other interesting offerings,5.0,,"Good fun. Right next to the cloud forest. If I had to choose one, I'd go for the cloud forest but you can get both in a combo ticket so I'd recommend that option. Some really interesting African trees and a specialty display of Indian flowers. Very nice indeed."
,,wonderful and cool,4.0,,"out of the two gardens by the bay domes this is my least favourite but no less spectacular. wonderful to walk around and great to see and enjoy the coolness inside as well as see all the amazing species of flowers and plants.

don't go on a sunday or public holiday, go off peak and take your time."
,,Impressive!,5.0,,The Flower Dome is the biggest construction of its kind worldwide. It is home of a vast variety of plants and flowers. Especially the orchids-section is very nice.
,,If you are on short visit to Singapore - miss this out,2.0,,"Actually somewhere between poor and average but not good enough for three stars. We bought a ticket for the skyway and both domes. Arial walkway gives a good view of the whole area and worth the money. The cloud dome is the better of the two. This one is definitely missable, especially if this gives you time to visit the much better botanic gardens and absolutely first class National Orchid Garden."
,,A new experience,4.0,,A very interesting place and well thought out. Plenty of different fauna to look at. And they still had the Divali exhibition on which was fun.
,,It's a paradise,4.0,,"Wow.... the nature lover won't able to come out from this amazing place. Various types of flowers and trees. Also, the interior was designed very nicely. You feel like entered into the heaven."
,,Flowers from 4 continents,4.0,,"Flowers from Asia, S. America, S. Africa and Australia are nicely placed and maintained in this AC dome. It has information on flowers as well."
,,Impressive Display,5.0,,"If you enjoy gardens then you will love this place...a dome like structure that is divided into geographic locations and showcasing the plants & flowers unique to each region eg Australia, South Africa, South America, California etc...There is a section showcasing the different baobab trees, and another showcasing various cacti...All well documented. A colourful feast greets you on entry and then you wind your way through the exhibits...as I visited in November the final display being prepared was a tribute to the Christmas season, with snowmen made from flowers pitted against an amazing display of red poinsettias...so I imagine this area showcases various festivities in floral displays on an ongoing basis. Take your camera you will not be disappointed"
,,Beautiful Variety of Flowers,4.0,,A lovely variety of flowers and plants from all over the globe. Worth a visit but.... the cloud dome is better.
,,Outstanding Attraction,4.0,,"If you like plants and flowers, you will love this place. Bring your camera along as there's lots of curious and lovely subjects waiting to be captured. The colour of some of the flowers are vivid and stunning."
,,Very pretty,5.0,,By a dual ticket for this attraction & the cloud forest. I found it very beautiful & I also visited at Deepvali which was a plus+++ ba must see at Gardens by the bay.
,,A Treasure Trove of Flowers and Plants!,5.0,,"Flowers and plants from all corners of the world, and the theme changes seasonally. Part of the Gardens by the Bay attraction. Must pay an entry fee to get in, but it's well worth the money. Expect to spend at least 1.5 hours in the aircon dome."
,,Wow,5.0,,"This was a beautiful time to see the flower dome and the floral displays arranged for Deepvali, the lights festival were breathtaking."
,,So many flowers,5.0,,This place has amazing flowers. Its fully ac and many different flowers are there from all over the world. Some unique design is also been made from the flowers like bird. One should not miss this place as you will find water fall also where you can take many pics.
,,A Beautiful Building with Flowers!,5.0,,"To start with, the building is amazing - the design with all of the glass, and the size of the building allows a great variety of plants, trees and flowers. You can easily spend a couple of hours wandering around the various sections and types of plants. The center section changes with a very interesting show of flowers with a theme. Been back to see what the center theme was - worth it both times."
,,Better than I expected for a garden,4.0,,"There's some eccentric stuff in here, and flora from a great variety of places. Worth visiting, but I recommend that you get the combined ticket with the Cloud Forest."
,,Plants of the world under the dome,5.0,,"Again this is in the Gardens by the Bay and in controlled environments in a massive dome. You wander through the plants from various countries and regions of the world and wonder at the variety of plants
We came to the Australian Plot and were amazed to see that many of the plants were growing better here than they do back home. I guess in this controlled environment they do not have to weathers the ravages of drought and fire as they do in the wild in Australia
Again I have to admit that the Singapore does the tourists more justice than in most countries I have visited. When they create an attraction it is world class and not just an attempt to extract money from the tourist"
,,A way to beat the heat,5.0,,"We visited on a warm, cloudy day and were almost cold inside the dome. The floral displays are spectacular. They contain everything from a tiny rock shaped succulent to a giant baobab tree. Some of the olive trees are the oldest, most stately trees I've ever seen. (Second only to California redwoods) The walkways and displays are well maintained and updated for the seasons. The Christmas exhibit was being installed during our visit. Absolutely worth the admission price."
,,Cloud Domes Poorer Sister!,3.0,,We thought the best flowers were to be seen in the Cloud Dome - after that the flower dome itself was a little disappointing. Still worth a quick look as the ticket is sold for both attractions. The different world gardens had more trees and bushes than flowers.
,,Great for flower lovers,5.0,,This place is great to visit all the different array of flowers inside a glass style dome with waterfalls and rock formations.
,,Don't expect much flowers in it.,4.0,,"Though it is a ‘flower dome’ don’t expect much flowers in it. Even there are not many flowering plants in it. There are many types of trees and cactus. It is well maintained and covered. But I personally found it life less. I found It is too artificial. If you like the gardens,Singapore botanical garden in worth visiting.
But if you are around Marina Bay Area and want to spend time till Rapsode show or Wonderful light show you can take a leisurely walk, you can beat the heat to some extent. Though there is not much to see still you can spend time for your purpose.
Ground floor set up is theme based, it is seasonal. When we were there, there was exhibit of Indian theme. Sight of Huge Blue and White feathered peacocks among the colorful flowering plants was amazing. They had featured beautiful tigers made from 2-3 shades of marigold flowers. Salute to artists/gardeners.
Even though there is not much to see but when you look at the fact that all the plants growing in various continents need different weather conditions and then you will definitely be amazed as they have grown plants in Singapore from almost all the continents of the world."
,,Show stopper,5.0,,Just take the biggest data card you can get for your camera. Wonderful. Seek out the grove of olive trees and wonder about the logistics!!!
,,Walk In The Green,4.0,,I saw so many cactus and succulents for the first time in a very long time at one place. Orchids and plants from so many places that I couldn't count. A must visit for nature and flora lovers.
,,Garden delight,4.0,,"The gardens by the bay are very well done , I went late afternoon thinking it would be too hot but it was very pleasant . I think it's an amazing amount of work , I thought it quite dear $ 28 , and that was senior rate ."
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,"Integral part of Gardens by the bay. Amazing flower-gardens, aesthetically decorated across the dome-structure"
,,Plants from around the world,4.0,,"The variety and sheer number of flowers and plants is staggering; the greenhouse is massive and takes a while to explore, and there are so many flowers it's easy to miss a few. The sculptures are a nice addition. I would have given this a 5, but compared to the Cloud Forest it's not quite as unique and epic. If botany is your thing through, this is the one to choose.

Be aware there are tickets available for just the flower dome for $16, although this isn't advertised."
,,Flowers Galore!!!,5.0,,If you love flowers.. you will love this.. Visit this first and then Cloud Forest.. We went here first and were just awestruck by the variety of flowers...
,,Gardens delight,5.0,,My favourite was the orchids but around the world display a was excellent too Fully accessible and nice restaurant area.
,,This is spectacular!,5.0,,"The cacti and flowers were amazing to see, it is really quite a feat to grow all these plants etc under one big dome with a similar climate. A must do early in the morning as it can get very hot inside by early to late afternoon. Treat yourself, it is very relaxing!"
,,Scenic but not worth the price,3.0,,The way Flower dome is prepared with different flowers is commendable. However the entry fees to teh same is bit expensive. You can see different kind of flowers within different shapes and good place for the pictures. But overall with in 15 minutes you will get bore.
,,Very Spectacular,4.0,,"Unfortunately the day that we visited the Flower Dome it poured with rain and we got very wet getting from the MRT Station to the little Shuttle Bus Service but nevertheless we got into the Flower Dome quite quickly.

The display that we say was primarily the Indian Flower Show no doubt because it Deepavali and it was really gorgeous with many fine examples of Indian flora in all shapes, sizes and colours.

Being under a Dome it made for quite an enjoyable visit and I would recommend that you go early in the day as the flowers are the freshest at that time and if you are an avid gardener you can spend many hours just admiring the colours and fragrances of the flowers on display.

The cost for entry is very reasonable and there are plenty of places to get food and drinks to make sure that you don't get hungry and thirsty. The only downside to our visit was that the Canopy Walk was closed for safety reasons otherwise it was a good trip.

At night there is a light show outside of the Dome which is free and I would also recommend this as it is quite spectacular."
,,"again, wow",5.0,,"I used the audio tour ($4 for the day) & found the garden far more interesting than those zooming past. Lots of info about the plant choices, historical plants (1000yo olive tree & 200yo baobab tree) as well as the engineering to keep the place in permanent spring... maybe do this before the cloud dome (you'll see why when you get there)"
,,Excellent attraction,5.0,,This was a part of the Gardens by the Bay attraction and was excellent well laid out with some pretty spectacular flowers on display. It was nice to see an Aussie garden also.
,,"Nice, but does not compare to the cloud forest",3.0,,"If I go back, I would only get tickets for the cloud forest. Its much better. I did not saw anything really special, and found out a bit disorganized the order and presentation of the flowers."
,,A must to enjoy the colours,5.0,,I have commented on this on the Singapore waterfront gardens Do get a joint ticket with the cloud dome. The colours are amazing and really interesting how different plants are grouped together . You will probably see something different each time depending on the main centerpiece. Do take a leisurely walk to see everything
,,Very colourful displays,4.0,,"Although not as amazing as the Cloud Forest, it's worth spending some time in this dome. There is a good display of succulents with excellent explanatory signage. The lower level has seasonal displays of flowers and when we were there it featured huge blue and white peacocks (artificial ones) among the massed flowering plants. Extremely colourful!"
,,Nice to visit!,4.0,,"Located in Garden by Bay, it is good place for flower lovers, specially it is hot and humid outside. You can enjoy a variery of flowers that keeps on changinf roung the year."
,,Depending on the display,3.0,,"Lovely place to spend your hot afternoon given that the flowers/plants there have to be maintained at a certain temperature. Been there for 4-5 times in the past 10 months as I will usually bring visitors to SG, to visit this place. A nice place if you have a penchant for flowers but it will bore you down if this is not your forte. At times, the flower display could be quite impressive (Christmas of 2013 and Tulipsmania but not for the War of Roses which was nothing special IMHO).

You will from time to time come across beautiful wedding being held inside of the glass restaurant. If you fancy for a drink, you may do so at the small cafe located inside of the dome. Overall recommended time to spend here would range from 1-1.5 hours. I would prefer this over the cloud dome which has nothing much but the huge artificial waterfall."
,,Nature and more,5.0,,You like flowers? You like nature? You like to walk? You can admire the beauty and have a nice camera to capture the same? Please visit.
,,Too artifitial,3.0,,"It looks fake not a real garden. Nice colors , well keeped. Beautiful flowers.in com parison with the cloud forest it is poor and low cost benefit"
,,Must VIsit,5.0,,THe flower dome is part of Gardens by the Bay and is worth visiting for the sheer color and variety of flowers and plants which are really well cared for . There was a lovely display of peacocks and flowers growing in shapes of peacock feathers There are some quirky sculptures which will bring a smile to your face for sure
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"It is called a flower dome but the dome does not have many flowers, mostly plants, trees and very old olive trees. The ""wow"" factor is that the Singaporeans created the domed structure as a tourist attraction."
,,Could not get the double,4.0,,Air conditioned flowers and flowering trees of the world in a sculptural glass enclosure. This was $14 per person and took about an hour to complete. Enjoyed our time but was disappointed that we went on a Monday and the adjacent Cloud Forest was closed for maintenance. Maybe on our next visit.
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,This was just a stunning place. I have never seen so many orchids in my life - they were just amazing and some were so small. An incredible place and well worth the price.
,,Wouldn't Go Again,3.0,,"We bought a pass for both the Cloud Dome and the Flower Dome. The Cloud Dome was definitely worth it however we didn't really feel like the Flower Dome was. We were slightly pushed for time so this may have contributed however when we walked in we were expecting beautiful tropical flowers, and instead got cacti and succulents. Just not quite what we were expecting. There were some pretty parts, however on the whole we were left a bit disappointed."
,,nice,4.0,,"I liked it to be outside of the city and within a more relaxed place. Just to walk around and sit for a while. I liked the other dome better, but they are both nice."
,,Flowers.... who knew?,4.0,,"inside the gardens by the bay is a dome of flowers - the exhibition changes every several months and it is abseloutly amazing what they do with flowers!!!! Beautiful, beautiful!!!!!"
,,An absolute MUST when visiting Singapore!,5.0,,"This is the most beautiful place! There is beauty everywhere as flowers from all around the world are all clumped together, mostly by colour, I don't know how they do it but all plants are flowering to perfection! There are walkways through the flower beds, beautiful arbors with vines growing over, seats to sit and take it all in, a place I will always remember!"
,,We liked the Cloud Forest Dome so much more..,3.0,,"The flowers are nice, but not impressive. Do I have some of the species in my garden? We had a quick walk around and left within 10 minutes. We think the Cloud Forest is a lot more interesting with its structural design and feels."
,,Cool and relaxing,5.0,,Escaped the heat and humidity of Singapore in the Flower Dome where they had a special orchid exhibit. The designs and colours of the flowers were amazing and the peace and tranquility were wonderful even with all the people wandering around.
,,Impressive but dull,3.0,,"The Flower Dome (and Cloud Forest Dome) are very impressive structures. I admire the engineering involved but the plantings are clinical and the atmosphere of the domes is pretty dull. Try and imagine visiting a flower show set in a shopping mall. That’s pretty much what the experience is like.

The plantings don’t feel integrated or unified at all. They’ve tried to squeeze too many environments into the structures. They don’t have a cohesive feel.

In the Flower Dome, there are mature trees which have been brought in from around the world. A worthy effort but a number of them are showing signs of distress with sparse canopies and dead branches. Not a great look.

I’m sure most visitors will not agree with me on my thoughts. On my visit, there were hundreds of people taking photos and seemingly enjoying the greenhouses.

It costs 28 Singapore dollars to see both of the domes. I thought the fee expensive for what’s on offer.

Better value (for both money and aesthetics), can be found at the Botanic Gardens. They’re larger, free and offer a much more satisfying integration of plantings. The National Orchid Garden, set within the gardens, is only 5 Singapore dollars. The experience is a lot better than what you’ll get at the Flower Dome or Cloud Forest."
,,Great!,5.0,,"Great visit and such a variety of flora, beautiful at night but recommend going at dusk! Otherwise beautiful and great!"
,,Wow,5.0,,"This amazing dome is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex. The other dome is the Cloud Forest dome - also worth a visit so get a joint ticket as it's good value.

The Flower Dome is enormous and full of amazing plants. Baobabs through to Australian plants to cacti and succulents to olive trees (one 1000 years old!) to lots of flowering plants through to the main reason for going - the orchids. When we were there there was a special orchid display. Truly magnificent. Full of colour and with tiny delicate orchids through to large, showy blossoms. There are always orchids on display but we just hit it at a very good time.

The dome is very pleasant temperature wise and much more pleasant than outside.

Well worth a visit."
,,Nice place,5.0,,This place is very scenic and very well designed. The architectural work is highly innovative and we'll planned. Recommended for tourists to visit
,,a must see,5.0,,it is such a beautiful amazing garden with so many flowers and plants and trees which has brought there from so many countries. it's like a little paradise . it is a must see place. i really enjoyed it.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Go late so you can walk across the platform while the show is on at 7:45 pm I think and 8:45 so head up about 7:15 then go to the lawn area and lie down. You then get the best of both worlds. we then caught a water taxi back to the quay. very nice and relaxing
,,Must for gardeners and photographers,5.0,,Huge area with many known species to Aussie gardeners and many more unknown. Very well laid out with plenty to see. Don't miss the interesting sculptures spread around the exhibit. Nice cool environment to saunter. Restraint both inside and out.
,,Make sure your camera is ready,4.0,,I enjoyed this dome compared to Cloud dome. So many beautiful flowers and plants that are very well maintained. Kids will surely enjoy but of course be careful not to touch the flowers and plants.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,I may seem to be a little tough but having visited the Orchid Gardens which are amazing I was disappointed. As an Aussie I did not believe the Australian area reflects our country.
,,Overrated,5.0,,Found this a bit of a let down compared with its alternative the Cloud Forest. Bit tacky and not particularly well kept Which for any Singapore attraction is a major failing
,,Lovely place!,5.0,,The plants are so attractively arranged. I love the way they did the landscaping and the way they have actually decorated the whole place. I will definitely comeback
,,So much fauna to see,5.0,,"The flower dome was amazing with so many different species of flowers, plants and trees. We think Singapore has done a good job of conservation and putting it beautifully together."
,,Really Amazing,4.0,,It was wonderfully beautiful. You can find many kind of flowers. The places are very big and fresh. There are three places in flower dome and make sure you will visit all of them
,,Pretty Gardens,5.0,,"Its a beautiful display, well planned. I really enjoyed walking through and loved the Cloud dome too."
,,Poor,1.0,,"I went to the flower dome and cloud forest with high expectations. Sadly, I was let down completely. There are more concreted walking paths than actual garden space. While this creates a clean and neat space, the entire space looks sterile and artificial. There is nothing natural about this except for the plants themselves but even so, the look out of place. The flower dome is slightly better than the cloud forest for sure. The cloud forest is almost a joke - my first impression was, Really? rather than Wow! Now, I could be overly critical - perhaps, it is still too early to visit these two domes as plants do take time to grow. if that is the case, perhaps, save yourself the $28 admission fees and come back in 5 - 8 years time."
,,Very Nice,4.0,,In the Gardens by the Bay Area and besides the cloud dome. Nice to visit and to watch the super trees.
,,Beautiful flora,5.0,,Spectacular arrangement of flowers from various parts of the world. We got a decent deal online from a local travel agent to visit both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.
,,Cool and Colourful,5.0,,Surprisingly for a 'greenhouse' a welcome escape from the heat and humidity of Singapore. Lovely gardens and floral displays and a 'secret' bistro hidden in the corner - great place to relax and to enjoy the flowers and wine!
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"This place is definitely worth a visit. After a hot day walking around Singapore, it was the perfect place to cool off and enjoy the beautiful plant and flower displays. My 4 year old absolutely loved it. He said that we were in the Wild West when he saw the huge cactuses. They were all shapes and sizes! They even had strange looking trees which he called the tree with a big bottom. We saw a hibiscus the size of my son's head!!! If you have kids, don't forget to check out the huge interactive games at the exit."
,,worth a visit,4.0,,We had intended to go to the Singapore Flyer but after talking to some locals decided to go to the flower dome. It is really well done with some beautiful displays and certainly worth a visit.
,,lovely,5.0,,worth seeing and visiting. quite a bit of visitors but spacious enough so you don't feel crowded. beautifully well done. nice way to cool off indoors. they also have other attractions worth to see
,,Beautiful Flower Display,4.0,,The Flower Dome contains a huge variety of flowers & trees from all over the world which makes it very impressive. It is an amazing experience seeing the plethora of plants from various countries under a single glass dome. The best part (this being Singapore) is that it is completely air-conditioned so don't have to worry about the heat.
,,Excellent,5.0,,A great place to visit at the time of our visit there was a orchid display which was truly lovely. A great place to visit and spend a couple hours.
,,Excellent garden,5.0,,"The greenery and cool of the garden give me a relaxing feeling, especially after a long walk from Singapore flyer. The garden is full of color with many type of flower and some dolls for decoration. Good for taking picture."
,,"Themed Gardens, Beautiful Plants and Trees",5.0,,"I thought the Cloud Dome would be the best, but the Flower Dome snuck up on me and was truly amazing assortment of plants, habitats, trees and all within a clear glass dome where you can even see the Marina an dthe Singapore Flyer out the window.

Various country themed gardens plus up top is the arid or desert style plants. Beautiful orchids, box hedges, cacti, topiary and trees. Lots of weird shapes and structures and you can take a breather and sit under the palms and survey the view.

It is cool inside so no worries about the heat.

TIP: there are quite a few stairs and despite the odd ramp, navigating back and forward with a pram or wheelchair takes some organisation to get to some spots without having to back track."
,,Beautiful orchids,5.0,,"If you like orchards this is the place to go I've been to the botanical gardens in Singapore and this is by far 100% better. Lush thick orchards displays are stunning and so we'll kept, you don't know where to look first. So go and see it for yourself you won't be dissapointed"
,,Weird looking structures but worth visiting!,4.0,,An area where you can see flying-saucer like structures from afar. When you get close you'll realize that the structures are actually -- plants! Vine plants climbing the flying saucer shaped structures. Worth visit with friends -- a hub for more flowers and greens in the heart of the city! :)
,,A fantastic overview of the world in plants,5.0,,Really enjoyed this - went at a quiet time so I'm sure that helped. The cactus gardens were really amazing. This exhibit is incredibly well done and should be on your Singapore itinerary for sure.
,,beautifull flower,4.0,,"i can found many flower from other country in here and because it is in the room, so i didn't feel hot."
,,Brilliant colours,5.0,,"We visited in September 2014 in the early evening when crowds were easing off. What a beautiful display. Well presented, with easy access to all areas."
,,Beautiful flowers from all around the world,4.0,,"The Flower Dome contains a huge variety of flowers, trees and cacti from all over the world. A very impressive collection.

Unfortunately, we had visited the Cloud Dome first, so the Flower Dome felt a little less impressive. However, the ticket covers both conservatories, so it is definitely worth visiting the Flower Dome - but do it first."
,,A must - with cloud dome,5.0,,"Loved this vist. We booked ticket wth cloud dome ticket too & weren't sure about doing both until we were there- loved them both & highly recommend double ticket. Great design, amazing flowers & displays."
,,Amazing flowers from all over the world,5.0,,Excellent design and execution highly recommended to visit if you want to see flowers and stay air conditioned.
,,Best time,5.0,,"I had the best time in this flower dome. It has so many beautiful plants and flowers from different regions around the world. There were some really interesting trees and flowers to admire. It was a nice place to sit back, enjoy the environment and read a book or just spend time on your own.
I absolutely loved the Orchid section, especially the vertical orchid tower that had a beautiful rainbow of orchids up the walls. Definitely recommend!"
,,"you have to see this display ,worth it.",5.0,,Saw the Marina Bay gardens last year but this time wanted my husband to see it. so neat and clean plus its a/c controlled so not humid at all. had some different displays to last year so that was a nice change for me. Did both domes and both are worth the money. took us about an hour to do both.
,,Wow....must see...!!,5.0,,"What a morning we had exploring the Flower Dome. It is so well done and such an interesting place to see, even my 2 teenagers were gobsmacked at how special it was."
,,OK but it's not the cloud dome,3.0,,"If you are there anyway, it's worth a visit. Definitely do it before the cloud dome or you will be disappointed. It's pretty, but does not seem to have a master plan. The olive trees are spectacular. If you must choose, I recommend the cloud dome over the flower dome."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Nice place to visit, but no where near as good as the cloud dome...nice experience but wouldn't go again."
,,Flower Heaven,5.0,,"Loved loved loved the orchids and the flower arrangements, international gardens. Thank you Singapore"
,,Stunning!,4.0,,"I wish we had longer to stroll around the flower dome as there was so much to see - an hour wasn't long enough. We saw so many beautiful and interesting plants, trees and flowers, many of which we grow in Australia. Of particular interest were the boab trees and dessert plant-life. However, stealing the show, the orchids in their many and varied sizes, shapes and colours, were simply stunning! I took so many photos! I recommend getting there in the late afternoon but allowing enough time before sunset to see as much as you can. We'll be back next year!"
,,Very calming and relaxing!,5.0,,The amount of plants and flowers from all over the world is vast. The atmosphere is very calming and relaxing. It's almost like you enter another world; you feel refreshed when you leave. Highly recommend!
,,A perfect place to admire the flower from everywhere (or nearly),5.0,,"But we were lucky to admire an exphibition of orchids: all more magic than the other. an actual array of shapes and colors.the emblematic flower of asia was shown here in all its forms: the more feminine to the more colorful, to more structured to the more spontanéous. A truly dream for who like this natural perfection....."
,,Enjoyed it but ....,4.0,,I thought it was a it like walking round a garden centre. They do try to liven things up a bit by adding themes .... not really my thing.
,,Well done,5.0,,Have never seen so many beautiful flowers and in such a great set up. This is well set out with flowers and plants from several countries in several sections. Worth the look.
,,Succulent and orchid heaven,5.0,,"I loved this place and so did my sons aged 11 and 13 which was kind of amazing too. Everything from weird desert plants to tigers made out of flowers. It was also quite cool which was a welcome and uprising relief from Singapore heat and humidity. We have seen the zoo, night safari, Singapore wheel etc and still think I will remember this most."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Each time we visit the display is different. The floral arrangements are extremely well done. The flower dome is worth a couple of hours of your time
,,"Colourful, pretty place",5.0,,"This is a nice place to escape the Singapore heat and humidity. It's a fascinating place full of interesting plants, flowers. It's an amazing building. Recommend highly"
,,Beautiful experience,4.0,,"One of the two domes in Garden by the bay , Flower dome is a very convinent way of seeing beautiful flowers in airconditioned comfort .The theme of the garden keeps on changing . When I was there in September it was Orchids my wife visited last year and could see Tulips in the flower dome.Some people do complain about the price of ticket for the two domes which is 28 singapore dollars but if you love flowers and plants it is indeed a small price to pay specially without having to face the humid and sultry weather outside.

Sharing few pics of this beautiful experience."
,,Lovely and cool place to be in Singapore sweltering weather,4.0,,I went in April to visit Tulipmania. It was baeutiful with all the various types of tulips and roses too. The place was fragrant and cool. What a lovely way to spend my hot afternoon.
,,Very nice!,4.0,,"Come visit during the morning, they don't have proper lighting at night. First time for me to see an actual boabab..that tree from the petit prince! :) i was thrilled to see a lot of flowers and the architecture of the dome itself is pretty impressive. However, i think the cloud dome is better to see so go there after the flower dome. Do the supergrove at night and make sure you watch the light and sound show..it's so unique!"
,,beautiful display,5.0,,amazing how they bring all these different plants under one roof. take your time and enjoy all the various plants from all continents
,,Good for nature lovers,5.0,,"If you are a nature lover, then this place is really meant for you to visit. I highly appreciate the way the place was arranged and structured."
,,wow,5.0,,what a great place to walk around and be overwhelmed by the exotic flowers and displays very refreshing
,,Plenty of plant and flowers,3.0,,"There were a lot of variety of plant and flower there, 25 °C in the dome not getting so hot, crowd of many people. I prefer to dome of forest!"
,,"Don't miss for flower lovers, others will also enjoy",5.0,,"The flower dome and adjacent cloud forest are superb! Cost is $28 per person for entry and you can get a re entry stamp, which is good to know. It is a visual delight and outstanding display of world wide ecosystems and flower displays, so pretty! Lovely way to escape the humidity of Singapore with its dry climate controlled environment. Water taps and toilets available at the exit and a few places to rest and admire the surrounds throughout. If you really want to learn about the species, best to get the audio guide as the information panels are not extensive.

Don't miss this manmade wonder to see the natural wonders of the flower world!"
,,Must See...,5.0,,The flower dome is part of the Gardens on the Bay and the Cloud Forest Dome is also here. I think buying a ticket to do both is well worth the while. Really beautiful.
,,Great but if u can only afford one go to cloud forest,4.0,,A great experience if you are in any way interested in nature. Nice and cool and really well laid out displays. I preferred the cloud forest as it was so different but there is only a small price difference between visiting one conservatory or two so would be a shame not to include it
,,Beautiful flowers All year Round!,5.0,,"I do admit that this place is absolutely lovely! Very beautiful place! I'm not entirely crazy over flowers but this one is just so nice that I couldn't help but appreciate the maintenance that they do to have such great display of flowers all year round. A must visit in SG if you ask me. It's a place to just slow down and appreciate nature. Elder friendly too ( I know my grandma would've loved this place) It's airconditioned too so it's quite comfortable to enjoy this even in mid day. And oh, most people just take photos... try to smell the flowers too! You'll love it!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,The domes are cool inside so it was very pleasant walking around.Lots and lots of beautiful flowers.I loved the boab trees and cactus as well.....
,,If you love Flowers - you Will Love this,4.0,,"If you love flowers, you will love this, however if you don't you may be a bit bored! For me, I loved the fact that you can sit inside the dome and drink a cocktail, nice view from the Cocktail Bar while watching the sun go down!"
,,"Just nice , bit too cleanish",3.0,,"Not a flower fan or hater, its a clean well structured maze of plants trees and flowers, tempareture inside is very pleasant due the hot temp outside.

We bought a combined ticket for the tree dome next door aswell, and enjoyed that more, bit more natural even though the huge middle structure, the setup was beautifull and the information more complete."
,,Only in Singapore ...,5.0,,I saw this under construction and was so excited to be there to finally see the finished product and was not disappointed. ESSENTIAL on a top 10 list Singapore 'to do' list!
,,A feast of sight and smell,5.0,,"In truth, I visited the Flower Dome to get out of the heat while waiting for the darkness and the illumination of the 'trees' in Supertree Grove. But within minutes I was captivated. Wandering round the gardens representing the different continents was fascinating, and the main central display was beautiful and colourful. As well as the wide variety of colours and shades, many of the plants had wonderful scents. A very pleasant diversion and money well spent."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"It was great to get out of the heat and into this conservatory with its wonderfully laid out displays of so many plants. The central flower display changes but was orchids while we were there. They were stunning! So amazingly Singapore, well worth the visit."
,,wonderful,5.0,,we visited this after the cloud dome and were not disappointed. It was different and the different species of plants and flowers from all over the world were amazing
,,Good place for flower lovers,4.0,,This is part of the gardens by the bay but you need to buy separate ticket to visit. If anyone like plants and flowers then they'll definitely like this place. They have decent collection of plants and flowers.
,,Gem in the city,5.0,,"You need to be here! Once entering you may feel cooling and with so many varieties of flowers and cactus all combined to one magnificently-build conservatory, this is the place to visit while you come to Singapore!"
,,Orchid extravaganza,5.0,,We happened here when the recent orchid extravaganza was in the flower dome - absolutely stunning. But do check online as there are always new displays here. The domes provide shelter from the sun and heat - a relief at midday.
,,Just beauty in a dome,4.0,,"Can't get enough of this place, third visit lined up already next May,the flowers here are more than than plants, they are a red carpet show"
,,Beautiful Nature indoors,5.0,,"The flower dome was a nice experience, indoor climate controlled and a bit cold, beautiful flowers and atmosphere, it uses natural light so best to be visited in good day light and not near sunset, once at the area a one stop to gardens by the bay and the cloud forest dome.."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"My favourite part of this place is definately the orchid display, simply stunning. Just thousands of varieties. Go early to beat the crowd"
,,Orchid Extravaganza!,5.0,,"Lovely flowers organized in a beautiful way... In different colours... :) Loved the inside of the pillar which was beautifully decorated with orchids, which were colour coordinated as well!"
,,Tulips,4.0,,"Unfortunately, we came during the tail end of the tulip exhibition, in fact the last day. However, the exhibition and the dome were awesome. Many interesting plants are display. A great place for photos. However, not as interesting as the Cloud Forest Dome."
,,Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Again a fabulous opportunity to see various exhibits of plants from other continents and local. What I can't stand is people using flash lights on their video and camera equipment. Very bad for people who are light sensitive, migraine sufferer or epileptic."
,,Loved it!,4.0,,Loved this with all the succulents & cacti! They even have an Australian section here of Australian plants.
,,Glimpses of World Gardens,5.0,,"Flower Dome is simply fantastic & is to be seen to be believed . Organised in a huge , multi layered glass dome with controlled temperature & humidity , it is a mini World's Flora Garden. Layout of Gaden is by continents & prominent regions & countries . All famous & exotic plants are well maintained . Clear write up about every plant is very interesting & educative ."
,,What a place,5.0,,Allow at least half a day to enjoy some the Gardens of the Bay if your time is limited. We didn't see everything but was there 4 hours and saw major attractions. Could see so much more in a day. The other areas are free so you can go back at any time. Totally recommend this. The orchid displays are jaw dropping. The cacti areas so varied and the Australian garden makes you feel at home knowing the plants.
,,Must-see but do you buy a season ticket?,4.0,,This is a must-visit in SG .... Cool respite from the humidity.... Interesting architecture and exhibits... It has all been said before. Perhaps my two cents is that the season ticket is worth it only if you entertain a lot of visitors who want to come here or if you want to come to every exhibition (though there are only a couple annually at the moment so do you save that much?) Otherwise come (1) when you dine at Pollen then entrance is free; (2) when entrance is included in the admission for something else e.g. This year's (2014) excellent Flower Festival. My friend had to pay admission to the Festival (which was held in the a Flower Dome AND Meadow) even though she had a season ticket to the Dome.
,,Cool off and enjoy the flowers,5.0,,The horticulturalists have been meticulous in the displays of this attraction. So many vibrant colors and interesting specimens to look at. Even amazing to look at the architecture of the building.
,,Flower Power at Marina Bay,4.0,,Flower enthusiasts will enjoy the beauty and splendor of these indoor garden and flower paradise. A nice alternative for the humid weather during summers.
,,Another must see in Singapore!,5.0,,"Again, I love the orchids that they have planted in this dome. They are spectacular! Jaw-dropping is the word I would use. I am an orchid lover, so I tend to get biased about this garden. But, there are other flowers - although the orchids really dominated the place. Don't miss this place when you visit Singapore."
,,Well designed,5.0,,Flowers by the dome is well designed and brings together a great collaboration of flora and fauna. The combination of desert cacti and the rose garden gives something for everybody to enjoy
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Don't miss this if your in Singapore. Do the 'package' tour at the Gardens by the Bay! You will love this even if your not a 'garden geek'! Enjoy!
,,A beautiful place,4.0,,It's a beautiful place. Even for one who is not necessarily in love with flowers. Do plan a little longer time for it and the Cloud Dome simply because they are truly spacious.
,,Bloom Haven,4.0,,"I am not much of a garden enthusiast but I can appreciate nature and its beauty. I thought the place was interesting with all the different flora and I especially love the orchids exhibition...it was truly beautiful...I didnt know flowers can be so beautiful like that. I probably wont come again only because once was enough for me but for the garden enthusiast, then you will love it!"
,,the world in one,5.0,,This place far exceeded our expectancies.Each diverse area flows into one another beautifulky.Starting with desert and ending with mediterranian the diversity of plants is amazing.Hours pass without realising it.A must
,,Fantastic visit,5.0,,"Allow a couple of hours for a relaxing visit. the dome has a comfortable temperature to walk around in. The flowers gardens are absolutely beautiful, there is also an interactive area near the exit which was good fun. Plenty of seating to sit a take in the surroundings. Food and drinks available for purchase inside but obviously cheaper to take your own."
,,Crowded garden,3.0,,In gardens is all about you and nature. In case of flower dome - you won't be alone. You must be really focused on flowers not to see people around you. For me better choice was Forest Dome.
,,Great place to see,5.0,,"Great place, the exhibits are excellent. Tickets are $26.00 each, however worth every cent. If you live garden and flower exhibits, then this place is for you."
,,1 day before flower fiesta,5.0,,"It is a very nice and enjoyable exhibition, fully flowered dome, with lots to explore about our flora. Must see."
,,"Flowers everywhere, that's about it",4.0,,"Not as interesting as the Cloud Forest Dome, but definitely the place for selfies with flowers and trees. The dome has a lot of seating areas for you to take pictures with the flora. There is a (expensive!) cafe in here, Pollen, for eats."
,,Don't wait until dark.,3.0,,We went after dark because I though it would be better lit. Unfortunately it was pretty dark so I don't think I experienced it in all its glory. It was air conditioned so a good attraction if it's a hot or wet day.
,,Flowery,5.0,,I just loved this place. This was one of the most colorful places I have seen in years. I went with my wife and we were mesmerized viewing the place. And the orchid decoration in a cylinder kind of place was too good.
,,So beautiful,5.0,,"Though I had to walk a lot, it was all good. I was able to get a free bag because I saw an advertisement in a map. Lovely flower dome :)"
,,Temperate gardens in a tropical city,5.0,,Unbelievable experience of seeing temperate climate plants & trees flower in a climate-controlled environment in tropical Singapore. I've never seen anything like this anywhere else. Have a drink at Pollen and enjoy the experience.
,,Love it,5.0,,It is worth the visit. Not very big probably you can d both dome in 1 or 2 hours. Nice place to get great pictures.
,,Nice and cool,4.0,,"Because the weather in Singapore is always hot and humid this dome has been developed to allow plants from cooler climates to grow. Not so much a hot house as a 'cold house'. Makes a welcome break when you enter. Orchid displays exceptional (but this was a competition, not a regular feature)"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This place is so beautiful, where I can see and smell all the flowers and the plants, the herbs all around the world. My fist step into this place, I can smell the nature :)"
,,Good,4.0,,"Very well done, bit crowded, but a great selection of plants trees and flowers from around the globe."
,,Spectacular - Visit Both Domes for Sure!,5.0,,An amazing place. The scope of these two domes (Cloud Forest is the other one) is mind blowing. We only had one day in Singapore and were so glad we saw these. Worth every dollar to see. Don't miss it!
,,colours!,5.0,,"a beautifull organised overview from the plants and trees and flowers , all over the world; the dome is situated next to the cloud dome (one entree ticket)"
,,Air Conditioned way to see tropical flowers and plants,5.0,,"There was too much to see and grasp in a single afternoon. The description of the eco-features of the building on the audio tour was really interesting. The floor is cooled and the glass is designed to let the sun in but not the heat. There were hundreds of interesting things to see. Here are just a few examples: a cork tree, several very old olive trees, and eagle wood carvings."
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,"Last day of the Gardens by the Bay festival, the Orchid's were beautiful also the Cacti garden, just fantastic, Singapore does this so well!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,This is another part of the Gardens on the Bay area and comes ticketed along with the Cloud Forest Dome. Both are amazing from a plant and design point of view. Worth a visit.
,,Nice! But not as impressive as the dome next door,3.0,,"We got in because we bought a ticket bundle of the two domes and the garden festival ticket. As you got in the first thing you'll see is the baobab trees with their fat trunks. Probably because of the garden festival we also saw a few towering orchid displays.

When we entered the dome we were at the second floor and when we looked over the balcony at the ground floor we could see masses of people flocking to a huge orchid display. I planned to see the orchid show winners but because changed my mind because of the long queue.

They put quite a few plants that couldn't be satisfactorily grown in lowland tropical areas like camellias, begonias and orchids.

Even though I like it I still preferred the cloud forest dome because this dome just felt like they just put a garden inside a dome"
,,Beautiful structure and displays,5.0,,Stunning design even better than Cornwall's Eden Project. We visited during a display of Orchids I have never seen so many orchids in one location
,,Artificial,3.0,,"Although it is quite amazing how this plants and flowers were move from places into the dome and able to grow there, the whole place just like a big flower exhibition. Looks quite artificial beautiful and not natural."
,,amazing dome,5.0,,we discover a lot of flowers - different colors and trees.Great place to spend a rainy day and enjoy the flowers. Great view on the bay even it was very cloudy.
,,"Uninspiring, large crowds but nothing much to see.",2.0,,"We visited during some flower festival. Expected the flower dome to be full of flowers... but you had to line up in a separate line inside the dome to view the sole flower exhibit. This line moved very slowly, so we just skipped it. Seemed to be no evidence of good planning/event management."
,,Too crowded!,2.0,,"Compared to the cloud forest, this was just a disaster! It was really crowded starting from the queue waiting for entry!
The flowers were great but just wasn't fit for visit. I would suggest the orchid garden inside Botanic garden which was way cheaper. However, you can't buy the cloud forest ticket solely."
,,Must see at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Beautiful sums it up !! Don't miss Cloud Dome either - take lift to top and make your way down. Another must see is light show in trees in evening and also walk among treetops.
,,The orchids are nice,4.0,,When I visited there were a lot of orchids on display. I liked the dome though there were a lot of people and a function was going on.
,,Must visited place,5.0,,"So nice place to visit, enjoy excellent flowers collection! I can spend whole day in flower dome! U should prepare good quality camera to take a lots of nice photos"
,,The world of Orchid Flowers,5.0,,"Immerse yourself in the world of orchids and be charmed by he plethora of flowers on display. This is the advertisement to attract me going there to see the orchids. Indeed, thousands and thousands of orchids in the air-conditioned dome. Comfortable and picturesque."
,,"Nicely concept, must visit",5.0,,"Very serene place with flowers/plant from around the world, it's such an amazing collection and very well maintained."
,,The most amazing orchids,5.0,,Singapore are famous for their gardens and their orchids and this is the best place to see examples of this. Also wonderful are the other gardens from all over the world.
,,Flowers to the max by the Bay,5.0,,You don't have to be a gardener to enjoy the Flower Dome experience. There is so much to see and it is a bit of a maze so we walked around a couple of times to ensure we viewed all of the exhibits. There was a photographic competition on at the time of our visit with queues of photographers waiting to get into some areas.The ancient olive trees were a stand out and the orchids were magnificent. It was reasonably cool inside despite Singapore's hot and steamy days. Give yourself at least an hour to get to see the whole exhibit and you won't be disappointed.
,,Pretty awesome,4.0,,"As with the Cloud Forest Dome, the Flower Dome is well worth a look. It's a complete departure from downtown Singapore and is stunning both architecturally and biologically. I really enjoyed it.

It doesn't take terribly long to get through, less than an hour, an is nice to be inside the cool space checking out some beautiful flowers. Try to go in the morning, I reckon, as it was crazy full with schoolkids when I was there in the afternoon."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This place is a must do ! even if you are not particularly into your plants you will be amazed at the variety and colours. It's nice an cool inside and really a architectural wonder, take your time and take lots of pictures :-) Did not see anywhere to purchase a snack from once inside but thats ok as you are looking a the sheer scale of this place most of the time :-) Enjoy."
,,The orchid flower show at Marina by the Bay,5.0,,l like everything. First visit to the dome and the greenery and colourful theme is great. The prize winning orchids were so colourful and magnificent.
,,A touch of Desert in a Rainy Climate,4.0,,We saw examples of plants and gardens that we've enjoyed from Arizona to Riyadh; it must be an amazing display for anyone who has not enjoyed a desert.
,,Went to orchid heaven,5.0,,"The place has an orchid exhibit when we visited Singapore from overseas, which was just our good luck. By itself, the orchid exhibit was spectacular that you will easily get the urge to go out and buy plants from vendors out by The Meadow. But other specimens, including old and large olive trees, camellias in bloom, roses, palm trees, also made for an interesting visit."
,,From the world over,5.0,,This is another attraction worth the visit for the architecture alone but the contents are from all over the world. The set out is wonderful.
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,"Much like the cloud dome, this artificial environment is a great respite from the incessant humidity outside.... this one is probably more for gardening and flower lovers but it still occupied us for an hour."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,My family visited the Flower Dome during our recent vacation in Singapore. We found the facilities and flowers in superb condition. Ideal to visit during those Singapore Rainstorms
,,Interesting,4.0,,You need to pay a visit if you are interested in flowers and plants. You will get a respite from the humidity outside and the exhibits are spectacular. Enjoy.
,,Rather disappointing after the Cloud Forest Dome visit,2.0,,"We were rather disappointed after our Cloud Forest Dome visit. It was already a little too dark, I think, but they still sell tickets until 21.00 hr. Not much flowers to see and it looked as if the building of the Flower Dome had not yet finished. Not worthwhile to visit."
,,Is a package deal with the Cloud Dome,4.0,,"It was a nice exhibit of flowers/plants from all over the world, and nicely presented. It is a nice reprieve from the humidity of Singapore."
,,jaw dropping sight,5.0,,"A spectacular attraction and it should be top of any ones list of things to do, but do allow at least 5 hours to really see both domes"
,,Garden by the bay 2,4.0,,"This was lovely, the flowers are beautiful.
They were setting up for flower festival when we were there, which was gorgeous to see.
Pollen is a little haven, but think would be better as tea/coffee shop with scones and cakes just. Sitting there wad very tranquil and idyllic.
Worth a visit"
,,Peaceful breathtaking exhibit,5.0,,Must not miss this exquisite exhibit of thousands of flower species and endless blooms. Different microclimate gardens. Different vignettes. Beautiful photo spots. Well worth the price. Just a special place!
,,"Amazing, awesome",5.0,,Go and see it for yourself! You won't regret it. Gardens by the Bay with both domes (trees and flowers) are a must-see in Singapore. Don't leave the city without seeing them.
,,Beautiful flowers all around,4.0,,"Plenty to photograph and a beautiful air-conditioned landscape. Like the other dome, we found that there wasn't a ""correct"" route around the place so ended up doing some double-backing to make sure we hadn't missed anything. As with the Cloud Dome, I wished there were more signs explaining what the plants are where they're from and how they are used. Some of the roses smelt fantastic (and some were too high to smell which was a shame). I would recommend to others."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"From the entrance onwards this was an amazing experience! You wander around this dome in awe of the variety of plants and trees from around the world. From 'pretty' flowers, to spiky cacti. Loved it!"
,,Interesting..,4.0,,"Not really the flower sort, but this again is worth the visit as the design just blows one away. For those into taking photos of flowers that are already all over google, obviously very interesting, for me, was just a nice walk around with some photo opportunities."
,,Must see at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Huge range of succulents on show all planted in very magnificent mass plantings. They have sectioned off the conservatory into gardens from around the world from Australia to California to South Africa. Lots of things to see but definitely not for anyone who doesn't care for flora as there's not really anything else to do but appreciate the plantings. Huge variety of plants and flowers to see and some flowers that you wouldn't see in a humid climate like Singapore. I would've thought that there would perhaps have been more temperate flowers but it is still very impressive. Definitely need to go and see this if you come to the gardens.
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,It was nice to see all those flowers. It is very well arranged even though some place look poor : california garden... an orange tree and then well all the same trees; looks unfinished. A little bit expensive for what it is I think.
,,Was ok,3.0,,The dome itself (architecture) is a great and amazing! Inside it was very artificial. Nothing really breathtaking. It felt like u are in a greenhouse but much bigger. You are able to walk around. Outside this dome is great too. There's a park to walk around.
,,Very well maintained and worth a visit,4.0,,Areas were adequately signposted indicating different gardens from different geographical areas. Suggest start from the right upon entry and walk through the designated paths downwards. Lots of guides along to seek help if needed. Gardens are very well maintained and there are many picturesque spots for the photo buffs if flowers are the subject. An indoor version (air conditioned) of the Botanic Gardens that is worth a visit.
,,Lovely and cool.,5.0,,They have done an amazing job building this facility - a plant lovers paradise... take your time - there is soooo much to see.
,,just beautiful,5.0,,great to see flowers and plants from all over the world. This is part of the gardens by the bay. you get your tickets there. just lovely. and nice and cool
,,Nothing spectacular,3.0,,"It's just another man made place. Good if you're into nature. You can skip it though, I'm sure there are way more interesting things one can do."
,,Best flower garden I've ever visited in Asia,5.0,,"We were blown away by its beauty, the flowers are blooming everywhere, beautifully, once you enter the dome colorful orchid and other flowers will greet you. Best thing about walking in here is that the temperature is set to cool with AirCon, using sustainable energy. All the beautiful flowers are there; orchids, hibiscus, roses, daisies, trumpeta, lilies, ..you name it.
Could not get enough of taking pictures here,"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Beautiful display of plants from different regions around the world. The olive trees will amaze you, they must be hundreds of years old. Fabulous set up."
,,Variety of unique plants,4.0,,"Beautiful and unique types of plants. I loved it. Anyway, I think they charge too much to entry fee which does not worth the price since the dome is not that big."
,,A great experience,4.0,,Only in Singapore can you see such a marvellous display created by fine architecture and a unique mix of foliage
,,Amazing plants,5.0,,"Such a wide variety of plants, particularly cactus species from all over the world. The Persian garden was breathtaking. So much effort goes into maintaining these gardens and it was wonderful watching staff take so much care with maintenance of the plants and displays. A nice way to cool off in the daytime heat."
,,BLOOMING LOVELY!,5.0,,"The Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay is a photographer's delight.They were preparing for the Upcoming Garden Festival which would be something to see.
Enjoyed the contrast between the English Cottage plants and the Cacti and Succulents.
Could see similarities with the Eden Project in Cornwall UK."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"The Flower Dome is simply an outstanding presentation of a wide variety of plants that thrive in the Mediterranean climate. The dome is climate controlled to a temperature around the mid 20 and a relatively low humidity compared to Singapore. Walking into the dome is a very pleasant experience. The award winning architecture of the dome itself can be described as a modern engineering marvel, and adds significantly to the visitor experience.
The variety of plants from cactus to palm trees and everything in between has something that will appeal to everyone. With many flowers in bloom, there are many great photo opportunities on offer.
We paid an extra $4 to get the audio guide, which was money well spent. An unhurried look through the dome will take about an hour or so depending on your mood and interest in the plants. A very worthwhile attraction.
Thanks for your vote if you found this review helpful."
,,In full bloom,4.0,,"One or the other flower festival is on most of the time, tulip festival, easter, etc. Should go to flower dome after the cloud forest. This one is mostly for photos n admiring flowers. So you could finish this one later as the first dome always takes more time as you walk slowly admiring the novelties."
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"The place was very nice and cool. And everything in there, the flowers, plants; you can really appreciate the beauty of nature and it makes you stress-free. Will be back next year for the tulips exhibit."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We were really impressed with this attraction. It is easy walking and has many countries on display. When we saw the Australian display it made us feel a little home sick. They really have done a great job in presenting the flora from the various countries. Take some drinking water. There is a shop where you can buy ice creams and Singapore items. You will enjoy the experience. If you enjoy art this is a great place to lose some time sketching. We saw some really great artists dabbling with their water colours as they painted flowers and shrubs.
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"Flower Dome is one place you should visit while you are in Singapore. The garden was looked after so well, all the flowers, plants and trees were looking absolutely gorgeous. As you arrive, you need to purchase a ticket to enter. The ticke is for both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, and as a tourist, we must purchse a ticket for both places. If you can, try to spare at least a few hours for both places. You can easily spend much longer time than that, especially you love the nature. We didn't realise how nice the place was and allocated an hour for each places and we had to rush a little which was a shame.
The Dome is air-conditioned so it is a very nice oasis from the heat outside. Take time to walk around and appreciate different kind of flowers and plants from all over the world.The highlight is without a doubt ""Persian Garden"". The flowers are so immaculately organised, you can sit and admire the beauty for ages!"
,,nice exhibits of flowers,4.0,,it's airconditioned. good place to bring your children. nice exhibition of flowers & plants. have to come here at least once.
,,Wonderful addition to Singapores attractions,5.0,,Beautiful displays and flowers from around the world. Take the time to wander all pathways worth the effort.
,,Not as good as the cloud dome,3.0,,"I was a bit disappointed as was expecting more flowers and colour. However, everything was well set out and easy to get around."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"Please visit here. It was absolutely amazing the various plants and trees that were included here, from all over the world."
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"As with the Cloud Dome and Gardens by the Bay, this is another example of what Singapore offers the world, you'll need every bit of a full day to take it all in, but it's well worth it."
,,Could be better,4.0,,The ticket to this place came bundled with cloud forest. After visiting amazing cloud forest dome our expectations were very high for flower dome. Well it disappointed us. Flower collection is diverse but nothing spectacular.
,,Marvelous,5.0,,"It is an enormous gathering of flowers and plants. When we visit was raining outside and it just felt great to be near nature. Take your time to visit this amazing place, even kids will love it"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The different species of Flowers and Plants are just amazing all set out in their on separate gardens,well worth a visit"
,,Flowers rare and flowers ordinary,4.0,,"Not quite as amazing as the Cloud Forest Dome as quite a lot of the plants are in my garden or I have as house plants, but pretty spectacular all the same. If you're visiting the Botanic Gardens you must go to both of the domes."
,,Flower Dome Delivers Delightful Experience!,4.0,,"The Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay was similar to other 'nature experiences' I've come across elsewhere - a dome within which an artificial climate has been created, along with plant species from around the world. The main difference with the Flower Dome is its scale, being bigger and better than probably any other such attraction."
,,Just Go,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore this is just a 'must do'. Dont overthink it, just go. Its well worth a couple of hours of your time"
,,Beautiful and Refreshing Place,4.0,,"Refreshing place in the midst of crowded city. Near with cloud forest, this place also has refreshing cool air. Many variety of flower. A nice place for flower lover."
,,a must see,5.0,,"One of the must sees in Singapore, whether you are a horticulture fan as I, or not (my husband) you will fall in love with this absolute heaven!"
,,What an amazing exhibit of plant life,5.0,,"The first attraction we visited at the Gardens By The Bay was the Flower Dome. It is the world’s largest column-less greenhouse. The Conservatories’ glass sits on a steel grid that acts like an eggshell. It is divided up into various zones. We saw some amazing Baobobs, Bottle Trees, and Indian Ghost Trees (Kullu). They have a very nice restaurant where we ate lunch, appropriately named Pollen."
,,Absolute delight,4.0,,"Having viewed the two dome structures in the Marina Bay Gardens from the observation deck on top of the Sands (great view, $25 ea for access) we chose to use the trolley ride in the park to get to the Domes. On a hot day (typical Singapore) the trolley offers a brief overview of the tree structures & surrounds without too much loss of sweat.
We had previously visited the Botanic Gardens & loved the cool climate orchid pavillion so chose not to visit the tree top dome as it covered some of the same environment. (Please do visit the Botanic Gardens but go as early as you can as the heat can be oppressive).
The flower dome is just gorgeous, both as an architectural highlight & the astounding range of vegetation, trees, shrubs, flowers, sculptures & micro climates, all laid out over many levels in the most attractive way. This will blow you away.
And there is a delightful cafe hidden away within the garden offering light meals, cakes, antipasto, coffee & alcoholic beverages all at reasonable prices. It is worth the price of admission just to enjoy a meal/snack & glass of wine.
I loved this place & on a hot day IT IS COOL!"
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"Persian garden was on show when we visited but without this it would have been a great visit anyhow.well laid out, good value and recommended"
,,Natural beauty,5.0,,We spent 2 hours in this glorious place which is set out in an excellently informative manner. i.e. Different sections illustrate different continents. What a tremendous showing of the contrasting areas of our natural world
,,Nice garden to visit.,4.0,,Nice garden to visit. If you are the flower love then you will love about this dome... and they got air conditioning inside the dome.. best for get out of the Singapore heat.
,,"Was ""transported"" to a Persian Garden",5.0,,The current Persian Garden floral display is absolutely beautiful! There are also ancient olive trees and amazing baobab and banksia trees in the Flower Dome as well. The air conditioned Flower Dome is a heavenly respite from the Singapore heat.
,,Engineering marvel or shameful waste of resources?,4.0,,"I went to the Flower Dome at Gardens By the Bay in a group of three. Two were impressed at the brilliance of the design and the variety of the plants, one was horrified at the amount of resources that must be required to keep these massive domes sufficiently refrigerated to grow plants that are native to much cooler climes.

What all agreed on was that it was an expensive place to visit and that the flowers were impressive.

You be the judge."
,,Visit the Flower Dome,5.0,,"Amazing structure with breathtaking verity of flowers, trees and other plant life from all over the world. The display is interweaving and allows you to take your time viewing each display. It is a ""must visit"" especially during the summer since the temperature is cooler inside. A memorable experience and very affordable."
,,Need to be there to believe,5.0,,The beauty of nature can be experienced at this place. created with fine details and one can spend hours enjoying the flower dome itself.
,,Flower everywhere,5.0,,"We went at Christmas when Singapore is very quite but it was great as they had decorated the flower dome in Xmas plants. The domes (Flower Garden and Cloud Garden) are cooled rather then heated so they are just fantastic to visit when its really hot. Just cross over the the Marina area by taxi, bus or walk across the Helix bridge (take some photos of the bay on the way). From the helix bridge enter the mall and head under the road. On the way see if you can see a shop that sells alligator golf bags. You can by tickets for the dome at the kiosk which is nice and shaded and has some great carvings. There are also food and souvenir shops there. Then just browse about in the multistory experience."
,,Amazing architecture to showcase the world's flora,5.0,,"As an architect, I was blown away by the sheer audacity of this elegant and airy structure. It made me think that the futuristic images painted in the sci fi novels I read as a teenager had come to pass. The flora displays, from each major global region, were fantastic. The only downside is that it is a bit of a hike to get to on a hot, steamy Singapore day."
,,persian garden is good,4.0,,you can visit during day time. Felt persian garden was more exptic than other themes. Desert plants section was well maintained.
,,For the plants lovers,5.0,,"Another brilliant ecosystem. This domes are just espectacular, is something worth visiting, because they are no others like this in the world. Truly plants lovers paradise"
,,Uniquely Beautiful,5.0,,"Located within the Gardens by the Sea complex, the Flower Dome is a must experience while visiting Singapore. Architecturally the building is beautiful, and the overall experience unique. I highly recommend this place."
,,For the flower lovers,4.0,,"If you love flower, this is the place, and of course if you don't I think you might feel wasting your time. I like flower so i personally feel 3-4 hours in this dome is just enough for me as there are many stuff that I can see and understand. The dome itself not very big and there always have different theme based on the season, so you might see different at the center of the dome, for eg. easter day, chinese new year, Christmas."
,,An attractive array of plants,4.0,,"This huge dome was home to cool dry Meditteranean and sub-tropical region gardens. We were interested to see the various gardens i.e. the Australian, South African and also Persian etc and the array of colours was really lovely. When we visited it was school week and so various schools were combining to show dancing and music with the lovely floral background."
,,Beautiful displays,5.0,,Some great displays with some very familiar plants and some unusual ones. Look out for the forthcoming flower show in Aug 2014
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This dome features dry climate plants from around the world, but contrary to what you might expect, is lovely and cool. There is a succulent garden, an Australian garden, a Californian garden and much more. The feature is currently a Persian garden, which is a coloured carpet of gorgeous flower beds, complete with fountain and mosaics.

Worth a visit for garden lovers, or just for a break from the relentless heat."
,,Brillaint,5.0,,An amazing creation from the architecture right down to the plantings of full grown trees. You come out of the heat of Singapore into the dry cool air of another place and time. Totally worth a visit (or two)
,,"A female view, but shared",5.0,,"Persian Garden exhibit was excellent, colourful and interesting. Should be a permanent feature. Interesting seeing various countries' vegetation, with great descriptions - very educational. Well worth an hour walk-around."
,,Nice Place,4.0,,"This place is nice but not as good as its sibling i.e. the cloud forest.I would rate it 4 out of 5. The place is divided in different vegetation, but i expected more flowers which were too less."
,,Wonderful place,4.0,,It's amazing place to took a picture and see a wonderful waterfall. U will be feel like going to heaven. Very interesting place!
,,Lovely setting,4.0,,Not as impressive as the cloud dome but still quite lovely. I liked looking at the different plants and flowers from all over the world in an easy to walk around venue.
,,nice cool place,3.0,,a very nice place for dinner with a view. price is alright and service is good and friendly. food is average
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is very well set out and well worth a look, it takes you round gardens of different country's and is all cooled by the same cooling system as the cloud dome. Some absolutely amazing plants and flowers."
,,Underwhelming and inaccurate,2.0,,"We went to this dome after the Cloud Dome expecting it to be the more stunning of the two, but were very disappointed.
It is poorly signposted, plants from Europe are found in what is supposed to a Californian garden, and are far fewer flowers than there are trees or shrubs. Many of the flowers are 'cheap and cheerful' ones which grow almost to weed proportions in more temporate climes. The so-called Australian garden included several plants which are native to New Zealand.
SP$28 is a steep price to pay for the 2 domes, and especially so if one of them is poor value."
,,Beuatiful orchids a feast for the eye,5.0,,"My colleague and I took many photos inside the flower dome of the beautiful orchids, all different shapes and colours and many other tropical plants. The waterfall is quite spectacular and you can take the lift up to the top and walk around."
,,persian garden in Singapore!!,4.0,,"Flower dome along with cloud forest dome have become iconic objects of Singapore along with Merlion statue! This dome made of glass is the worlds largest columnless dome. .Its controlled temperature replicates and maintains the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean countries like Spain.Italy, South Africa and parts of Australia Many desert trees and plants are seen here. Bonsai version of Baobab trees are very interesting Very ancient olive trees are also visible here. Flower beds which are a big attraction here varies with season When we visited in early July, it was the time of Persian Garden and at least a dozen flower beds of different bright colors and hues in the shape of a star was adorning the garden.Very clean wash rooms with drinking water is provided inside the garden There are good sitting arrangements inside the dome. As perpetual spring is present inside the dome with its excellent climate control,enjoy your trip inside the garden One thing however needs to be mentioned-its steep entrance fee of S$16 Singapore Govt has also done a discrimination by offering 50%discount to only senior Singapore citizens only where as in Universal Studios and National Orchid Garden senior citizen discount is given to all irrespective of nationality"
,,Good experience,4.0,,Found the different sections very interesting especially the plantings for the Persian Garden ( theme of the period). Bit disconcerted by the guided tour groups tending to barge through but it was a Saturday.!
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"Again, as part of Gardens by the Bay it is a part that should not be missed. Although Gardens By the Bay has free admission, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest Dome have an admission charge but this is minimal and neither of them should be missed"
,,A piece of Mediterranean in the tropics,5.0,,For a gardener it is very interesting to see plants from all over the world from a similar climate in one location. I think it is a great achievement to get the conditions right in wet tropics of Singapore and see the plants thriving.
,,A great coservatory,5.0,,"From the cactus plants of Mexico to the Persian gardens, one can see species from all over the world, laid out in an amazingly creative manner. It is nature at its best, in the midst of an urban setting. Certainly worth a leisurely visit."
,,See almost all flowers and plants under one roof,4.0,,"The SGD$28 entrance fee includes both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest (see my separate review). You can see almost all the flowers and plants from California, South Africa, Australia, South America, the Mediterranean and others under one big roof (the dome). The place is very bright with natural light through the all-glass ceiling.

Don't forget to bring a camera with macro feature. The beauty of the patterns of the flowers on closer look is simply stunning. You could easily spend an hour inside without noticing the passage of time."
,,Visit it!,4.0,,I liked Cloud Forest more but it's a good place to sit and have drinks after exploring the Gardens. Also a good place for photo enthusiasts & for people who loves to have their pictures taken against beautiful backdrops. I especially loved the miniature train & the orange tree. Some bottle trees on the higher level.
,,So Beautiful!,5.0,,"I'm lost for words at how beautiful this place is, it's truly magnificent by night or day and really lives up to the whole Singaporean ethos about a city within a garden. A must see."
,,Flowers galore at Flower Dome,5.0,,"It was a hot afternoon and we boarded a shuttle for Sgd2 back and forth to flower dome. Inside it was cold and balm to the afternoon heat we had. Walking around you can see trees and flowers from different countries as each section has it's own designated origin. They also include some statistics and additional information related to flora. The experience is pleasant and soothing. The tour can be done in half an hour or 1 depending on how fast or slow you breeze through. Toilets and water fountain are located near the exit.
My personal favorite - the date trees. You can be transported just by the smell. Be on the look out for some kaleidoshow on your feet too (in this area also ).

Ticket, bundled at sgd 25 comes with the Cloud Dome."
,,Tulip Mania,5.0,,The place is nicely decorated with lots and lots of tulips and flowers. Had my birthday spent there as my hubby knows I'm a tulipmania. Simply love it!
,,Spectacular,4.0,,"Absolutely spectacular. I thought it would be something quite boring but it was the opposite. I could have walked around in here all day, just enjoying the different environment, the flowers and nature. The scent that hit me from the flowering hyacinths and tulips as we walked in was just fantastic.

Amazing day out for young and old. Very informative. I would definitely go back again during my next visit to Singapore."
,,Excellent displays of plants from all over the world,5.0,,Stunning and well set out and presented displays. Most countries are represented with native plants and flowers from the different countries and regions around the world.
,,Not as spectacular as the cloud dome but still wonderful,4.0,,"Like the cloud dome is is climate controlled so a nice relief from the heat and humidity outside.
I am only rating this a 4 as it isn't as fantastic as the cloud dome next door, but non the less it is pretty good. I expected, probably due of the name, that the would be more flowers as you come in on the level of the cactus garden. But the dome is terraced and you look down on a beautiful sea of colour.
It is very peaceful and nice to visit. I certainly didn't spend as much time here as I did in the cloud dome."
,,Not as good as the cloud dome,4.0,,"We visited during the French theme and although it was impressive, we noticed a few dead plants and it took the excitement away from what should have been a great display. We preferred the cloud forest"
,,Where are the flowers?,3.0,,"I went in early July, I thought there'd be more flowers in bloom. Good for nature lovers, bring a jacket. It can get cold."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Gardens By the Bay - a must see in Singapore. Both Flower Dome and Cloud Dome are so very nice to see with do many different areas to see. The Cloud dome had a massive water fall and a trillion different orchids and flowers ...
,,Plants from around the world,4.0,,"Very interesting if you are into plants, not as inspiring as the Cloud Forest Dome which is next door"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Amazing plants, trees and flowers from around the world displayed and presented in a stunning enclosed glass Dome over numerous levels."
,,A treasure trove in the Gardens by the Bay!,5.0,,Such a beautifully landscaped enclosure. There is a lot to see and learn in there and even the kids had a good time. One of the jewels in the Gardens by the Bay that is a must visit for all nature lovers.
,,Interlude,5.0,,"the second of the two domes contained within the magnificent Gardens by Bay complex - the ""nations' "" gardens within this dome are ttruly wonderful"
,,"Love it, love it, love it",5.0,,"I can sit here the whole day if given the chance. The flower scent, beautiful blooms every where, I am amazed by the idea of air conditioned garden, since I've been a tropical person since born, and heat has been my daily life every day of the year. I love trees and how the grow into characters. I saw some patient workers holding a tong and a bucket, carefully picking dead leaves so that not to hurt the healthy others, so dedicated, I can see their love and attention to the plant they are tending too.....salute."
,,The rare view of WOOD Horses,4.0,,"The best part is that you never feel you are indoor inside a dome. You can see so many things and on the top you see special plants like stone plants , cactus and then wooden horses on the top."
,,For the love of flowers...,4.0,,"The flower dome compared to its sister the cloud forest dome is much more attractive.
I, for someone who grew up entirely in Asia and the tropics, the Flower Dome provided a window to flowers all around the world.
The display was spectacular, and the variety and the colors impressed me a lot!"
,,Absolutely amazing.,5.0,,World class display. It's like a botanical snapshot of our planet. What is truly astounding is that in the 5 years since our last visit the Gardens and Marina Bay Sands had popped up.
,,to see is to be inspired,5.0,,Absolutely amazing and the range of plant life from around the world on display is so worth the visit.
,,Interesting,4.0,,Great to see all the plants from different countries. Dominated thought by plants from Europe so a bit boring for me but good if you are from Singapore I guess.
,,"Love,y",5.0,,"We were there in December 2013 and the flowers were lovely. They would be nice at any time of year as there were flowers from so many different countries and continents. Liked the little cafe, the coffee was good."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,I not sure the Flower Dome is worth what they charge. Perhaps I was expecting more given the wraps I'd received from others. The dome itself is amazing but the displays apart from two were ordinary.
,,Celebrating the creation,5.0,,What a display of nature's beauty. How can anybody not like this? The nice thing about Singapore is that similarly beautiful plants and flowers border the footpaths and public spaces.
,,Beautiful display of different plants and flowers,5.0,,Great display of beautiful flowers and various plants. Wish I had more time to explore but alas it was almost closing time.
,,flowerlicious,4.0,,"the area was a little warmer than the cold clouded forest. over all it is astonishing as the colossal trees can be moved into the new dome. the logistics it takes to move the trees are unimaginable.
the horticulturist looks like they are really committed as the work quite slow when trimming the plants but the results is amazing.
you feel like you have moved to different areas of the world. from the towering palm and date trees of the Mediterranean to the plump, odd-looking baobab and acacia in Africa.
my favorite place was the area with ever changing look, the area has a very themed look to it, the beauty of the places the plants was placed makes it a great place. picture perfect. the area changes with season, sometimes filled with tulips. sometimes, it is filled with orchids.
you should go to the top part of the dome where there is a strip of cactus garden which is wonderful an amazing to take picture with.
as always, the price is too high for a garden. i don't think you should bring kids unless you want your kids to the place as it can get boring. plants-lover will certainly feel like heaven.
the beautiful view you can get is priceless."
,,Pretty beautiful but lack of interesting place,3.0,,I enjoyed this place a lot. It was refreshing and suitable for a walk with your other significant. But the price is quite high to enter just a park-like facility. The cloud forest is much better with more thing to contemplate.
,,A Glass Dome of Wonder,5.0,,"The Flower Dome, or the closed clamshell conservatory, is wondrous inside and out. This massive dome houses some of the most interesting species of flowers in the world, from South Africa to California. The biggest question is...How did all of these plants get in here? The artistry of the plants with rocks, rock sculptures, vines, trellises, glass ceilings is like no other in the world.

I have never experienced so many geranium and pine tree species in one place. The outside views of the South China Sea, the Singapore skyline, the Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer were fabulous at every turn. The row of huge Cypress and Mediterranean pine trees along the water views of the glass conservatory were impressive. The main gardens here change periodically, so the gardens within the dome change periodically.

It appeared that the unique gardens within the Flower Dome was a great place for taking wedding photos. It was so sweet to see all of them on their special day. The dome has a huge room for conferences or events that had bubble like lighting on the ceiling that changed with programming. It looked so romantic. Be prepared to take an excessive amount of photos."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This dome is incredible. A great way to cool down and 'visit' a variety of gardens from around the world. There is a cafe if you want to hang around a little longer. Get a cheaper ticket at a travel agent in Chinatown.
,,The flowers are brought to you!,4.0,,"having visited difference flowers exhibits overseas, I am really thrilled to attend the tulips exhibits. Despite its small scale, I think it's still worth a visit if you are a flower lover. The flowers are lovely, enough variety & you need not travel overseas to view them. Oh it's handicap friendly, senior is half price, saw many elderly on wheel chairs."
,,floral beauties,5.0,,"For those who love flowers and plants... Flower Dome holds many surprises. Showcasing vegetation and flowers from all around the world, the Dome is a delight for the eyes as well as the soul.

We happened to see French Riviera where a special setup showcased French flowers and plantations and an Eiffel Tower was also built with green plants. Truly loved it"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Looks like you are in another world. So soothing to the eye. Hope there was more info about each flower and a picture to identify it.
,,Cool escape,4.0,,If u need a break from the humidity this place is air con. Not a huge display compared to cloud Forrest but we enjoyed the special Paris exhibition. There was an Aussie section which was funny seeing plants from the local park back home. If u are doing both domes do this one first then get blown away by cloud Forrest dome.
,,Seasonal flowers,5.0,,"Cool way to spend a hot afternoon, since the Flower Dome is covered and air-conditioned. Expect about 1 hour to tour the dome, and my understanding is that the flowers do change seasonally, such as the tulips season, etc."
,,Wonderful activity for a hot and humid day,5.0,,The inside air conditioned flower dome is perfect for a hot and humid day if you like gardens. The layout is wonderful..You meander along pathways through gardens from a variety of locations in the world. There was a Bollywood filming going on while we were there adding to the fun of the experience. The restaurant at the Flower Dome is very good although a bit expensive.
,,Beautiful flowers,4.0,,"There's a wide variety of flowers you will see. However, it lacks the ""wow"" factor the way other large gardens in other countries during spring time will impress you. It's probably the limited area/size of the dome."
,,"Truly glorious -- but too many ""fillers""",4.0,,"This huge air-conditioned dome is a superlative display of Mediterranean and subtropical plants, generally arranged geographically. For example, there is an area for Australian plants, and one for South African plants.

One minor quibble: All gardens are works in progress, and the Flower Dome is no exception. But there are far too many geraniums filling otherwise empty spaces, and far too many yellow daisies. Yes, I appreciate that many flowers are seasonal and that large empty areas will suddenly appear and will need to be filled. But when that happens, a variety of different ""fillers"" should be planted."
,,Great!,5.0,,"Flower dome was great! especially the country / continent specific gardens such as the 'Australia Garden' - reminded me of home. Was great on such a hot day, for a reprieve in an indoor/outdoor environment."
,,"""Inspirational""",5.0,,"Hats off to Singapore for doing something so well,a great place to wonder through and escape the heat and take fabulous photos."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,As part of Gardens by the Bay it is well worth a visit. An amazing engineering feat to build such a structure. Full of wonderful plants from around the world.
,,Lovely,4.0,,"A nice starting point to follow with the Cloud Dome for a bit of adventure. If you are a fan of flora this one is for you. Always somewhat crowded, but you can get around smoothly in spite of the photo-crazed visitors. A changing flower exhibition keeps it interesting even when repeating your visit."
,,Florals For Spring? Groundbreaking Indeed!,4.0,,"The Flower dome was the one we visited first prior to the Cloud Forest dome, and made for a pleasant stroll amidst various themed gardens. The ongoing exhibit at that time was the ""War of the Roses"", and the main central area was a sight to behold, what with roses of virtually every shade and color as the main attraction.

Aside from flowers & flowering plants, this dome also features plants like cacti and the like."
,,Great place for photo,5.0,,Good if u like flower and stay in air con while still explore the nature. Is not expensive if u get the combine ticket for the other dome as well
,,Not really impressive,3.0,,"I can't say why I wasn't that impressive: is it because of the excessive price? because of the fake bee sounds? or because everything seemed very artificial? It looked immaculate, clean, white (except for the trees of course). For me this is not a garden!"
,,Flowers!!!,4.0,,"It is one of the tourist attraction in Singapore that a tourist may find a place where to go. It is situated inside Gardens by the bay.
If you are into an area where you love to look at different plants, flowers, etc. this is the area where to go as it is well decorated and lots of things to see and explore."
,,Go there!!!,5.0,,"While outside the temperature is too high for th eaverage tourist, inside the temperature is so nice. Cooler and humidity very pleasant: perfect to watch all those wonderfull plants flowers and trees."
,,Just Good.,3.0,,"The architectural is beautiful. Its welcoming with the cool atmosphere. I would say not many plants or species though. We did notice a lot of the plants seems to be rotting or dying. For those flower lovers, YES it's a must visit. They do have themes along the year. But other than that do not expect much. I would suggest Cloud Forest then which is just adjacent."
,,Well Decorated.....Presented....,4.0,,Liked the placement of Flowers and Plants.... Liked oneway walk to see entire Dome..... Likes pleasant places to Relax....
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Perhaps I was expecting too much from the flower dome, it is beautiful but I was anticipating many flowers and really there was not. It is supposed to have flowers from all over the world but the majority appear to be able to be grown in the UK. However it was lovely and cool in there and you can walk around in a couple of hours. Did not visit the other dome as thought this was just green plants but maybe should have done so seeing the photos now. Maybe go back and do that one later."
,,Good,4.0,,nice place to take picture with the flower from all over the world. recommended for you who loves flowers. but expected for some attractions.
,,Wonderful colours in cool surroundings,5.0,,I love this wonderful building and the amazing plants and huge trees that are permanently there but also every month or so there is a different theme to the floral planting that means I just never tire of popping into the cool of this place and taking all my visitors there. The amazing colours of the tulips and windmills was wonderful and looking forward to seeing the French theme with Eiffel tower on my visit next week. So glad to have become a friend of the Gardens.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,It was a great experience to visit this place.they have a lot of trees flowers and many decorations that you may not walk around in couple minutes.i really love this place.
,,Good but ...,4.0,,"I didn't find this as interesting as the Cloud Dome, nothing very innovative here. Having said that though, my partner preferred this Dome because he liked the baobab trees and the very old olive trees. Just goes to show that we are all individuals and what may be one mans meat is another mans poison (to use an old English saying)."
,,very interesting,5.0,,"the flower dome has plants and (you guessed it) flowers from all over the world, sorted into sections based on where theyre from (ie, Mediterranean garden, australian garden, californian garden). It's air conditioned too, a nice break from the heat outside"
,,Good but feel it is a bit pricey for what it is,4.0,,"It is a lovely place to go and escape the heat. The gardens are nice but flowers were not much different to what we can see anyday at home in Australia. Feel the price is over the top and you are unable to pay to visit one dome only if you are a tourist. The locals get the price cheaper.
Nice to see but still feel a bit overpriced."
,,Cactea and succulents,5.0,,"I know, these are not the only flowers at the Flower Dome, but they happen to be my favorites. They have many varieties, even white ones!"
,,Lovely,3.0,,Showcasing 'gardens' from around the globe with an array of beautiful colours and scents it was lovely to walk around this dome. Although not as 'spectacular' as the Cloud Forest it still is a lovely place to stroll around for an hour or so.
,,Good but -,4.0,,"Good, well maintained indoor garden. A pity it has rival named Cloud Forest Dome which is just next door. Perhaps you should visit the flower dome before you check out the cloud forest. Maybe it might get a higher rating."
,,Nothing extraordinary about it,3.0,,"It is nice to visit if you have time, There are several sections representing different countries with plants shipped there from all over the world. Even though the concept sounds exciting, I did not find the experience that exciting. The Cloud Forest Dome was much better, if you only have time to visit one of the two."
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,Lots of plant exhibits to explore and a lovely café for a cool drink. Comfortable temperature to walk around in.
,,"Too small, few flowers",3.0,,"My boyfriend and I expected to see lots of flowers, everything should be blooming but on practice the Dome turned out to be rather small, we spent around 30 minutes there and it was not full of flowers. I liked kaktuses most. The tickets are available to 2 parks only - Flower Dome and Cloud forest, they cost S$26."
,,Nice but nothing special,3.0,,"During a visit to the gardens by the bay I visited the flower dome and cloud forest to, personally I found the flower dome not particularity spectacular.
It has beautiful plants of course but I thought it was a little bit kitschy, especially when I got to the green Eifel tower.
Was nice to see but would not visit it again."
,,Huge and Awe Inspiring,5.0,,"The size of two & a half football fields, the Flower Dome included everything from ancient olive trees from Europe, a wonderful display of African bottle trees, Australian native plants and a fantastic cactus collection. When we were there there was a french flower garden display complete with the Eiffel Tower! A lovely, lovely experience."
,,Flower Dome,3.0,,"Several areas lumped together under a dome. You walk through Australian Plants, African Plants etc. It was OK, but really given a choice I would put the Cloud Forest Dome well ahead of this."
,,Colorful flowers,5.0,,"Visited this in Apr 2014 when there was a Tulipmania show over there. It was worth the money. The baby enjoyed looking at the colorful flowers, If you are a nature lover, who is fond of flowers, this is the place for you."
,,Wish it were lit better at night,4.0,,Unfortunately after dark it's very hard to see in the dome. We arrived a bit too late to really enjoy the flower dome.
,,A whole lot of gardens,4.0,,"My favorite part in the Flower Dome is the cactus garden. Huge cacti you'll probably see only in hot deserts around the world. This place is a must for garden-lovers, as they feature rare find plants and flowers.

It takes about 45 mins. to an hour to go around the garden alleys inside. You will not mind the walk because the dome is fully airconditioned. They offer strollers for kids, rented for SG$2.00 for the whole day, and wheelchairs for the impaired or senior citizens. Both of which available for your convenience."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This Dome is amazing. The variety of flowers, trees and plants is beyond imaginable and there is a/c which is very welcome on Singapore very warm temperatures. It's expensive (around SGD 30)"
,,What a Surprise,4.0,,Great garden design.. we were luck to visit in April and they had a Tulip exibition on.. Tulips in Singapore! Just magic. Plus some Gardens exibits from all over ther world. Again a must.. but an entry fee is charged.
,,Disappointing,3.0,,After seeing amazing photos of this place I found it very disappointing. There was not much difference between the Cloud Dome and this one. Very expensive for what you get. Choose just one of the domes unless you are a plant fanatic.
,,Flower Dome - Highlight of the Gardens By the Bay,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is part of the Gardens by the Bay experience at Marina Bay. Ticket price is SG$20 per adult or SG$28 w/ entrance to the Cloud Forest. This is a very interesting place to visit for nature lovers interested in seeing a wide variety of flora from around the world.

Here you can find a very large, indoor dome facility, providing a cool-dry climate that replicates the environments found in the Mediterranean and arid conditions also found in South Africa and California.

This is a massive conservatory housing a huge number of plants, flowers and trees. We particularly liked seeing the baobab trees, a very neat tree species to see. We have enjoyed visiting the angular walkways passing through curious cacti and pebble-looking plants and other flora from various parts of the world as well.

You can easily spend an hour or more in the Flower Dome prior to visiting other attractions at the Gardens by the Bay.

Overall, the Flower Dome is a very good attraction on its own and something we very much enjoy during trips to Singapore. It is genuinely unique and a great place to spend time during the heat of the afternoon.

Hint: There are many other attractions you can see when at Gardens By the Bay. Some of the attractions are free to visit while others require tickets. Visit the website for details for various attractions.

Hint: For those planning to spend a day in Gardens by the Bay, we would suggest visiting the 2 conservatories during mid-day as they climate controlled and very cool inside. Then you can explore the other open areas in the earlier and/or later parts of the day. Stay till around 8pm for the light show in the Supertree Grove (1st one at 7.45pm, 2nd at 8.45pm).

Hint: There are plenty of dining options available at the Gardens by the Bay for those interested in making a longer visit here. Again, see the Gardens by the Bay website for available dining options."
,,A waterfall with a difference,5.0,,This again was a brilliant experience flowers from every country we will certainly return again.Plenty of room for everyone not at any stage did we feel crowed with people very well laid out.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Would suggests tourists to take out time and visit this beautifully crafted Garden. Kids and adults would love this place.
,,A must see,5.0,,Very good experience! Very beautiful flora. Different kind of plants and flowers very well maintained.
,,Variety is its main draw,4.0,,A very contrived garden and yet the beautiful displays are always breathtaking. It still exudes a peaceful air even with people thronging and jostling to capture their best Kodak moments. I especially find the cacti display fascinating and thoroughly enjoy the smells and sights of the Mediterranean Garden.
,,Lots of beautiful flower.,5.0,,"Really pretty, very educational for children. Comfortable to walk and there also interactive mini game"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is part of the Gardens by the Bay. It showcases plants and flowers from the main regions of the world, having a comprehensive display from each. It is not quite as breathtaking as the Cloud Forest Dome but very beautiful in its own way. The French Garden with its wide range of flowers was a joy to behold."
,,Where wonder blooms,4.0,,We have paid sgd28 for the 2 conservatories-flower dome and cloud forest. You can use your pace to visit both the domes. Temperatures is cool and nice. Do avoid crowded weekends.
,,Big and interesting,3.0,,"I personally preferred the cloud dome to the flower dome though the flower dome is much bigger and have a bigger variety of plants / flowers from different parts of the world. They had a french exhibition thing when I was there. however, they blocked certain pathways with pots (unsure why). Best if you visit both. But if you only have time for one, I recommend the Cloud Dome instead (it may be just personal taste)."
,,A great refuge from the heat,4.0,,"The dome has an awesome array of flowers, with many parts of the world represented in unique gardens. Highly recommend this in conjunction with a ticket to the Gardens in the Clouds pavillion."
,,Pretty wonderful (excuse the pun),5.0,,"A world of plants and flowers within a dome, fantastic! A really beautiful display of all sorts of plants, trees and flowers from across the globe displayed under a glass dome, transporting us to another world! Such value for money, one could spend all day wondering around the dome. Very educational!"
,,Stunning and worth a few hours visit! Kids will enjoy it as much as adults,5.0,,Liked everything about this place; the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome are both within the Gardens by the Bay complex on the shore in Singapore. Definitely stop here...it was a highlight of Singapore!
,,GARDENS BY THE BAY,5.0,,"Just revisited Singapore last week and having missed visiting this attraction on the last trip, spent a day at Gardens By The Bay which is located in the Marina Bay area.
No wonder it's rated #1 Singapore attraction. The two domes in the gardens are a ""must visit"". Yes to go in the main attractions you need to pay. BUT, amazing. The Flower Gardens feature plants from so many different country & being an Aussie was most amazed at the plants featured.
The cloud dome is the most incredible of the 2 domes. Huge waterfalls cascading down. The walk ways are an easy climb, but we caught a lift & went from the top downwards. Every level is out of this world."
,,Flowers from all over the world.,5.0,,"It is by far the most beautiful flower display I have ever seen. The sheer size of the place is overwhelming. A must see when in Singapore. It was the sole reason for my visit this time and it did not disappoint! Easy access via the local Bus and a short stroll to the Dome and Cloud. The park surrounding the Dome is full of tropical plants, Ginger, frangipanis, sculptures and open spaces that will surprise you at every turn. There are plenty of quiet spots to picnic or lay and watch the Trees choreographed light show in the evening.
The restaurants had plenty of choices all well priced. We paid for our tickets via our tour desk in The Concorde Hotel and got a good discount. Take your camera and enjoy the show nature has to offer."
,,Sweet little thing near the gardens and cloud forests,4.0,,"If botany and flowers get you interested, if natural beauty incites you, you are going to love it. Extremely well maintained and exceptionally clean."
,,A wonderland not to be missed.,5.0,,"Only Singapore can do this sort of thing so well. This dome has gardens representing several parts of the world - how did they get such enormous trees? If the general heat and humidity is difficult for you, this is the place to be!"
,,inner city oasis,5.0,,"I visited with my partner last year and have only just got around to writing a review. We loved this place!! We both chose to walk the vast gardens without utilising the transport provided...not recommended if you aren't prepared to walk at least 10 km...
it has an amazing indoor oasis with waterfalls and floating walkways...not to mention the array of colours and shapes on display from plant species representing many different countries and climates.
This was definitely one of our highlights in Singapore!!"
,,Lovely,5.0,,SO many displays of wonderful beautiful flowers. It will take you to another world. The entire dome is Air Conditioned. You shall not feel the SG heat and will enjoy the walk.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Again lovely to wander around a bit chilly after the heat outside so you may need a wrap! A bit expensive in the little bar restaurant maybe best to eat outside instead! We went at the end of the tulip displays which were lovely but starting to fade. Some amazing displays.
,,Beautiful plants,4.0,,"There was a wide variety of plants in this dome from all over the world. We got the audio tour guide for this dome, and it was interesting, but the whole tour got kind of long."
,,So pretty and clean,5.0,,We both loved this so much the water falls and all the flowers set in there countrys and the sort of plants are all stacks up the walk and we spent serval hours there just looking at all the plants there where plants we have never seen before and took so many photos make sure you take a good camera
,,Truly beautiful,5.0,,"Peculiar to visit as a Brit who grew up near Kew Gardens in London! Just as we have tropical plants in the temperate house, Singapore has all our trees and flowers in their greenhouses! The most surreal moment for me was coming across a sign that explained the four seasons!

Inside was a very pleasant change in temperature from the humid air outside though and nice to experience a very real difference in such a westernised city. As we were visiting around the Lunar New Year, there were lots of horse figurines subtly placed around the orchids and other beautiful and varied plants. The greenhouse covers many different biomes in a lovely, clean environment. Definitely worth a visit if you're around the bay area!"
,,Awesome place to see,5.0,,I am not a fan of flowers that much. But this place changed my mindset on flowers. It has flowers from all over the world and the way it organized is really awesome. This is a must visit for anyone who visit Singapore and I recommend to go on a weekday as possible since weekends can be crowded.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,This was an amazing done and we would love to go back again when there is a change of seasonal flowers. Worth the time and money to visit. We are pensioners from USA and were given pensioner rates which was excellent because in most countries as visitors you usually have to still pay full price.
,,Very Very beautiful!,5.0,,I met a Tulip Mania in that period. It's very beautiful on every conner of this place. I also like the souvenir shop. There are a lot of beautiful jewely to buy.
,,for trees & flowers' lovers,5.0,,"in the gardens by the bay there are 2 domes - flower dome & cloud forest dome. if you have time, you should visit both, but if you have to choose, i would pick the cloud forest dome - it's more special.
in the flower dome you can see various plants, trees, temporary exhibitions of flowers (like tulip- mania from Holland in May 2014). like everything in SG it's well arranged, clean & spacious.
& it's a nice refuge from the hot & wet weather outside.
the visit shouldn't take more than an hour."
,,"Great place to visit, rain or shine",5.0,,"Singapore is hot and sunny most of the time. But when it rains, it really rains. This is a great attraction and even better on such a day!"
,,Great variety,4.0,,"Quite an experience walking into the dome, immediate impressions were how,light and open the space was and how refreshing the climate was coming in from the humidity of outside. Then started seeing the amazing variety of plants in the dome, just staggering. The have plants presented in areas around the world.
A great way to spend a couple of hours"
,,Beautifully arranged... A gift for nature lovers...,5.0,,"Singapore is a modern city with tall magnificent structures but it has remembered to be close to nature aswell... the Flower dome in gardens by the bay is really a master piece and a gift for nature lovers.... you feel so much fresh and get a soothing effect.... All the colors and fresh aroma really brighten up your mood...When we went there, a tulip and orchid exhibition from Netherlands was going and it was beautiful..."
,,Cool but bitten by a bug so not great,3.0,,Not bad but not great. I had expected more.the pollen set off my allergies. The bistro was great.i preferred the cloud dome .... It was way better and cooler and more spectacular.
,,Unimpressed,1.0,,"I kept hearing about the flower dome, and as a new resident of Singapore, I found it an interesting place to drive by, it looks pretty neat! But when my hubby and I finally got around to going to this attraction, we were unimpressed. The lines were unbelievable, long and unorganized. No one knew what they were standing in line for, there was no marking nor signage. We finally made our way to the ticket counter, and got into the Dome, but were immediately underwhelmed. So many people were taking pictures, and taking forever taking their pictures, cute little close ups with their iPhones, group photos, it was annoying. Could hardly walk, let alone see the displays. Their variety of flowers was not too exciting for this American master gardener. I think this place is more for the locals who aren't able to have their own gardens or green space. We did enjoy the view of Marina Bay Sands from their parking lot!"
,,Nice and cooling place for a walk in nature,4.0,,"Love this place, but it could be too cold for some people. The variety of flowers on display here is quite a lot.
This colourful setup will certainly brighten up your day!
If you have time to spare, simply enjoy the fun by strolling leisurely and admire them. Bring along a camera too!"
,,Nice,5.0,,huge area and nice arhitecture. Needs some directions or staff moving you about as you do get lost. this is not a place for party more for family and enjoying the displays.
,,Must See for flower lovers,5.0,,"Check this out, different themes several times a year. Watch out for the Gardens Festival, held once in 2 yrs - must see!"
,,Really Special,5.0,,An engineering marvel one must see. Different areas showcasing plants and flowers from all over. Easy to walk in and a great place to cool off.
,,Tulip mania,5.0,,"Nice place to view tulips but only on certain times of the year - when tulips are in bloom in northern hemisphere. Other times of the year, the flowers are changed according to the season."
,,amazing view,5.0,,"For a traveller like me, it was amazing that singapore was able to make such a wonderful garden. it was worth the visit, we really did enjoy it and we were just so amazed by it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I muddled up the Domes, so will say that this was the Garden Dome and the Cloud Forest was the one with the stunning water fall and plants growing up the man made mountain, with sculptures to look out for, strategically placed among the plantings, including a 'Del Boy' 3 wheeler covered in moss and other plants."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,A really beautiful attraction ideal for getting out of the heat and enjoying the tranquility of a world filled with flowers
,,nice place for flower lover,3.0,,"This place is not bad at all. It's like a giant green house with various plant from around the world. I'm not a fan because I'd rather to visit an outdoor garden. Some collection are really amazing though. If you're a tulip fans, they have plenty of them, though I'm not sure whether they have every type of that flower."
,,"Flowers, flowers everywhere",5.0,,This dome is great for family photo shoots as well as appreciation of nature. It is divided into different flowering regions and the centre showcase changes every quarter. It's a very relaxing place to be as you can event sit down and take in the sight and smell of the wonderful plants around you.
,,amazing garden,5.0,,"amazing garden in the heart of the city ,flower paradise,if you visit Singapore you must come at this beautiful garden"
,,Stunning,4.0,,Wow what a great concept this whole parkland is. It is so worth visiting and understanding how we can work to be more ecological. The display was tulips and bulbs and they were just coming into flower so it was a great time to visit. The whole parklands area is just beautiful.
,,Exquisite...,5.0,,"Flowers from all over the globe… The colourful changing displays of the Flowers reflects different seasons and themes.
You will be amazed to see the way the changing floral display is set. They have events as well different seasons with different display.
We were fortunate to see numerous roses with different hues…

It’s a must visit when you are here."
,,Beautiful and refreshing,4.0,,"Tulipmania was underway while I visited and that was a very diverse display of tulips. I have no idea that there are so many types and colours. The temperature inside was such a nice ""break"" from the heat and humidity outside :) Highly recommended!"
,,Love it!,5.0,,"It is a must visit place! Beautiful gardens and flowers. ""Tulips"" were the highlight, when we visited the place in April 2014. Many types of tulip from Holland, Dutch houses and windmills were on show. We love our trip."
,,Winter flower,3.0,,I went there when there was Tulip period. It was cold inside like I am in Netherlands but poor thing was...it smells like mixed up flower everywhere in the dome and feel like flower shop too much.
,,Tulips in Singapore,5.0,,"Just managed to catch the tulip show before it ended on 4 May. Got there rather late as we walked from the Bayfront MRT station and got distracted by other parts of the Gardens by the Bay. Paid SGD16 per person to enter the one dome as we were not locals. Great to see the tulips and hyacinths, and explore the dome up to closing time at 9pm. Walked to the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands for dinner after that."
,,You can not visit only one,4.0,,"Of course you have to visit both domes if you go to Gardens by the Bay. In the case of the flower dome, the walk is extremely pleasant and I suggest to take time just to seat and relax. Choose your preferred spot and enjoy the place."
,,WOW,4.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay and along with Cloud Forest and the two purpose built domes housing an array of flora that is amazing. Flower Dome focus is a garden collected from around the world. The Cactus display was my personal favourite, just the size and variety, a great place to visit."
,,"Nice, if you like flowers",3.0,,"The Flower Dome here at Gardens by the Bay is pretty impressive, but only really if you like flowers and all things horticultural. Nearby is the even more impressive Cloud Forest Dome, which should be chosen as a priority if you only have enough time or money to see one of them. There are often exhibitions on here at Flower Dome, so check the listings before you arrive and you may get lucky with additional things to see! However, I would not recommend Flower Dome as a 'must-see' in Singapore."
,,beautiful tulip,5.0,,first time see so beautiful tulip compare to magazine. for those love flower must visit flower dome. to avoid disappointment visit their website http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/ because closed for maintenance .
,,Wonderful Tulip Display,5.0,,We arrived at dusk and went into the Flower Dome immediately. There are a great range of plants sub grouped mainly into zones they grow in. The ambience at dusk and beyond is lovely. The tulip display was a nice tip to the Dutch bulb fields.
,,i liked the cloud dome more,3.0,,Get the audio guide . Great for the season flower display. Went I was vising it was Rose. I am not a rose person .. personal likeness. Have lunch up the super tree.
,,Tulips in Singapore,5.0,,We were o lucky to visit during this 2 week special exhibition. The dome has temperate area plants but for me the masses of tulips were the best. Cant believe how vast these domes are.
,,Beautiful tulips,5.0,,This dome is a must-see. It features plants from different continents. We chanced upon the Tulips display this time and they were absolutely gorgeous. It is amazing to marvel how this entire dome with all its plants/flowers actually thrive in a tropical place like Singapore. Simply amazing!
,,pretty flowers,3.0,,"Went here Christmas time and so there were Christmas decorations and poinsettias throughout. The flowers and trees were mostly Mediterranean, cool weather plants which are commonly seen in North America so I didn't find it that exciting. The restaurant Pollen is in this building - but we didn't eat there."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"So many beautiful flowers, and lots of great deco's. Never think waste time & money. DO NOT miss this place!! strongly recommend!"
,,Ablaze with colour,5.0,,Superb displays of flowers from all countries in the world. Unusual trees and cacti and brushwood sculptures
,,Nice Setting!,3.0,,"The Flower Dome was nicely done and a welcome break from the heat. This Dome is set in park lands with lots of green space. There are a few other structures (Cloud Forest Dome), as well to tour. Both have an entrance fee. I enjoyed the Cloud Forest Dome a bit more due to its uniqueness."
,,So relaxing,4.0,,"So many variety's of plants from all around the world, the rose garden is well worth a visit as are the succulants"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Wonderful flower sea and comfortable cool air.
There are lots of different flower,
If you feel tired, you can sit down as there are many seats.
I suggest that you may bring also a thin coat, as the air temp is quite low.
You must bring camera to take wonderful photos there."
,,An Oasis from the heat,5.0,,"As soon as the doors open, we were hit with the most amazing smell from thousands of flowers. I have to admit, it was a bit overwhelming, but smelled so good. The number of flowers is just staggering. They were all so beautiful. The place is separated out by regions of the world. It was nice to see flowers from all over. We were lucky enough to be there during the tulip exhibit. They have the floor covered with miniature building and windmill from Holland, completely surrounded with many varieties of tulips. It was crowded, but we were there on a Sunday. It was expected. My husband is not overly into flowers, but he was impressed by this place. It is definitely worth a trip."
,,Beautiful conservatory and range of plants.,5.0,,This Dome displays ranges of plants from many different areas of the world. It is an interesting presentation of flora from similar climates. There was also a stunning tulip display at the lower level of this Dome when we visited. A beautiful exhibit with interesting interactive displays. Loved these conservatories and the cool air is refreshing.
,,Lovely,5.0,,Easy to get to. I liked the gardens being separated into international location. There are some lovely wooden sculptures throughout as well.
,,Nice but small,3.0,,Node but small compared to cloud garden. Went at night so could not see that much but if you are into flowers it looks great
,,Stunning flowers,5.0,,The flower dome has the ability to display flowers from all over the world due to the climate control. We were lucky enough to see 'Tulip mania' which had just started. The displays are changed regularly. It is also great place to keep cool!
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"just relaxing, well priced away from the hustle of Singapore. Would visit again on return. Enjoyed by all the family"
,,For the flower lovers,4.0,,This Dome specializes with exhibits during different seasons with flowers from across the globe supported with audio equipment to learn about the displays. The arrangements are pleasing to the eyes that every photographer would want stay for as long as possible capturing the natural beauties.
,,Nice,3.0,,"A very nice visit, nice to have a brake in the heat. Average meal somewhat expensive but still worth the effort"
,,Beautiful Creation..,5.0,,"It's nice.. beautiful.. and for sure it's awesome!! Wondered how they could manage to build, plant and maintain this place. Really enjoy to see all the plants in Flower Dome especially the Tulip festival was really nice. If you visit Gardens by The Bay, you should enter this Flower Dome."
,,Amazing...,5.0,,Another must see in the Marina Bay Sands area. If you are interested in flowers or just want to see beauty this is a place for you.
,,just superb,4.0,,"what an atmosphere. amazing flower garden. flowers of different varities of different countries u will just love.there is rose , orchid section. a must for lover of nature."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We loved this dome - the roses were past their best but the other plants were fantastic - massive baobab trees, cacti, succulents as well as flowers. Even our teenaged sons enjoyed it!"
,,Not to be missed Tulipmania April 14 - May 4,5.0,,"Take a special photo with the tulip and upload to instagram to stand a chance to win prizes from KLM. Write your caption ""Fly me to Amsterdam with @KLM because _________."" and don't forget to hashtag #ilovetulipmania and tag 3 friends."
,,Nice,4.0,,A nice place to visit but not super impressive to me as most of the plants featured here are familiar in our Australian gardens. I don't like succulent plants much but the collection in this biodome is quite spectacular. I visited during the annual tulip display - the tulips and the hyacinths were lovely.
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"We got a combo ticket for Cloud Forest Dome and the Flower Dome and both are great places to visit. The flower dome is amazing in how many different plants and flowers it holds. It's a real educational journey just to walk through there and read about the various plants and where they are from, etc. Highly recommended. We went on a Monday afternoon which worked out well to avoid big crowds."
,,Breathtakingly Beautiful,5.0,,This dome consists of well laid out gardens . The flower variety is amazing . The dry cactus gardens too are breathtaking .This is a truly beautifull place
,,Nothing special,1.0,,"Nothing extraordinary about this place. Better avoiding this, as it is just good collection of flowers and trees. Nevertheless, can be seen once max"
,,Huge display of plants from all corners of the earth,4.0,,"As with the whole of the Gardens by the Bay complex, the Flower Dome is housed in a huge glass house, and beautifully laid out. Particularly fascinating is the collection of baobabs; next door are the succulents, which are also rather fine. On both occasions I visited, the central, topical display has been rather garish and tawdry, letting down the total effect."
,,Flowers under the dome,3.0,,"Little disappointed, there were many trees, palm trees, few flowers. Pleasant walk though, with spaces to sit down and relax"
,,Beautiful flowers!!,5.0,,Lots of flower from different parts of the world! Amazing landscaping!! Beautiful !! Non stop taking picture moment.
,,Pretty boring,3.0,,"Compared to the cloud dome, the flower dome was pretty boring stuff particularly, if you come from a tropical country. You would have seen most of the trees and plants in your own country"
,,Pretty amazing flowers and views.,5.0,,"When you are in the flower dome, you get to see lots of pretty flowers and a amazing skyline view of marina, pretty cool place."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,This is another paid area but again worth the money. Very well laid out gardens associated with different countries. Cactus garden at the top was particularly interesting.
,,Worldwide flowers,5.0,,"I loved all the different flowers from al different countries and how it constantly changes themes,coming up in July is Tulipania.There is even a cactus garden here"
,,so much more than a greenhouse,5.0,,"As we approached the domes we had no idea what we were going to see. The flower dome was our first call having paid to visit both this and the Cloud Dome. First impression..... its very cool and big and beautiful. There are desert areas, european gardens, english rose gardens and so many more. We spent just over an hour wandering around the various gardens and levels by which time we were craving some heat. We noticed that those in the know had shawls and light jumpers with them. There are seats to relax on and take in the sight of so many plants and surprise, surprise many of the plants are scented so they are not forced. It really is a garden lovers dream. My only criticism , I would like to have seen more plant labels telling me what the plants are."
,,Go to both domes,5.0,,Spend the $28 to view both domes. Allow lots of time to take photos and read the information. Take snacks as food is expensive and not lots of choice. Dont go to Cafe Crema for breakfast at all ... It's dreadful and an expensive waste of money
,,flowery flowers!!,4.0,,Flower lovers will eat smell and sleep flowers after visiting this dome..exceptionally beautiful.very informed in case people are not aware of flowers.. Visit during day light to enjoy to the fullest..
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,The Flower Dome houses a variety of plants from all over the world. It is well air-conditioned so you won't feel hot and humid inside even if it is very hot outside. Worth spending 1-2 hours having a close look at the plants.
,,garden by my side,5.0,,i could not believe if was really inside the flower valley so nicely desined and preserved for me. i could never forget the experience.
,,Flower blooms,5.0,,"The flower dome garden is a great place to visit, with plants from all over the world on display, and many themed areas. We truly enjoyed our visit here and would highly recommend a visit"
,,Feels like Im in Holland!,5.0,,"I love flowers, specially tulip. At the flower dome, I was able to see plants and flowers which are not grown in our country. The place smells heavenly . Be sure to have your camera's battery full when you enter the place. This is our last itinerary in SG.. sad to say we took pictures through our cellphones camera only."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,We travelled with our three young sons and they loved visiting the Garden Domes. It is definately something to cross off the 'To Do' list when in Singapore.
,,Extremely poorly maintained and overpriced.,1.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay are nice to walk through, but I would stay away from the overpriced domes. The Flower Dome was the worst of the two. There were very few labels on the plants and the plants were not in the best of shape. An extremely poor value for the money. We would not do this again."
,,Colourful and Joy,5.0,,Good collection of flowers exhibits and the occasional change of themes makes it worth a visit and always interesting. Always colourful and vibrant.
,,pollen - flower dome,5.0,,"a very pleasant, spiritual setting to have a philosophical question with your friends tip: try the food at the upper floor at pollen restaurant first!"
,,Good but not extraordinary prefer the Cloud Forest Dome,3.0,,This has vegetation inside a dome from Mediterranean climates around the world. Whilst it is interesting to look at and no doubt changes with the flower season it would only be a visit if you are not pressed for time
,,Impressive structure,3.0,,"Impressed with the structure and landscaping, but disappointed with the rather in appropriate Tudor theme."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"An impressive range of plants, from a variety of habitats, the succulents were my favourite. Not as impressive as the Cloud Forest Dome, so glad I did this first."
,,Lots of flowers and trees from all over the world,4.0,,"The boa trees, cactuses, palm trees, hibiscus, roses, etc. Nice place to relax. Visited during school holidays, so it slightly busy (and noisy). Best to visit during non peak period."
,,worth the visit along side the Cloud Forest,5.0,,Combine this with a visit to the Cloud Forest first - its calm and full of wonderful plants that have come from around the world. The building is a real piece of modern design and must be a real challenge to keep cool in the Singapore sun. Worth a couple of hours.
,,Another Environmental Friendly Creation,3.0,,This too is a nice place. But not that attractive like cloud forest. Plants grow in different climates were grown in a stimulated environment. Another creative product of Singapore.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing place, beautifully maintained and so well designed. We loved this atrium and all it has to showcase. Even an Australian garden as well. Very special to see people admiring the the kangaroo paw. The eagle wooden sculpture was awesome as we're many other throughout this garden. It was fresh, well designed and most of all easy for access and viewing. A credit to Singapore."
,,Flower Dome.,5.0,,If you do nothing else in Singapore visit the Domes. Forget Raffles and head for the Gardens. Wonderful.
,,A small version of world's plants,4.0,,"This dome has a small collection of several plants from different places of the world. They are divided by regions and you can walk around to find what kind of plants there are in south america, asia and so on. It has a good maintenance but the place is kind of cold due to the air conditioning system. Buy a combo ticket to see the cloud forest too because the tickets are not that cheap."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,If you like plants you will enjoy spending time in the flower dome. There are plantings from all major continents and there is bound to many plants flowering regardless of when you visit. The gardens are well looked after and include some beautiful ornaments and statues as well as the botanical plantings. The temperature inside the dome is also set to be cool temperate so its a great respite from the heat outside on a hot day.
,,marvel,5.0,,"The interior is awesome, done tastefully, attractive to all types of travellers.I thought of getting a souvenir, everything was ridiculously priced. View this place in the evening."
,,Worth the cost,4.0,,"Both this and the Cloud Forest displays are really great, and worthe the price of entry. Really spectacular displays of trees, plants, and flowers, very varied and lots of them, so don't miss it."
,,Special place,5.0,,Well worth visiting Gardens by the Bay....Singaporeans can be very proud of the huge time and effort made for such a stunning venue.
,,Many flowers,5.0,,"There are so many flowers in here, all are blooming and colorful. Because it's nearly Christmas, there were Christmas decoration (Christmas trees, Poinsettia, reindeer made from woods)"
,,Nice,4.0,,"I was here at night for a big function with dinner. The dinner was decent, great selection of desserts. However the pasta was not cooked long enough and there were many uncooked pieces of penne. Need to be careful about that especially since this was a international conference dinner. The gardens were very pretty at night, well lit enough to see the flowers but not the descriptions very well. Very beautiful selection of flora. Would like to see more 'fun facts' about the roses, and maybe for the other trees too."
,,Lovely collection of roses,4.0,,When we visited they were in the middle of a rose exhibition and they were lovely. Not as highly perfumed as I would have thought given the vast collection of roses on show. We liked this dome but preferred the cloud forest dome.
,,A great slice of make believe,5.0,,"Just like the neighbouring Cloud Forest Dome this place is a great way to witness just what human ingenuity can do. Separated from the outside world by what is in itself a very impressive dome this concise yet airy garden is a carefully choreographed colour explosion. Flower devotees, in fact keen gardeners of any hue, should really enjoy this place with its tiers of displays. And it's not all softness of being - there is a section of cactus style plants in one area of this dome that makes for an interesting diversion too.

Excellent when combined with the equally fascinating Cloud Dome."
,,"Flowers, flowers, flowers!",5.0,,"Beautiful! They currently have a theme for roses so it was great to see all kinds of roses and smell them. Very nice indeed!
The dome is not extremely big, but it has a big variety of plants and flowers from across the globe, it was interesting to walk around, smell and see them!"
,,amazing,5.0,,"wow- see it, you wont be disappointed. Modern ideas at there finest & the variety of plants & flowers is astounding."
,,lovely,5.0,,Not what i expected but definitely worth the visit after a walk in the park. Also visit the other dome too.
,,Amazing,5.0,,We visited the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Beautiful environment with lots of flowers and trees from several countries. The Flower Dome is build around a big waterfall around you can walk on skyway and visit some dedicated theme areas. You also see a small exepition about endangered environment and global warming.
,,Sadly not enough time,5.0,,"Spent an enjoyable hour here but had to rush through as we were leaving Singapore that day. However, I can say it was beautifully presented and luckily very quiet on that day so got to appreciate the different areas very well. It is not unlike The Eden Project in Cornwall UK. Would recommend and even though there's a small fee S $16 each the Gardens By The Bay are free so well worth a visit."
,,surprise show,5.0,,the evening light and sound show was a treat. Must not miss. A great place for families to wander especially with children.
,,Must See,5.0,,This is a Must See when visiting Singapore. They've done an amazing job keeping it beautiful. Bring your camera! We went just before sunset and got amazing photos with many different lighting.
,,"If you like flowers, the environment, anything then go here!",5.0,,Combine with a trip to Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest. Really nice design and displays (sometimes thematic). Very refreshing on a hot day and I imagine refreshing on a cool or rainy day.
,,Great,5.0,,The flower dome and cloud forest are adjacent and the tickets if bought together come at a discount.
,,Must see!,5.0,,"See my earlier review.
Great day out and very interesting with all kinds of flora and fauna including some very rare plants from around the world.
The whole dome is temperature controlled so a welcome escape from the hot and humid air outside!
Set in beautiful gardens."
,,Good For Flower Lovers Only,3.0,,"If you are planning to visit Gardens by the bay and you are a flower lover or you have extra money , then only opt for this attraction . other wise buy the ticket for Cloud forest attraction only. which you will find a far better experience then it."
,,"If u love nature,gardening,flowers or photography,u should visit this place",5.0,,"It had still decorations from Chinease New Year which made this place full of celebration spirit and more colorful!There are flowers,plants and trees from around the world:olive trees and simply camamiles adjoin with orchids and baobabs.Nice place to chill after hot SG's weather!"
,,Flower Power,5.0,,"a nice exhibit and very impressive structure, but no Longwood Gardens....a lot of flora from desert regions...which I guess in a rainforest country is interesting...."
,,Impressive Garden,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is one of the two conservatories in Gardens by the Bay. Take this tour first before going to the Cloud Dome. The entire place is impressive in exhibiting the varying flora found in different regions. I took the recorded audio tour and was able to learn more about the plant life in it, some imported from their location and brought to the dome. The place also features plant exhibits for a certain period. During my visit they had the War of the Roses, which showed an impressive arrangement of roses. It felt like going through a fairy tale exhibit. I have little knowledge on plant life, but I enjoyed exploring this greenhouse and seeing the various flora and fauna."
,,Roses galore,5.0,,The colors of all kinds of flowers were so dazzling and the ornamental plants so refreshing. It may be sunny and bright outside but the coolness in the dome was so good. The wheelchair service was free and served such good purpose. This is a must see attraction in Singapore indeed.
,,Cool Greenhouse!,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is one of the two paid Conservatories (the other being Cloud Forest Dome). We headed in and enjoyed the cool climate as compared to heat outside. This Conservatory replicates the cool dry climate as Mediterranean such as South Africa and South America/ South Australia.

I am impressed by the cooling mechanism by putting chilled water pipes in ground slabs and ventilation of warm air through the open windows at the top. It was still the CNY mood with displays of wooden horses at the front of the entrance. We headed up to the baobab, working down to the plants of South America, South Australia region and then to the bottom with colourful flowers such as daisies, hibiscus, roses and much more.

Stroller friendly and toilets with baby changing area cum nursing room are available inside the Conservatory"
,,Impressive display of Plants,3.0,,The temperature of the dome was too cold for comfortable viewing. I'm surprised that the desert plants are surviving in this temperature. Some of the other plants don't seem coping with the controlled environment as it seemed the same everywhere throughout the dome. Having said that it's worth visiting even if the price seemed expensive.
,,Variety and spectacle,4.0,,Stunned by the desert displays from start to finish this dome has something to offer the garden lover. Mini gardens from around the world can be explored as you follow the pathway. Flowers dominate the final parts of the walk whilst the start is categorised by regions. A great place to cool off and spend a couple of wandering hours on a hot day.
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"The flower dome is a huge hall with numerous kinds of flowers and trees from all around the world. It is absolutely lovely. Don't miss this one, it is definitely the number ONE attraction in Singapore."
,,Go and smell the roses.,4.0,,"There is a special exhibit ""War of the Roses"" currently in the Flower Dome. The blooms are amazing and all so colourful. Take the time to wander through the other gardens and escape from the Singapore heat."
,,Wonderful gardens,4.0,,"The botanical gardens in Singapore are just outstanding. This is well worth a visit, especially if you live flowers. It is also a great view of the city."
,,Worth a look,3.0,,"Funny how you can be sweating outside in the sun, then come into a glass dome and its cool and serene. Very interesting array of plants and trees."
,,Plants from all the world,4.0,,"Nice atmosphere but price is too high. However, I can imagine their costs! This is Singapore, calm down."
,,Relatively nothing special,3.0,,"Nothing special, just a bit conservatory with some strange statues if I am honest. They put some statues of fish in the dessert and some manequis in the rose garden. They look pretty sily. Some people step on the plants to take pictures despite all the signs informing against it. The baobabs are pretty impressive but overall it is nothing special if you have visited other big conservatories in the world."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is a beautiful exhibition of plants from around the world and it very pleasant to walk around in this very cool environment - a relief from the heat.
,,Sister to the Cloud Forest Dome,5.0,,"Be sure to visit the Flower Dome when you visit the Cloud Forest Dome. There is such beauty at each step, a true testimony to those who work every day to bring this beauty to us. It's moving to walk through with so many people, and realize the enjoyment that this structure and its zillions of flowers bring to each of us."
,,Flower Dome Display during CNY,4.0,,"Best time to go to the Flower Dome is during Festive Periods where there will be special One Off Displays. During that time, you will see more varieties of flowers as well as very beautiful displays and since the price does not increase, it is more worth it to go during these periods."
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to be here for Chinese New Year and the place had some many interesting things to look at.

It is a fantastic experience and well worth the visit. There is so much to see and take pictures of, you'll need an empty memory card with all the shots you'll take.

A great explosion of colours, and smells ready to please your senses."
,,What a fantastic experence,5.0,,"If you go to singapore don't miss this dome it is mind blowing thousands of flowers and plant, and the great thing is that the huge dome is fully a.c you will just enjoy"
,,Loved it,5.0,,"If you are into plants and flowers, sculptures etc, well worth the price of the ticket ($28 for this and the Cloud Forest together). It is a huge place and the fact that it was Chinese New Year, just meant there was even more to see. Loved it."
,,"All the colours of the rainbow, and then some...",5.0,,"The whole of this new Gardens by the Bay development, is well worth the entrance fee, and excellent value for money. The Flower dome itself is a riot of colour and a photographers dream."
,,Colorful!,4.0,,Beautiful plants and flowers from different ecosystems around the world. They even had a California garden. This dome is better to visit when it is still light outside
,,Visit five continents under one dome...,5.0,,"This was such a cool experience. I was honestly shocked... I did not think it would be so impressive and informative. Besides all of the unique plants and flowers, there are art exhibits set up throughout the space. They also have themed exhibits going on, so check the schedule. Currently ""War of the Roses"" is installed.

Also, you can enjoy an impressive meal at Pollen, which is discreetly tucked in the same building. Ask to meet the pastry chef, who is from California. She bakes with lot's of love and creativity!"
,,Beautifully laid out.,5.0,,Having been to the Cloud Forest dome - which has to be first on the list - this is well worth a visit also. Riot of colours and very peaceful. Again don't forget the camera !
,,Great if you like flowers,5.0,,What a pleasant surprise this was. I really enjoyed the walk around the dome. The flowers are lovely from different climates around the world. Its tranquil and cool. Well worth the money. I should imagined that it will only get better over time.
,,Stunning,5.0,,As with the Cloud dome the architecture and range of flora is ace. Dad and I found it funny as our family are from Lancashire and Yorkshire and the display when we arrived was the 'War of the Roses' lol. Recommended but with a slightly less wow factor than the Cloud Forest.
,,Go during day time,4.0,,"Looks much better during day time visit. Interesting place for those who love nature/flowers, wide variety, almost picture perfect. Good to spend an hour here."
,,Desert Views,5.0,,A good section of this exhibit is dedicated to desert themes boabs and Aussie bush plants some Euro and English gardens great succulents
,,Impressive display,5.0,,I really liked the way the gardens had been laid out and especially the wooden horses they had set up for the Chinese Year of the Horse. Very well done all up.
,,Cool and airy,4.0,,"This dome is cool and airy and full of plants from the more temperate climates. There are some baobab trees and many other plants, but no English Garden(!)."
,,Beautiful and tranquil,4.0,,Had a lovely time roaming through the flower dome - the international flower arrangements were amazing! Would return - basically the best orchard ever!
,,"""Magnificent""!",5.0,,My wife persuaded me to visit the flower dome and initially I was not keen - what a mistake that would have been not to go. It was brilliant!!!
,,"Air conditioned dome, great plant exhibit",5.0,,"OK, this was a great. I reviewed it under Gardens by the Bay, but thinking particularly about this dome. My wife loved it and I found it interesting, well done."
,,Magnificent place!,5.0,,"Spent a few hours in the flower dome and loved every minute of it. Lots of thnigs to see, great environment. Good that there were a number of seats to rest and take in the sights. Only minor complaint is that non-residents of Singapore have to pay more to get in! Not used to paying different prices as tourists"
,,Only Singapore could do this,5.0,,"The Flower Dome and Rainforest Dome are really amazing, the flower Dome was incredible, how fully established old trees have been transported from their home country and grown to perfection is incredible add to these trees a wonderful array of flowers from around the world makes the dome magical. The Rain Forest Dome has huge waterfalls, rain forest plants and trees from around the world, you take the lift to the top and amble down the walkways in amazement. Not to be missed. I would suggest you book on line to save queuing."
,,Good for a one time visit !!,3.0,,Not as good as the cloud forest dome but good for going around. Not much variety of flowers as expected but the one's displayed offered a pretty sight.Did not find anything interesting at the top floors but level 1 has a good and colorful variety of flowers.Not worth the money but good for a on time visit !!!
,,wonderland,5.0,,"Stepping into the flower dome was stepping into a wonderland of flowers, exotic plants and absolutely beautiful garden beds. The clusters of orchids were fantastic. The sculptures in between were in recognition of the Chinese Year of the Horse and were also cleverly constructed. If you love any sort of flora, this is a must see stop in Singapore."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"If you want to see the biggest, most beautiful flowers you have ever seen, do not miss Flower Dome. Connected to the Rainforest Dome and located in the Garden by the Bay ( which just opened a cool children's section)."
,,OK but it could be so much better,3.0,,Having been to the cloud dome we were expecting great things from the flower dome - but came away feeling a little disappointed. Not to the standard of the Eden Project in the UK.
,,Great!!!,5.0,,"I run out of words to describe the flowers, they're just really awesome....... the cacti variety...... so beautiful, felt like we're in a different world...... the wooden horses, i loved it......"
,,Must see,5.0,,Missed this on our first trip to Singapore and so glad we did not make this mistake again. Singapore do their attractions so well and this is no exception. Dont miss it for sure.
,,Wow what a place to visit!,5.0,,"Plan to spend time here as there is so much to see, a whole world of plants to make you swoon...then take time to have lunch at Pollen, right in this Dome...a perfect ending to this visit."
,,The best of the 2.,5.0,,"I went to both domes and this is the best. Maybe leave this one for last on your visit, as you have to buy the tickets for both. The Baobab trees are the highlight. I was lucky to see it decorated for the Chinese NY and it was stunning."
,,A bit boring,3.0,,I went to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The Cloud forest was quite nice to see. Beautiful plants. Really enjoyed it. Of course not too thrilling but nice to visit. As for the flower dome: I spent 10 minutes inside and then went out because it was so extremely boring. Also not impressed by the flowers and plants.
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,This place is just absolutely beautiful. Ye be warned with those who have allergies. Take your Allegra or don't go. Pollen very strong. However it was totally worth all the beautiful pictures I took. Definitely a family place. Would recommend !!!
,,Worth the price,5.0,,"I love conservatories, but I wasn't sure I wanted to pay this much to get in. Don't worry -- it's totally worth it. There's a ton to see, and the permanent exhibits are quite different from those I've seen in other botanical gardens. It's not just flowers; you'll see all kinds of flora including mature trees of many kinds anchor the displays.

The desert features were my favorite. Lots of absolutely amazing succulents from around the world. I go to a lot of gardens, and this dome featured many plants I'd never encountered before. Don't miss it!"
,,Incredibly awesome,5.0,,"This dome is in Gardens By The Bay. Consider buying a package of two tickets (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest Dome) to save you money. Inside the dome, you can see lots of flowers around the globe."
,,Very nice,4.0,,"Here you can see not only flowers, but also very large trees from various parts of the world. The interior layout and experience might not be quite as original as the cloud forest dome but it is still interesting to see all the species in here."
,,Garden Dome,5.0,,The section showing Western Australian native tress and plants I thought was exceptionally well done. Could not fault the rest of the display either. The model horses were very interesting. Probably could have done with some further watering - some of the plants were looking a bit sad on our second visit.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Singapore is truly the worlds leaders in inovation for displaying an amazing array of plants and flowers in creative shows that allow us to see intricate details of each one. In harmony with each other, the displays in the Flower Dome are spectacular."
,,Like a Giant Flora Nursery,3.0,,Visited these during Chinese new Year so it was very colourful with a lot of pretty flowers but it also gave an impression of being in a giant flora nursery housed in a giant dome. Impressive was the extensive range of cactus and bonsai plants. Other than that... Restaurant Pollen is also inside here.
,,nice,4.0,,"The building is very impressive and the flowers are beautiful, but it reminding other botanical gardens, just smaller."
,,worth a look,5.0,,We visited here on a rainy day and it didn't matter because we were inside. The plants inside were lovely and they had a nice Christmas display too. There were lots of different fruits and vegetables growing. It was a good visit.
,,Not just for nature lovers...a must go attraction,5.0,,This is part of the amazing Gardens by the Bay.....it is a photographers ' paradise.....very impressive tourist attraction.
,,Don't miss,5.0,,"Whole Gardens by the Bay area is simply amazing and good location too, behind famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel and MRT station nearby. Even though you don't understand anything about plants/flowers, you still find this place interesting and really beautiful."
,,Flower Dome,5.0,,My wife and I spent half the morning here walking around. The temperature is perfect and no rain. Very interesting and relaxing.
,,Amazing Experience at Flower Dome,5.0,,"there's another excelent park, flower dome is very beautiful and my Kids very enjoy the view, the ant to go back in the next day :)"
,,A colorful display that won't disappoint!,4.0,,The layout of the flower dome was very well thought out and allowed you to move at your own pace! Plant varieties from all over the world could be found here! We thoroughly enjoyed the baobab trees as we had never seen them before. Don't miss this attraction!
,,Flowers from all over the world,5.0,,"Another surprise in Singapore. The dome has flowers, plants and trees from all over the world. Wonderful presented."
,,A riot of colour,4.0,,"This is a riot of colour with spectacular orchids and other gorgeous plants. Beautiful, but nothing different to other gardens. Worth a visit but prefered the cloud dome"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a must do when in Singapore, I would go back and do it again. Gorgeous place to visit. Great views of the marina bay sands."
,,Worth seeing but not spectacular,3.0,,"The pros are that the dome itself is architecturally lovely. The air inside is beautiful and cool which is nice on a hot, humid day in Singapore.
The setup is good, with the plants divided into areas to represent different geographic regions. Interesting conservation information also.
I didn't give a better score because it was just interesting, it wasn't amazing. I'm glad I saw it but I felt it was somewhat lacking. Maybe because you're walking around in concrete paths looking at plants that are surrounded by walls, rather than appreciating them or being in amongst them. It just didn't thrill me wandering around looking at that many plants.
For real plant lovers though, or people from very different climates to those represented here, it would probably be better."
,,Ok if you don't often get to see flowers,3.0,,For us it wasn't worth the visit because most of the flowers we have in the gardens around us at home anyway.
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Just loved this place. The various gardens were well designed, looked great, the colours were beautiful and the decorations for Chinese New Year were fabulous. Don't miss it"
,,Beautiful Setting for Photography,4.0,,It was a beautiful sight to see. I was thrilled to see cherry blossoms in bloom for the first time in my life. The place was decorated for the lunar new year and was a lovely space for seeing the many blossoms and inhaling their sweet perfume. It has been designed with the click-happy traveller in mind and there was a bridal couple making ample use of the lovely backdrop when we visited.
,,Simply Beautiful,5.0,,"This dome is as good as the other one (Cloud Forest). Just pay, come in and enjoy the stunning view inside, not to mention the cool air inside!"
,,Perhaps overpriced.,4.0,,"What a flower dome! probably one of the biggest-sized indoor flower gardens I've ever been to. I enjoyed the experience. The indoor temperature was perfect, too. But Am I the only one who thinks it's overpriced? I'm aware of the fact that the huge amount of $ are needed to manage the dome under control but still the collection of flowers were not that various."
,,I expected it to be better,3.0,,"For such a big complex, I expected to see more inside the dome. Its the Chinese New Year season now so there are a wide array of ""spring"" plants, fruits (including kumquats) and flowers on display. The temperature inside the dome is just cool and nice and one does not get tired easily."
,,Flower Pleasure,5.0,,Located in the Gardens By the Bay like the indoor cloud forest this is also indoor with a huge dome providing sun light to the flora from world over. Not to be missed.
,,"Biotops of different earth zones, very educational and worth of visit",5.0,,"A great natural experience. You can observe different biotops of earth zones, how the nature is diversified and how the climate and geographical location influent the existance of certain biotops in different parts of the world. Together with the visit of cloud dome and Gardens by the bay it is a must see in Singapore."
,,Just wonderful,5.0,,We paid the extra money to visit this dome at Gardens by the Bay and it was well worth it. So well constructed and the plants were spectacular. Certainly highly recommended.
,,Another Gardens stunning attraction,4.0,,"This is one of the two domes at Gardens. Firstly, it's a welcome retreat from the heat from walking outside. Definitely recommend you begin outside before you come into the two domes. This is truly a wonder in architecture and the floral displays, which they do rotate according to the season and/or holidays. A few levels which wrap around, and you can go in either direction. Definitely a must see if you are going to Gardens. But I do give cloud forrest dome a bit higher grade just because I found it a tad more interesting, but since they are right next to each other, you need to / should do both. Enjoy!"
,,Not a patch on Cloud Forest,3.0,,"Unless you are a real green fingers kind of person, this garden can be done pretty quickly. It's lovely, cleverly set out and shows a lot of plants from different regions, a very relaxing place to visit but doesn't have the wow factor of Cloud Forest so if you only have time for one of the two attractions you can give this one a miss."
,,was expecting more flowers,3.0,,"It's not that this dome is bad but it suffers from comparison with the cloud forest dome, which was so good. This is more like a really nice garden, good for a stroll and the boababs are cool. Surprisingly there were not many actual flowers which was a bit of a let-down.
Unlike the cloud forest dome the walk is not 'structured', so you can wander around in any order you like. So i's a bit better for kids to run around."
,,Wonderful garden,5.0,,"This magnificent glass domed building houses plants, trees & flowers from many regions of the world and is part of the Gardens on the Bay experience. Separate entrance fee required. Once inside it is very easy to walk around and each section is specifically designed to show off a particular type of plant. Great to see a line of the very odd baobab trees. In all of this there are some great ""garden accessories"" including a wonderful set of wooden horses. The miniature gardens behind the glass are delightful. Take a minute to look out through the glass for a magnificent view of the city"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing amazing amazing Enjoyed walking around. Was just beautiful and breathtaking. Best attraction I enjoyed when visiting singapore. We went on a Sunday. NO queues despite what tourist agent said.
,,Amazing Flora,5.0,,"Wow, this place is amazing. We were blown away by the different varieties of trees, shrubs and flowers from all over the world. The Flower Dome was well laid out, clean, no sign of insects and air conditioned so walking around was relaxing.

Definitely make this attraction a must!"
,,Not too many rare flowers,4.0,,Many of the flowers and plants were what we could always see. Nothing that special! I liked the way that the area was separated into different gardens of the world.
,,Disappointing,3.0,,I expected this one to be better than the Cloud Forest Dome because it says flowers but I enjoyed the other much more and I think it had more flowers in it as well. I would like to see more actual flowers in this one so it can live up to its name.
,,Pretty place to enjoy,4.0,,"This is a place for people who likes plants! Ya, there's a lot of different species of plants in there. And it somehow is a bit boring. I don't know how to say. We just took a few photos and yeah, that's it. Nothing much.. Preferred something from Next door~ The Cloud Forest."
,,Love this place,5.0,,"My family and I have visited the flower dome many times. Even when it gets busy, we always find it a beautiful place to relax and enjoy."
,,Singapore day out,4.0,,Like other recent reviews of both the Flower and Cloud domes the latter is very much more dramatic. Seeing this one first would be recommended if you do visit both as if you do go to the cloud dome first this one lacks the wow factor which is certainly found in the other. It is probably much more interesting to visitors who are not from Europe. Many of the flowers seen in the dome would be classed as normal garden types in the UK for example. Those of us who have been to the Eden Project in Conrnwall would probably also prefer that to the Flower Dome. But it is good for a kids day out.
,,Excellent Floral Displays,5.0,,"Great layout with flowers, vegetables and trees in separate areas.
Well worth a visit to the Gardens by the Bay.
Air-conditioned oasis is a nice relief from the normal Singapore climate.
Seating is available in many locations. Cafe is onsite.
Remember your Singapore Airlines Boarding Pass is worth a discount.
Never visit without your camera.
Taxis can drop you off at entrance. Shuttles operate within the gardens.
Easy walk from Marina Bay Sands complex and local MRT stations.
Flower displays change during the seasons of the year and special events.
Will visit again."
,,Flowery!,4.0,,Spent a day here with my aunt and we both loved the flowers and fauna. Just a lovely and well planned out space with nature at every turn.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Visited this place with so many unknown flowers & plants from the rest of the world makes you wonder are you in foreign countries .... !!! You need not travel to those countries to see all those beautiful flowers & plants cos in this place you see all .....
,,preferred the cloud dome,4.0,,"the two buildings are fascinating and worth seeing, but to be honest i thought that the cloud dome was more dramatic, and far more interesting. I would definitely do both though so you see the difference between the two eco environments. Its fantastically educational for kids."
,,really nice,4.0,,"This was beautiful inside with lots of plants and flowers and vegetables growing, looked really nice and worth a visit"
,,Get in Early,5.0,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay and visited both the Flower Dome, OSBC Sky walk and the Cloud Dome. Well woth the visit.

However, the tranquility of the Flower dome was broken by tribes of screaming kids (it's not that I mind screaming kids - its when the parents are not taking control of them - thats what annoys me.

During peak times (especially Sunday) the ticket queue can be quite long. So we pre-booked our tickets for both domes. However, the skywalk does not take pre-bookings, so I'd go early to avoid the queue (as they limit to 50 people on the walk at any one time).

Well worth the visit and one I will be going back to next time I am in town."
,,A leisurely stroll to see different flora from across the world,4.0,,"Entry to the Flower Dome is included when you purchase a ticket for the Cloud Dome. I enjoyed the walk through the different regions of the world and the specific flora associated with each of them.

I wouldn't do this again, whereas I would do the Cloud Dome again."
,,"Flowers, flowers, flowers everywhere",4.0,,"Well, for flowers lovers or botanists, this place will be a haven. Plants, trees, flowers from all over the world can be found here. It's like visiting the whole world's nature in one dome. Great place to hang out for a daY!"
,,Good collection of Flora,4.0,,"The place itself is airconditioned, it has a wide array of plants. Different colorful designs, well maintained and relaxing place. Its a nice place to chill out and cool off from the hot weather"
,,Un-compareable to the Cloud Forest,3.0,,"Although this was a lovely dome (gardens were well-maintained and the flowers etc were beautiful and from a lot of different places), it was completely un-compareable to Cloud Forest!"
,,Lovely displays - Too many blocking walkway,3.0,,Can't be helped but way too many folks blocking walkways taking people pictures. Expected everyone else to wait. Creative layouts - especially the Christmas themes. Live Floral assembly display had woman directing audience when to applaud - kinda weird and left it feeling fake.
,,Totally enjoyed the dome,5.0,,"Very well done. Beautiful setting, relaxing atmosphere, very interesting plants, and well thought out. I would recommend going here and also the cloud forest."
,,Flower power!,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the Bay and well worth visiting. As it is air conditioned and there are places to sit, it's a good place to relax after the humidity of the cloud forest dome. There was a Christmas theme when we visited with magnificent displays of poinsettia. It was particularly interesting to see fruit and vegetables growing and integrated into the gardens. There was an amazing selection of flowering plants which apparently changes frequently and amongst the many attractions are baobab trees in the dry Mediterranean part.
Entrance to both domes is SGD 28 ( not sure if you can buy a ticket just for one dome) and it is worth noting that tickets can be bought online which can save a considerable time as the queues for tickets can be quite long. Take a camera and you will soon be snapping away!"
,,Feast for eyes,3.0,,The colors are spectacular but thats about it. The flowers do look quite artificial. A few looked like a mix of real flowers and check look alikes! Not worth for the entry price!
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,The flower dome is beautiful. Loved the different sections with plants from different countries. Being air conditioned is a bonus as well to get out of the heat.
,,nothing special,3.0,,I was a bit bored by the flower dome and only went in here because my ticket allowed me to. if you dine in the Pollen restaurant you get free entry to the flower dome so if you don't fancy the cloud dome and want dinner too then it's a good idea.
,,Buffet for your eyes and nose,5.0,,"We are staying at the Porcelain hotel and they sell tickets to the Flower Dome/Cloud Forest for $3 discount. It's seriously like an amusement park of flowers. So $25 per person for the two places. And buy the separately sold tickets for the SuperTree! Take the lift up one ""tree"" and walk on the catwalk over to the super tree across the way. Great way to see the city!"
,,Well organised and beautiful,5.0,,"Nice cool environment with many spices of flowers on display. A feast for the eyes, a must visit for flowers lovers."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"This place about all the plants you could even imagine to see in your life, the cactus and the burnt trees that can grow in Australia. The flowers are just beautiful. It is universal, and the place is temperature controlled to give the flowers the longest life. Visit during the Deepavali period, you will see Indian themes. The extras are situated at the center of the gardens. when you have seen all, walk towards the Cloud Forest for another round of exotic plants sighting."
,,Wonderland for flower lovers in air-conditioned comfort.,4.0,,"Great varieties of flowers. It was like a wonderland for those who enjoy flowers. Most importantly, the air-con in the area means you get to really enjoy yourself without any care for the weather outside. there are benches to sit on, so you can lounge about, have a rest and or have your pictures taken with friends. The waterfall is pretty and breath taking, albeit man made.

No food/ drinks allowed inside the flower dome.
Value for my money, perfect for people of all ages."
,,Christmassy,5.0,,"A beautiful piece of the Bay Redevelopment, it is a gem. Full of tomatoes red peppers and other garden fruits when we visited. Stunning flowers everywhere with different themes, such as Mediterraine. Must visit!"
,,Christmas theme,4.0,,We had visited during Christmas period and enjoyed the Christmas themed flower garden. The other displays stay the same but the main area changes during the year.
,,Very good,4.0,,Had a good experience here. Although a little pricey but this is well maintained. The flowers and all the plants were good.
,,Breath Taking!,5.0,,The cool temps make this an sanctuary from the humidity and heat outdoors! The gardens are divine! Very well planned & maintained! The technology is impressive… truly a must see!
,,Quick loop,4.0,,"When you visit gardens by the bay as a tourist, your only option is a ticket for both the flower dome and the cloud forest. I went to the cloud forest first which I found to be far more interesting and interactive. This was still beautiful in its own way, but there was less to see and we were in and out in half an hour. Parts of it were a little redundant after having been to the cloud forest, so that may account for my lack of awe."
,,We're exotic....,3.0,,"The flower dome is a very nice, organized and well kept space. Seen with the eyes of a European, it looks a bit odd that all our ""normal"" plants and flowers are the ""exotic exhibition"" of the flower doom... And so I met the olive trees, so familiar to me and surrounded of Asian people enthusiastic at seeing such a strange tree... It's an interesting change of perspective... What is ""ordinary""?"
,,Totally worth,5.0,,"I've been in the Flower Dome after I read all the good reviews on TripAdvisor. It's really astonishing to see so many flowers.

I payed around 30S$ for the flower doom and the one with many clouds. It's a good price and most important the air inside is wonderful."
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"Flowers, cactus, fruit trees, plants are all you can see in this huge garden. This is a good place to visit during afternoon since it's air-conditioned."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Wow, well worth the experience, Singapore have done themselves proud once again. A beautifully inteligentely laid out attraction , great place for photo opportunities."
,,Baobabs and Cacti,5.0,,"More succulents than flowers, but magical. In the center was a sort of hobbits garden! Loved it! Part of gardens by the bay."
,,was not able to see much flower,4.0,,was not able to see much flower but enjoyed the nature feel. dont visit on mon/tue as this is closed for maintenace
,,Beautiful site,5.0,,"These domes feature flora from around the world. Everything is perfectly manicured and the topography is impressive. They also keep it very well air conditioned, so if you have been walking around in the heat, they are a great way to cool down."
,,Charge up your camera battery!,5.0,,"see my other review about Gardens in the Bay for details. I just loved the Floral Dome and took more than 50 photos!! Features like the Indian elephants, balloons and sculptures meant we were there for over an hour. Just wonderful!"
,,Rainbow at the Dome,5.0,,Indulge in a cool stroll at the lovely dome filled with colourful and sweet smelling flowers. Its easy to forget about the time as you are immersed in the beautiful sight. Just let down your hair and enjoy your presence at the big garden!
,,Colorful,5.0,,My mom visited singapore in August 2012 and she wanted to see the newest attraction. She enjoyed the varieties of flower as much as i did. It was so beautiful. It is our first to see an attraction like this.
,,Loved it,5.0,,We visited the Flower Dome with family and friends late on a friday afternoon. It was so refreshingly cool and we could smell the beautiful gardens before even entering. There are walkways that you can take to view plants and flowers from all around the world. The current Christmas display was wonderful and the kids loved it. We easily pushed a rented ($2) stroller around and went at our own pace. It wasn't crowded but very peaceful and beautiful. We probably spent 1 hour here.
,,A Rip Off,2.0,,"I was assured upon entry ($16.00) that I would see wonderous flowers from all corners of the world.
I actually saw no more in variety than I can find in all corners of mine and the neighbours gardens here in NZ.
Very disappointing - although I must say it was laid out most attractively."
,,One of the modern wonders of the world,5.0,,Breathtaking is the only way to describe the Gardens by the Bay. The flower house is enormous. I have never seen anything undercover as lovely as this. It rivals Buchart Gardens in Victoria Vancouver Island. The Christmas theme was evident throughout the pavilion nothing was out of place. Pristine is the only word to describe the whole pavilion. It is worth taking the golf buggy tour before entering the pavilion just to experience the size of the pavilions. This is an experience NOT TO BE MISSED.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Do yourself a favour and visit gardens by the bay. Our expectations were blow away with the attention to detail and again the cleanliness, customer service and it's air conditioned!"
,,""" UNFORGETTABLE "" Don't miss it!!!!!!!",5.0,,Well what can I say other then I was blown away. Very beautiful place full of the most awe inspiring gardens not to be missed. No matter the weather you can visit the aircon is very cool and refreshing no wonder the plants are happy. They change the displays throughout the year so it worth going no matter what. There is plenty of seating throughout the dome to sit and relax and marvel at this amazing engineering feat. The photos we took are amazing pro quality. We spent 3 hrs in this dome alone so allow plenty of time and we did a dome a day.
,,A great experience!,5.0,,How neat is this place. Everything from African Baobab trees to ornate flower gardens. The vegetation comes from all over the world with special areas for each region. Don't miss the artworks and statues placed throughout the beds; every bit as interesting as the flora.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Its really big, there are many sections from different weathers, and they were all cool. I don't really know how they do it, but the whole dome is cold, which was relaxing, and still the plants could live there.
Im not a flowers or plants lover. I didn't want to go there, but my friends did, so i went with them. And i actually enjoyed it, i cant imagine how a flower lover would have loved it."
,,You can't leave without that curve on your face or heart. Promise!,4.0,,"+
You have the 4 seasons here so you need to make a comeback 4 times. And I wouldn't mind doing that as it was a fantastic, entertaining and educational experience.
The colorful flowers made me smile; the 500 year old olive trees caused me to wonder (It takes 30-35 years for this tree to bear fruits.); and the drunken trees from Argentina tickled my funny bone! :)

As I remember, I saw golden ager people on wheelchair visiting the place and that's just great as it does not stop anyone from going there and enjoying it. There's even an elevator, too. If you feel very cold, a cup of coffee at the coffee shop inside will surely change your temp.

If you're visiting this place and most specially the whole Gardens by the Bay, better wear flats and forget not your camera and shawl/blazer as it can get very cold inside the Flower Dome. For the whole Gardens by the Bay, you need a whole day or two. For the Flower Dome, one to two hours is enough.

-
There were some spaces where they could put some more species of flowers/plants.
We kept seeing a few species of flowers a couple of time.
A few huge artificial flower/s were on display, I guess for picture taking. Wouldn't it be nice to just have natural flowers?

My husband likes more the National Orchid Garden but all in all, the place is one of the best. Take a visit and you'll understand why. :)"
,,Absolutely Amazing,5.0,,"This has to be seen to be believed. the whole concept is amazing. This is the place to relax and just enjoy the gardens, the colours and the whole environment. Well worth a visit ...or two!!!!"
,,Beautiful flowers that changes seasonally,4.0,,"THis is a lovely place as it is indoor and air-conditioned! :)
The floral display changes according to themes. For example: Christmas, Easter, Autumn, Deepavali and so on. Worth re-visiting as the displays are lovely.
The Flower Dome, also contains different species of plants from around the world, from desert climates to tropical climates.
There is a little cafe inside the dome if you are hungry."
,,Heaven of Flora,5.0,,"it's a good place for a family outing, and a good place for knowledge and experience. there has been an effort accumulating flowers from all over d globe and central it here. the ticket price for two conservatories(flower dome+cloud forest) is $28 for foreigners. it really opened my eyes to a new world of bio creatures, additionally i'm a sentimental person who loves flowers. the flowers were very well nurtured n cared n most of the plants in it are rare species. recommended to go there in May, the month of earth and everything flower starts to bloom full fledge. unfortunately, i went there during dec and they had exotic christmas deco n plants with red leaves that so rare. they imported so many out of the ordinary plants that r never seen on tv! d management dress the gardens according to the season. if ur going there during christmas season(nov. & dec), when u r buying tickets at d booth located in between the cloud forest dome n flower dome, do go n smell d pine tree (it is real)"
,,Nature lovers paradise,5.0,,"The huge dome is air-conditioned. Flowers, plants and trees from different parts of the world are found there. There are plants and trees and cactus from the arid and harsh climate. Flowers from different regions of the world are arranged and organised at different parts of the dome. You will not be disappointed by this visit. Do not forget to bring your camera and make sure the battery is fully charged."
,,awesome dome,5.0,,"Flower Dome is like a flower heaven. Must see in Singapore. The dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like South Africa, California and parts of Spain and Italy. Home to a collection of plants from deserts all over the world, it showcases the adaptations of plants to arid environments."
,,30 minutes spent here & u get memories that last a lifetime!,5.0,,"this place is purpose-built & when Singapore's first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew dreams about having a gardens located in the city centre, similar to ""Central Park"" in New York, rest assured that the best design team will be assigned to create this architectural monument.

Not just pleasant looking from the outside, we are talking about a building that is functional to add natural greenery to Singapore's harsh urban landscape.

Even a short visit here will enlighten you on the many efforts Singapore makes to ensure that the people here interact with Mother Nature in a eco-friendly way."
,,Expected more flowers,3.0,,"Dome impressive, but expected more flowers, maybe because still quite new facility. Cloud dome was better of 2 domes."
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,"No matter what part of the world you are from, you will find a little taste of home in this magnificent dome. And typically, you will feel like heading back to your own garden with newfound ideas."
,,Mediterranean conservatory,4.0,,"Ok, so for European travellers most of this dome will look a little like home from home, but don't forget we're near the equator so this is an experience for those who haven't experienced our climate before. Instead we should marvel at how they've done it, no mean feat when you consider the humidity outside."
,,Colourful,5.0,,"The mixture of shrubs, flowers, fruit & vegetables is amazing. I would not think of such a combination if I lived to be 100. Gives ALL gardeners get ideas to take home to their own garden."
,,Cool down and enjoy the view,4.0,,"I found this to be the more enjoyable of the two domes in the Gardens by the Bay. There are some hidden ""trails"" and there is always something interesting to see if you pay close attention. The temperature is well controlled so this is a great place to cool down if it is a hot day. Give yourself at least 45 minutes to take in the experience."
,,WELL WORTH WHILE,5.0,,"This is set in a part of Singapore that is already beautiful ie gardens by the bay. The extra effort to enter the domes is well worth it. It is a cool place to see many different groups of plants by region displayed at their very best. The cactus display was my favourite but then it was hard to pass up the brilliant floral displays. For one who has never ventured into a rain forest, seeing this is a must. Go for it!"
,,plants galore,4.0,,This was a lovely place to visit - relaxing but not so much filled with flowers as had been suggested to me in earlier reviews. but was worth the stroll through for the engineering of the place if nothing else.
,,Part of the Gardens by the Bay- amazing undercover international gardens; tip: free entry if you dine there,5.0,,"The Flower Done is an enormous glasshouse, housing plants from around the world.

It's an amazing collection- you walk around to see displays of plants from each of the continents.

The displays are uniformly excellent.

It's an audacious undertaking, which has been executed brilliantly.

A tip: there is a restaurant within the Flower Dome (Pollen) which offered free entry to the Flower Do e when you dine there- check their website for details.

You can easily spend 1-2 hours- possibly even longer- looking at the sensational displays.

Also, you can make a visit here part of a day trip to the Marina Bay Area."
,,Interesting gardens,4.0,,I really enjoyed the cactus garden in the flower dome. The other gardens had some interesting bits and pieces too. I liked how the sculptures are included to break up the plants a bit. Some of the gardens were not different enough from what I see everyday to be all that interesting.
,,The Cool-Dry Conservatory- to witness Lap of Nature,5.0,,"Enter the Lap of Nature to experience true colours of vegetation. It is spectacular and innovative in design. Enjoy a cooling and leisurely stroll through the Flower Dome You'll discover amazing plants and flowers from different corners of the globe, and you'll be amazed by how different parts of the trees are used in daily lives across different cultures. Lots of photo shoot opportunities for all, be professional or amateur.

The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like South Africa, California and parts of Spain and Italy. Home to a collection of plants from deserts all over the world, it showcases the adaptations of plants to arid environments. Stop and smell the flowers in the colourful changing displays of the Flower Field, which reflects different seasons, festivals and themes.

Part of Gardens by the Bay, not to be missed while in Singapore. Go to Cloud Forest also."
,,The whole experience was wonderful.,5.0,,"As a gardener and a lover of plants, thoroughly enjoyed the Flower Dome, we were there when the tulips were out, beautiful"
,,The best thing to do under the heat,5.0,,"Ran into the flower dome literally as it was boiling hot, it was like paradise - half because of the flowers and the other half would be the cool air. Comes with different theme - cactus corner, rainforest, mediterranean palm, indian garden etc. Absolute beauty."
,,A must,5.0,,"Fascinating experience to see the combination of modern architecture and nature. The gardens are well planned and each time I have visited they have had a different theme, so this makes it enjoyable every time. Provides a botanical presentation from all parts of the world and a respite from the humidity."
,,all I could do was stop and say 'wow'!,5.0,,"This is just amazing! Plants from all over the world. A cafe if you want, and a lovely reprieve from the heat and humidity. Gardens by the Bay, the flower dome and Cloud garden are right at the top of the best things to do in Singapore! Don't miss it if you go"
,,Walking along the flower alley,5.0,,Tons of flowers around this dome. Some nice and wonderful that you've never seen before. The bottle trees are awesome. The interior will be changed every 3-4 months due to the seasonal and festival. The weather in the dome is quite cold a bit. Don't forget to bring your jacket.
,,Must be!,5.0,,"It was not until I came to this place, I realized that Singapore owned a natural beauty.
I had a chance to watch lively variety of flowers, many different kinds of flower under one roof.
Belong the garden there were a lot of seating and resting place. A cafe inside helped you to enjoy the peace, watching beautiful flowers and breathe in fresh air.
I really love it!"
,,Charmed by nature,5.0,,experience a variety of climates and different fauna and flora all under one roof. a very good learning trip for kids. Lots of sitting and resting places. A cafe inside to let you stop and rest. Beautiful plants.
,,Great!!!!,5.0,,Must visit place in SG - air-conditioned garden with heaps of flowers from all other the world. We took bunch of photos and enjoyed our time in cool atmosphere.
,,Very nice flower garden,4.0,,"disclaimer: I visited the flower dome after the cloud forest dome, so I might be slightly biased... to be clear the cloud forest dome was so amazing that the flower dome seemed normal ;-)

Under this dome, we've seen a beautifully arranged flower garden, or actually lots of difference gardens, by theme, region, ... An amazing feature to manage to bring it all together and keep it so nice.

They also have a very nice cafe at the end of the flower dome, where you can sit for a drink, coffee, or food.

So still a very nice visit, but if you go here, please combine it with the cloud forest ;-)"
,,"""A cool and wonderful experience""",5.0,,This dome is awesome. There's a wonderful display of worldly plants and it is just wonderfully presented and awesomely cool. A relief from the oppressive heat outside.
,,beautiful,4.0,,"amazing flowers blooming in the garden from the corner of world. very nice place to visit, feeling good by being there."
,,Great gardens,5.0,,We made a hasty decision to visit the gardens by the bay and it was a great decision. Grab a shuttle to the visitors centre unless you are fit as it could be quite a trek. Visited both the flower dome and the cloud dome. Worth to see both for realistic garden and then a fantasy garden.
,,Very cool place! recommended to buy tickets combine with cloud forest,5.0,,"went here with my family on 6 July 2013.. this is such a great place for vacation with families, especially children.. various types of plants and flowers, great scenery and cool surroundings.. no more gardens with hot weather.. :)

alternative if you want a romantic settings, go in the afternoon or night! the lightings are spectacular.. :D"
,,Flower Dome Park Singapore,3.0,,"My friends accompanied me for a first visit to the area, it was in the afternoon which is good as in daytime it could be hot and humid during this time of year. Make sure to have a good pair of walking shoes/sandal as it's quite an area to cover. The supertrees are quite beautiful in the evening when lighted up, hopefully the various ferns, orchid plants fitted is not damaged because of these lights."
,,Cool retreat,5.0,,"Part of the Gardens by the bay, these buildings are beautiful by themselves, but the plant collection is impressive and a cool retreat from a sticky Singapore day. The 2 attractions (Flower and Cloud) cost $28 per adult but the surrounding gardens are free. If you are at all interested in plant life, it's well worth the wander around"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"It was really nice. Make sure you go in the afternoon/morning though. Late in the evening, when there is less light, you don't see the colors of the flowers well. The whole place was beautiful and could be covered in less than 1.5-2 hours."
,,Unique...,4.0,,"The Flower Dome is coupled with the 'Cloud Forest' and is one attraction in Singapore's 'Gardens by the Bay'. I think you can do this one as a stand alone but it's best to do both together....do this one first. Basically, it's flowers, trees, & greenery from all over the world and it is divided into various gardens. The dome itself is spectacular...makes you really feel like you are in a greenhouse (except it is very comfortable). There is a bathroom in the dome as well. The nearest MRT is the 'Bayfront Station' although I believe they are building another line that will be closer but that's all in the future."
