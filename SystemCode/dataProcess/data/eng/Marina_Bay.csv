,,Great walk around the bay,5.0,,Great opportunity to have a walk around the the bay ending at Marina Bay Hotel. Start at the Bridge over the River at Clarke Quey and start walking past River walk gallaria. The wal takes you past some very nice eateries and bars with many having hapy hours and beer much cheaper than the main Clarke Quay area. If you continue you will soon see the Marina Bay Hotel dominating the skyline with older and newer buildings to each side. Stop at the Chinese ice cream man and buy an old style waffer for $1.50 continue and cross the road by the Concert Hall Bridge and Fullerton Hotel you will then have uninterrupted views of the Merlion and Bay with the Marina Bay Hotel dominating the skyline.
,,Must-visit,5.0,,A must visit in Singapore. We got a wonderful time here and enjoy a dinner on the bay. Really worth a visit.

,,Music show,4.0,,"Is a great place to be. Spectacular sights. We enjoyed a music show and saw some amazing fireworks. We were told it was kind of preparatory for the Independence Day.

Views from the top of Marina Bay Sands affords panoramic views of the city and bay itself. There is also the Art and Science Museum and Louis Vuitton Island Maison among many other attractions."

,,Take a bumboat,4.0,,Marina Bay is at the heart of Singapore overlooked by skyscrapers and the Marina Bay hotel. 0laces to see include the Helix bridge and the art / science museum both architectural delights. Great photo opportunities. Best way to experience it is via a Bumboat ride. Start from Clarke Quay. One way trip to the Museum / shopping mall for $18 or do a round trip for a little more. About a 20 minute it's ride to the mall and you see the sights the city has to offer ending up in Marina Bay. Well worth it. There is a light / sound show in the evening around the bay or you can stroll around. The Marina links the access to the Gardens by the bay via the Marina Sands hotel / mall.

,,Very Good view,4.0,,We went twice to this place once in the day time and once in the evening for the light and sound show. Its a huge place and in the day time there is enough space to relax by the bay side.
,,Beautiful Bay,5.0,,A lovely bay with wonderful architecture nestled around it & the reflection of coloured lights adding an extra dimension come evening.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,The view of Singapore from the top was splendid! The architecture was stunning.We took two of our granddaughters (who were on their first overseas trip) and they were blown away - being a Saturday it was very busy but we coped and found some quiet niches to absorb the wonders.

,,A great place to see,4.0,,Marina bay is a fantastic place to visit. The shopping is amazing along with the views around the gardens. A must see

,,Great free light show at night over the Bay - bring the kids!,4.0,,"This is a Las Vegas type light show over the bay. This should not be confused with the Supertree Grove Light Show in Gardens by the Bay on the front side of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
Suggestion: We had a wonderful meal at Justins Flavors of Asia that is on the ground level facing the Bay (right outside the Shoppe Mall). Plan on eating and then viewing the light show which I I think begins at 8PM."
,,Amazing laser display,5.0,,Wow! Watched the display and it truely was amazing. The whole marina bar area is wonderful. Lots of bars and restaurants in the vicinity.
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,Nice to wander around but we decided against going up to Marina Bay Sands in principal as we thought the prices being charged to merely go up on a small platform were outrateous and this did not even include being permitted to go to the restaurant up the top. Why not?? If you allowed people there they would spend money in the restaurant. Very disappointing and Singapore has got this wrong.
,,Date,4.0,,"Been there a few times for night cycling, the scenary is good for insta pictures. Alternatively, can go shopping too:)"
,,A worthwhile walk,4.0,,"The place has an energy of its own.. Even if you just walk the area, you cannot get bored.. There is plenty to eat n drink.."
,,Come see the fireworks and water laser light show,4.0,,"Get yourself along to this free gem of fireworks followed by a laser light show on water. It’s a quick 15 mins but worth seeing. Kids will love it, geriatrics will love it. Make sure you bring a drink with your."
,,Best View,4.0,,"Marina bay on the Fullerton side is the best place to see the laser light show from Marina Bay Sands, lovely during the day and even better a night"
,,Huge & Beautiful park in the Garden City!,5.0,,"The park is free for all, only the 2 domes are chargeable entries (Cloud Forest and Flower). Expansive and well manicured green space in the city, ponds with fountains, interesting modern sculptures, plants and landscaping, children play area, and lawn.

Also, special events (e.g. Children's Arts Festivals, Christmas Wonderland, etc.) are held throughout the year, offering refreshing fun activities to look forward to.
Great place to spend outdoors time with the family on a fine weather day. Dotted with some cafes along the fringes for easy meal options, or toilet breaks - clean, air-conditioned and reasonably priced. Fantastic place for photo taking too.

Reasonable car parking rates."
,,Specatcular views,5.0,,"This area is nice at daytime and nighttime as well.There are light showa in the evening and at both times the bumboat cruises are an event. You cruise through the historical district, highrises, Clark Quay and along Fullerton Hotel. you have a great view of Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is visible from every angle. Our favorite place to stroll and hand out."
,,Awesome,5.0,,the hotel is amazing and the expensive amazing and shopping mall has very food stores and restaurants
,,Holiday,5.0,,Marina bay remains a beautiful place to stroll after dinner when it is less hot. Beautiful especially at night. The MRT line to take you into marina bay sands is downtown line - Bayfront whereas the marina bay is shopping area

,,Spectacular,5.0,,"We were spell bound by Marina Bay from the moment we saw it. There are so many things to look at & do along the water front. It really is worth seeing from many angles (by boat, walking, & up high on Marina Bay Sands), as well as both day & night. The absolute highlight of any trip to Singapore"
,,Buzzing precinct,4.0,,"Marina Bay, from where cruise ships sail, is a modern, clean and buzzing precinct on the Singapore harbour. Even if not cruising there is a lot to see and do in the precinct."
,,Definitely worth a visit and here's a tip,4.0,,"The views are amazing. If you go up to the bar at the 'boat overhang' end of the building you have to pay S$22 each, however, this can be put towards a drink/food purchase (this is obviously to stop people taking advantage of free views). We inadvertently went to the bar/restaurant at the other end.....which has no charge (views still awesome). We bought our S$22 beers here anyway."
,,Very pretty and fun architecture,3.0,,"It is a treat to walk around the Marina to visit the stores and buildings. We visited the Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck which was nice. I would not recommend it , however. It does not reflect anything other than consumerism in Singapore."
,,Great area to walk around,4.0,,A great place to wander around in the day but also in the evening. See all the night lights and the light show in front of marina bay sands shops at 8 or 9 pm.
,,Brilliant!!,4.0,,If you hav the time you must come here in the evening just amazing wonderful photo opportunities just great to spend time here
,,Awesome!!!,5.0,,"It was a hot awesome day when I was walking forward to see this beautiful building. We went there on the tour and only stopped by there for a short while before continuing to Sentosa Island. Even it was super hot day, but we did enjoy our hot moment there Unfortunately, Merlion was under construction. We couldn’t take a memorable photo with it. Good though, then we will go back for that"
,,Thumbs Up !!!,5.0,,"Marina Bay is the most happening place of Singapore. its a must visit place with Gardens by the Bay, MBS, Flyer and many other attaractions around."

,,Gorgeous Architecture,5.0,,"I love Architecture and Marina Bay Sands is one of the best in the world.
It's definitely a man made wonder.
Do visit the promenade during the evening to view this gorgeous hotel.
The lobby is huge and well designed.
I love the walkway made for people through the building.
Do visit the Bay Sands Park and enjoy the view with a dip and some cocktails."
,,"Great people-watching area, day and night",4.0,,"By day, wander along the promenade taking in the sights (both out to see and inland towards Singapore's gleaming steel-and-glass skyscrapers). By night, choose from dozens of restaurants with outdoor seating for delicious food and drinks. Hey, it's cliche, but try a Singapore Sling!"

,,Absolutely gorgeous!,5.0,,We watched the light and water show in front of Marina Bay Sands in this beautiful bay! Don't miss it when you're in Singapore!
,,A Beautiful Water Show,5.0,,The Marina Bay light show is a must see when visiting Singapore. It shows twice once at 8:00 and then again at 9:00 . You can grab food at the mall food court and then enjoy the show with delicious snacks and drinks.
,,Most impressive,5.0,,"We spent an afternoon at this formidable complex and enjoyed ourselves. Part mall, part resort, part casino and definitely an attraction in every way, Marina Bay is the Las Vegas experience in one majestic skyline stealing building. With plenty of restaurants and shops, there's something to do at every price point. Had the kid with us, so sadly we couldn't venture to the casino and play some slots; guess we're going to have to wait until next time.

But yes, definitely find your way here, even if it's just for lunch."
,,Looks like the pictures :-),4.0,,"Interesting walk, SUPER crowded and touristy in places though (Sunday). I'd suggest renting a bike or scooter and doing the big circle, not just the bay walk."
,,Perfect for lunch - even though we weren't staying there,5.0,,To experience the buffet lunch was a Singapore experience it itself. So much choice and just so delicious. And the perfect place to watch a Singapore storm flow down the glass walls into the ponds.
,,Evening Out,4.0,,"We went here for an evening - we ate in one of the restaurants here and there is a big mall to look around. Also, the famous Marina Bay Sands is here"
,,"Great Mall, Huge Selections",4.0,,"Great shopping centre, huge selection of shops (though many are hugely expensive brands!) with a similarly large selection of restaurants."
,,Specially beautiful at night,5.0,,We visited Marina Bay at night and took a leisurely walk around the bay. The views are truly beautiful at night and the weather is cooler in the evenings. You can spend hours wandering around and enjoying the views and the open space. Highly recommended.
,,Nice light show in evenings,5.0,,If you see nothing else that night show is the best in the world. Singapore knows how to entertain. And the bay is so clean that it puts our US coastal areas to shame. Very friendly staff and people
,,Definitely a sight to see. Spectacular,5.0,,"Marina Bay will not disappoint. Visiting day or night the views are incredible. Especially for the magnificent Marina Bay sands. But from whichever angle you view there is so much to take in.
The walk around the bay is beautiful but can also be accessed via the city buses.
Well worth a visit. You can easily pass a couple of hours just wondering around the bay."

,,Very very Instagramable,5.0,,I took a very early morning walk here. Around 7:30 on a Saturday. Almost no tourist except some joggers. Only a handful of people around the Merlion. But by 8:30 it was impossible to take a single shot with the merlion. But that wad the...More
,,Light show well worth a look,4.0,,"Time your stroll around the Bay so that you will be able to view the light and laser show, It's very well done."
,,an evening attraction,4.0,,we could have chosen to visit this place in broad daylight but the heat and the crowd was just too much. going there at night was already humid but it was worth the inconvenience just to see the spectacular view even under the moonlight. we...More
,,Spectacular in the evening time,5.0,,"Marina Bay has become the face of Singapore since the construction of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

,,Heartlanders nearby...,4.0,,"Explore further after looking at the barage. The canal leads to heartlanders places both private n hdb dwellers. Just use the PCN walkways on foot, scooters or bicycle. Best in morning or evening. Afternoon is too hot n sweaty."
,,Visit,5.0,,"Great place to Visit, the day we went it rained but it did not spoil anything very well spread out and staff very friendly"
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Singapore has correctly recognised that if you engineer design at a high quality, then maintain the cleanliness to a high standard the Tourist will come. Lovely are to visit, super clean with beautiful views."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Built on reclaimed land, the scale and opulence of this place has to be seen to be believed. Huge amount of retail, even a canal with boats you can ride going through the middle, large food court, direct connection over to Gardens By The Bay."

,,watch the light show & walk along the water!,4.0,,"If you look on the Marina Bay Sands website you can find the times for a light show, and I highly recommend going if you can! It’s a beautiful show. Be sure to get there 10-15mina beforehand for a good view otherwise you’ll be in the back of huge crowd of people and unable to fully see the show. There’s a viewing spot by the Chanel and Louis Vuitton. During the day or at night, definitely walk along the water to enjoy the view of Marina Bay."
,,Serenity in the cbd,4.0,,"Paid several visits to the area during a 4-day trip to Singapore. It is a beautiful place at the heart of the cbd. Things are moving in a slower pace in that area despite the the turbo of sg economy is surrounding it.

Visiting it at night is a must."
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"The area around the reclaimed land with the MBS hotel as its centre is worth visiting. The MBS hotel is really busy and I found it hard not to be impressed every time I looked at it both from inside and outside, from the Gardens by the Bay walkway and even from the air when flying into Changi Airport. The light show which we watched after the Gardens by the Bay light show was a total waste of time."
,,Sands Theater is the Best,5.0,,I like how they manage crowds before the show started. I watched the Phantom of the Opera. There is many door stall that prevents bottle neck. Excellent sound! Seat plan is good. It’s really near stage even I bought the 2nd most expensive ticket (cannot remember a price)
,,A must place to visit!,4.0,,Beautiful view. A must place to visit and spend time in the evening. The light & sound show is quite exquisite.
,,Smaller than expected but still lovely.,3.0,,We had planned to split the marina bay area into 2 and go over a few days but when we arrived we realised you could walk all the way around it in just over an hour so we did just that and then went back to see it again at night time for the light display - which was good but not amazing. Also whilst we were there the Merlion was covered up in scaffolding which was disappointing.
,,Extraordinary place,5.0,,"A very good day out. A lot of things to do but fairly costly. Worth it , The staff were very helpful and informative."
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,"A visit to singapore has to include the marina bay. Reclaimed land that shows modern architecture, there is light show with the Merlion (do check timing) and is a good idea to do an evening walk around the bay. Can walk to Fullerton (old part with the small merlion), Fullerton bay hotel (new part) and to marina bay sands."
,,Beautiful scenic place,5.0,,Walked around the bay at night time to feel the great scenic amazing view. I was amazed to see the beautiful light and sound by the bay. Hope to come back here again.
,,Relaxing,5.0,,Walking to the Marina Bay Sands you have to pass Marina Bay. It is a very nicely built park with trees planted by the Olympic participant nations. You can sit on a bench called by a fan. Impressive and pleasant. Don't miss to walk there.
,,The center of the action,4.0,,It hosts the MBS light show in the evening. During the day it is lined with busy restaurants and cafes’. It is only a few steps from Esplanade Park and Merlion Park is here as well.
,,Pretty unique experience,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore, this is one of the “must do” locations. Unique setting in the middle of the city. Free concerts at the Esplanade side, free light shows at MBS side, and frequently other events. Lots of food and drinks options, although generally not the cheapest. Wander off elsewhere for food if you are on a tight budget. Within walking distance from some food courts."
,,Beautiful evening walks,4.0,,"The Esplanade around Marina Bay is one of our favourite areas to hang out. The skyline view across downtown is fantastic, with the Fullerton and Marina Bay Sands hotels offering contrasting styles to the vista. Close to the Gluttons hawker center this was a lovely place for an evening walk, great photo locations and quiet bars for a cocktail."
,,Fantastic Skyline Especially at Night,5.0,,"I took a walk in the cool evening under Merlion and the lights from across the water makes for a great photo shot. The light breeze without the heat of the day, makes for a nice walk around the bay area. I stood there for quite a while to soak in all the night lights, the river boats crusing around, the people enjoying the views like me. Awesmome!"
,,It’s all about the Bay!,4.0,,"Downtown Singapore is all about the Bay! Whether it’s the Merlion, the Gardens, the city skyline or the MB Sands hotel, the bay is the centre of everything!"
,,Hire Scooters!,5.0,,We hired scooters to tour the bay and it was such good fun. You'll need the app on your phone and such a fun way of touring the whole bay and the gardens
,,Last year holiday,5.0,,I had holiday last year for 4 nights and i visit marina singapore its was very good and nice would like to coming back again this year if i given chance .
,,Iconic views of Singapore,4.0,,Marina Bay is worth visiting. We walked over to MBS by walking around the marina and this way you get a good view of the CBD skyline and of course the marina Bay Sands Building. It’s a pleasant walk and in the evening it’s nice as the sunset over the CBD looks amazing and you can see the lights start to come on.

,,Wonderful place to visit at night,4.0,,"We went on a river cruise in the evening. The scenery was beautiful, with the buildings lighted against the night sky. One can sit in any spot around the lake and enjoy the view. There are also a lot of activities and restaurants in the area to make it more interesting. The more adventurous can cycle around the area but the cruise was worth it."
,,Expensive for the view,5.0,,Expensive to visit the viewing platform and not one seat to sit and enjoy the view. Take away shop at top but no where to sit. great views no access to bar or restaurant unless you are a guest

At night it is like a fairyland and you can watch the laser light display by the Marina Bay Sands hotel from anywhere around the bay. There are food stalls and restaurants dotted along the way and easy walking access. Of course there is also the famous Merlion but be aware it can get quite busy around the statue.
,,Lousy lasers but nice night spot,4.0,,"This area is the “postcard picture” centre of the city, or the first image you will see if you Google “Singapore”. It’s a great spot to visit in the evening, although best viewed from inside an air conditioned building during the day because the heat will truly beat you down.

There are great views of the area from the top of the National Gallery.

The hourly night time laser show is neither as impressive nor futuristic as it sounds. Indeed, there were several times we turned away thinking it had finished.

Definitely visit, but don’t think you have missed out if you think you left the show before the grand finale (because I don’t think there was one)."
,,Awesome water music performance in the evening,5.0,,"The view was great, the blowing wind was refreshing too. I came to see the free water music performance at 8PM and it was great. I sat too close to the edge and was hit with some water though, haha. Would definitely come again."

The view of the area in all directions is fantastic once the sun sets and the buildings light up. If it wasn’t for the massive crowd, it would’ve been a fantastic walk circling the bay.

,,Beautiful place to meander.,5.0,,"Lovely walk round the bay, we took harbour boat trip which was great, learnt a lot of the history of Singapore."
,,Glamour,5.0,,"Marina bay could be a good night out and spend nothing. We went to see the laser or light show. Full of spectacular eye-catching events. Set against the sky scrapers on one side and the sea on the other.
Buildings change colour, Nija climbers go up and down the building and sky divers appear from the top. You will be standing for more than an hour but get there early and there are some seats and lots of cafes that fill quickly.
Another popular thing to do is the sea boat and river boat rides. Some include meals ,some just drinks and the cheapest you take your own water. Water is vital in Singapore. If there is rain people don't use umbrellas but cool down. It's hot in the morning , boiling midday and hot at night. When you first get off the airplane you will gasp for air. This is a sauna. All year round it's mostly the same.
Marina Bay has the Singapore Flyer, like the London eye. Museum's, shops and the aquarium. It's full of glamour and you may find musicians, dancers, shows. You will find hawkers lots and lots selling laser pens and fake watches. This is the bottom of the market so don't expect them to last.
One warning chewing gum is forbidden in Singapore and drop litter or cigarettes you WILL be fined on the spot or jailed."
,,Spend a day here!,5.0,,"I travelled here with colleagues for a work presentation, after which we had a couple of days at our leisure.

Highly recommended and will definitely return again."
,,You will appreciate it more if you walk :). Really.,5.0,,"Forget the bumboats (rip-off, no toilet ;) for two hours); forget the hop-on hop-off bus (rip-off, waste of time). If you have the luxury, take the time to walk around Marina Bay. It's probably around 4 km for the whole 360 deg promenade to and from Marina Bay Sands. We loved it. We loved looking at the Marina Bay Sands sails from the OverEasy restaurant at One Fullerton and back again. It's a pleasant promenade for catching up with friends.

After the Helix Bridge, you will also see some nice lounge chairs where on good weather, it probably is an excellent place to soak up the soon, read a good book or ponder about life. Wear good comfortable walking shoes so you won't regret it!"

Once during the day time to take good pictures and definitely during the late evening when everything is lit up. This place is truly mesmerizing. This was my second time so I exactly knew where I would like to spend more time. We took the battery operated cycles and circled around Marina Bay and that was real fun. We stopped in between to take beautiful pictures and then finally settled at Esplanade. During the evening we were lucky to see the laser light show sitting on the exact opposite side of Marina Bay Sands. It was so beautiful.
,,Marina Bay sands sky park,5.0,,"Wow wow superior experience viewing Singapore City lighting standing at 58th floor of Marina Bay sands sky park area. Enjoyed a lot.

,,Great for a scoot,5.0,,"We parked at the Tanjong Rhu side of gardens by the Bay, and scooted (non- motorised) around past marina barrage, gardens by the Bay, MBS, Esplanade, the Merlion, Fullerton, and back around to MBS. It was a Saturday, and the crowds weren’t too bad, but we did have to slow down a bit around the Merlion. It’s hot but beautiful. Lots of places to stop and have a drink. The Bay is a great place to visit... basically you see all the sites that were in ‘crazy rich asians’."

,,Light & water show is well worth a night visit.,5.0,,"By day we took a bum boat cruise around the bay, great way to see the sights you also get a running commentary. We did the round trip but you can get off at different jetties if you want. We ate lunch at one of the many waterside restaurants in Clarke Quay. Suggest you go quite early in the morning to avoid the big tour groups.
By night we watched the light/water display in the bay, magnificent and well worth the time spent here and it’s free."

,,Loved It!,4.0,,"Visited this venue for 3 days as we went to watch the F1 Singapore grand prix in Marina Bay. The venue and atmosphere during the F1 was lovely! There are notes around (which I bet are going to be very expensive). There are also restaurants around too. Our ticket for the F1 grand prix meant we had to take the metro and get out at City Hall and then walk to our gate. If I visit Singapore again, I would take a trip back to Marina Bay to see what the place looks like when F1 is not on"
,,Singapore GP,4.0,,They have done this well and it’s a great starting point. Night time light show is also great and the place is just well set out
,,Very nice place,4.0,,I like to walk and send my night here Full of people and everything around you Many activities and show and many nice view around
,,What a walk!,5.0,,The place has a view from everywhere you walk. The must do thing is the cruise.. you will fall in love with this place.

,,Picturesque!,5.0,,"I would definitely come back here to just enjoy the views! Take lots of pics and eat! I highly recommend a short visit here, even if you are strapped for time."
,,Convenient and near to Garden by the Bay,5.0,,"A convenient place to go especially via the local train (MRT). Stop at Bayfront station. Garden by the bay can be reach by an underground linkway from the MRT. Great place to walk. Many restaurants n Cafe. For those on a budget, the food court at basement 2 have prices from $5 . For those on super budget, you have to go to the Singapore Pools outlet where takeaways from S$1.70 for a hot drink. There are buns n bread too. Or stop by 7-11 once you exit from the MRT gantry. Otherwise take a pleasant 20 mins walk to Marina square area via the helix bridge. The view along the bridge is great."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Stunning at night especially. Beautiful views and lovely skyline, walk. Very romantic as well. A must in Singapore."
,,This place is overwhelming and astonishing,4.0,,"It is an amazing place with everything built around this marina area, both modern and historical. Fullerton hotel obviously is one the center landmark and representation of the historical part. Sand resort, boardwalk, restaurants, markets, museums, the Merlion, etc. There are a ton of stuff to do here, sightseeing, dine, shop, relax, etc. It is very touristic for sure but definitely worth a visit. I recommend to visit both during daylight as well as in the evening, you can see different views of the area. It's quite hot during the day though. In addition, obviously you will be paying a premium tourist price around here."
,,Glamorous entertainment and shopping area,5.0,,"A massive Bay Area oozing in opulence - a playground for the rich as well as the mere mortals like me! Like a bigger Monaco or Hong Kong but with more of a modern feel and spotlessly clean and safe even late at night.

The mega shopping centre is one of the grandest I have ever seen and although it has a lot of shops for those who have fat wallets it does have stores we are all familiar with plus an abundance of restaurants and cafes for all tastes and budgets. It is also a great place to escape the heat for a while too.

Outside you can walk all the way around the bay and pass by some jaw dropping hotels that are definitely for those on a few dollars more than me! Gorgeous and stunning doesn’t do them justice. The Marina Bay Sands is a spectacle but the Fullerton around the other side looks breathtaking too. Checkout the lobby. Wow!

The business sector skyline looks great at night alongside the Sands hotel and the whole area is a place where you can take so many pictures - night or day. The bay also has museums, boat trips and the light and water shows add to the atmosphere. Add the F1 event and the buzz is off the scale.

A great area to wander about, people watch, eat, drink, take 100s of the same pictures, keep fit and suck in the views!"
,,Nice and green,4.0,,"It was a nicer attraction with lot of green and clean Beautiful landscapes Nice area to walk with friends, family or solo Few restaurants, malls are closer where u can go to"

,,Afternoon walks,5.0,,Most evenings my wife and I would walk around the bay before heading in for Dinner and then up to the infinity pool at the marina Bay Sands for a relaxing wind down at the end of the day. Always something happening in the bay that would draw your attention and create a memory
,,Love,5.0,,"My favorite place in all of Singapore. Loved the hotel, the casino and the restaurants, which provide amazing view and great food."

,,What a place!,5.0,,The Singapore skyline is something to take in and enjoy. The buildings are amazing and it’s just a wonderful place to enjoy a drink or food and take it all in.
,,Stroll around in the evening,5.0,,"Enjoyed a leisurely stroll around here during the evening and then returned the following evening for the light and laser show.

The area is well lit, but not in a way that detracts from the ambience. Look and marvel at the huge skyscrapers lightning up the skyline.

If you want a waterfront seat for the light show then be sure to be early. There’s ample seating. Silence fell as the show was about to begin. Sadly we only got to see a few minutes as there was a technical fault and the show had to be cancelled. Still, it’s all free so no real reason to complain."
,,A Great Land Mark in the City,5.0,,"Its a good attractive Land Mark with Options of Shopping and Food, even you can enjoy the Night Light Show with the Shadow in the Lake of Colors, best environment for Families and Couples and Business Travelers"
,,Amazing Space,5.0,,We took in the sights and sounds the light and water display from both the observation deck on the marina sands hotel and at the waters edge
,,Awesome night lights!,5.0,,"Visiting during Night time is simply awesome!

The reason i have more appreciation and I’m in awe is the fact that the walkways or the pedestrian lanes have muted lights which makes all the light in all the tall buildings surrounding the bay look amazing! Just standing there absorbing the night muted silence, the air and the atmosphere is an experience itself that is so worth walking there. It is safe and no one bothers you even if you’re alone.

We tried also walking along the bay during day time but there is no comparison with the experience at night time :)"
,,An excellent place to spend some time,5.0,,Marina Bay is packed with lots of different things to see and do. You haven’t been to Singapore if you don’t spend an hour or two at Marina Bay.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,I was fascinated by the view of Singapore! It was amazing! The dancing water are so cool and it is a huge place. I want to go back there again and again to explore more. I got limited time when we visited there that's why I didn't enjoy that much.
,,Amazing view. One of the best places in the world... completely free!,5.0,,"At night, with the sunrise or just giving a walk by the Bay in the middle of your day. It's a great experience.

,,magical moments!!,5.0,,"the marina bay is full of things to see and do. during the day, you can walk for hours enjoying the indoor and outdoor area and in the night, it is so brightly lighted up that it is just amazing experience."
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"Singapore is a hot and humid country but that did not stop us from exploring Singapore’s Marina Bay. The view is amazing, very instagramable. Around Marina Bay are the beautiful and expensive hotels, as well as the former landmark of Singapore- the Merlion, the Esplanade, etc. The heat is just intolerable during mid-day but ok to walk just before sunset."
,,Window Shopping,5.0,,"Who says you need to empty your pockets to fully enjoy Marina Bay? A long, leisurely walk along this premier tourist attraction is enough."
,,Still being developed,4.0,,"The Marina Bay area is built on reclaimed land and includes high rise apartments, the new financial district, Marina Bays Sands hotel, the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay and many more.

It’s a very large area and it a sign that Singapore is growing it’s regional importance while also providing additional services and attractions.

In general it’s not a great place just to wander about, better to take the MTR to various places that you want to visit."

,,Full entertainment zone in downtown Singapore!,5.0,,"Trust Singapore Government to create unique experiences for the joy of their citizens and the esteemed guests of Singapore - the tourists!
One of the unique creation is Marina Bay. In a short distance, one has everything from Gardens by the Bay to Marina Bay Sands hotel to Esplanade to Art and Science Museum to Singapore Flyer and much more. One can walk around the marina bay and take in all the sights.
The Marina Float is a mass entertainment zone with a stadium.
There is a cabana for live music on the weekends where the world's artists come to perform free for the audience.
There are several restaurants and malls all around the Bay.
This is the venue also for the Fire Cracker Show on special occasion including new year eve.
It is a go-to place during the week-ends.
A must visit in Singapore."
,,Unforgettable moments.,5.0,,"Please visit this place at 5 pm so you can view sunset from the top of the building. Stay minimum for 3-4 hours on the top where you can view all the major buildings of Singapore specially HSBC building, Super Trees & lots of others. You can view all the nationalities in this building.
Take dinner in the top floor restaurant only, if interested in beers, it is superb."
,,Must do,5.0,,There are plenty of restaurants lining the bay area and full of activities. You can do your walks or runs by the bay area and it really can't get better. You will also love to sit down by the bay and watch the skyscrapers around or have some great drinks and ice creams
,,tourist trap,2.0,,"we wanted to have a drink at the top....Tower 3 charges to go up, you do get a free drink but in a really loud nightclub with no outside view (it was roped off) and us oldies were fish out of water so we went back down, got a refund and headed up Tower 2 to the restaurant up there for a drink, it was a bit quieter... but after waiting 30 minutes to be served our drinks we bailed on that one too and returned ""home"" to our own rooftop bar at the Andez Hyatt which was way nicer!"
,,Lovely area,4.0,,This is a great area to walk around but currently tricky due to Formula One roads being half blocked and lots of works going on. Loved the Helix bridge.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I didn’t stay at the hotel but the complex where it’s situated is fabulous. The food court like nothing I’ve seen, the shops are fantastic and there a glass chandelier in middle and you can download an ap and tell it what patterns to make. The building looking great at night time but amazing at night. Definitely something you need to see."

BUT, it was still very nice, with a few great non-shopping options. I will say, my one complaint is the signs are a little tough to decipher. Otherwise, it was fine."
,,Shopping,4.0,,We did a bit of shopping here. It wasn't very busy. We did find it hard to find directions to places within the shopping centre here.
,,Spectra show is Top!!!,5.0,,"All this part of Singapore is fantastic: skyscraper, the bay, top restaurant and also characteristic boat China style for an incredible trip along the river. I suggest to stay in the late afternoon maybe after a drink at Level 33 brewery, read my review, and enjoy the bay reaching the little arena where at 20:00 the Spectra light and sound shoe will surprise you! The show is free every night so reach in time a good central position in the arena because it will fill totally very soon."

In the evenings there is a light show put up by Marina Bay Sands and its quite pretty."
,,nice family day,4.0,,"Nice place to spend a day. We really enjoyed it. BUT... if u like coffee, expect to get slugged hard"
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Go and check it out! Went to Marina Bay upstairs as well. You can just go for a drink and enjoy the view! It is pretty impressive. If you can access the infinity pool even better I guess. The walk around Marina Bay it is very pleasant. Anyone will enjoy that! These photos have been taken while on a 40 min cruise with Singapore River Experience, 25 dollars for an adult. Enjoy!"
,,Lovely bay especially at night,5.0,,The bay with the Helix bridge is great during the day but even more special at night. Plenty of places to eat and drink along the bay. Plus the light show in the evening is wonderful.
,,"Good for spending your day, walking and having coffee",5.0,,Its a really big place to walk around. Though its more of the ambiance that gives the vibe of the place rather than a particular structure. It is some what an organized chaos that makes you feel chill at the same time excited.
,,Marina by Night,5.0,,This is an amazing experience and a must do if you are going to Singapore. The light show was really spectacular and if your taking children they will totally enjoy the trip.
,,Foreign visitors' day visit,5.0,,"I took 4 American visitors and spent the whole afternoon visiting Marina Bay area. Everything is very well thought off and planned.

,,A must for ever visitor,5.0,,"I didn't know this place existed until I came across it when visiting Singapore. The hotel dominates the city and harbour. At night it lights up and is even more beautiful and exciting, a place one finds one must explore. Every evening one can enter the bay hotel and take lift up to floor 53, a small price has to be paid. There a one can view the surrounding area for miles. The centre tower brags a restaurant that one can view the area whilst eating, booking is strongly advised. Every evening the fountains in the lake below are switched on and appropriate music is blasted out, a must for every visitor. Lots more around the bay including several botanic gardens."
,,The beating heart of Singapore,5.0,,"Let's just put it in that way. What's common between the Colosseum, the Acropolis,the Pyramids, the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, the Big Ben,....and the Marina Bay Sands? Right! They are the icon of the whole country not just the city.
It' a circular bay in shape surrounded by so many attractions and interesting places. For instance you can find the famous MBS lucury hotel at the center of the scene with its famous observation deck and infinity pool and the place of Spectra show, the ArtScience museum, the Merlion park, the Helix bridge, the Waterfront promenade, the Fullerton luxury state hotel, the Float Marina Bay Stadium, and many other magnificent sites and unique towers.
It's a very nice area in the morning, but definetely priceless in the evening lights."
,,Must visit with a ferry ride and Laser show,5.0,,I had seen the light show from Marina Bay Sky Park but wanted to see it from front. So we took a ferry from Clark Quay to Marina Bay Sands. We sat there at saw the Laser Show and it was beautiful. Singapore is very safe so we spend a lot of time sitting and chatting there. It is beautiful and very romantic.

,,Very Modern,5.0,,Singapore is rapidly changing. The area surrounding Marina Bay is full of modern engineering marvels which are well worth visiting. Easy way if travelling is to take the Free Singapore tour from T2 at the airport.
,,Go during the evening,4.0,,"Nice area to walk around, especially in the evening when there are light shows etc. Enjoy good views of the CBD and Marina Bay Sands."
,,one of the more beautiful views. Nature and Man made,5.0,,"Singapore is all about marina bay and its surroundings. Green zone, blue zone, buildings, shoppings, nature, parks, water."
,,View of Marina bay from the boat ride,4.0,,"If you happen to go to marina at daytime and its a pleasant weather, then nothing like it. Take the boat ride and it will you take round the Marina bay. Its a wonderful experience"
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,"It’s a nice place to pass by during the day but I think it’s most enjoyable at night. It has stunning views to Marina Bay Sands. Lots of lights around , nice restaurants on the walk with some European and Asian food options. During three days stay we would go there every evening."
,,Nice walking,4.0,,"This place is quite crowded whole day, but enjoy my nice walking along the bay while talking to friends. It is hot in Singapore but the walking here will not be that hot! it is really nice, especially if you go here in the late nite. Also recommend Satay by the bay food court here"
,,Great to see,5.0,,Very impressive area with Marina Bay Sands in the background. We saw the laser light show from the Skydeck which was a bit disappointing however the view & atmosphere on the Skydeck is superb.
,,The View and the Crowds,5.0,,Get your energy from the dazzling array of architecture and people along this waterfront attraction. There are restaurants for a dinner or snacks. There are walkways sometimes flooded with people and oh the energy! Recommended for groups who need to burn off some energy by walking around the bay.
,,Bustling and spectacular,5.0,,"There is so much to do around. A bit of shopping, eating, people watching and simply strolling. There's something for everyone. Love it with the lights at night."
,,A pleasant place to spend a sunset,4.0,,The seats on the overpass were a good place to watch the sunset without the haze from the top of the Marina Bay Sands.Skypark or the bar slightly further up.
,,Hub,5.0,,"Always lots to see and do on both sides of the bay. Beautiful hotels, restaurants and shops or just sit and people watch."
,,fablous,5.0,,great night photography a must visit for all newcomers evening view the best good eateries around the area
,,Great to have a look at.,5.0,,Marina Bay is an amazing area to have a look at & see what money can buy. Mainly catering for wealthy tourists you will pay more for everything on this side of the bay. However the free light & water shows each evening are fantastic.
,,"Be there at Sunset , find a good spot and just take in the views!",5.0,,"I'm a Singaporean and get to visit the Marina Bay very often but i cannot help be awed by the views. Recently i made a visit with my husband on the 4th Aug (saturday) to see the final dress rehearsal for our National Day (it falls on 9th Aug) and thought i'll share the photos that he took of the skyline and fireworks.

If you're a tourist and have just a few days in Singapore , please make time to visit the Marina Bay. Go in the evening, see the Merlion, drop by the Esplanade, walk round the bay in full circle and take in the views. There's a food centre showcasing the best of our street foods-- Glutton by the Bay (right after the Esplanade). Set aside 3 to to 4 hours here. If you're game for nightlife, Clark Quay where the bars and drinking holes are is just a 15 mins leisure walk away (in the direction of Fullerton Hotel).

Enjoy!"
,,Stunning views and performances at esplanade,5.0,,Nice view around night and there are lot of performances around that area everyday. So do take a walk around and also listen to performances in the esplanade outdoor theater while you are there.
,,Well worth a walk around,5.0,,Marina Bay is all reclaimed land and is a master piece of both engineering and architecture. The hotel is awesome and there are lots of shops and bars. Well worth a trip and walk around.
,,Great place,5.0,,"Having been to Singapore few times we never actually got to spend that much time here, but this time had a good walk around and also took a boat tour to Clark Quay. The light shown was nice and the tree walks and light show worth visiting and hanging around, will visit again."
,,Magnificent sights!,5.0,,"What a gorgeous view. From the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, past the Lotus-shaped Arts & Science Museum right across to the Merlion. We walked across the Helix Bridge and right through over to Gardens By The Bay, and also the other way around to the Merlion. Great views everywhere you look."
,,The heart of the city :),4.0,,"There's plenty to see on each side of the bay. At one side there's National Gallery with it's terrace cafe's (try them out during evenings! :), there's Marina Bay mall with frequent events inside and often expositions set up in the halls, then there's Bay Sands with posh shopping area and welcome food court, Science museum with it's expositions and finally the business district with selection of skyscrapers."
,,Ignore any negative reviews!,5.0,,"If in Singapore you simply have to go to Marina Bay! I do not understand why anybody would have a negative thing to say about this wonderous reclaimed part of this fascinating city! You could spend days exploring if from differing angles and heights! We found a great view from Bar 33 - highly recommended! The Marina Bay Hotel of course dominates the skyline, however there is much more to it and it must be magical during the Grand Prix! Another must go!"
,,The Lion,5.0,,Great attractions by night the landscape changes with the addition of the light shows and restaurants
,,Just WOW !!,5.0,,The light show from Marina bay sands is something to be seen. You can take a boat ride and see it from the water and get up close to water fountains changing color and dancing to music or you can see it from merlion park or along Fullarton One precinct for free...but see it !!
,,Quick trip!,4.0,,"It was a nice place. Lots of shops and you can dine too! They have a light show at night too so you can take photos! If you want to just stroll around indoors and shop for luxury brands and dine, its a place you want to see."
,,Interesting ambiance,4.0,,"We went walking from Raffles city
Thru war memorial and an underground mrt station

It was a pleasant sight at 10 pm in the under ground seeing locals students having their chill out session.

Very lively.

As we entered bay thru esplanade mall it was quite a sight to see merlion beautifully lit with Fullerton magnanimous back drop.

Whole view with water front was fantastic

Sitting on steps of waterfront was exciting."
,,Feel the true Singapore!,5.0,,Amazing sights of all the financial buildings. Take a long walk around the bay for views of the financial buildings and Marina Bay Sands. Great number of restaurants and bars to enjoy near the bay.
,,"A must do experience, day and evening.",5.0,,"One of the most spectacular venues you will visit. The view of the bay with the Marina Bay hotel in the background is amazing. Enjoy a walk around environment with lots of eateries, photo/selfie opportunities (take one by Merlion - the national icon) and enjoy particularly the evenings."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Nice scenery and good place for a walk, but not worth the high recommendations. Conveniently next to the gardens, so still worth walking by when visiting there."
,,Great Atmosphere,5.0,,Walking aorund Marina Bay is a must do in Singapore both during the day and at night. Bay bay changes as the sun goes down. Easy walk
,,Lively Place to Enjoy a good evening walk,4.0,,"Next to Cloud Forest, this place provides a very calming effect for the eyes and complete relaxation for the mind. A must go kind of place. Good to just stroll around."
,,Spectacular and stunning but too 'sanitised',4.0,,It is worth a visit but it's all just put on for show. Everything is too expensive here. The shops are designer and restaurants are expensive. The hotel is lit up at night and has a musical light show that can be enjoyed from across the bay.
,,Overwhelmed,5.0,,"Was down here for Singapore’s 53rd Birthday. It is lovely to walk round and a lot to see. Once night has fallen, the lights from all the surrounding buildings is very impressive"
,,OK,4.0,,The stroll was great. The water is calming. The view is just so relaxing. Just a place to visit to rewind
,,It is stunning at night!,5.0,,"We took a river boat by WaterB from Clarke Quay at night, and the river and the bay are amazing to look at! Also not as hot as walking during the day. If you time it right your boat will be arriving to Marina Sands in time for the Spectra light show which starts at 8pm. Highly recommended!"
,,"A must see, definitely at night",5.0,,"We had been recommended to pop down to see the Marina Bay Gardens, and boy were we glad we did.

The place is mesmerising and like something out of an Avatar movie. The Supertree Grove in front of the Marina Bay Sands hotel was wonderful, and you can go on the aerial walk way within its ‘canopy’ for around £8. The views over the gardens are excellent.

You can even have a meal in the base of one of the larger ‘trees’ and there is a lift to take you up to the top.

There are lots of things to see and do, and you can easily spend an hour or two just walking around the well maintained and beautiful grounds. Entrance to the gardens is free, but the ‘dome’ and walkway are extra.

Either way, it’s a must see when visiting Singapore.

Tips

Get there by cab, it should be no more than 12-16 SGD from just about anywhere downtown. Tipping isn’t expected.

Take plenty of water, as it can be very humid and balmy."
,,Great views but entry tickets price bites,3.0,,"A bit overrated touristic attraction. Be prepared for some wait in the lines and zillion people blocking the views of Singapore, but if you are here for a boost for your ego, probably, you dont care.
You can get to the top without purchasing entry ticket if you head to the bar. The drinks are not cheap, but at least you get the drink AND the view."
,,Amazing by night,5.0,,We saw the bay from the SkyPark and then by boat at night. Skyline matches Chicago. Easy to get to by metro or taxi.
,,Walk the bay,5.0,,"A truly beautiful location with some amazing architecture and views. We enjoyed a full day walking around the whole bay. There are plenty of places to rest outside in the shade, restaurants and eateries."
,,Best marina I saw,5.0,,"Visiting singapore should include marina bay. Excellent sights. Attractions u should see. Marina bayside hotel, marina gardens, lion fish statue , water, bridge and surrounding towers of special building design. Without photos in marina u did not visit singapore."
,,The must see in Singapore,4.0,,"The highlight of the bay is the view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Merlion. It is really large, although there isn't much to do at 70% of the waterfront. That being said, it is a must do to say that you have actually been to Singapore."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,What a great area to see when in Singapore. It is just beautiful. We loved walking around the area and exploring the surroundings. So many people in Singapore but it didn’t feel that way being here.
,,The place to be in the evening,5.0,,Every evening entertain the city there with a free Lightshow. Around the bay are nice restaurants and places to sit and relax.
,,Woow place,5.0,,"Day or night this Marina Bay is woow for me.
This is my second times already to see this area. You must prepare yourself for walking sneakers upon touring this place and prepare your gadget for a nice selfies and picture perfect for this amazing view"
,,Beautiful amazing architecture,5.0,,Beautiful sight to behold at night. Definitely the highlight of the trip to view the marina bay hotel with all its lights in the evening. Would recommend anyone to visit if you are in town.
,,Visit to see a number of attaractions,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is an attraction of its own. It is worth a visit to walk through the towering complex with its massive trees in ceramic pots. The patisserie serves a great coffee, snacks and delicious pastries. The Casino (if you are a foreigner you will need to show your passport for free admission - locals pay $100) and The Shoppes are in the basement which connects to the Bayfront MTR (train system). There is a canal reminiscent of Venice running through the centre and kids can get a sampan ride and you can see the Hurricane waterfall; visit the Sky Walk (looks down onto the Singapore Eye); Gardens by the Bay (magnificent); the Spectra light and water display; and the ArtScience Museum with interactive displays for children. If traelling by MRT ensure that you alight at Bayfront NOT Marina Bay (a bit confusing)."
,,A magnificent night stroll along MBS,5.0,,"Took a walk fr Clark Quay along the Sgp River to Merlion Park opposite Marina Bay Sands (MBS) after dinner with my buddy n a friend from Yangon Myanmar.

A rather cool evening with a nice breeze blowing.

As the lights come up, the many man-made structures become evening more enchanting.

The daily Lights Show in front of MBS coupled with the audio effects is beautiful to behold. The added bonus is that it comes free if charge! With the Sgp National Day parades floating platform nearby, it simply adds to the magical atmosphere.

A great place to walk around the bay to take in a 360 degree view of everything in n around it.

Many made-for-tourists photo points for one to bring home n proclaimed: ""I was there!"" Just as I would with photos of The Big Ben in London or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

Go do it!"
,,Lots to see,5.0,,"This is a great place to walk around, take a bum boat ride, see the Merlion and view many other attractions. Some historic buildings are in this area as well as the CBD."
,,A walk around the bay,4.0,,"Work out on a circumnavigation of the Marina Bay area in Singapore. Of course it is flat, but you'll increase your steps count for the day and perspire in the process. Really great views of the Sands MBS makes it all worth it."
,,A lovely place to spend some time,5.0,,"Just a lovely place to walk around - loads to do and see. There is the ""world's first floating Louis Vuitton shop"" (why are they planning more!), lots of restaurants - I would recommend JustIn (excellent but not cheap although my husband said it was the best satay he had ever had so worth it) and best of all an air conditioned shopping centre with a canal through the middle of it - what's not to like!"
,,Exceeded my expectations.,5.0,,"Everything was perfect. The view to the Gardens by the bay, service, breakfast, facilities, the pool. Nothing to mention as negative. So grateful for the memories! It was worth long flight and every cent."

,,Best seen at night,5.0,,"Yes a beautiful bay with plenty of places around to see, eat and drink. We preferred it at nights with the lights of the city."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A really lovely bay. Our hotel looked right down on it and the lights at night are beautiful. There are many great restaurants on one side of the Bay (opposite the Marina Bay Sands) and you can do a river cruise. Very intriguing architecture.
,,Beautiful place - landmark of Singapore,5.0,,"All the area around the river is a very nice place to walk around with all the huge buildings in the background and the singapore flyer and merlion on either sides. the view of Marina Bay Sands from this place is very nice and most people capture very ncie views from here. Looks a very different Singapore here, looks like a developed place, other areas like the downtown and Little India just disappoint as compared to this place."

,,The plae to go in Singapore,5.0,,"It's not just the shopping, which is really grand, nor is it the food, which is awesome, it is the entire package, food, shopping, sights, sounds, kids, all of it, wrapped up into one big package. This is the one tourist thing I did on this trip to Singapore and loved it. Easily accessible via the subway, nice and cool inside and a ton of things to look at and do. Of particular note was the ""kiddie pool"" that had no water in it at all. The ""splashes"" were pools of light that followed kids around. Amazing. You could spend hours in the area, and should. Period."
,,EXAMPLE OF A 21ST CENTURY SKYLINE,5.0,,THE VIEW AT NIGHT IS BREATHTAKING. We took a walk from Esplanade to Marina Bay in the evening. Nice cool evening breeze and lots of selfie moments.

The path was perfect for a stroller (Maclaren layback one with 4 wheels not a running stroller by any standard) and Mr 6 found it easy. Lots of runners and motivated sorts out exercising. Lots to look at and take in. Felt very safe and clean. We did this boardwalk/promenade trip twice over two days."

The only bad here is that it can become crowded in some spots around with everyone taking pictures everywhere. besides that this is one of topfree activities to see/do here.
Ofcourse there is lots of resturants to sit and you can allways enjoy the bar on the 57th floor and see the show from there :) (charge for that)"

,,Beautiful bay at night,5.0,,Beautiful lights. Nice leisure walk around the bay. Was able to catch a laser light show in front of Marina Bay Sands
,,Soak up the atmosphere of Marina Bay,5.0,,Such a fascinating focal point in Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands hotel is the imposing backdrop to this area. The vast Gardens by the Bay is located directly behind the hotel & definitely worth a visit - also at night it takes on a completely new persona when it’s colourfully lit up. There are many (& mostly designer) shops in front of the hotel which attract a lot of visitors. On the opposite side you have the old colonial Fullerton Hotel in complete contrast to the modern buildings around. The many tall tower blocks of the business & financial district sit close behind. Crowds gather to visit the popular Merlion statue. The best way to experience this close up is to jump on an electric powered boat tour in nearby Clarke Quay & enjoy the guided trip along the fascinating waterway leading to the Bay Area. If you time it right in the evening you can be in the bay as the nightly laser show is projected from the Marina Bay sands hotel. Another crowd pleaser. It is now possible to walk the entire way around the Bay Area taking in all the various & diverse buildings & attractions along with the atmosphere. This walk also takes in the walk across the fascinating Helix Bridge. Another fascinating feature which must be viewed.
,,Great atmosphere by day and night,5.0,,Have lived in Singapore nearly 2 years now and Marina Bay area is a must see for all of our overseas guest. Great both by day and night. We don't generally eat or drink in the immediate bay area as prices are a little higher than surrounding areas but great open spaces around the water with amazing vistas from all aspects and take in Spectra water light and sound show viewed differently from both sides of the Bay
,,The vibrant hub of the city,5.0,,"With so many attractions within easy walk of Marina Bay this is an excellent place to start exploring Singapore. If you are there on the weekend the Dragon Boat races are a treat. Clean, safe and with lots of attractions within easy walking distance"
,,Impressive,4.0,,Really worth the time. The shopping mall area is huge and will keep you busy for a while. Note the indoor water (tiny) river with small rowing boats yp and down. I suggest you go in the early evening to enjoy the light and water funtain show. Well executed.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,First visit to Gardens by the Bay and the experience was simply amazing! The combination of nature and technology created such a spectacle. It is a must see attraction. You could easily spend an entire day checking out the gardens. But it’s a bit hot so would suggest to visit late afternoon.
,,Best bay on the earth,5.0,,"Unbelievably nice, you spend the best nights in Singapore by the Bay, you see the beautiful orange sunsets, you go to your favorite rooftop bars and Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands Unforgettable and unique!"

,,Location location location,5.0,,"We stayed here at a nearby hotel, and if there is a central point in singapore then this is probably it. Sadly my wife wants to stay on orchard road next time as she prefers shopping over sightseeing lol"
,,Must see,5.0,,"You cannot visit Singapore without stopping by Marina Bay. Facts are facts. It's right in the middle of it all; Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands resort, casino and shopping precinct, the famed Merlion and business district. It's a cultural hub, as the performance Centre sits on the banks of the bay, and there's a floating sports stadium for the soccer fans.

At night, there's a light show from Marina Bay Sands. At night, Clarke Quay (at the mouth of the Bay) goes off. There is so much to see and do here. Take a boat cruise, go for a stroll. Marina Bay has it all."
,,Many things to see and do,4.0,,"Plenty to see at day and lovely at night with the all the lights. Attractions include Merlion Park (with iconic mermaid lion statue), Fullerton Cove, Esplanade (theatre, hawker food, viewing level), The Helix bridge, Bayfront and Marina Sands (ArtScience Museum, The Shoppes, etc.), Gardens by the Bay and much more. It is possible to walk around the Bay, stop at the many vantage points to take in the views and activities. Splurge on an icecream or high tea. At night there is the laser music water show in the bay (several shows) best viewed from Marina Sands side of the bay. Gardens by the Bay is a must see."
,,Fantastic area to spend time around,5.0,,"The Marina Bay area covers a lot to see and do, from the Art & Science museum, the Marina Bay Shoppes to the skyline, which at night is nothing short of spectacular. The evening light & laser show is best seen from outside the Marina Bay shopping mall looking across the bay to the Merlion - you get to see the full laser show - and it is very impressive. We watch it 5 times! If you view from the Merlion across the bay looking at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, you get to see the big lasers but nothing as good as the other way - but still worth watching. You can walk around the bay - take an hour or so, take one of the local boats to travel up the Singapore river and dine at one of numerous restaurants or street markets, where you can get a good Chinese, Japanese, Malay meal for no more than £4!"
,,Stunning at night,5.0,,"This place is stunning at night and a great place to take photos. We where lucky as some Singapore festival was on and they had fireworks. Every night they have two laser shows an hour between, think 8pm and 9pm."

The architecture is amazing and it is easy to lose quite a few hours simply wandering around and taking the sights in. In is particularly beautiful at night - and very safe. Recommended.
,,"A great place to walk, eat and drink",5.0,,"Avoid the middle of the day when it can be extremely hot. All around Marina Bay there are great sights, photo opportunities, restaurants, shops and bars. A good place to grab dinner with friends (either at Marina Bay Sands, Makanstura hawkers, Esplanade mall or One Fullerton/Customs House). A good time to go is around 7 on the One Fullerton side when you will see the light show across the water at Marina Bay."
,,Singapore at its best,5.0,,"You have to come here in the late evenings to see absolutely awesome views of the all the modern architectural buildings around this. The spectra light and sound show was free and fantastic. Spend time here wandering around and relax. Walk also through the Helix bridge to see great views. End of the helix bridge there was an ice-cream seller selling ice-cream in less than sgd 2, which was so refreshing."
,,Dragon Boat Festival,4.0,,"It was the annual dragon boat festival in May and the precinct was a light with colour and splendour. The boats, teams and sounds made for an interesting back drop to the glamour of the buildings and walkways. A great morning."
,,Shimmering,4.0,,"Surrounded by skyscrapers whose lights shimmer across Marina Bay. The Bay is anchored by two bridges - The Helix and The Esplanade. Around the Bay, you'll find museums, the infamous Merlion, some exclusive hotels, casinos, shopping malls and hundreds of restaurants. At dusk, there's a short light show that felt a little muted, but still sparkling. A short distance away is the very impressive Garden by the Bay, Supertree Grove, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Well worth a little detour from Marina Bay"
,,Stunning,5.0,,The bay is amazing- surrounded by hundreds of bars and restaurants to suit millionaires or those on a budget. Go early evening to see everywhere lit up and watch the light display in front of the Marina bay sands hotel.

,,Modern and Beautiful Night View,5.0,,"A lot of activities over here, I just love the night view, It really relaxing.Singapore is a modern and futuristic city."

,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The views from inside, out and from afar are beautiful. The area in itself is immaculately kept. It was very busy."
,,A Must See Place and it’s surroundings,5.0,,"If you are a tourist, visiting this place is a must. Best to view the night scene if you prefer a cooler walk around here as temperatures are between 25 to 28 at night.
In the day, I would advise that you stay indoors for shopping and relaxing in cool air-conditioned comfort and eating or having your favourite afternoon lunch or tea & coffee breaks. You will be spoiled for choices in and around the various malls.
But if you prefer the hot weather of average 31 to 33 degrees then go ahead to enjoy the sunny weather.
You can also go to the Casino and enjoy a game or two but do not get carried away. If you win some monies it’s fine and better to stop while you can.
If you lost, set an targeted amount and gracefully exit before you regret losing all your monies. Hahaha. Enjoy and have a great time."
,,Incredible!,5.0,,"This area is the hottest in Singapore, and a must for every visitor. Spectacular architecture and good restaurants."

,,Singapore must visit,4.0,,Having been to Singapore before but not visited the Gardens at Night we took the opportunity this time and wasnt dissapointed. The light show 1945 was superb and well done also its FREE as are most of the gardens. If you want to visit the domes book online first as the queue for tickets was long even at 1500.

,,Amazing place,5.0,,I'd been here in d evening on the 2nd day of my travel.. it's very huge to cover by walk.. I'd recommend that you hire a bicycle to visit this place and start with the left side of the bay.. reson being.. the Merlion doesn't get captured well in d dark so ensure that you visit when it's bright and start with the Merlion.. unfortunately we started with the other side of the bay and reached Merlion in the dark and didn't get good clicks.. there are many restaurants of all types of cuisine around the bay.. you can also go for a boat ride.. ensure to see the fire works that starts at 7pm sharp.. it looks beautiful
,,Lovely view by night,5.0,,"Great place to walk, especially in the evening when everything is lit up. One of my favourite views of the city."

,,Stunning,5.0,,"Clean and beautiful, lights galore,walking at night is beautiful, pretty hotels and restaurants , boutique stores"
,,Cool night water show,5.0,,The bay front all part of the marina bay Hotel - everything is very modern and all the shops are exclusive brands. The night time show they put on (which is free) in the water with lights and music is very cool - think the bellagio in Las Vegas. Lots of restaurants too at the bay just a tad pricey for what you get.
,,If like lights and night life : must go place,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore and like nigh life, then you should not miss this place. Very colorful and lively during night time. There is light show happen every day around 7.30 & 9.30 evening time, which is must to watch out for.

,,The place!,5.0,,"Marina Bay and the Singapore river is for me the center of Singapore, its heart, so to speak. No doubt there may be other more important places to go to if you are on a business visit but for us regular tourists it is an absolute must. Just roam around the area and take in the environment. A lot of nice places to look at or to sit down and have a bite and refreshing drink. A haven guarded by skyscrapers but still the area is bright and plenty of sunshine."
,,Stunning place especially at night!,5.0,,We walked a good deal round the bay so saw a lot of it - after descending the Marina Bay Hotel we walked through the shopping mall onto the Bay. We were lucky enough to see a light show that was going on at the time - amazing. There are lots of restaurants dotted around and we ate at one in the old Custom House. It is worth allowing at least a couple of hours to wander round the bay.
,,Brilliant views,5.0,,"Great to look at and try and stay in a hotel with views of it. Really good when lit up at night. You can see the Bay Garden trees, Sands Hotel and the Singapore Flyer"
,,Lovely views,5.0,,"A great area to visit or stay day or night. If you are a F1 fan follow the road under the Singapore Flyer towards the water and you will be on the F1 track. You will reach the pit lane, grid and the pit garages. A must for any F1 fan. The road msrkings are clearly visible and the garages labelled with the driver's names on them.
When we visited there were only a few workers and no tourists...One of the best free thing to visit in Singapore"
,,One of the most beautiful (urban) places I've ever met,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful (urban) places I've ever met. Worth a night and a day tour. There are free and paid options. I suggest checking out the attractions for the day. From the marina bay you can have access to the Marina Bay Sands complex. The boat ride is a great option, which can be done day or night."
,,This is real heart of Singapore,5.0,,Great place to day day or nighttime. Located in the heart of SG provides amazing views to the bay and all skyscrapers district
,,Unlike anything I’ve ever seen,5.0,,This is an outstanding city! We spent 3 nights at the beginning of our SE Asia trip and 1 at the end in Singapore and the marina bay is such a beautiful place. There are constantly changing lights and visual effects along the entire bay. We took in the nightly light show which was 10x better than any fireworks and highly environmentally beneficial - like most things in Singapore. We must have walked the bay 3 full times in our short stay and never got over the awe of the skyline! Tons of free shows in the area make the price of cocktails not seem so bad!!
,,excellent..lovely views..great atmosphere,5.0,,"loved this area...stayed 3 nights and all I did was keep looking at the view, stunning, will return, thank you"
,,Wow,5.0,,I'm so happy and romantic mode. Cause very nice place . And one think child's very sefty in the Marine Bay. Every area CC camera setup. And people very comfortable. I like sea and ships I want to come again and again.
,,AN ABSOLUTE MUST!,5.0,,"I was in town for F1. Seriously, Singapore is on another level. I can only think of 2-3 other places that left me in awe. This is one. first of all, just walking around here and eating in the little restaurants around is breathtaking. I was in awe of human ingenuity, massive skyscrapers, wonderful hotels, stores on water....just amazing.

When I went it was FULL because it was F1 week, but still everything was well organized and well lit. Simply breathtaking.

My wife and I had dinner at the Fullerton Hotel near by......INCREDIBLE. I would recommend staying at a Hotel further out from Marina as they are super expensive and do feel like they are a bit of a price trap."
,,Happening place,5.0,,We err there at night. Simply beautiful. Restaurants and bars of all kinds ad all types of food. Boat tours are good and worth your time.
,,Lovely bay area walk and lights,5.0,,"We walked the 3,5km walk on our first day which was lovely in the day time with gorgeous views across the bay and plenty of places to stop for a drink.
We then returned at night to see the Illumi display of lights which was beautiful.
Visit at both times to enjoy a different feel. It's free to walk around and watch the light show."
,,Beautiful Night Scenery,4.0,,"It's a nice place to take a stroll after having your meals. There are quite a bit of activity going on in the vicinity at the same time. I can see quite a few runners having their training around this area too, which I would not recommend as it is too crowded at times. It would be better in the morning without the usual tourist crowd."
,,MARINA BAY AT NIGHT,5.0,,You will definitely have to see Marina Bay light show. They have two shows 8pm and 9pm. FREE! We also got on a boat and did a night tour. The lights of the Marina and surrounding buildings are amazing.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This place was the shopping mall and restaurant and food court. Also there was water fountain and activity boat go around . Nice place to cool down.
,,Marina Bay Lights Display,5.0,,"I headed down to Marina Bay to see the lights display and this place is once again beautiful. You have an awesome contrast between city skyscrapers and then the Marina Bay Sky Bar and red light bridge.

Whilst I was here there was a lights display and carnival. I highly recommend going down to the Marina bay."
,,Beautiful view of Singapore,5.0,,"Most of the tourist visited this place for the beautiful views. It is very hot to travel during the day, but during the night it is very beautiful due to the lighting of Singapore"
,,Beautiful views,4.0,,"Worth a walk, ride or scooter around the bay. Lots of stops for coffee, shopping and sightseeing. Plenty of opportunities for photos"
,,Center of Singapore Tourist Area,5.0,,"Around the marina is a plethora of thing to do and see. Obviously the Marina Sands sticks out as a focal point. But there are many other things to see. There is a great mall at the foot of the Marina Sands. There are a couple amusement parks, many restaurants, the Helix Bridge, hotels, museums, etc. And everything is within walking distance.

The amazing fact about this area is that it didn't exist 50 years ago. The entire area is constructed on reclaimed land. It all used to be in the ocean."
,,Sightseeing,5.0,,So wonderful to see the marina bay sand and all the structure around it. A lot of people but nevermind it you will still love the place
,,Gorgeous Romantic Views,5.0,,"Great place for exercise activities; walking, biking, and/or scooter while basking in the beauty that surrounds you. Day or Night, great place to be romantic!"
,,Beautiful day and night!,5.0,,It is a lovely place to go during day time if you don't mind the heat but I personally prefer to go after 5pm when the weather is not so hot.......
,,Very good area to wander around,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the Marina Bay area of Singapore. So much to do and see. Very good selection of restaurants and bars, and if you get too hot, you can go into the huge mall inserts Marina Bay Sands hotel.
Well worth going to see the light, laser and music display in the evening. We think viewing from the Marina Bay Sands side is best."
,,Central for every entertainment i sg,5.0,,"I spent 3 days in SG and i went here everyday bc they have all kinds of attractions here, esp if you like light shows/exhibition. It’s also quite nice to stroll along the bay. I just hope all the power they beed to light everything is ecofriendly, bc damn that’s a lot of lights"
,,Relaxed,4.0,,"I find it relaxing, but except for the hot weather. But the view is nice and the place is good for strolling with kids. Lot’s of food around. Best place to get ice cream."
,,Awesome spot to spend your evening,5.0,,"Marina Bay is one of the very popular spot of Singapore which is usually cover under most of the City Tour packages. You can get the good view of most of the Singapore popular attractions like Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands Skypark, etc. You can also enjoy the boat ride in Marina Bay, entry of Marina Bay is free but for Boat ride you need to spend some dollars."
,,Light show must see,5.0,,It is worth visiting the Marina Bay in the evening and combining it with the light show. We caught the 8 p.m. light show. It was spectacular. Should not miss the light show.
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"Marina Bay is just so beautiful to be described in words. The walk around Marina Bay is around 2-3 kms and gives the most beautiful and scenic views in the evening and night. Like most places in Singapore, this place is very well planned and clean n tidy surrounding with tall buildings adding to the beauty of the place. The Merlion, Marina Bay Sands buildings and the Fountain show in the evening is a must must watch."
,,This is ok for a few quick snap shots of the skyline but nothing special,3.0,,"The Marina Bay area is rather boring really. Its ok to walk through but lacks atmoshere in the shopping areas and when you walk outside to the decking there are a few spots to grab a few quick photos of the skyline, but again this is nothing special and I doubt anyone would be disappointed if they missed it. If you are in the area its ok for a quick look, but as I mentioned it is nothing special and not worth a special trip to see unless you were already coming to see something else here in the area"
,,Great place,5.0,,It is a nice area in front of the Gardens to stroll or Take a boat trip. There is a big mall in the area and the singing Fontaine. It is a laisure place full of tourists.
,,Urban design masterpiece,5.0,,"There is some interesting history behind the whole Marina Bay and Marina Bay Sands areas. I recommend reading about that before you come so you can fully appreciate the urban design masterpieces in the area. It is designed for masses of people and so it can hold many many people without feeling too crowded. Much of the space is outside so if it is really hot or raining, dress and time your visit accordingly. Pathways are wide and easily navigable by people with mobility issues. We didn't see any public toilets but I am sure the buildings in the area will have some open to the public. The Marina Bay Sands complex definitely does. I would recommend coming during the day and also in the evening to experience the light shows. Two totally different experiences to savour and enjoy."
,,Very Nice Area to Stroll and Relax.,4.0,,"Plenty of bars, eateries and pleasant views of the bay and surrounding area. We visited on a Sunday when all the locals and families were enjoying the bayside facilities."
,,Great place to visit.,5.0,,"We visited on a Public Holiday and it was very busy. However, once past the ticketing there was plenty of room to move. Overall it was absolutely magic. When visiting go in the afternoon and stay for the light show as it is a must see. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,Loved the Marina Bay,5.0,,"Loved the Marina Bay, we sat on the steps next to the Merlion, which is a fountain that lights up at night, it is huge. The Fullerton Hotel is beautiful and one of the oldest buildings in the Marina. We just loved sitting there people watching. A great place to visit."
,,Best City Views in Singapore,5.0,,"it is always a favourite place coming to Singapore, the views of Marina Bay Sands ( especially at night when the lights shows coming on) and the views into the CBD.

its is a great walk around flanked by bars, restaurants and shopping and other entertainment."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Beautiful marina. Great place for families. Lots of entertainment and food places. Kids fair and good walking place.
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,The Singapore know more than a thing or two about design. This area is a must if you visit. Your camera will be clicking away at the perfect modern architecture. Hotels and business towers look elegant against the water with its tourist boats. Love it!
,,Scenic city walk,5.0,,"A stroll around the Marina Bay must be one of the most scenic city walks available. The water, the Singapore skyline, the amazing Marina Bay Sands, the Merlion. There are so many sight that you reach for the camera every 20 meters. Highly recommended."
,,Clean and organic was but it can get really busy in the day!,3.0,,Clean and tidy. We went here as part of a city tour around Singapore. In the day it gets hot so dress sensibly and there are lots of tourists (rich coming from me...as I’m one too!) You should go at night as the lighting of the city across the bay gives the whole place a different dimension. We went to the MasterCard theatre there - the musical was cancelled whilst we were there so we walked around after! Safe at night too.
,,Lovely Place!!!!,5.0,,Lovely place to walk-in Morning or Night. I went there twice one in the morning to discover the area second in the night to see the Fountain show. It was amazing!!
,,Beautiful at sunset,4.0,,"Walking along the bay, enjoying the reflection of the sun on the glass windows of the skypark building . Nice view"
,,Brilliant place to spend an evening,5.0,,"Spent some time here before sunset by the Merlion, then watching the nightly laser/fountain/light show. It was lovely to sit on a balmy night taking it all in - the amazing city lights, the people,the reflections - just brilliant."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"Worth a visit day or night, but at 9:00pm each night there is a light and fountain show - not to be missed."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Awesome attraction, loved architecture and views. Impressive Hotel and views on the deck are Magnificent"
,,Best part of Singapore,5.0,,"Me and my partner spent 3 days in Singapore, we stayed in Clark quay but we made sure to come by the Marina bay every day. It is so stunning. Amazing views. Best place ever !"
,,i Light Marina Bay improved the evening experience,3.0,,"The light show at Marina Bay Sands is really quite mediocre. All that laser technology completely wasted by a total lack of creativity. Dismal! The March to April i Light marina bay event somewhat improves the experience of walking around the bay in the evening and the projections on the Merlion are pretty good and entertaining. Around the bay there are lots of good places to eat and drink as well as museums and other attractions worth a visit but the bay itself hardly qualifies as an attraction. The water tends to be very murky, especially after rain (which is a constant weather element), in sharp contrast with the ocean beyond the barrier. Best plan is to have a particular attraction or restaurant in mind and enjoy that."
,,A very enjoyable place!,5.0,,"When I went to Singapore I was surprised by this beautiful place, I enjoyed walking around the gardens among many tourists, in total safety and serenity"
,,Beautiful place to enjoy the night,5.0,,"Beautiful place to enjoy the night. Everything colorful at night. The trees, the helix bridge, the ferris wheel."
,,morning ...day or night...visit,5.0,,morning ...day or night...just visit...there is always something happening and the view is endless....people are friendly around you because they are also happy being there and like us enjoying the atmosphere
,,Boat on the Marina,5.0,,"It is good even just looking and walking around the marina but if you want to know more about the history and see Clarke Quay and other locations then take the tour boat

The tour boat comes complete with a narrator who tells you the history, it is well worth doing"
,,Another must see!,5.0,,"Even for a half hour stroll, I highly recommend any visitor of any age, to take the time to visit the Marina Bay. It is so perfectly representative of the gorgeous Singapore many know from the most professional travel photographs seen around the world. I highly recommend you experience this area for yourself to soak it all in... a great intro to your Singapore visit."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,I just loved the water show here. The mall is pretty good and huge. Also there is a casino in the mall.
,,Like a mini-Sydney harbour and lovely to walk in the evening.,5.0,,Surrounded by skyscrapers lit at night there is free entertainment and loads of places to sit and eat and drink. We walked across the cricket green to get there. There is an interesting sound and light show across the bay in front of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel every evening at 8 and 9 pm. There are dancing fountains at the same time but If you want to see them you need to cross the Helix bridge and walk to your right along the board walk. Beware you could get wet if you're too close!
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Excellent location with great views of the river and Marina Bay Sands. It is best to visit it in the evening when it is very well lit.
,,Amazing location to experience Singapore,5.0,,"Having lived in Singapore for more than a decade, this place never makes me bored. I go there so frequently and every single time I’m there, there’ll be something that I’ve never seen before. Be it a new art installation, a new light show, free performance at the open theatre outside the esplanade, the list can go in and on and on... This is a must do item to walk around the area in the evening and you’ll love it for sure :)"
,,Beautiful Scenery,5.0,,I would recommend to go on the evening around 6pm but depend on the sunset. Beautiful places to walk around
,,"Spectacular, simply spectacular.",5.0,,"Every aspect of this complex is fun, beautiful and breath taking. Everyone knows the iconic hotel with the ""boat on top"" but there is so much more. The mall offers the shopaholic unlimited high end shops. Restaurants, food court, ice cream shops and speciality stores in abundance. The Louis Verton shop is a tourist attraction in itself. It is an island in the bay with tunnel access. The theater is a must. So big. We saw Evita. Oh what a circus oh what a show."
,,Excellent exploring,4.0,,Much to do around the bay. We took a river cruise by night and took in the lights and water/sound/light show of the MBS
,,Memorable,5.0,,Singapore Marina Bay at night shines like a jewel - all along the Marina Bay there are many restaurants catering for all tastes
,,best place at SG !,5.0,,what a view !! must visit during any SG visit walk around the water body and enjoy the view. Best place. Food street adjacent to this where u can taste local flavors of food !
,,Nice view at Night...,3.0,,Good to travel to see the night lights but for the lights show better to stay on the Esplanade side then Merlion side. Be aware the restaurants around there are expensive!
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Fantastic, I’m speechless, no wonder why is most instagrammed hotel in the world, MUST see and visit"
,,excellent spot,5.0,,"I loved Singapore and this place. Excellent for taking amazing pictures. You can see Marina Bay from a lot of different places in the city. At nights, it looks better than during daytime."
,,Up and coming area that is being rebuilt,5.0,,Very nice area that Singapore is rebuilding into a more family orientated destination. Many boat rides in the bay. There is a mini carnival location as well. Easy to get there on the MRT. In a couple more years it will be amazing what they build on location.
,,You have to go here if you are in Singapore,5.0,,"Great way to spend a day or two just walking around and seeing all the sights. Must go to the top of the Sands, must go to the cloud forest and gardens next door. Must see the laser light show at night, preferably from the top of the sands. Lots of sights, shopping, eating, people watching, etc."
,,Lots to see and to do,5.0,,"There is a lot to do in the are during the day and night; restaurants, cafés, shops, hotels and sightseeing. Light shows are in the evening and make the modern part of the city shine to the next level."
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"This location is very important to visit it when you come to Singapore, it has an amazing view for the bay and the bridge plus marina bay sand its recommended."
,,Lovely bay,5.0,,"Marina Bay is very pretty lit up at night, and there is a breeze here during the day! It’s a beautiful place to walk around."
,,Beautiful area of Singapore,5.0,,"It was lovely walking around the Marina Bay. You will find a museum, upmarket shopping mall, restaurants and of course the famous Marina Bay Hotel.. Worth the walk around."
,,Excellent spot,5.0,,This is an excellent place to walk and enjoy the Singapore skyline in the early morning or late evening.
,,great boat trip round the Bay.,5.0,,Wife and I done the boat trip with my Brother-In-Law whom we were visiting while on holiday in Singapore. Very worth while doing boat trip as you learn what all the different buildings are and all about what is happening in the Bay. We then went back at night for the water and laser light show which was spectacular. Would certainly recommend this and would love to go back to sww it at some time.
,,Perfect night water and light show.perfect location,5.0,,Perfect location for shopping and enjoy.ı recommend a boat trip at night.garden by Thé way is very closed.beuatiful view .
,,An absolute must do dream,5.0,,"It has a long walking trail all around the waterfront, taking in the Merlion, passing One Fullerton, one of the oldest buildings, now a hotel, on the waterfront, the Helix Bridge, the Arts and Science Museum and not forgetting Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

The waterfront hosts lots of different free performances throughout the year so we made sure we checked out what was going on. There are also lots of little food concessions and the Co Nut Ink ice-creams were absolutely to die for. We must also mention there is a walkway showcasing Olympic sports and also before the Helix Bridge featuring pictures drawn by young children about their aspirations for the future, one of them had even been turned into a sculpture! There is a nightly laser and light show in the Harbour at 8pm and 9pm, not to be missed but do co-ordinate it with the Gardens by the Bay light show at 7.45 and 8.45!"
,,Lovely area to wander around,5.0,,Lovely scenic area of the city. Plenty to see and do. Light display in the evening. Plenty of eating places around.
,,Spend the Day!,5.0,,"There’s enough here to keep you occupied for a whole day. There’s endless shopping and eating establishments, and the Marina Bay Sands is something to see! For the port: the cruise ship port is clean and modern if you are sailing from there. There is a MRT stop for the port (currently the last stop on the line) however you will have about a 5-10 minute walk to the pier. The walkway is wide and smooth enough to roll your bags."
,,a required stop !,4.0,,"Marina Bay is an absolutely gorgeous spectacle especially at night. And most impressive is the water show at the Marina Bay Sands hotel where gatherers can gaze into the bay and enjoy the spectacular water and light show at night for free. Also, patrons can take a boat ride from the Marina Bay Sands hotel into Marina Bay to the Merlion statue and eventually to Clark Quay in a span of 30 - 45 min. Visiting here is tantamount to visiting the Bund in Shanghai or Hong Kong Bay at night. These are absolute required visits which will keep you coming back again and again."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,Of course you can't visit Singapore without seeing this. Nice light show at night and we also saw nice fireworks as well.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Very beautiful view of the Singapore skyline. Tends to be crowded at times but we still managed to swing by there every night. In my opinion it's a synonym for Singapore. Go see it.
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"If you travel to Singapore, this is the area your must plan a visit to. Lots of activity. We saw the fireworks for Chinese New Year. You won't be bored!"
,,Great views and lovely ice cream!,5.0,,"Strolling night or day this is a fascinating walk with many points of interest, loved the J cone Korean ice cream and every vista. You can walk right round the Bay via the helix bridge."
,,"Shopping, views, casino, restaurants..it has it all",4.0,,"Very pleasant precinct to spend a couple of hours browsing the very modern shopping complex, kicking back at one of the many bars and taking in the view of the Singapore CBD, or taking the lift to the 57th floor of tower 2 to take in the rooftop infinity pool ( open only to hotel guests) or visit the bar for a drink and spectacular views."
,,A good day out!,4.0,,"Plenty to do here - lots of different themed gardens and lakes. Plus spectacular sculptured 'trees' which are illuminated at night. There's also the major attractions of the flower and tropical forest domes which are not too pricey and worth at least a visit to one of them - both are perhaps a bit much on the same day!l

Do the walks around the gardens earlier - shelter from the heat in the domes later pm and then you can catch the spectacular lighting after dusk"
,,Interesting busy area with a lot going on - an exciting place!,4.0,,"So much going on here - from dawn to dusk. Museums, shopping cafes, bars and fireworks every Friday night at 9pm. Go there!"
,,Beautiful area,5.0,,"Visited during Chinese New Year...had a lot going on at night..street food, festivals, rides. Entry to festival was free"
,,"Whenever you see images of Singapore, you are looking at Marina Bay",4.0,,"Singapore has an interesting mixture of architecture and functional decisions all around the city, this can give you beautiful contrasts between classical design and modern practical spaces and there is no better example to this than Marina Bay.

It would be a lie to say Marina Bay is the most beautiful place in the world or Singapore, but at night it shines with its own light (sort of speaking... in reality, it shines with lasers and light beams coming from lots of different buildings )

I have mentioned in a different review that, areas around Marina Bay are particularly void of commercial activity in the morning, activating itself slowly throughout the day becoming a beaming spot and the centre of attention of the city at night. Sort of like a frat boy that parties through the night and crashes before dawn, sleeping all morning and waking up for a brunch at 3 pm, just to repeat everything once more as the days go by.

What does it offer?

- Stunning views of the most iconic buildings in Singapore.
- Art and culture expressed by several theatres and some museums.
- Amazing shopping experience with a gigantic (the definition of gigantic is subjective) shopping mall ready to take you in.
- Good restaurants.
- A relaxing atmosphere
- A bit of the fusion of cultures composing the picture of current Singapore.
- Did I mention the views?

What does not offer?

- The classical/traditional Singapore, for that you need to go to little India, China town or the Arabic town.
- The history behind this organised and super clean place.
- The nature as almost everything around here is completely artificial... and I got to tell you, Singapore has some beautiful views of their landscape and natural places. The natural Singapore is well reduced to small pockets spread around but quite beautiful and well worth visiting.

Have this in mind, is hard to describe the experience without rambling for too long and it will depend on what you appreciate the most. I liked the food and atmosphere around. Took photos like crazy of the Marina Bay Sands and the bridges, but a nature lover could easily get bored of these views quite quickly.

To get here, get out of the subway at Raffles Place, City Hall or Bay Front stations and enjoy."
,,Great City Views.,5.0,,"take this all in in the evening. Spectacular views of the city, a ride along the river, past the Merlion, City's Memorial, a stop at Clarke Quay. A great way to see the city."
,,Must see when in Singapore.,5.0,,After some shopping at this wonderful mall Marina Bay we sat down on the boardwalk to witness this fantastic fountain laser show at night. The tall modern buildings were all lit up & with the light & water show with music it was absolutely spectacular. A must see for sure when in Singapore & it is FREE!!!
,,Heaven on earth 🤗,5.0,,I don't know where should I start about this place because to my this place is absolutely heaven on earth. The way how they designed the buildings and everything is just like magic... They have everything you need over there ... I it's more then I could describe. I'll be back in the future to see what's else they are going to create
,,A Bay emerges through superb urban advancement,5.0,,"On 2016 I first visited this area & again this February I again went there along with my family. Visitors to Singapore should put Marina Bay on their bucket list. It depicts modern Singapore in one sight. It has different identities one at day time & another one at night time. Both are soothing & attractive. This very systematically developed bay gives a clear picture about Singapore skyline, spectacular view of famous landmarks like the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Esplanade, the Singapore flyer, the Helix Bridge, the Art Science Museum, the iconic Merlion, super-tree groves & so on. Total Marina Bay area is surrounded by near about 06 MRT stations so it is very easy for excess. At night, the whole area becomes magical, colorful & blissful. Laser show, spectra the light & water show, colorful tree groves bring life to the area.

The whole area is very wide so it's better to go there in the afternoon & then continue up to evening to have both views. During midday scorching light may directly lead to discomfort. The Marina Bay Museum and ArtScience Museum could be visited for learning about Singapore's history and its advancement in the new era.

Whole the environment seems to be ecstatic."
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,"Still, Marina Bay is a very great scenery in SG. One should not miss this place. Everywhereitis clean and well planned, my ideal place to walk and work."
,,Great vibe for a workplace,4.0,,"I have been here the 2nd time and I love the vibe you get . Open, enough light and great skyscrapers with lots of space. It's a great place to work."
,,Beautiful Nightly Light Show,4.0,,"Marina Bay and its landmark buildings are amazing sites especially lit up at night. In the evening, there is a laser light show. Well worth a look whether it is at street level or from of the taller buildings."
,,Always a new experience.,5.0,,"Having visited numerous times since 1989 it is always amazing to see what has changed. From seeing the marina area as an empty space of recently reclaimed land to what it is now is truly astonishing. Even the Merlion has moved a few yards further out, as it was previously in the other side of the road which previously didn't exist.

The Sands Hotel, part of the skyscraper skyline and the barrage didn't exist 11 years ago, and the marina has changed from sea water to a freshwater lake. You will never be bored here, especially with the extra entertainment, fireworks and music at the River Hongboa during the Chinese New Year period.

There are more places to eat and drink than you can ever imagine, but be prepared to pay plenty to take advantage of them."
,,So pretty and fun!,5.0,,This entire area offers dining and night fun! Watch the sailboats go by while sipping a cool drink outside a number of restaurants.
,,Amazing and beautiful,5.0,,"From the hotels, to the malls to the views absolutely stunning. Anywhere you turn something more and bigger and better will be in site."
,,A Great Place to take a Boat-Cruise,5.0,,The Marina bay surrounded as it is by both traditional/historic and also modern buildings is a great place to see on a boat cruise.
,,Not a Must-See Place,2.0,,"The best view point is on the deck outside of the Hotel Marina Sands. other than that, it’s just another touristy spot that caters people who will line up at LV store. Good luck finding the entrances to the hotel from view deck, a long walk will wait for you."
,,WOW PLACE,5.0,,GO at night and u can see view wil not be believe.fantastic singapore is a one of example of singapore.
,,fantastic fountain show,5.0,,"We are waiting by the bay opposite the entry of the Marina Bay hotel to see free fountain show, was fantastic time and beautiful. This is the thing you should not miss when visiting Singapore."
,,Such a Unique Cityscape,5.0,,Singapore has such a modern and unique cityscape and Mariana Bay is the best place to soak it all in.
,,Good view if you don't mind queues,4.0,,"The queues really tested our patience, both going up and coming down. The view, especially in the night are not to be missed.
One suggestion is to go to the rooftop bar if that is an option. You cut the queue and get the view. Didn't check the cover charges though."
,,Amazing,5.0,,There is such amazing architecture to the whole of Marina Bay! The views here are incredible- it is a must when travelling to Singapore.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"You must visit here especially at night. The light and water show is gorgeous. Also visit the restaurants
And stroll around the bay. While there and you want to do a little gambling visit the Marina Bay Casino
But don’t forget your passports or your not going in. Lesson learned."
,,Walk and enjoy,5.0,,"If you are traveling with your better half den this is the place.. hands in hands and a long romantic walk by the bay.. if you with kids, enjoy the breeze and let them cycle while you sit back and relax.. this place offer alot of different things for all kind of visitors. Its an all day activity as the places and malls nearby will keep u busy for hours"
,,BEAUTIFUL LASER NIGHT SHOW,5.0,,The area around here is beautiful. There are many restaurants and places to eat and drink and the views are great. Really nice atmosphere and there is a nighty laser /water show which is absolutely beautiful - a must see whilst in Singgapore
,,Highlight of our trip! Amazing view!,5.0,,"Amazing view seems to be an understatement. Marina Bay Sands has a light show which has a good view from Fullerton Bay. If luxury goods are your thing, Marina Bay Sands is the place to go if you do not want to head to Orchard Road."
,,Modern Singapore in a nutshell,5.0,,"Visitors to Singapore, especially first-timers, should put Marina Bay on their bucket list. It gives you a general idea of how beautiful and modern the city is, with all its skyscrapers, posh bars and restaurants, shops, and spectacular view of famous landmarks (like the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Esplanade with its distinguishable durian-looking concert halls, the Helix Bridge, the ArtScience Museum, and of course the water-spewing Merlion). It is also a good place for early morning or late afternoon physical exercise or strolling. You can also go on a short boat cruise around the area (lasting for about 30 mins) and enjoy the city's skyline. At night, the whole area is lit up wonderfully. There are occasional light and water shows, too. Marina Bay is one place I keep on coming back to every time I visit Singapore. But I would suggest that you don't go there at the peak of the midday or afternoon heat and also when the place is overcrowded with tourists pushing one another to get selfies with the Merlion statue. Better visit the place early in the morning."
,,If you visit Singapore you must visit Marina Bay,4.0,,"I was only in Singapore for a stopover, but had to visit the landmarks and sites. Marina Bay is that iconic place to visit, with excellent views. I just wish I had more time."
,,Singapore's Jewel indeed!,5.0,,"Marina bay is not just an observatory deck, it is amazing, attractive and one must go place when you are in Singapore. The spectacular view, the picturesque touristy place. Not too far from metro and Gardens by the bay also connects to this. There is a Sampan Chinese boat ride also inside Marina Bay which is a nice experience.
Observatory Deck, Sampan ride they all have individual tickets."
,,Shopping at the bay,4.0,,"Very crowded during the CNY holiday. Lots of shops and bargains. Easy access by train and bus. However, we notice a lot of foreigners instead of locals working at most of the shops, which sometime can be very frustrating if they cannot converse well."
,,Worth Strolling Around At Night,4.0,,"Worth a stroll around at night. The lit up buildings give an atmosphere not there in the day time. The ""light show"" was a dissapointment. Across from VivovCity on Sentosa Island near the Aquarium is a light and music show with industrial cranes teling a story of two birds. Now that is very very clever indeed! Well worth attending (free). Al my family including 5 yr old son sat in raptures."
,,Best view in the night - marina bay,5.0,,"Visit Marina Bay in the evening to view the laser light show of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is a visual spectacle. You can also try going around the bay in a cruiser. We enjoyed, walking, hiring a scooter, biking and excellent food. Look out for the electric scooter hire to save your legs."
,,Nice area to walk in,5.0,,"This is a beautiful area, with some of the most iconic sights in Singapore, stay until it is dark, and there will be a beautiful light show, at the marina. It is worth staying for."
,,Marina Bay amd Merlion.,5.0,,Beautiful place to watch the world go by. Bright and busy very lively the night we visited and grest fireworks display.
,,If you can afford it - do it!,4.0,,"This hotel would have to be on everyone's buckets list, it is simply stunning. The atrium / reception area is huge and spreads between the three towers, and one has to go into this area to frequent the specialty shops that seem to spread underground for miles, - a shopaholics delight if you can afford it. The bay walk area is a great place to sit and simply admire the foreshore and opposite shore which includes the ""Merlion"""
,,Nice area,4.0,,Nice area to walk around and watch the views. Day and night are both nice. Close to the MBS shops so you can cool off in the air-conditioned mall.
,,Trip to Singapore,5.0,,One of the best architecture in the world. We spend time during the day and also spend some time in the Bar during night.
,,Must Visit in Singapore,5.0,,"You have not really visited Singapore if you have not been to the Marina Bay Area. It's a great sightseeing spot and there are plenty of things to see and do around. You could indulge in luxury shopping, go on a supercar drive, cruise on a boat, observe the beautiful Singapore skyline, visit the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, watch the free water fountain light show in the evening, etc. There is plenty to experience in the area."
,,Light show spectacular,5.0,,"We arrived in Marina bay at 7.30 ready for the 8.00 light show.
Got a place on the boardwalk ready for the show, great way to see the city skyline lit up at night.
Water and music show well worth seeing, Singapore has a lot of free events and this is worth getting to the bay area to see."

,,:),5.0,,The atmosphere is amazing over there. Beautiful views. Amazing lights. Nice place to have an evening walk

,,Amazing,5.0,,"If you can find a place to sit and look at the big buildings as day turns to night, you will not regret it! So beautiful to watch the buildings slowly light up in the darkening evening."
,,Magnificent and Stunning.,4.0,,"Went at night after visiting some bars and trying some Hawker food at locations near Marina Bay. Laser show great, but the whole thing without laser is better. Beautiful and impressive, yet not too much. Restaurants and bars close really nice. Well worth the walk and time spent."
,,Big - Get ready to Walk,3.0,,"We took in most of Marina Bay trying to find the entrance to Gardens by the Bay. It was a long, wet walk! Not the highlight of trip. The mall seemed sparsely filled with shops and places to eat."
,,An interesting place to walk around,4.0,,We had a late night walk and an early morning one and both were interesting. The laser show at night was very good with lots of couples sitting watching. Lots of places to eat around the Marina too. Our day time walk was different as we did the whole way round stopping to look at the Malls - which were huge! - and it took us about 90 minutes.
,,Good view at night,5.0,,The best view in Singapore would probably the Marina Bay area. Facing the bay from one fullerton area one would be captivated by the shining LV store.
,,A beautiful place to stroll in the city,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a beautiful place to take a walk. It is easy to walk around the whole Bay as there is a pedestrian walk that goes around the entire Bay and includes a bridge that looks like a double helix. There is a lot to stop and look at, restaurants, cafes, bars, the Marina Bay Sands hotel with the paid outlook on top, and tour buses are frequently stopping all around the area as well. A nice place to get a feel for the downtown heart of Singapore."
,,struck to the depth of my soul!,5.0,,"Me and my wife have been there two years ago, but I`ve still remember all emotions I felt from the first our visit. All evenings we spent there by walking around! There were a lot of cafes (fancy and easy food courts) around. I highly recommend for visit this main city`s sight!"

,,A must do in the evening,5.0,,I have to say that the skyline in the evening is impressive. And only do this in the eveving as it is too hot to be at it in the morning or afternoon. You can walk all the way to Boat quay or Clark quay and have a bite as well.
,,Always Changing,4.0,,"Whenever we come to Marina Bay there is always something new happening, a vibrant place to visit. It clean and safe to walk around any time."

,,Amazing city view at night!,5.0,,"The place literally glitters with all the lights of the skyscrapers. There is a light and music show every night at 9 pm (available to all free of cost) which is truly a treat to the eyes. At times over the weekend they also have another show at 10pm. The 15 mins of this show is truly mesmerizing and one of the best things to see if you are in Singapore.

,,Everything is there,5.0,,"So it’s really like a small city with everything there. The casino, sky park, exhibitions, theatre , gardens and hotel as well as the 100s of shops and food outlets. There is a lovely digital light canvas on near the food court on the ground floor. So much to see and do you can spend hours in here. Did find the signposts a little confusing. Shops from high end to high street brands. Same with eateries and there is a wolgang puck restaurant there. Lots of levels and also things going on outside too. Easily accessible MRT, taxis. Great architecture and even got little gondolas and waterways. Definitely worth going and spending a few hours there. We managed to go back 3 times on our trip so much to see and do around there."
,,Upmarket and pretty,4.0,,We went there just before the Chinese New Year and the place was all orchids and lanterns. The laser show at night is quite nice . The place has good food court on a budget. Crowd watching is fun here.

It is accessible by train, bus or taxi. The views of the massive skyscrapers in the central business district are memorable as was the short circular cruise on the river by boat.
The Merlion has been renovated and moved to s better site since our last visit.
The viewing platform on the 58th floor of the Marina Bays Sabds Hotel gives spectacular views over the bay and open sea as well as the nearby park and greenhouses.

The site should be visited by day and by night - the lights are great. The best attraction is the free laser show every evening."

,,Nice place to visit and enjoy,4.0,,A great shopping area with lots of restaurants and the hotel too. It is enjoyable to spend some time here
,,Fabulous for shopping and dining....,5.0,,A wonderful time was spent in Orchard Road and Marina Bay. If you like shopping you will not be disappointed. Here there are bustling shopping malls selling luxury goods to souvenirs with many designer stores in sight. I didn't know which direction to go in first!....there is a vast array of goods here and we spent at least four hours browsing and shopping. A must visit!
,,Beautiful spot,5.0,,"this is a spot for seeing the sights, shopping, or eating in a fantastic food court. It is right on the water and you can walk all around the bay and across the mouth of the bay on a bridge. Every angle seem to present different shots of the marvelous Singapore architecture."
,,Ars nova and spectacu,5.0,,"I like the buildings most from the outside, from different angels and perspectives. It is so beautifully integrated in the Singapore superintelligent lay-out and being. Very few buildings in the world fullfil the city landscape like this. It is an icon that will last.
I don’t know much about the hotel itself. I know I wouldn’t stay there, and from the looks of it, it seems like a bit of a chaotic luxury place.
We went up to the top floor (unbelievably expensive!). Fantastic views of the most beautiful modern city in the world, in my humble opinion......"

,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We spent hours simply walking round The Bay looking at the sights and sounds of Singapore...calling in the odd bar for a beer or two!! Worth doing
,,Excellent place for walking,5.0,,"The bay area is neat and clean and the way things are connected makes it an excellent place for a morning or afternoon stroll. The water is actually Singapore's drinking water supply and is kept clean by restricting access and water sports. A good explanation of what has been done is at Gardens by the Bay. The area tends to get very crowded, especially on weekends. An excellent spot to photograph the Marina Bay Sands is from the Esplanade. I try and come here at least once every time I am in Singapore as I enjoy the exercise, and access via various MRT stations is easy."
,,Beautiful Architectural Palce,5.0,,"What a beauty of this Building, the design and beauty is mostly desirable on night. I have seen it on day time but like the beauty on night. I will recommend travelers to go at Night and spend 2 hours at least."
,,Amazing early morning or after 6pm when the heat subsides.,4.0,,fantastic atmosphere. people watching. something for everyone. if your on a budget - get down about 5:30 and grab yourself a free lounger or chair and watch the city wake up when the sun sets. simple things in life are best - stunning

The Marina Sands Bay complex is a sight to behold, absolutely stunning & just amazing how it has been constructed. The bay has many other features and the tour boats are now electrically powered so no noise or pollution like the previous Bum Boats."

,,Amazing POOL Views!,5.0,,"Spacious & very accommodating room. The bed was very very comfortable, the bathroom was so big!! Similar in size to a luxurious Las Vegas room. The infinity pool was crowded, but the views around Singapore was worth it. Also, the hotel is adjacent to many shoppes!! Overall, very beautiful and clean. My style of hotel rooms for sure!"
,,Competitive Singapore,4.0,,"Marina Bay is unrecognisable from 10 years ago. The Lion finally has a firm home, restaurants and bars have grown around the edge a new bridge, music stage and now a nightly laser show to compete with Hong Kong. Possibly the best example of Singapore development it is popular, you run the selfie stick gauntlet in places but it is family and tourist friendly, if not wallet friendly."

,,Lovely Area,5.0,,Great area to walk around with lots of shops and sights to take pictures of. Only problem is its popular (of course!). I wouldn't let that put you off but when its hot it gets a little tiring. Another must see area of Singapore
,,Expensive shops and restaraunts.,5.0,,Go during the day and have a walk around. For teens there's a big funfair with various attractions. If you find yourself there at 6/7 pm it's worth finding somewhere to sit as they do a really fantastic lights water and laser show at 8 and 9 pm although it started a little later when we were there. It's fantastic and well worth seeing.
,,Recommended Evening Walk!,5.0,,"Always visiting Marina Bay when we travel to Singapore. Why?
It has a city view, great sunset, good for walk, good dining with a spectacular lighting show.
Those are some of the reasons we went there from time to time.

Marina Bay is connected to the Garden by the Bay, from the Marina Bay Hotel & Mall, you can simply walk through and to the garden.
We chose to go to Garden by the Bay (i will shortened this term into GBTB for easy writing ) in the afternoon. Starting from 3-4 pm onwards, unless you want to go to all attraction in GBTB, then you should start between 11am-1pm.

We usually travel with family, with elders. That November, was the first time we walk around (full round) of Marina Bay area. From GBTB, Marina Bay Mall, Helix Bridge, Esplanade, Merlion Statue, and then we end the tour by having dinner.
Enjoy the beautiful sunset at Helix Bridge. I guess that's the best location, just to sit at the deck between the bridge, and watch the sun goes down.
When feeling tired, you can simply sit and enjoy the Bay-view in front of the Esplanade.
Starting at 8pm (or 7pm, I forgot), they have lighting show in front of Marina Bay Mall, which we can enjoy during our dinner.

Unless you want to see the beautiful light from the Supertree Groove at GBTB, you should go back there. 7pm is the last time you can see the light installation at Supertree Groove.

Walk towards Raffles Place to get to the nearest MRT to go home.
Have a try, our parents enjoy this trip much, and they don't feel so much tired even walking far enough.
Singapore has a feet-friendly-pedestrian!"
,,Must in Singapore - Adorable view and Laser show,5.0,,"Must do in Singapore - Walk from Merlion park, the floating football stadium and Laser show (8.00 pm and 9.00 pm) free.

,,Incredible light show and night view,5.0,,Visited Marina Bay and Merlion for couple times and never missed to watch the light show which started around 8pm every night. The best view if you want to take a photo of the light show is from Merlion location. Chose the best spot to get the best pictures. Part of it you can also visit garden by the bay which is only take around 15 to 20 minutes walk. Enjoy the beautiful night view
,,Great place with a showcase of magnificent sights,5.0,,"What views? Stunning during the day and spectacular at night when the buildings are lit up.

It provides easy access to everywhere."
,,"Eye poppingly nice, a photographer's dream",5.0,,"No matter where you stand, from MBS or by the concert hall, the views along Marina Bay are absolutely incredible and worth a visit any time. If you are staying in a nearby hotel there are fabulous running paths that will take you as far as you want to go. Well serviced by the MRT, but there is a bit of a 5-10 min walk involved no matter what station you alight. For great city views, come at sunrise or at dusk. During the day, the walkway along the bay is not sheltered and you will get the brunt of the sun. Better yet, do your research and book a hotel room overlooking the bay, city side. For tourists: I've been here at all hours and it's very safe and no one bothers you."

,,Most beautiful night cityscape in Singapore,5.0,,"If you wish to take in the city lights, Marina Bay offers the best in Singapore. I would recommend starting in the early evening around 6:30pm when it starts to cool. There are many possible starting points and routes. Following is one suggestion.

Start at Raffles Place (take the train there) and walk to UOB Plaza to start your walk along the Singapore River. You will see Botero's Bird Sculpture. Walk south (downstream) towards Cavenagh Bridge. You should see some local sculptures (see if you can spot Kucinta and her kittens). Cross the pedestrian bridge and turn right to head towards an underpass leading to Queen Elizabeth Walk. Walk along the bay (on your right) and head towards the Esplanade (locals call it the Durian as it resembles the fruit). You may wish to go into the Esplanade for some cool air-conditioning and grab an early dinner in one of the many food outlets/restaurants such that when you continue on the rest of the walk later the sun would have set and the buildings in the area would be lit up.

The second part of the walk along the bay would be from the Esplanade to Marina Bay via the Helix (pedestrian) Bridge. If you prefer the outdoors you may continue your walk to Gardens by the Bay else you may stroll into the Marina Bay shopping area as an alternative place to find dinner. To complete the round trip, take a boat taxi from Marina Bay to cross back to Fullerton Bay. The Clifford Pier restaurant at Fullerton Bay is also a great place to have a nice dinner. At Clifford Pier, walk towards your right and you will reach the Merlion Park. On this side of the bay you will be well positioned to watch the free 15-minute light and water show courtesy of Marina Bay Sands every night at 8pm and 9pm (and additionally at 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays)."

There’s a mall and a “hawkers” food market that has lots of good food and drinks. We waited to watch the water and light show that we misunderstood was near the merlion sculpture. We sat near the amphitheater and watched a prettygood local cover band play American songs.

,,Amazing at night !!!,5.0,,"This was an absolutely amazing part of our three day trip to Singapore.

What we did and what worked out really well;

We arrived at 5.30pm to the bayfront station and got a view outside the marina bay sands hotel in daylight. We then headed back into the mall, enjoyed the christmas decor and shops and had some dinner.

There are plenty of food places on B2 and B1 right at either end of the mall.

By the time we finished dinner we heades outside and it was dark. I was mesmorised with the tall skyscrapers and lights across the marina bay. It was a spectacular view!! Take some photos with a proper camera here as your phone may not capture the light action!

We headed east out of the mall towards the helix bridge. Have some fresh coconut ice cream or melon ice cream from the 2 stalls located just before the outdoor theatre.

The first fountain light show starts at 8pm and lasts 15mins. Either watch this right outside the mall or from the seating area just before the theatre by the bay. Spectacular lights and music.

Wall further across jubilee bridge to see the merlion statue which is better at night than day i believe. You can complete a full circular walk along the bay back to bayfront station."

We went to a restaurant on the groundfloor next to the inside “canal”, don’t do that but go all the wat up to the bar."

,,Marina Bay Wow!,5.0,,"There is sooooo much to do here. It is worth a few visits, both at day and night. The gardens are amazing - day time to see the gorgeous orchids and night time to see the lights. Same applies to the Singapore Flyer. The river journey by tug boat let you see life from the river, and are also a great way to transit from one place to another $12 fare one way. The shopping complex it huge - didn’t do any shopping as the shops all seemed to be labels - far too expensive for this poor tourist!, but it was worth a wander to find the food mall and have ice cream
The area is beautifully upkept, with amenities scattered throughout.
Don’t rely on your gps amongst the many skyscrapers, the little gadgets get very confused. Get a good map!
The public transport system is amazing and puts Perth public transport to shame. Each journey is about 80c. Well worth purchasing a tourist pass for a few days - you can easily top it up at the stations."

Merlion is a bit boring to just sit around and do nothing. Some activities around would have been better. Nice to take a walk and pictures.
Though lack of toilets around the place can be a disaster if you have a child with you who needs to urgently visit a washroom"
,,Amazing Place to visit,5.0,,An amazing place to visit with a view of MBS hotel right in front of you and sky touching business towers on the other side. Like any other place in Singapore this place is also not short of food joints and restaurants. Enjoy drinks along side banks or at the MBS tower (If your wallet is overloaded)

You either purchase a ticket of $23 to get access to the whole boat or you go up for free and purchase a drink at the ce la vie bar but you only get access to a small part of the boat which belongs to the bar.

There is also the ‘shoppes’ building which hosts some very luxurious and expensive shops and restaurants I.e Chanel and Gordon Ramsey."

If you fancy purchasing a few million-dollar diamonds at the resort (too expensive to photograph by the way - just gaze and devour the sites) then this is the place for you
The ""hanging"" swimming pool is outstanding. Singaporean engineering at its cultural best. Go Go Go! Do NOT miss this!"
,,Pleasant place to visit near the water,4.0,,We visited after getting off the hop-on hop-off bus to stretch our legs. It is very clean and a nice area to walk around. Very close to Gardens by the Bay. There is a large shopping centre in a wonderful building. You can get an escalator or lift to the rooftop area for good views.

,,So much to see and do,4.0,,"On one hand, part of it shows the crassness of the modern world, i.e the nearby shopping malls with more brands than you will ever need, on the other hand, a wonderful place to walk, see the light and laser shows, so many places to eat and drink."
,,Beautiful nightview,5.0,,"Stopped by after dinner to see the laser show and look at the night view of the beautiful city skyline.

,,Beautiful place for a pleasant evening,4.0,,"A good hangout area , if you like to be alone by yourself and enjoy the waterfront. A good place to eat out well"
,,the latest laser shows,5.0,,with the upgraded laser shows that open last month this is a place not to be missed if you happen to walk along the bay that is where the F1 track is
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Travelled by the local metro train which was cheap and easy. A couple of changes necessary but there were station attendants on hand to direct everyone. Didn't see everything we intended because it started to rain. Interesting walk along the wharf area and into the over the top commercialised shopping centre at the end. Everyone has a sales spiel and it is a typical tourist trap with sales people trying to snare you into their shop. Look but don't take up the invitation to sit down! They sell boat rides at $10 per person (including young children) on the very short boat trip along the artificial canal in the shopping centre. Big queues show that some people have more $$ than sense. Some pleasant parks to stroll through but not in the rain and a lot of interesting architecture for photo opportunities.
,,Spending an evening with overseas friend from Perth at marina bay on 30 sep 2017 . We met for an evening walk .,4.0,,We enjoyed simple dinner and follow by walking one hour enjoying the marina bay by night .

,,One of My Favourite Places,5.0,,"I lived in Singapore briefly and can honestly say that Marina Bay was one of my favourite places. No matter how much time I spent there the skyline still amazed me. In the evenings there is almost always something going on, whether it’s a concert or a light show. There are also lots of great bars and cafes in the area, and it’s within walking distance to Gardens by the Bay and Boat Quay. If you don’t have much time in Singapore, I definitely recommend walking around Marina Bay. If you walk fast you can circuit the Bay in about 40 minutes, but you could also spend several hours in the area. Uncle’s Ice Cream carts sometimes pop up around the Bay, so if you see them I would highly recommend getting an ice cream sandwich for $1.20 SGD."
,,Two weeks holiday,5.0,,"I have to say that Marina Bay in Singapore is one great areas to stay if on holidays. Very similar to Sydney Harbour but on a smaller scale. You can walk to all the shopping, restaurants, ,buses, and are all close at hand. There are so many hotels to of choice within a 1km radius of the bay it is fantastic. The Pan Pacific was our choice, due to its location to the MRT, restaurants, buses etc. to the location."
,,Exciting by day and night,5.0,,"This is such a mega area with a huge range of things to do from shopping, river cruises, fabulous eating and wonderful light shows."
,,"Excellent place to eat, play and shop",5.0,,Great place to visit with young family and all ages as it is close to a lot of attractions and has a great show at the bay at night. Suits all budgets from cheap to expensive for food and great amenities close by
,,"Relax, Unwind and Free",5.0,,Perfect for an early morning jog. Nice to have your coffee or a few beers while enjoying the view of the bay.
,,Sound and Light Show,5.0,,"Yet another must visit show in Singapore. Shows at 8,9 and 10 PM. The laser and the sound show along the Singapore river is amazing. It is an experience and have very less words to describe."
,,Marina city walk,5.0,,We went for a stroll around the bay and it was beautiful. There are lots of fountains and gardens plus great photo opportunities. There are a number of shopping areas within walking distance as well.
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"We headed for the rooftop bar right after walking through the adjacent gardens. It was a great place to relax and take in the spectacular views of the harbor, marine and Malaysia in the distance. You will need to pay an entry fee, but it’s credited against your bill and the restaurant..."
,,Great Walk Around the Bay,5.0,,"If you want a lovely walk that isn't too long then do the walk around the bay. Only 3.2km, very picturesque."
,,An angle of pure charm,5.0,,"This place is rightly the symbol of the Lion's City so don't miss it! Go there using the Red Line MRT, get off at Raffles Place or Clarke Quay or City Hall and take a walk among skyscrapers and thousands of tourists. Go to the Merlion Park and then cross the bay and visit the other attractions... The only word I can use to describe the place is ""charm"""
,,Exquisite,5.0,,"Marina bay is a must visit for all. Even if you are not shopping, the grand atmosphere with shops competing for who's grandest, will definitely blow your mind.
Although you have the same kinds of shops on orchard road the shopping experience here is more relaxed.
There's also a food court where you get traditional foods but do not be misled, you also have continental fast food joints.
We missed it ourselves"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Lovely visit and definitely a must see! We stayed for the light show, and enjoyed it too. Great place to unwind and enjoy a drink whilst watching the light show."
,,Wander and check out the sights,4.0,,The marina area is great to just wander around in the evening and see all the sights. All the big featues are lit up at night so evening is a great time to visit. Under the mall is a great food court for dinner or you can try the more expensive places upstairs. Catching the mrt is a great way to get here as two lines terminate here.
,,Great for people watching!,4.0,,"A pretty marina surrounded by interesting and indeed iconic buildings, including the awesome Marina Bay Hotel. Marina Bay is a great place to just take a stroll and enjoy the sights and sounds, and maybe a drink or meal in one of the bars and restaurants."
,,Glamorous nights,5.0,,Went there once at night by MRT. It was packed by tourists taking photos and selfies. There are some restaurants at the southern part of bay.
,,Nice place to hangout,5.0,,"It’s a nice place to hangout with friends and family. If you are active type, get on your sports shoes and run around."
,,Pretty views,5.0,,"Gorgeous views day and night. On one side you've got the shopping centre and the famous hotel which you can stroll by (but probably can't afford) and on the other side you've got the promenad and some eateries (not extortionate, but on the more expensive side still). If you get there 20 or 21, you can see the light and fountain show, but we found it underwhelming as lights weren't heavily used and you can't hear the music/see the fountains too well from the promenade side."
,,Stunning views and great photo oppertunities,5.0,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore, there are so many attractions to see but this whole area is lovely and a must to get some great holiday photos."
,,Saturday Night Laser Show WOW!,4.0,,"We came by MRT from China Town and too an exit through the huge Shopping Centre. There were people sitting on the deck and we actually thought they were just enjoying the evening, we had a walk around and were about to leave when the Laser Show started it was fantastic went for about 15 minutes to music, loved it1"
,,Great night,4.0,,Good view at night. The lightings and scenery. Good place for couples or even family and friends hang out.
,,Marina bay - barrage at night,4.0,,"An all time favourite walking route of mine. My friend and I used to walk around the bay from Raffles place after work (around 8.30pm). You can continue walking towards gardens by the bay and onto the Marina Barrage.

There's a hawker (Satay by the bay) where you can stop for food / drinks.

It gets pretty dark at the Barrage (not much light from nearby buildings and very dim lights to guide your path) and as it can be quite windy, you will see some people flying kites. It is peaceful there and it's quite nice to just sit there and enjoy the city from afar or stare into the still water / darkness.

To walk there and back it takes around 1-1.5hrs. Not a must if you are on a short tourist trip but quite nice if you are in the country for a little longer."
,,So Amazing,5.0,,I will visit again this place. The show of lights from Marina Bay Sands so beautiful . The merlion is also a tourist attraction and lots of restaurant sorrounded the Marina Bay.
,,"Great views, don't miss the show at night",4.0,,"Great views over the harbor, the show that plays at night is most impressive and wouldn't look bad in your average theme park! Be there in time for a good spot."
,,Beautiful light and sound show,5.0,,"Please do not miss the light and sound show every evening at 8 and 9 PM. It is the best light show I have ever seen anywhere, and better than even the Bellagio fountains in Vegas."
,,A must in singapore,5.0,,You have to visit here if you’re visiting Singapore especially at night the lights and views make it very beautiful.
,,Fabulous!!!,5.0,,An amazing place and well worth a visit whilst in Singapore. Try an evening meal on the waterfront while watching the light and water fountain show..........brilliant food and an amazing atmosphere!!
,,Nice walk around for the night.,4.0,,"It might be too hot in the day time, but an evening stroll around the banks of this bay would be an ideal outing. You get to see the night scene of the many tall building in the old Central Business District opp the magnificent MBS hotel. You can catch the hourly laser and water show (twice during mon-thu/thrice on fri-sun). Starting with the Merlion park, down to the Esplanade walkways, over to the lighted bridge to the baywalkways in front of MBS. Nice place for photos as well."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,Marina Bay is lovely both at night and during the day. It is very easy and inexpensive to take a 20 minute cruise around the bay---a view you cannot get any other way. It is a nice combination at night with the night life at Clarke Quay where you disembark---LOTS of people!
,,Lovely,4.0,,Nice to walk around- we walked there a couple times to get to other places. Great for photos. Lovely skyscrapers and good view of the famous hotel

,,The evidence for the amazing of human creativity,5.0,,"Everything is artificial. However, you can see the amazing creativity of human. From Marina bay to Garden by the bay. Must see and worth to see !"
,,Grand Prix visit.,5.0,,"What a great setup for the GP. Not the cheapest place in the world but clean everywhere you go. Watch out for the taxi drivers, they do not all know where they are going. The bicycle chair riders are very expensive."
,,nice walking place,5.0,,"The best place to see the beauty of Singapore, it is great during the day and even more beatiful at night. The buildings, lightnings, music, water, bridge - all of these together crate great atmosphere."

,,Super Cool!,5.0,,"Marina Bay, An excellent place to spend many many moments walking and enjoying! So beautiful, a place that deserves ""Multiple Looks""!"
,,"Great place to see during your Singapore visit, go during the day and again at night",5.0,,"This is the main area of the center of the city. There are buildings and hotels on the Western side of the Bay, some cultural and performance centers to the North and of course the Marina Bay Sands complex to the East. The Flyer is set there also as is the mouth of the Singapore River. You can tour the Bay by boat, recommended as well as you can walk around the entire area, also recommended.

Twice a night, there is a light and laser show in the Bay which is shown against the Marina Bay Sands complex. It is a 15 minute show (reviewed separately) but part of the Bay experience once for sure. Tons of restaurants and famous hotels nearby also.

I enjoyed taking in the Bay from several viewpoints on both sides as well as from the Helix Bridge and also from high atop the Sands at the View Point some 56 floors up. This area makes for some great photo ops too from several viewpoints each with slightly different breathtaking views.

The boatride gives you pretty much a view of the Bay from the water so you get to see all the buildings up close including Merlion.

Worth a few hours to explore for sure."
,,What a place to be in combination with the GP Singapore,5.0,,"I have done cycling around, walking around and now visited the Grand Prix Formula One in September 2017. What an impressive place to be at that time. When the cars go for the race the evening has fallen and lights are on. Just a dream come true"
,,you have a view over almost everything!,5.0,,"You can see Opera house, Art and Sience museum, Marina Bay Sands hotel, Merlion, Fulerton Hotel, and Singapore Flyer from this point."
,,See how the other half live,4.0,,The Marina Bay centre piece is the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Worth a visit. Buy tickets for the restaurant at the top of the hotel instead of the viewing platform as you can use the tickets as vouchers for drinks and the view is just as good. The shopping mall is mainly for window shopping unless you have deep pockets. A trip on the canal is fun. The Gardens by the Bay are near by.
,,A must,5.0,,"What an amazing place in Singapore, always visited, never to be missed, a gem, a pleasure, a beautiful place to enjoy!"
,,Nice walking spot,4.0,,Nice place to walk around in the evenings. If you head over by the Fullerton hotel you can watch the “ok” laser show projected on the marina bay sands hotel in at night.

,,The only place to lay around :-) though hot,5.0,,"Its the bay front area with lots of eating, shopping places and Fullerton hotel (the deck is a nice place). You can walk around the Merlion area and then stop for a break. You can spend few hours doing nothing but you cannot touch the water (no beach here)"
,,"Excellent place, breathtaking view",5.0,,"Marina Bay offers a breathtaking view of city.

You can come in evening around 8pm and enjoy watching light and fountain show. The show was mind-blowing and all for free.

,,Good for a Swanky Night Out,5.0,,"Though Marina Bay was only constructed in the last four decades on reclaimed land, the area has fast become the ultimate representation of Singapore.

,,Pleasure,5.0,,"Main attraction for the Bay , F1 circuit surrounds it ,as well as many restaurants and bars and of course the Fullerton and the amazing Marina Bay Hotel"

,,Laser visit,5.0,,"Came to see the nightly laser shows and have a look around the shopping complex.
Brilliant venue, but it is a centre of, if you need to ask how much it is you can't afford it!!

The food court downstairs offers great cheap local food but an get busy! There's a cool superhero cafe inside which kids would like to look through and take pics with the superhero statues.

We ended up staying there til night. We first went to the cloud forest and that flower dome, then around 4pm we just stayed on the river canal boardwalk until nightfall. Then went back on to see the fountain show, which I think is very awesome!"
,,Popular Tourist Area but still worth a visit,4.0,,"The thing I liked the best about Marina Bay was the different examples of architecture. Singapore can never be accused of boring building and this is the place to see some great designs. The Louis Vuitton building, The ArtScience Flower building, Marina Bay Sands with the SkyPark, the Merlion Park and around the corner the Gardens by The Bay, all within walking distance. There is also a huge shopping centre with a very call water feature. At night the place hosts light and water shows and comes alive with people. Well worth a visit and a walk."

,,Beautiful View,4.0,,"Must see venue with its light shows,brightly lit imposing buildings both new and old. Singapore has preserved its imperial past very well. Take a boat ride thru' the river towards Clarks Quay and its restored harbour warehouses. Area is dominated by funky
bars and eateries on both sides of the river. Not to be missed !"
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of the must visit attractions in Singapore. If you have even only one day, make sure to visit here. Here lies the famous merilion statue. The shoppes are pretty big and MBS building is awe inspiring. A lavish place to spent your dollars."

You can hang out at the open space outside The Shoppes and enjoy the skyline during the day, spectra (light + water show) during night. High-end shops, indoor gondola ride (though not recommended - pricey for a short ride within the mall but, if you want to try it anyway, go ahead), huge casino and much much more. A lot of eateries (a bit pricey of course). Have a moment and appreciate the building's design. ^^"
,,Must see the lights show.,5.0,,This place is not much during the day but at night there is an awesome light show and water show. The lights show is best seen from the merlion park side and the water show is best seen from the marina bay sands side. You can see both since There are two shows everyday. If you are selecting one of the two get a better look I suggest the water show.
,,Nice 1-2 Hr Photo Opp ....,5.0,,"Marina bay and merlion park can be visited to spend few hours and capture pics by the day and the night . Dont miss to click pics at night because the area is well lit. You can also opt for river cruise, I didnt go for it due to lack of time."
,,Pretty Bay,4.0,,Had a lovely evening listening to live music relaxing by the bay after our brilliant food served up in the Street Markets - Esplanade was busy but worth the wait.

Catch the MBS turns golden during the golden hours (4-5pm) or turns pink during the sunset hours, or even catch the free light shows every night.
And most importantly grab some shots with the Merlion statue."
,,One night in Singapore with family,2.0,,The Marina bay area is very nice. The variance in architecture is magnificant. The light show is overrated. Nothing special. The food in the restaurants wa expensive and average taste/quality.
,,Easy Walking and Scenic Trip,4.0,,"You will be enjoyed walking around the Marine Bay at all time. You can walk on the day time, night time and even raining day, the scenery would be look a lot of different at all time and even different days. I enjoyed the night walk the most, this is because is less hot and humid, and also the night lighting will light up whole Marine Bay, this would make this Marine Bay even more beautiful."
,,Take your time and enjoy the Bay,5.0,,"A 3.5 km promenade encircles the Bay and a walk around gives you an opportunity to experience the many free and paid activities in the area.

,,Mesmerizing and breathtaking,5.0,,"This is one of the most beautiful places in Singapore and your trip won't be complete until you visit Marina Bay. To think that several decades ago, parts of this place was covered with water and has now been turned into an architectural wonder. If you have time consider spending the afternoon and the evening there, the scenes are different during the day and in the evening and they are both breathtaking - don't worry about killing time as there are lots to do in between - plenty of exciting shopping and restaurants in Marina Bay Sands. Definitely have a good dinner there or nearby like the Hawker Center at Gardens by the Bay. In evening start at the Helix Bridge and take a nice, slow stroll towards the direction of Marina Bay Sands and then walk all the way to the Merlion Park, take the time to enjoy the lights, the bay, the water shows, and the beautiful city and skyline. At the Merlion park look back toward Marina Bay Sands, simply beautiful. You will not regret it."

A lot of folks tend to spend time around the Merlion and see the night show from the Waterfront Promenade side but highly recommend for friends or couples to take a walk around the entire area (full circle to MBS Shoppes and back) to enjoy the Bay area in its entirety.

,,"Beautiful , Wonderful and very Pricy!",4.0,,"Marina is lovely. Boat trips, eager tourists, restaurants and bars and so many old buildings converted to give a sense of colonial ease. At night again it is best with lights and sights and magnificent food and beverages. The only issue is that the price has massive taxes and service charges added to everything so one dollar's worth will cost you approximately 1.30 !! The hidden cost of Singapore."

,,Evening Drinks to watch light show,5.0,,"Well worth a visit. We purchased a 20 Singapore dollar voucher each, which gave us access to top of hotel bar and these can then be used to purchase a drink from the bar and this was enough to get a beer or G&T. We watched the light show from Gardens at the Bay, fantastic"
,,A must see when in Singapore.,5.0,,"The magnificent beautiful skyline of Singapore is best viewed from the shores of Marina Bay: The iconic 3 towers of Marina Bay Sands hotel resort, the Fullerton hotel (old post office), the gracious Merlion and the skyscrapers of the financial district, all can be observed from a stroll around the entire bay, ca 1.7km. At night, a beautiful light shows kicks in from Marina Bay Sands hotel observatory platform with its laser beams and spots throwing into the dark towards direction of the city. There are several shows every hour, starting at 8:10pm ca. and onwards, hourly, until 11:15pm ca. At some occasions, the lights are accompanied with symphony music from nearby loudspeakers and a dancing water fountain on the bay itself. This part of the show can best be viewed right on the shores in front of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, not on the opposite quai near Fullerton nor Merlion. Don't miss"

,,Excellent spot to look at the skyline,5.0,,You can walk around for quite a while just looking at and taking in the views. Go to the asian civilisations museum which is nearby.
,,A visual delight,3.0,,It's a mini manhattan in Singapore. The lights during nights are spell binding. Nice restaurants abound. But the waters of the bay are dirty though they don't stink. Must visit
,,A must see at night attractions,5.0,,"Love this place at night when the lights all up, the whole place is sparkling.

,,A must see area,5.0,,Walked the whole circumference of Marina bay and loved it. Marina Bay Sands hotel is an awesome structure. There is a nightly light show to music over the bay outside the large new shopping centre. A beautiful clean area to view the Singapore skyline.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,What a great hotel - worth taking a look if you get the chance . Wander through the lobby area and check out the shopping
,,safe experience for solo travellers,4.0,,"I was only visiting for 3 days and I wasn't sure what to do or see. I was comfortable in my hotel and I didn't really need to wander around or venture out but I felt I would be missing something if I stayed within the confines of the hotel. My phone was playing up and I had to resort to asking directions from the concierge and he gave me a map. But he also said that since it was a humid night I'd be better off going via the underground mall. The entrances aren't that well signposted, once I'd found it it was obvious but I missed it the first time I looked.
The city doesn't seem to encourage pedestrians above ground, I had to take a long detour to find a way around the barriers and cross the road.
I'm glad I ventured out, the bay area is lively but safe.
There's a light show at about 8pm which is quite a good display.
There are plenty of bars and restaurants.
If you are prepared to get a bit lost at first you'll be fine."
,,Nightly light show is beautiful,4.0,,"There is a light show nightly that is really good, I believe it is twice a night & maybe more often on weekends, well worth watching"
,,Beautiful and modern addition to Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay is simply beautiful. We, a family of four with 2 teenagers, spent 4-5 days in Singapore. Marina Bay was the prime location with Sands and its high perched pool on one end but the Gardens and the wondrously architected buildings on the other. The place feeds your creative senses as much as your mind. Spend some time at the ArtScience Museum and you'd come out a different person. Spend time and money at the Marina Bay Shoppes or done their with its varied fine options.

We walked around the area as we stayed not too far from it. Whether it was the Flyer, Helix Bridge, the MB Shoppes, the MB Gardens or the even the Merlion Park, we walked the area during the day and then in the evening to soak the lighting shows.

A trip to Singapore won't be complete if you do not pay the visit to this fabulous area the attests to the modernity and forward looking nature of the city it calls home - says a New Yorker!"
,,Beautiful area in singapore,5.0,,Marina bay is must visit for Singapore visitors. One should visit bot during daylight as well as during night time for different experience.

,,Great location at night,5.0,,"Definitely a must-see attraction in Singapore, it provides the city view at its best. It is unforgettable at night, with all the skyscrapers and marvellous architectures illuminated. The Light&Sounds Fountains Show is a must-see experience, given for free twice every evening.To reach this place you can go by metro and go below the marina bay sands hotel, right across the shopping complex."
,,Scenic & clean,5.0,,Among the top 5 paces to visit in Singapore. A walk around the Bay is picturesque. There are places to eat at the MBS and Boat Quay ends. Bring a hat/sunglasses/suncream as it is not very sheltered. Leave at least an hour to walk all the way around.
,,Brilliant visit for drinks,5.0,,"We went for drinks on the drink package where you pay 20$, I would highly recommend this as the look out is over rated and we received complimentary drinks with our ticket and the view was better than the look out view was. We didn't stay as guests in the hotel and we are glad we didn't as the pool looked unmanaged and crowded. Brilliant for a drink with a view but don't stay here."
,,Lovely place to spend time at in the evening,5.0,,"With only three days in Singapore, it's understandable that our days were pretty crammed with all kinds of activities. Hence, we made it a point to visit Marina Bay after dinner on all three nights, and enjoyed a leisurely hour or two there, with our feet up and the cool evening breeze for company.

This is a great place to just sit and admire the Singapore skyline. The light and sound show is pretty neat, but the best thing to do here is walk along the waterfront, or simply sit down on one of the benches and watch the lights on the water."
,,Great waterfront especially at night!,4.0,,"A great spot to chill out in the open grassy area, eat - there are a huge range of restaurants - and shop - the Marina Bay will satisfy all desires. All around a great lagoon. You can even charter racing yachts if you want to get more active. And the view from the Marina Bay side back to the city is great."

Drinks also available. the iLight watershow can be seen from this place. To reach this place go below the marina bay sands hotel, right across the shopping complex"
,,Revisit,4.0,,"Was back here for a break to enjoy the night scene of the city with the reservoir in between to create a reflection of the city. Early in the morning, the place is quiet and peoples running around the reservoir. In the day, people busy with their daily work and many vehicles moving around, cruise carrying tourist around to see attractions. In the night, people gather together for a drink or meal and awaiting for the light display by MBS."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful place to visit and take photos and view the singapore skyline. Nice place to jog too. Recommended

,,The City Centre,5.0,,"Genuinely a really amazing part of the city. All the big lights and sounds are in close vicinity. You could easily spend 2 full days doing everything around the Bay Area from boat tours to the ArtScience museum. Should be any tourists first stop in Singapore, light shows and sound effects at night are another great element!"
,,Beautiful Waterfront,4.0,,"Marina Bay is a beautiful waterfront and nakes for a lovely Place to stroll. There is a boardwalk most of the way. The Merlion Fountain, Gardens by the Bay and Supertree Grove are all reasonably close too if you don't mind walking in the sun.
Singapore is a truly beautiful city and Marina Bay is one of its most picturesque districts. Why else would they choose to build the iconic Marina Bay Sands here after all?
Definitely a place you should build into any itinerary if you are visiting Singapore."

I have seen many wonderful hotels around the world but this was something special. It is like part of a Sci Fi movie and for me a must see when in Singapore. You can go into the atrium area and marvel at the size of it inside. There are quality restaurants and bars within. You can also pay to go to the observation deck on the very top. Well worth doing to see all around Singapore. Again well worth doing. Just go and see it up close and personal. You will not be disappointed!

Be aware of people near Merlion as there are so many of them anytime any day. Also, there is a watershow performed each night and can be seen on both sides. So, try to go early for a free seat in the middle to enjoy the show. The best view is definitely at Marina Bay Sands"

Make sure you walk across the spectacular Helix Bridge at night to take in the magnificent views and be sure to spend some time indulging in retail therapy at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands plus iconic stores like Louis Vuitton's Island Maison.

Marina Bay Area is good for a city jog and to enjoy many interesting food, cultural and music events even the DBS yearly regatta. It's always crowded so sometimes parking can be a hassle.

,,The treasure of the city- Singapore!,5.0,,"Marina bay is the centre for all things in Singapore surrounded by residential, commercial, entertainment, shopping, restaurants and hotels and much more. This is a modern marvel with ultimate architecture.

The bay looks mesmerisingly beautiful during the evenings. The atmosphere is well lit with the city & sky-scrapper's lights, music and crowd. This is a picture perfect place to click pics after every step that you take.
Recommended time to visit: Dusk to midnight.

The light show and the Merlion Statue is a must to watch after a long walk at the bay and the Helix Bridge.

It is, and you are no doubt drinking some of it from your tap.

If you are lucky, you will also get to see the Marina Bay otters frolicking. What a time to be alive!"
,,Top Tourist Spot in Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay - Singapore

I went to Marina Bay again to take photos for my review. The whole place was jam-packed with tourists and locals. I then realized it was a Sunday and the rehearsal for the National Day Parade (NPD) will be held in the late afternoon towards early evening. So I waited like everyone else and in time to capture some unique photos.

Marina Bay is a bay located in the of Central Area of business Singapore surrounded by the perimeters of the four different areas. The entire area surrounding the bay itself is an extension of reclaimed land to the adjacent of the CBD (Central Business District).

In the early days of sailing ships the whole bay area was called the Inner Roads where a detached mole was built for safe anchorage of merchant shipping. With redevelopment and reclamation the whole area was transformed and the mole took the area where the Marina Sands Hotel and Gardens By The Bay now stands.

The Marina Barrage, a integrated work of gates and machinery was built on the mouth of the Bay towards the sea. Completed in 2008 it cut sea water from the Bay and transforming Marina Bay and the Kallang Basin into a fresh water reservoir that will in future provide another source of drinking water. The Marina Barrage also prevent flooding in the downtown area including Chinatown. Both the Kallang River and the Singapore River empty their waters into the bay. The crafts that use the waterways now are boats carrying tourists for the Singapore River Cruises and boats for water sports such a dragon boats, kayaks and sailing boats races.

Marina Bay was transformed into a mix of uses for this area, including commercial, residential, hotel and entertainment, including 3.5 km Waterfront Promenade around the perimeter of the bay. Both locals and tourists can be found hiking, cycling or jogging along the walkways. There an interim event space and public space used for activities such as theatres, bands and carnival shows. A floating platform rightfully called the Float is currently used to house the National Day Parade.

The whole area is well served by several MRT stations, bus stops and taxi stands are well placed As the Bay area spills in to the adjacent CBD many banks have set up head offices and 5/6 star hotels such as Marina Sands, Fullerton, Pan Pacific and the Orient hug the other shores of the bay. Concert Halls and Museums too compete for space. The year end F1 races where Singapore is credited for its night races hug the areas around the Anderson Bridge and the Esplanade Bridge section of the bay."
,,Visitn Singapore is going to Marina bay,5.0,,If you can afford you should definitely stay at Marina Bay because of the infinite pool. It is worth it! If you can't you can always visit inside the hotel and the observatory which is pretty nice as well.

,,Blade Runner!!,5.0,,"I didn't know what to expect of Singapore, and have only been here for 6 hours but wow!! What a place! The Marina is surrounded by amazing architecture. From the towering skyscrapers that dominate the skyline to the art and science museum that looks like a lotus flower, to the DNA double helix bridge. When lit up at night they are even more stunning. At 8:00 pm, and each hour onwards, there is a 15 minute light and water fountain show which is free and definitely worth waiting for. Not that you'll have any difficulty finding things to do. The mall, which spans a large part of one side of the bay, is a visual and actual feast!! Covering several floors there are all sorts of designer shops to view (even if you don't want to buy) and many food outlets, including a food hall with many different styles of food. One could go on ... I won't ... but this place is well worth exploring."

Taking a taxi is also very easy , just stand in the taxi queue and wait for your turn."

,,A walk around the bay should be part of every trip,5.0,,"Every time I come to Singapore I enjoy a walk around the bay. On a weekend it can get quite crowded even until late at night. You get the Crowds of camera totting tourists at Merlion Park, the locals at Gluttons bay catching cheap eats. Then the stroll through Marina Bay Sands shopping mall to catch a glimpse of people paying huge amounts for things that are more for show that the accessory they pertain to be. There are lots of other things as you walk round, look for the other listings around the Bay."

If you want to see the laser show, better buy the laser show cruise tickets for SGD 38 and SGD 22. The cruise ride tickets could be purchased at the ticket booths in Clarke Quay. You can get the best view and enjoy the show leisurely. The laser show starts at 8 pm and 9 pm every night and lasts for around 10 mins."
,,Expensive but worth it!,4.0,,it is a nice experience to see Singapore from a flyer. I flied at night and city lights were on and beautiful.

,,Still a favourite,5.0,,"Have visited the Bay over the past 20 yrs and love returning with each visit. It has changed considerably now with its role in the F1 calendar; the Marina Sands; Helix bridge and Singapore Flyer but the Merlion and Esplanade Theatre can still hold their own - with the Jubilee Bridge providing an easily accessible, panoramic view of all. Recommend you visit either early in the morning or late in the evening, as the heat of the day builds up considerably. Take your time to explore this superb area and the amazing architecture and history, located all around it."
,,Beautiful views at night,4.0,,"The marina bay is gorgeous and mesmerizing. There are benches and lots of places to sit and sink in the views of the city. There are some food and Icecream stalls which allow you to pick up stuff, relax and spend time with your loved ones. The night view is great."
,,BIG SHIP!!!,4.0,,No matter how you look at it. It's always awesome. A lot of F&B outlets as well for you to dine in. Price is slightly above average but the food is awesome id you don't mind spending some money here and there. Near to the MRT station which is nice and convenience.
,,One of the Must Visit Place in Singapore,5.0,,The Marina Bay is undoubtedly one of the best places in Singapore to just walk for free and enjoy the stunning view of the skyscrapers and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. A great place to click photographs.

,,Beautiful in the night,5.0,,We did a boat tour in the evening end it was really beautiful and romantic. Something nice for a couple in love.
,,"Great views, small viewing area.",4.0,,"We paid the not-so-small fee (I think it was around $16US per person) and waited in line for the 56 floor elevator ride. The views are obviously phenomenal, but do not be fooled by looking up at that huge surfboard and think you will have free reign from tip to tail. As a non-hotel guest you are restricted to just one end of the platform."
,,Shoppers delight,5.0,,"I've been to many a high end retailer store but never so many in the one space. It's an incredible shopping area to visit and to emphasise this- there are Venetian gondolas travelling through the centre.

Well worth the visit - even it it's simply to cool day and people watch."
,,Relaxing but needs entertainment,4.0,,Great place to relax and take some snaps. But needs entertainment as it is very quiet at times. So at times not much to do. Can be a lot better if entertainment is provided. There are stages for performances in the Marina area and they need to be utilised.
,,Pizza par excellence,5.0,,A view unparalleled. Very few cities will offer the view and so many attractions in one centralized location. The free sound and light show in the evenings is awesome.
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Enjoy your evening in Marina Bay Boulevard, watch the sun go down , go for shopping , gamble and enjoy the laser show"
,,Beautiful night view,5.0,,I loved the night view by the bay. Skyline of CBD and Marina Bay Sands + @ were beautiful. I feel a bit sad that i missed the beautiful view of merlion statue at night :'(
,,Very nice comfortable street to enjoy leisure walk,5.0,,It has been a famous area in Singapore that you can enjoy some sun and wall around next to the water. It also have some water show at a certain hour. You can enjoy some jogging around this area. It can be crowded with tourist during a certain time but the area is quite big. So you should have no problem enjoying the view still.
,,Best spot in Singapore for Pictures,5.0,,"It's Undoubtedly the best place in Singapore to be. Go during Sunset and then observe the Superb nigh views, it's the best Urban view you can get in Asia. Must visit when in Singapore."
,,A do not miss spot in Singapore,5.0,,It's a mere Grandeur to describe Marina Bay in a word. From Marina Bay you can view the Marina bay Sands hotel which in itself a landmark of Singapore and also the Singapore flyer. The laser shows are really stumning
,,Makes for a good visit esp in evening,4.0,,"Marina is a long walk so we went only maybe halfway but it is very scenic, we stayed back to see the laser show which was somewhat disappointing compared to the one we saw in Sentosa"
,,Nice view,4.0,,"We stopped here for a couple of photos at night, the view here was awesome and breathtaking. My suggestion is to come earlier before dusk and you can get a perfect nicer view set of photos."
,,Must Visit place,5.0,,"the place is awesome, especially in night. its wonderful to take a walk from the shoppees via Helix bridge up to Merlion. the place is hugely visited by Tourists and u can even watch laser show twice in evenings. a great place for photography. Day time, come to Bay in Duck tour for a altogether different experience"
,,Beautiful garden away from the buzzling city,5.0,,"A beautiful place for a walk, jog, cycle or just to watch the sunset and chill. Away from the city buzz but yet not too far from it. Easily accessible by public transport. The place is huge so be prepared to put on proper walking shoes and bring along a bottle of drinking water especially if you are visiting during the day."
,,Evening sights,5.0,,"We went in the evening and the scene is fantastic. So beautiful to see the lights of Marina Bay Sands and surrounding areas. There are many places to sit, take a drink and soak in the atmosphere."

,,Possibly one of the best places on earth!,5.0,,"You never get bored wathcing the skyfalls, the Marina bay sands hotel, the Marina mall, the lake, the miracle of human science! There are people doing jogging there. There are also small boats thet take you a 40 minutes ride for 30 US dollars. You can sit there and enjoy for hours the breathtaking view! At night it's even better!"
,,"Amazing view, but likely to constantly get hit by Selfie sticks all around",5.0,,"Most amazing view in Singapore, very unique and breath taking. Evenings with great light show, that you better only see once, as the same program repeats each day, also the same music.

Lots of tourists, I mean LOTS. All equiped or let me better say armed with smartphones of cameras and very often with Selfie sticks, which they use almost often in your face. After a couple of unpleasant experiences I walked into pictures and photo bombed. It is literally impossible to get around without doing so, so don`t feel weird if you do the same, and do not excuse yourself, as it is mostly Chinese who show no courtesy and do not deserve one either. Walk as you like and if you end up in thousands of Chinese visitors pictures, who knows, you might get famous. Hey, its 1.5 billion people, I think half of them have been visiting this place here.

Daytime when its hot is best, evenings gets very crowded because of the show. They should have limited access to the bridge, as it gets VERY crowded. Still, amazing view all around, well worth a visit. A must do actually when in Singapore. I live(d) around the corner in Financial district."
,,How it has changed in 25 Years,4.0,,"It was 25 years ago that I first went to Singapore and it was also my first overseas holiday. How things have changed.

,,Even better in the evening!,5.0,,"This bay area is a nice place to see, especially at night with all the lights around the bay! Go to the bay and have satay at the local hawker stalls!"

,,Great for an evenings walk and enjoy the views,5.0,,"This area truly explains why Singapore is such a wonderful, beautiful city. Lovely views of the water with skylines reflecting everywhere, with nice restaurants everywhere."
,,A MUST GO...,5.0,,"If you wish to take your wife or team to an outstanding place, topping all of Singapore (57th floor, rooftop) GO THERE. Great service, good food, perfect atmosphere"
,,Wander around the Bay to enjoy the sights and sounds of modern Singapore,4.0,,You can wander around the entire edge of Marina Bay and enjoy all the sights and sounds that Singapore has to offer. In addition there are multiple places to stop for food at all levels of price and variety. The total distance is over 5 KM (makes for a great morning or evening jog) and you can do the entire route without crossing the street. Keep in mind that the Sands has a 2x nightly laser show over the Bay (8 & 9 PM) so stop and enjoy if you want.
,,Amazing at night show,5.0,,Apart from the domes it was hard to believe it was the same place that we visited a few days ago during daylight hours. The structured trees come to life when all lit up and the moving light display is super - the accompanying themed music is fabulous

,,A visit to the observatiopn deck is a must.,5.0,,"We didn’t stay here =( but we did visit and go to the observation deck. The view is phenomenal (although I like to remind hubby that we could have had that view in the swimming pool). We went on a nice sunny day and could see quite far.

On the night, there was a light and sound show (for free!) on the water, and it was fantastic. There are seats, but if you get there late, along the edge of the boardwalk by the water is prime spot.

The shops were the usual stuff i.e. stuff I can't afford, but there was an awesome DC comics shop and the Louis Vuitton on the boardwalk is architecturally amazing.

While the price for the observation deck is steep (S$23), the views are the best and worth it. And walking over the helix bridge at night is beautiful."
,,Lovely sight at night,4.0,,It is one of the best examples of city planning. There are walking paths that are being filled with Singaporeans in the evenings for their cardio workouts and visitors for the views from this place. At night there are two sessions of light show.
,,Great place for a walk,5.0,,Best time to go is in the early evening when it gets cool. There is a free light show every evening as well.
,,Aussies enjoy visiting Marina Bay Singapore,4.0,,"We visited Marina Bay several times over our week in Singapore. Plenty of food and coffee stops and clean restrooms around the area.

Huge shopping centre(indoor ice skating area), financial district, theatre, and outdoor stadium with entertainment, across the helix bridge, safe to walk around day and night."
,,Marina,5.0,,"One of the best views in Asia/Australia and second only to Sydney Harbour, maybe. Lots to do here with Esplanade nearby."
,,Marlion,4.0,,It's different experience for us because it was raining when we went there but even though is raining it's good and we have fun.
,,Spectacular Architecture and Urban Planning,5.0,,"This is a focal point for all Singaporeans and visitors. The area is packed with places of city-state significance-the Esplanade (performing arts center), the Fullerton Hotel, the Merlion, and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel all circling a cluster of bustling restaurants and bars. It is the place to be on weekends and weekdays. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is the mega architectural statement although the Esplanade has its virtues. The MSB has over 60 restaurants, many very upscale, along with an enormous food court specialising in Asian, Malaysian and Singaporean modestly priced delights. The area at sunset and night time is really alive with lights and a fascinating light show, with coloured lights aimed at an artificial mist creating images woven into stories, a unique and very pleasant feature you won't want to miss. If you do ONE thing in Singapore, this is it."
,,"lovely place to go to, by day or night",5.0,,"lovely place to enjoy the sights of singapore whether by day or night, evenings usually they have a laser light show, with water fountain effects. very nice truly enjoyable."
,,Tranquil walk along the bay,5.0,,"A stroll along the well-paved footpath round the Marina Bay is a therapeutic one, especially during the cool evening.

The modern financial skyscrapers the esplanades and the beautiful Fullerton hotel. Visitors cannot avoid this area. There are a lot of people there yet it isn't crowded, it remains clean. It's a great place to sit and people watch."
,,Wow What a Romantic Boulevard,5.0,,"- if you can stay on the Marina or close to it then I would highly recommend it.
-this boulevard is absolutely stunning and the light show with music is fantastic, its on every night at 8am and also at 9am on weekends, we made sure we were there every night for the show and walked the boulevard 3 times.
-there are boats you can take to go closer to the fountains, there are available near the Fullerton Hotel.
-there is a stage on the Marina, we managed to see one of the schools perform a musical which was extremely enjoyable. this is a free event.
- The Hawker Market Makunsuthra Gluttons Bay is right on the Marina and the food is excellent.

- its extremely safe, clean and vibrant place to be and highly recommended."

,,A great waterside walk.,4.0,,"Marina Bay is a must if you like waterside walks.It can be a little hot during the day as there is not too much shadow on the long, well paved walkways. It may be a good idea to have an umbrella against the sun or perhaps against an unexpected shower. If you plan to have a longer walk, take some snacks and drinks with you too! Marina Bay provides excellent views of Singapore, wherever you look, you will see a ""postcard view"".Plenty of photo opportunities! On the water you will see quite a few small and large boats, ferries and if you lucky, you will be surprised by a large bus which charges into the water and continues its way as a boat!"

,,One of the best running venues you can find,5.0,,"I run around the bay regularly and it is a delight. Start at Marina Barrage and head east through the gardens and then on to Kallang. Cross the bridge at the National Stadium keeping left following the path. You will hit Nicol Highway Bridge, cross over the river and down steps at the far side. Follow the path keeping the water on your left eventually passing F1 pit lane then the Singapore Flyer and under Sheares Bridge. Then go straight past F1 grandstand and after another 400m go up left towards the Merlion but skip onto the bridge. Then go past Fullerton Bay hotel, hang a left, then left at the end along past MBS, Gardens by the Bay on to the Barrage. Its a 10k loop and the cityscapes are great. Quietest times are weekdays around dawn or sunset. I run at weekends too and it gets a bit busy around MBS but still OK.
Keep an eye out for the otters that have re-established themselves."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"A trip to Singapore remains totally incomplete without a visit to Marina Bay. The night views are spectacular with illuminated water shows and fireworks.

,,Singapore skyline wonders,4.0,,Just go there to shoot fabulous pictures and also enjoy the Shoppes facilities. Worth a day of relaxed getting around.
,,"Wonderful views, a sight that you would remember for a long time!",5.0,,"This is a must visit when in Singapore. The Marina bay must be visited twice - once during daylight and then during twilight. (~ 7.15-7.30) . If only one visit is possible, then its a no brainer - the area looks best during twilight and later. We get to see an awesome view of the Singapore skyline - Marina bay sands hotel, the Singapore eye and all the sky scrapers around."
,,One of the Mascots for Singapore!!,5.0,,"It has now definitely become one of the mascots for Singapore as a whole apart from Esplanade and Merlion. It overlooks the business centre and hosts one of the most popular hotels in the world.

Though if you talk about the bay itself, it is more of a photogenic place with a lot of places to click pics."
,,Too much concrete,3.0,,"This is a nice area to run around for some exercise in the morning and having the water nearby is nice, albeit a bit dirty, but there are no grassed areas to sit around on and relax. It gets very hot given all the concreted areas so take a hat and sunscreen. This area could also benefit from having what a lot of int'l cities have these days which is free water bubblers or refill stations. Given how hot Singapore is I would've thought the Govt would have seen to this by now.

Plenty of restaurants line the bay on the city side and high end shops over in the marina bay casino complex."
,,Beautiful scenic view,5.0,,"Wonderful place. One of the most beautiful places in Singapore , perfect to hang out at the night or day alike."

,,Best in Early Evening,5.0,,"I've been fortunate enough to visit Singapore a great many times over the past five years. One thing my wife (born and raised in Singapore, but emigrated to the US) and I always do on our visits is come down to this area around 7PM to watch the sun fade away and the night lights take over. It's beautiful to just sit, hold hands, chat and watch it happen all around you.

Daytime, given the heat and the crowds, is much less enjoyable. But it's a must-do in the evening."
,,World Class Scenic View,5.0,,"It has always been my dream to witness this place at least once in my lifetime. Even though I'm practically neighbours with Singapore, I hardly found time to travel due to the busy nature of my work. Thankfully, I did get some time off during my business trip and do a bit of a walk around here. Even managed to take a couple of interesting shots of the Marina Bay Sands (MBS). During the daytime, this can be quite a scenic view and awesome for clear photography and even panoramic shots. As night falls, the place transforms into a totally distinct experience altogether. I loved the fact that I could view this place twice during my short trip. It's just really amazing!"
,,beautiful at night!!,5.0,,"I was in SG in April 2017 so the weather perfect(at night)! I took a cab from our hotel Furama Riverfront around 9pm and got dropped of at Merlion Park. I took pictures with the Merlions continued on the Jubilee Bridge and took I specifically brought my camera and trips for some long exposure photos of Marina Bay Sands which came out pretty good. Kept walking ended up at Esplanade and there was a pretty cool dance performance at the outdoor theater we sat for around 30 minutes watching. Continued past the grandstand and got to the bottom of the Helix Bridge, took around 20 more minutes taking pictures of MBS, ArtScience Museum, Helix Bridge and downtown Singapore. Went onto the bridge and took more pictures and finally ended up at Marina Bay Sands. Walked through the mall and all the stores were closed but the A/C was nice after being outside for the last 2 hours.

I really enjoyed being outside and wandering around Marina Bay, the weather during this time was pretty humid and warm but i thought it was perfect especially coming from San Francisco where it was freezing. We purposely went out at night so it would be less crowded and not as hot! I would definitely return on my next visit!"

The Bay is surrounded by pedestrian walkways, bridges, boulevards and open air concert and theatre venue. Particularly enjoyable for an evening stroll watching the lights of the city twinkle around you."
,,Spectacular night time views,4.0,,"Worth a visit, although eating there is expensive. The shops are a bit decadent for my tastes, great if you are a Gucci-Prada type of person. However the urban skyline at night is worth it and incredibly safe as well."
,,Wonderful Place!,5.0,,"There are many things we can see in Marina Bay Singapore like Merlion Park, Esplanade Theatre by The Bay, Victoria Theatre Hall, Asian Civilization Museum, Fullerton Hotel which formerly was a general post office, Raffles Landing Statue, Raffles business district, Garden by The Bay and Marina Bay Sand Mall or taking a walk a long the river at Boat Quay toward Clarke Quay."

Definitely worth a nice walk around the bay! Besides this, there is a lot to do as there are restaurants around, the massive shopping centre, light shows, and more."
,,Great place to take a walk,4.0,,"But you have got to mind the weather and the temperature else you'd be sweaty all day.. but this is a great place to enjoy a walk holding hands or sit down at the banks and have cup of coffee while you indulge in never ending chats with your loved ones..

Great place.. must visit.. spend an entire evening.."
,,Wow Factor,5.0,,"The Marina Bay area certainly ticks all the boxes for wow factor. From the stunning Marine Bay Sands building, to the Gardens by the Bay and the extensive shopping malls - it has it all. A 'must see' destination in Singapore."
,,A superb place to hang out,5.0,,"After a good dinner at Lau Pa Sat, my wife and I went for a walk to discover the surroundings. That's when we unexpectedly found ourselves at the Marina Bay. Wow was our first expression. The Marina Bay resort and the Flyer was in front of us and the atmosphere was great. So many restaurants and people dining, others just chilling and relaxing, couples walking by, others walking out their dogs.
The view was spectacular with all these buildings lighted up. We even had the opportunity to assist a live concert by ""Ramona and the Cool Cats"". There's an open stage there for the artists to perform with all sound and light system. It was really great. The public was awesome. Spent a great time there and we lost track of time.
Unfortunately it was our last night in Singapore but we sure go back there to discover more goodies this place has to offer.
We were out there as a couple but it sure adequate for group of friends, families etc.
A place I sure recommend to all."

,,MARINA BAY WATERFRONT PROMENADE,4.0,,"A focal point for the Singapore city. Or say a landmark attraction to tourists.
Very popular international centre filled with restaurants /bars and elegant boutiques. In fact a huge selection. If you love shopping and have lots of money then you are in the right place.to top it off there is a casino as well just in case if you are interested. The un missable Singapore icon (Merlion statue) is right there. You will often find this place crowded with tourists as it’s a popular photo session area. Walk down the bridge to the other side as well as there is live shows happening almost every day. You will get a good view of this place if you are willing to walk through the bridge.
For those who like skyscrapers, big shopping malls etc. then you will love Singapore But for someone who prefer quiet place then Singapore is not for you"
,,Fantastic area with a lot going on,5.0,,"Wandered through from the Gardens and went through the Marina Bay Sands and then into the shopping mall and then ended up on the skywalk round the bay.

,,Lunch overlooking Singapore,5.0,,"What an amazing place, after watching a documentary on British TV it was amazing to see it in the flesh. The shopping is out of this world as are the prices but its still worth the visit.

,,WOW I love this place,5.0,,"Such an amazing place to visit, Marina Bay is a lot bigger than i expected. Again it's great for shopping, it has everything from cheap eats, restaurants, affordable clothing along with high end designers. You will not get bored here. Make sure you take the elevator up the tower (the third one i think) it has a bar with amazing views. You don't need to pay anything to enter the bar, just your drinks. The drinks are quite $$ though but that's understandable. My partner and I went up for a drink and he was wearing a singlet and boardies and they gave him a dinner jacket to put on for our visit, they were fine about it though."

,,Glittering but not gold,4.0,,I heard a lot about this place but did not find that attractive. The one thing which really feel bad that every where in Singapore there is only building and building. No matter how much light and glitter you but in the end people get bored of it.

You'll find the new Marina Bay Sands sky park which dominates the skyline. You will recognise it by the boat shaped roof which is accessible if you stay at the hotel. When we were there the grand prix had just finished so we were able to take a peek around the pit area which still had all the names of the drivers above the door. You can seek out the shops and architecture or just stroll along the river bank. At certain times of the year you can catch the dragon racing practice there."

We went for the same and waited for almost 2 hours from 9pm to 11:15 pm, however, it didn't happened. There was huge rush and lot of people were waiting for it, however, there was no announcement or communication to inform that it is not going to happen.

You can pay to take in the vews from the top but I opted for a meal in the rooftop restaurant instead and benefited from a fabulous fixed price (lunch) menu, glass of fizz and the stunning views including overlooking the amazing infinitely pool. Great unplanned experienced which turned out to be a highlight. Can't comment on accommodation as didn't stay here, but well worth a visit if in the Marina Bay area."
,,Foodie heaven :),5.0,,"Beautiful are especially around Fullerton Hotel, with multiple restaurants. Good place frequented by joggers."
,,A must go place,5.0,,"This is one of the best spots for taking great pictures. If you are visiting Singapore, it is a must do for a long walk and nice shots."

,,A well developed Marina,4.0,,They have really packed a lot into the Marina area. The Merlion is a very important sightseeing features for pictures. The floating sports field is a pretty neat feature. Plenty of activity for anyone on the Marina.
,,Enjoy the evening light shoe,4.0,,"Great for a late dinner then catch the evening light show. Make sure you check the times though, as if there's a concert or similar on, the times change. Great shopping with some big brands, nice food court (but choose carefully- best going for ones with a hot wok and not the ones with the food already cooked).
We spent a good 4 hours here, just walking around and enjoying the atmosphere, lovely when the sun goes down."
,,Enjoy Marina Bay,4.0,,"Marina Bay in Singapore is area that we can see interest view and close to some attraction. In this area, we can find Merlion Park, the trademark of Singapore.

,,Biked from East Coast Parkway,5.0,,"One of my favorite Singapore half-day adventures was riding bikes from the East Coast Parkway bike path to Marina Bay and back. We brought our bikes but a friend just did it and said it was super easy to rent there. The ride is very easy on both ends of the trip and you will pass old men (known as ""Uncles"" here in SG) on single gear bikes as well as kids and more pro-bikers in their lycra gear. In between there are some speeders and wide ranging children that require some vigilance to avoid. I'm in low to medium fitness level (regular yoga and gym but not an athlete by any stretch) and I was fine. Once at Marina Bay we arrive on the back side and rode around almost the whole way to the Bread Street Kitchen. There is a bike rack right out front so you can leave your bike and sit nearby while you get a 5 star breakfast or fantastic juice. Then back we go, retracing our steps. I've walked it at night from a different direction and many times during the day as well. There is always good food to eat and people watching. You might even get lucky and see wild river otters! It can suddenly pour rain any time and there are spots without shelter so bring an umbrella. Then just go have an adventure!"
,,A highlight of worldly porportions.,5.0,,"A wonderful collection of architecture, both colonial and uber modern, mixed with a strong belief in the need for human interaction. During the day and then again at night one need to see this in both lights. The evening's lights make for a romantic walk around the water's edge. Plenty of watering holes and places to eat ensure that you will not be left wanting. Plan an evening for two or bring the whole family. This downtown area is safe, clean and a marvel to behold."

,,Lively at night,5.0,,We went during the day and walked all the way round to boat quay. There was an exhibition on whilst we were there I-light it was very nice to look around all the different individual installations. We went back at night time and wow what a different place. Bars food stalls kids rides light show a really good buzz about the place.
,,One of the Best...,5.0,,"So if you are in Singapore, The Marina Bay is basically a shopping mall with the world's most high end brand available. It also has a food mall and an internal river which tries to ape the Venice concept of the Gondola but ends up being very expensive so avoid that.
The best part is when you arrive at the viewing area and can see the entire skyline with the Marina Bay Sands hotel behind you.
Go during evening around 6 pm and stay till 8:30 pm, that way you can see the skyline and the city go from day to night and catch many stunning views in the backdrop while getting yourself clicked.
They also have a sound and light show which is not as good as the one in Gardens by the Bay but if you have time then go. There is a lot of walking involved so get a pram if you are with a child and once on the viewing area - sit, relax, take in the sights and sound while savoring the experience of Singapore. All this at no charge since everything that you see and sit is free unless you want to purchase something from the shops or the food vendors nearby."

,,Beautiful view at night,4.0,,"The Marina Bay is beautiful during the day, but stunning at night. It certainly deserves a visit. You will be passing there anyway as it is the center of everything in Singapore."
,,Meander the Bay at Night,5.0,,"For a lovely night out we took the MRT to the Marina Bay station and was emersed in the cool air along the bay. We spent 3 hours enjoying the sights and sounds of the Gardens on the Bay, walked all the along the river to the Cloud Forest but it closed as we got there (9pm). We then made our way across the footbridge to Marina Sands and stood in awe of the spaceship hotel that towered above us. Passing through the gateway of the spaceship (that's what we decided to call it because it looked so surreal) we came out the other side at the Singapore river. Here we were met with relaxing sounds of music in the air and just in time for the water laser show. We stopped for drinks on the bay and continued our walk along the river while enjoying the Singapore skyline - great photo ops, cool air and really enjoyable."
,,Nice view and clean place,5.0,,Its our first visit in singapore trip. We went in Chinese festival season and we could see colour ful decorations. Lot of tourists had come to this place.

,,A beautiful skyline!,5.0,,"When you're in Singapore the Marina Bay is definitely worth a visit. The area is the product of great planning and attention to detail, and is a beautiful mix of art and architecture all at once.

The water show (at 9:30pm I believe) is also an absolute must see!"

If you're lucky, you might catch a performance at the outdoor amphitheater too!"
,,Beautiful area but the light show dissappoints this time,4.0,,"It is ofcourse a spectacular view of all the buildings lit up in the evening. What spoilt the lights show for us was that the steps that led to the bay earlier, where one could sit and see the laser light show have been cordoned off. An ugly, hopefully temporary canopy like structure has been built which really obstructs the view.
Nevertheless the place does round off a visit to Singapore so is a must see."

,,Magnificent!,5.0,,"We walked along the 3.5 km Waterfront Promenade around Marina Bay. Started from One Fullerton, passing Fullerton Pavilion, Clifford Pier and Fullerton Bay Hotel, One Bayfront, turned left on the side walk next to Marina Blvd, then left again on Mist Walk, along Waterfront Promenade, passing the Shoppes, Art Science Museum and then to the Helix Bridge, onto Marina Bay Seating Gallery & the Float, Jubilee Bridge, Merlion Park, back to One Fullerton. A 60 min walk was a little tiresome under “typical” hot and humid Singapore Winter. But we really enjoyed the view of beautiful architects, hotels, restaurants, parks and, surely, the magnificent Bay. We did not stop and sip tea or coffee at anyone of the restaurants, bars or clubs. But imagined that it would be a very romantic event. We stayed at Fulleron Hotel, so that’s quite convenient for us to walk 30 min to Event Plaza to watch the 15 min “Wonder Full” Light Show on 8PM. What a lovely experience!"
,,Calm and beautiful,5.0,,"The little Merlion was closed for renovation which was a bit disappointing. The calm beautiful city made up for the Merlion.

A good spot in Singapore to hang around late in the night post a long day at work."

,,The best part of Singapore,4.0,,"In my opinion this is the best part of Singapore. There is lots to see and do here. You have the iconic Marina Bay hotel, the Beautiful Gardens in the Bay , the classy Marina Bay Mall and many other attractions. It is a must see place!"
,,Great Scenery for a run early in the morning,4.0,,Recently we had as Sunday Morning Run at Marina Bay which is very peaceful and quiet with very few people or cars around. Just try it yourself in particular on weekend mornings.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"We bought tickets to the 57th floor, which also includes a $20 voucher to use at Ce la vie bar (drinks were delicious!). The view of Singapore was excellent especially as it was a clear day. It took a little while to grab a seat as we had visited before lunchtime. The bar is right next to the infinity pool from the hotel."
,,Romantic Marina Bay,4.0,,Still once you walk here you feel the beauty and romance in each corner and the time while walking was around 3 pm and the weather was fantastic
,,A great view of Singapore,5.0,,You walk around Marina Bay and it's such a great view of Singapore. All of the lights and buildings coming to life in the evening is definitely the best time to check it out. You don't spend anything and you just take in the city as it is. Beautiful city.

,,Sit and watch the city.,5.0,,"Marina bay is a bay located near the Helix bridge.
There are many people there that come to sit and watch the city's buildings view and relax.

,,lovely walk,5.0,,just a nice walk down by the water with a lot of crazy architecture around. We went at evening to catch the lights and to avoid the heat.
,,Not really showcasing the real Singapore,2.0,,"Marina Bay I'm certain has its place....but it's not Singapore. It is an expensive, artificial, decadent environment dominated by a (hideous) casino, and top end shops. If you can afford it and want to experience something that is anything but Singapore then go for it!"
,,Singapore best area,5.0,,"This section of Singapore is beautiful and There is so much to see! One sight after another -all in a short walking distance. The MRT makes it easy to get to, no matter where you are staying!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Wonderful views looking to the city , excellent shopping as well as the casino , well worth spending time here , no doubt about that ! ."
,,Light Show at Marina Bay,5.0,,"The Singapore light show with the background of the city sky line is magnificent. The show is a light projection on mist from the small bay and includes laser lights and music. The lesson of the culture of Singapore and the importance of conservation is meaningful. We had a great location, but it was very crowded. We had just come from Hong Kong where we saw a couple of performances of their light show (which we had seen many times before). There is no comparison as they are different. But we did like Singapore’s better (In English with a story and moral)."
,,Beautiful at night,4.0,,A must see in the evening with all the lights on. The roof top garden is about £20 to access and this amount also goes towards a drinks. Really nice in the evening to look over the city plus lush cocktails.
,,Lunch Tril,4.0,,"This shopping mall is massive
All the names and brands are here. Probably a rich man's paradise
We had lunch
There is plenty to choose from but our philosophy is when in Rome . Dim sum was fresh tasty and reasonably priced
There is a small canal built inside where you can hire gondalier to row you round
The Louis Vutton building is in the shape of an orchid and right on the water
Just visit it"

,,Amazing views in all directions,5.0,,"We took a slow stroll along Boat Quay, past the Merlion Statue, over the Jubilee Bridge to the area outside the Esplanade and then found a bench to sit and admire the hugely impressive Singapore skyline. We then carried on walking towards the Helix Bridge and crossed over to the Marina Bay Sands. After a few hours enjoying Gardens By The Bay we retraced our steps to Boat Quay.
The scene had changed dramatically since our first visit to Singapore almost thirty years before, but the city is now a far more exciting and vibrant place to be."

,,The Singapore version of the Dubai fountains!,5.0,,So the fountains aren't as beautiful as the ones in Dubai but it's a pretty place nevertheless.

,,Amazing at day and night,4.0,,"Super colorful garden with amazing design, great to walk around and get away from the city for a while. Stay for the light show if you can, it was an incredible experience for us, really enjoyed it!"
,,The Icon of Singapore!,5.0,,"There is NO better place to show the superb beauty of Singapore than with Marina Bay! Talk a walk around the loop, stop and have a Singapore Sling and go shopping and take pictures with the Merlion! You won't be disappointed!"
,,Place to be,5.0,,"Marina Bay is the place to visit. You can see all the amazing city skyline. Best time to go is at sunset, so you can see it with daylight but also at night, with all the skyscrapers' lights."
,,Love it all the time except on rainy days.,5.0,,"Well, I must admit I am biased to the area because I work in it. It is a lovely place to spend with family especially at night when all the city lights come on.

There are also almost always something going on. So check it out and you'll see what I mean."
,,Relaxing,4.0,,We visited the Marina Bay at night time and by the use of their MRT. Do not drop of at Marina Bay station if your going to the bay because that is very far. Drop of at the Bayfront station because this is in between Marina Bay Sand and the Garden By the Bay. You can visit this in the morning and during night time but they have musical fountain at around 8:30. They also have Shoppes there.
,,Modern city views and plenty of brand shops!,4.0,,Marina Bay provides modern city views and plenty of brand shops. We spent one evening there. Views were very nice and the shops were very interesting. The views were especially beautiful when it started to be little dark outside.
,,Marvelous,5.0,,This is a treat that you shouldn't miss. Come at night and bring your tripods for long exposure shots.
,,Must do activity,5.0,,There were 2 options here. One being the trip up to the viewing gallery - a long queue. Or the other (which we did) was $20 each to go up the bar area. the cost was then deducted off the price of the drinks. Sat up there and watched the sun go down over Singy - fab!
,,There aren't much more impressive Skylines than this one!,5.0,,"The hotels, the malls the restaurants - everything around this little bay is just exclusive and impressive. Go for a walk, don't miss the opportunity to visit that huge luxury mall inside Marina Bay Sands. The whole place is futuristic, got light shows at night, it's awesome - welcome to Singapore."
,,Great place for time pass,4.0,,Its great place for walk around. Many shops and great view of buildings and sea. You can sit there on steps and have a relax time. It was nice place.

,,night time shows,5.0,,the area is lovely and clean with plenty of attractions but take time to see the night time light shows especially the one with the cranes .
,,Cheshiresupermum,5.0,,Nice atmosphere lots of eateries. Bars etc light show is worth a view. It's free. You sit on steps outside designer shop mall and it's free lasting about 20 mins. We did this then went to the skylark on roof (shaped like a boat) for a drink after to take in the view
,,The number one place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"This is indeed an engineering marvel in itself . The splendid views , magnicifcent views are eye candy . I have never seen this place without being packed with people . The shopping scene here is world class with all the major global brands lined up for you . Gourmet restaurants and what not , this is once place in Singapore that has it all"
,,"Nice place to look at the shops, eat, drink or just walk around.",5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel maybe expensive to stay at but costs nothing to go down to the Marina Bay Shopping area and have a window shop or buy.
Take a ride on the gondola on the manmade canal inside the shopping mall.
If you are feeling lucky visit the Casino but remember your passport or you won't get in.
Outside just admire the sights, there are delightful lily ponds and lovely iconic structures to photograph and look across the river and see the famour Merlion. Walk across the clever DNA bridge and if you are lucky (as we were) you might even spot the Otters that have made their home around the Singapore River as they play on the banks."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"This great location invited us to stroll, ending the afternoon with the light and music show from the MBS in the dusk. Very romantic, spectacular and most impressive. Can't wait to be there again!"

,,A must see when you are in Singapore,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Is a spectacular man made attraction. To walk the loop around the bay is around 3km courtesy of the Helix bridge which connects one of the river outlets and the federation bridge at the other end. From the bay you can see the Merion, the amazing Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Lotus shaped Science Museum to name but a few of the attractions.

,,Must see part of Singapore,5.0,,A gr8 mix of modern buildings and traditional Singapore sights all around the bay itself which is in fact a reservoir. The Marina Bay Sands or the Flyer give tremendous aerial views of the area or alternatively take the bum bum boats from Clarke Quay to see the area at water level. The light show in. Front of the Marina Bay Sands is worth a visit - it's free but gets busy - if you time it right you can see this from the boats but you don't get the sounds.

At 8 PM the marina sans puts on a laser light show across the bay, followed by fireworks at 9 PM, at least during my visit which was the Chinese new year.

Now, it looks out into Marina Bay, with the famous and remarkable Marina Bay Sands Hotel right opposite.

It has a great level of sophistication, mixture of CBD amazing architectural buildings , great hotels both old and new, shopping, tourist attractions, food court and Museum. It was very hot and not much shades around so be prepare. You have to go there to experience it yourself, photo won't do a justice!"
,,Made me fall in love ❤ with Singapore 🇸🇬,5.0,,Incredible!!!! What a spectacular place. This place was so soothing and incredibly beautiful. Surrounded by the business district fashionable designer stores and the incredible marina bay sands hotel. And what a beauty that is. If you want just watch the sunset absorb the beauty in then take a seat on the steps and watch the night go by. The laser show starts around 8:30pm which is worth watching. A number of food places to eat from however just near to the merlion is a hawker street with a lot of street food. Which was amazing. Very busy to try grabbing a seat first. I really enjoyed this place. Slot of walking to do but there are boat services available for you to get Frm one side to the other. You can not visit Singapore without visiting this place.

,,The modern side of Singapore,5.0,,"This city is such a vibrant place! The buildings around this little bay are very modern and very different. The Merlion fountain attracts a lot of visitors and is very photographic.
The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a sight to behold, and difficult to take in. There a lots of places to eat and drink, but the prices are very high. When you have a meal or drink,be aware that there is service charge and tax to pay on top of the price. 2 drinks came to $30 before 10%service and then the tax!"

,,Splendid view - Different views in daylight and the night,4.0,,"This place is spectacular to watch from any height in the vicinity. When u see this place in the daylight, it is good, but when u look around the night lights and buildings lit up magnificently, u'll take hundreds of photos from different angles..."
,,A really beautiful spot,5.0,,"This is a great location for wandering around, at both day and night. The lazar light show is 'interesting', but worth a look. A good spot for dinning too."

,,Beautiful view of lights,5.0,,"Marina Bay was just beautiful with a wonderful chance to shop, or have a gorgeous evening meal so many to choose from also a street food market if not wishing to spend too much. We enjoyed the laser show & looking at the lights of Marina Bay was peaceful & enjoyable we ate at a Seafood Restaurant at Marina Bay we had recommened to us, our meal was just devine."
,,Lotus flower in the city,5.0,,Nice view during the day or at night. Don't miss the lotus flower ! It is the nicest mix between a modern city and some beautiful flower
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,This area has opulence but also has affordable options for everyday people. The experience of being able to walk the complex and admire views back at Singaporean along with so many other things to do within close proximity make it a suitable attraction. There are plenty of reasonable food places and a very popular food court. Lots of high end shops. Easily accessible by mrt.
,,awesome,5.0,,its really nice place . We loved the skywalk and spent quiet sometime there. small restaurant is there at top. .Please try to go in late evening to get both day and night views .
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Very interesting to visit all the high end brand stores. So many junior brand stores here. Food court is good, great food. Ensure your credit card is with you and ready for a good bending!! Great walk through this entire bay with many interesting things to see and do."

,,Must visit,5.0,,Very nice area.will provide you the feel of Singapore.full of tourist across 24*7. Good food joints.
,,Mostly for the views.,4.0,,"Nice view over Marina Bay Sands and the lightshow during the evening. Even though the lightshow might not have been the best I've seen. Apart from views over the small bay and it surroundings this area doesn't offer much more, at least not compared to what you can get in other parts of Singapore."
,,Amazing view for couples or with friends,4.0,,I had my chance to visit this place last weekend. My friends and I got so excited with places. One of which is Marina Bay. We took MRT to get there. Accessible indeed.Sunset view is the best. We made of a lot of fun here.
,,Excellent place,5.0,,"I do not know again, looks better during the day or night? I think - both. It is very clean, like all Singapore!"
,,Above average,3.0,,This place is nice to sit around in the evening to watch the lights and building around. Nothing spectacular....
,,By day and by night,5.0,,Do yourself a favour and visit the Marina Bay by day as well as by night. It provides for two different experiences. The food market at night by die opera house is wonderful! The scenery beautiful.
,,Marina Bay sightseeing,5.0,,Very beautiful view at night along Marina Bay. Good recreation place by walking from Marina Bay Sand to Merlion fountain along the bak walkway
,,best countdown,5.0,,"very awesome night view, i have been there 2016 countdown.. was amazing..also during the daylight very nice"
,,Great location for running,5.0,,"Apart from being a great tourist area, I used the pathways to enjoy a morning jog whilst on holiday. The pathways are well lit, and provide a great view of the city and all of the buildings on the bay."
,,What a view,4.0,,I think the obsevation deck is 56 or 57 and you get a beautiful view os the city. It costs around $33 HKD. There are some plaques with desctiptions. There is a light show on the bay twice a night but you could probably get a better view on the ground. Very nice breeze at night.
,,Nightly heaven,5.0,,This was a great walk from the hotel and the marina had lots of different food options to choose from and was extremely safe and enjoyable.. highly recommended
,,great part of Singapore,5.0,,so many things too see in this great part of Singapore. amazing too thing it was made possible by land reclamation. too many attractions to list here but its worth a visit
,,Great Views,4.0,,10 minute walk from our hotel. Big area to take a walk or sit & enjoy the sights. Vendors selling all sorts of food & drink. The coconut stall was my favourite
,,laser show,5.0,,great laser light show in the cool of the evening we then spent some time in the shopping centre adjacent to show area
,,Prime Singapore!,4.0,,Marina Bay is Singapore in all its splendour. Visit it at night to see the lights dazzle the city. The backdrop against the water is indeed amazing!
,,Lit up and lovely,5.0,,I was traveling alone and for me there was no other way to see this place...undisturbed and free too take everything in.
,,Magical walk by night,5.0,,One of the top recommended place to go when go to Singapore. Recommended to by by night to see the laser show of Marina Bay Sand and enjoy restaurants and coffee shops.
,,Peaceful,4.0,,"Nice area for peaceful walks and food and drink stalls and cafes n bars for relaxing unwinds. Museum, shops and eateries to suit all tastes"
,,Sensational Area,5.0,,The entire Marina Bay complex can be easily walked around by someone of medium fitness. Singapore is usually very humid so take sensible precautions. The Bay has so many sights and activities that you should plan to do different parts by day and night. Laser light show is quite spectacular. Dining with a view by night is surreal at times. From hawker stalls to high end eating your choice. It's a special area of Singapore.
,,Posh and upscale,5.0,,Posh and upscale define this place and the Marina Bay Shops. An integral part of the Singapore experience.
,,Loving it,5.0,,"It is hard to describe what exactly it is... the feeling of being there is spectacular. You feel the wealth and beauty surrounding you. During day and night - as long as it is not raining, it is an enjoyable spot."
,,A very interesting area,4.0,,This is very much one of the must visit areas in Singapore. Take time to walk all the way around and get the different views and see what is going on. Not sure what a boat ride adds but they looked popular. Be aware the much hyped light show at 8pm and 9pm is vastly overrated. That said all the other buildings lit up together with numerous structures lit up makes for a great permanent after dark light show.
,,Relaxing Casual Stroll,4.0,,Great place to have a relaxing stroll and take in the excellent surrounds and view. Well worth a visit after doing the Skypark.
,,Modern Green City Model,5.0,,"Singapore's Marina bay is perhaps the best Asian model for a modern green city. Its incredibly clean, the park is covered with greens, the street lights are gorgeous and the view is calming. Locals skate, bike and walk around. I do not know anything that you would not want here(money is no issue)."
,,Comes alive with light at night,5.0,,"Great for a stroll to see the sights like the Marina Bay Sands as you make your way towards the centre. Relaxed by day, fabulously lit up by night, fantastic for photograph opportunities."
,,Signature of Singapore,5.0,,"I had been there twice only , before they build Marina Bay Sand and Garden by the bay , The Marina Bay is the most beautiful view of Singapore and become signature for every tourist"
,,Money Money,3.0,,If you love shopping and have lot's of money then this is for you worth a look it also has a Casino that seems very popular (not our thing) but seeing the queue must be a good
,,Evening Delight,4.0,,"Took my sister in law and her family to the promenade opposite Fullerton Hotel to see the nightly Marina Bay laser light show. Unfortunately, the show was cancelled due to some glitches. But our visitors really enjoyed the magnificent CBD skyline from Collier Quay to the National Theatre. It was breezy and we had a nice stroll to the Merlion."
,,NIce place to relax and have a stroll,4.0,,"It was quite windy when we went here so the weather was perfect for us to go around. There are a lot of scenic views to take pictures of, a nice place to relax in."
,,"Excellent place for a night time stroll -- romantic, family",5.0,,"Singapore is one of the safest places in the world, and this is where a lot of people congregate at night. It's a clean, beautifully lit area with plenty of options from low end to high end. The bar options are numerous (Fullerton Bay Hotel seemed to have a good one on the roof of their hotel that has a gorgeous view of the Marina Bay Sands). If you're only here during the heat, it's best to experience this area at night, as it's cooler and it's when the people come out."
,,A lovely place,5.0,,Marina Bay is a lovely place a specially in the evening there are a lot of great restaurants just a few steps away at Boat Quay and Clarke Quay! I can also recommend to take a short boat tour along the river (about 30mins) and to visit the Marina Bay Sands hotel to enjoy the view.
,,An engineering and commercial masterpiece,5.0,,Marina Bay cannot be left off your Singapore itinerary. It offers 360 degree views. By day it is gorgeous and at night it is just magnificent.
,,Enjoy the Waterfront,5.0,,"A lovely place to browse the shops, have a sundowner, watch the sunset and have a meal. The area is expensive both in terms of shopping and eating but the sights and sounds make it all worth it."
,,New Years Eve,4.0,,We had the opportunity to visit on New Years Eve and see the laser and fireworks. Fabulous! Crowded but what else would you expect. Be patient and soak up the atmosphere of wonderful time. Even if it was not New Years Eve the visit would be worth it. Travel to it is so easy.
,,Great place for an evening stroll,4.0,,"Marina Bay is a great place to see the CBD area. Atleast at night when the buildings are nicely lit. Ice cream shops, bars and buskers add to the pleasant ambience. Do remember to catch the free laser show that happens everyday. Also remember to try out the local sandwich icecream from the friendly ice cream uncle :)"
,,"Always nice view, 365 days",5.0,,The view is always nice no matter when you visit. Highly suggest to go at night to catch the water show in front of MBS.
,,High end brand lovers... this is for you!,5.0,,"Fantastic where you can find all the high-end brands in this mall. Accessible to MRT,won't burn your pocket to go to the venue."
,,Attractions,4.0,,Good for tourists to hang around at the centre of the city Few tourists nearby Good for a Long walk with friends and family
,,beautiful gardens,5.0,,"a testament to how much Singapore loves and is willing to invest in green space these gardens (with lakes) are a lovely, free and tranquil place to go"
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Some of the best (and certainly most iconic) views in Singapore. Walking around the bay never gets old.

There are restaurants of all kinds, a food stall (more or less) suitable for the budget traveler, and a fancy mall nearby.

Make sure you walk over the Helix bridge at night, it's beautiful.

Some days of the week there are live performances on the Esplanade. At least those I've seen were in Mandarin, so I could not fully appreciate them.

Perhaps my favorite area around the bay is the Merlion Park."
,,Trip down the river,5.0,,"Jumped on a river boat at night,magnificent views and well worth the money,so relaxing and a must do"
,,All the bells & whistles but lacking personality!,3.0,,"Stayed here for 3 nights after spending a week in Penang & whilst the Marina Mandarin is a very modern in all aspects (ie decor, room facilities, restaurant set-up, gym equipment, pool etc, it didn't meet expectations for service or friendliness. Check in was chaotic & extremely slow & staff did not advise customers that they would need to tap their room card in the lifts in order to access floors above level 5. Additionally, when we checked in, our room was not ready & altho' we had no issue with that, we were not told the room number allocated & were therefore unable to book our lunch at Aquamarine to our room. Later, we returned to Reception with the 'Handy' electronic device that had been set-up in our room. It did not work & required re-setting, but staff did not offer to do this or provide a replacement. They just told us to take it back to the room (the next room user will also be inconvenienced). The gym facilities are terrific, altho' the loud & repetitive music nearly drove us to distraction. Fortunately this only happened twice! The pool is very aesthetic, but no shade over it & no change room facilities either. As for the bars, very difficult to find staff to serve you & there did not seem to be any smiles to be found anywhere. Whilst the quality of the hotel is very good, I think the staff need to interact & care for their customers much more than we saw during our 3 days. Very impersonal & did not make for a friendly atmosphere."
,,Great way to see Singapore,5.0,,Cost of $28.00 per person to go to level 56 is worth it to see Singapore. The photos the staff take and then try to sell you at $50.00 is way over the top.
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"Great atmosphere, this area is a nice place to while away a late afternoon or evening. Quite romantic."
,,Tourist Hot Spot,5.0,,A fantastic place to just chill and enjoy the surroundings any time of the day. A spectacular skyline awaits and the nightly lazer show in the area is a must see. There is also frequently free live music which is enjoyable to sit and listen to while taking in the sights.
,,Great place,5.0,,"Wounderful to walk around the lake have some drinks , lunch or dinner. Great place for shopping. Or visite a museum."
,,Nice for a walk around,5.0,,This area is nice to have a walk around after visiting Marina Bay. Nice spots to take beautiful pictures!
,,Great,4.0,,"Marina bay is very interesting.This modern city is a very well planned development, with many advanced features and building structures not seen in cities of comparable size.."
,,Great place to see Singapore's sites.,5.0,,A huge area with great access to a lot of things on the tourist trail. The light show at night is wonderful with plenty of vantage points.
,,Great place to shop,5.0,,A great extravagant place to Shop at. Different levels of shops and eateries. Shopping is quite expensive but there is No harm in window shopping and enjoy the Architecture of the building.
,,Lovely Mumus,5.0,,Our friends took us to a very popular restaurant in the bay and it was delightful. Huge place though crowded at places. Lovely place to pass the time of the day and enjoy water front.
,,Watery Walk,3.0,,"Just a nice location to walk around, remember an umbrella for the rain can be heavy and if clear it will act as a sunshade."
,,Evening romance,5.0,,Always a good place to have a drink or stroll and its not that crowded. It has changed very much for the better!!
,,NYE fireworks!,4.0,,"Was battling the crowds worth the 8-minute spectacular fireworks? For us yes. Once in a lifetime at least. If you want to spend NYE at an iconic location, MBS fits the bill."
,,"Many places to visit: Marina Bay Sands, Merlion Park, Esplanades, Helix Bridge, Etc.",5.0,,"The Marina Bay area is a wonderful location where one could have a good view of the Singapore Central Business District, the Esplanade Theaters and other hotels, The Fullerton Hotel, The Merlion Park, ArtScience Museum, The Helix bridge and many more. My favorite activity in this area is to walk around it. One will enjoy the view actually. Take photos of the Merlion spewing water to the Marina Bay. Take pictures of the Marina Bay Sands from the Merlion Park. You can even book a River cruise that passes the Marina Bay."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Our daughter could not close her wide open eyes and mouth.... What a place! Even if it's ""Asia for Beginners"", and even if it's money, shopping, money, shopping – Singapore is a real nice place."
,,Very relaxing and so much to do!,5.0,,"Was very relaxing and not as busy as we thought it would be. The small and informative Marina Bay Museum and megastructure ArtScience Museum were great stops for us to learn more about Singapore's history and its advancement in the new era (better than google). We also went on the Ferry Ride which cost about $25 per person. That was the best decision we made because we got to see the other side of Singapore which we we did not have time to visit. There were great spots to sit, relax and unwind too."
,,Great walk,4.0,,It is a place to go if you visit Singapore. You can go during the day or during the night and it's also gracious. Lot's of places to eat around.
,,essence of Singapore,4.0,,"It is a must visit place. Look what is there? Gardens by the Bay with Supertrees and two architectural wonder botanical domes Waterfront Promenade Marina Bay Sands hotel museums, eateries, fancy shops"
,,So beautiful!,5.0,,It is the city center of Singapore. It is a beautiful area around the financial district. All is very clean and nice. It is plenty of restaurants and there is a light show every night which I highly recommend!
,,breathtaking views and architecture. Great food and ambience,5.0,,"We went on a sunny day and walked along the quay. The outdoor sculpture, the people, the grand old hotels and the wonderful restaurants made for a wonderful experience."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Went last night and the views were spectacular, the water light show is cheesy but impressive and the buildings are exceptional, just casually walk about and you will be amazed."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"Recommen!!! Really Amazing view in the night day, you can watch dancing lamp or play floating ship, really beautiful, so romantic place too."
,,Civilization,5.0,,"Education bring Civilization, Wonderful Set up, Easy going areas. You can find luxury and relaxation at the same time same area"
,,Visit,5.0,,"First visit today and found so much to see and do lovely clean area and has all been built on reclaimed land which always amazes me ,"
,,Great views!,5.0,,Wonderful time checking out the entire city from the Marina with beautiful views. Lot's to see and do!
,,Do not Miss!,5.0,,"Marina Bay is filled with great things to do from rooftop restaurants, to pedestrian walkways and super trees to the Flower and Cloud Forest Houses and the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel which offers terrific shopping and eating venues (Spago, Wagu Ghin, Louis Vuitton, Hermes, etc). Great kids' open air water park too. Something for everyone to enjoy!"
,,breathtaking skyline,5.0,,"visit the art science museum there were a gallery by NASA it was great, but we couldn't visit the other galleries as there were no enough time before closing (each gallery needs around an hour and the close by 7PM), then take a walk by the bay or shop in the mall, the view at night is spectacular"
,,Worth slow wander around,5.0,,Lots of things of interest. Worth just slowly strolling around taking in the sights and atmosphere. It's very hot so wear comfortable cool clothing. Plenty of places to stop and eat or get a drink.
,,Thee spot for the fireworks,5.0,,Nice place for a morning walk or bike ride. Best place to see the fireworks on nye. Good for taking pictures of the area.
,,You haven't visited Singapore without seeing Marina Bay,5.0,,Definitely worth the visit. You haven't seen Singapore if you dont get down to Marina Bay. Stunning views and very well done. A must see. Get to the lookout at the top of Marina Bay for stunning views of the City.
,,Love it,5.0,,Marina Bay is fabulous and so tourist friendly to stroll around and check out the Singapore skyline and all the skyscrapers towering over the City. Walking over the bridge to the Marina Bay Sands and stopping to take photos and take in the bay area is a must. The shopping mall is amazing too and has Gondolas going through.
,,Great Scenary,4.0,,"Marina Bay is definitely worth a visit regardless of whether you are after some sight seeing or some rather expensive shopping.

The place is quite nicely laid out with river, sea and city view plus the carefully planted vegetation all round the bay and roof top. A lot of what Singapore has to offer in terms of scenery is man made but I have to say that Marina bay is very nicely laid out with Singapore river and the harbour in the background.

We went there during the day time but we were told the night scenery is even better. We think this is true given the location, the night scene will be even better. Worth a visit just for the scenery alone."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Such a wonderful location! We have loved strolling round marina bay early evening soaking up the atmosphere and watching the world go by.
,,Go,5.0,,"It is very touristy, but well worth a look. It is a stunning area of Singapore. Even if you only go for an hour or so"
,,Alot to offer,5.0,,"One of the best areas in Singapore. Quality shopping, endless dining, art science museum to compliment the bay area. You will not be disappointed."
,,Beautiful Walk,5.0,,"This is a beautiful place for visitors to take a gentle walk. From the perspective of architectural excellence, there is so much to see in this area. I started my walk on The Helix Bridge, walking past the Art Science Museum and the magnificent water lily ponds complete with carp, past Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the shops continuing on the pathway to Clifford Pier (I took a round trip bumboat ride to Clarke Quay), then continued on to The Esplanade (the buildings that resemble Durian fruit). This is a great free activity giving a snapshot of this unique part of Singapore all built on reclaimed land."
,,Iconic Singapore Day or Night!,5.0,,The Marina Bay area has many of the iconic elements of Singapore. This deserves a stroll in the daylight and at night. And it is very safe to experience this at any time. Please see my other reviews for more details. Savor!
,,Beautiful by night,5.0,,"Defintely visit this for the evening lights, even without the light show it's quite a sight, impressive."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"It's one of the must see places in Singapore. Considered newly developed area there with the MBS hotel & casino complex opened around 2010. From there, we could take a walk to Merlion Park & Esplanade. It's a OK-5 from me."
,,Beautiful skyline of Singapore,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore get a taxi to the centre and go to marina bay, the photos will be amazing. It's also free to walk in the hotel, around the harbour and in the shopping centre. Fantastic clean city with lovely friendly people."
,,Big crowded designer mall hotel & casino complex,3.0,,"This was as touristy and non authentic as Singapore got. It could be a neighbourhood in Las Vagus. The designer shops were not competitive compared to equivalent shops in London. The food court was amazing as long as you battled with the masses to get a table.
Not in any hurry to go back."
,,Great Place for a night out,5.0,,"Marina Bay is more suited towards party-goers and couples. This Place is lined with many eateries and restaurants and although they are quite expensive, the food served is generally good. At night, amazing lighting will bedazzle you, and at around 7.30pm, the laser light show from Marina Bay Sands is truly amazing to watch."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"If you have gone to Singapore on business trip and has very less time to go anywhere please visit Marina Bay. If you have some couple of hours i would suggest to go for the evening show along with dinner.

If you are short of time at least take a walk along the bridges of Marina bay.

Brilliant place to spend evening."
,,Must-visit destination in Singapore,5.0,,"We came to Marina Bay area multiple times, both during the day and also at night. This setting is uniquely ""Singapore"" and is what I will remember most when thinking back to our trip. Best time to come is in the evening, don't forget your camera!!! The light show was very popular but also walking around the entire perimeter of the bay is well worth the effort - very very scenic from multiple vantage points.

Was able to walk to and from City Hall area, felt very safe to walk around at night, and the air is cooler, it is of course much warmer during the day.

Do not miss this experience when in Singapore!"
,,Very pretty especially at night,5.0,,"We loved walking around the bay, at all times of the day. Loads to see and just sit and admire. Definitely take the time to walk all the way round if possible and make sure you see it at night, as it's very beautiful all lit up."
,,Beautiful to view.,4.0,,Unbelievable architecture and beauty. Best seen from across the bay. Beautiful by day but unbelievable by night. Also wonderful to view from a river boat.
,,A view thats out of this world,5.0,,"We booked tickets for the observation deck, they cost about £13 each and went early evening. I can only say the view is worth every penny. The view was stunning and as it was dark, the lights back into the city or out at sea looking over the big boats was breath taking.
I would advise pre-booking, as when it full, theres no entry."
,,Amazing architecture with many luxury shops but really just a tourist trap,2.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is an amazing piece of architecture, as are the surrounds (Gardens by the Bay, the Space Museum etc), and the attached shopping centre is huge and filled with every luxury brand.

However - it is always jam packed with people who actually don't seem to shop. And forget trying to get something to eat in the food courts....you will never get a table unless you pick a table and stand by it until the occupants have finished eating. I find this awkward to do!

There is a gondola that goes up and down the length of one of the malls. A very cheesy attempt to replicate similar rides in Las Vegas. Not sure how much it was as we gave that a miss.

You can access the MBS Skydeck from here, but this is also a very expensive attraction that has restrictions placed upon tourists and those not guests of the hotel.

Furthermore, the MRT station is also always packed and there is always a long line to get tickets.

In summary, it's a place you need to visit to say you've been, but unless money is no object, don't expect much retail therapy."
,,Good tourist spot,4.0,,It would be an eye opener for tourists visiting Singapore to have first hand experience on how our city area looks like and how well developed we have come from the past 51 years
,,Nice place to walk around,4.0,,"This is a nice place to walk around and do some photo ops. From the Shoppes of MBS, you can see a nice view of the skyline and the Merlion Park at the other side of the bank. A lot of tourists come to this place and becomes crowded especially during the weekends."
,,Lovely walk,5.0,,A wonderful place to walk around in especially in the evening when the lights come on a the food joints open up. Spend an evening here before heading out for dinner.
,,iconic views of Singapore,3.0,,"If you are staying in a hotel around the City Hall area, it's a short walk to get to the marina and take in the views. It might be too hot during mid-day but early morning or late afternoon are good times to go. We happened to be there during the dragon boat festival and it was entertaining to watch the competition and the locals celebrate and cheer on their team."
,,"Amazing View, Great Location",4.0,,"Laid back, Easy Walking and a pretty good view of 'The Sands'. Be sure to take a 'Duck' tour within Marina Bay, as it gives you the opposite perspective of Marina Bay and it is truly amazing."
,,Amazing😄,5.0,,Amazing place! Recommended when visiting Singapore! Also wheather in April was quite nice only little bit humid in evenings!
,,Must Visit Place at night.,5.0,,"Very classy place, with combination of shopping, good foods, sight seeing & maybe try some luck at the casino."
,,Yet another beautiful bay front..,5.0,,I took a cruise ride which wasnt expensive at all and loved the tour. This place has also plenty of fine dine options too.
,,Spectacular as usual,5.0,,"Any time of the year, any time of the day, Marina Bay looks fabulous. Always a pleasure to take a tour, stop at Marina for a snack, buy few things from the mall and have a cappuccino on the bars along the shore.
What a spectacular design and architecture."
,,"Wonderful scenery, day and night",4.0,,"We are always keen to visit the Marina Bay as they are frequent activities held around the Bay, from Marina Bay Sands (MBS), to Marina Square, to Merlion Park, and to Clifford Pier. When visiting the Marina Bay, apart from visiting the splendid MBS, do go around the Bay and check out the Satay Club at Lau Pa Sat, and also the fullerton hotel at Clifford Pier. From the Pier, you can catch the laser light show at MBS, and it gives a different perspective as compared to the view from MBS."

,,A great area to walk around,4.0,,The 3.5km easy and accessible circular walk around the bay was full of many interesting sights. After starting at the Helix bridge I took lots of photos from the bridge and then again from the floating sports field. The lotus flower designed Art & Science Museum was a stunning architectural feature as was the Marina Bay Sands hotel. There were more interesting buildings and of course the Singapore Lion spouting water. Several river boat trips departures points were among the way and out walk ended at the Shoppes complex (part of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel). We kept away from the Casino via the underground access in the shopping complex but did visit the food hall and ice skating rink! It was a great walk.
,,Spectacular view and pampering,4.0,,"Room just normal. Size n decoration. But u r in marina bay sands no need to stay at room hotel too much. We tried to acces the pool and the view was soooo amazing. Its just the water that a bit cold makes me feel not too comfy. And try to have a wirlpool in the club where u can enjoy relax time while having a spectacular view with not too much crowd like @the pool.
The food just normal. Nothi g special. And 1 thing that makes me not feeling this is a 5stars hotel is their lobby. So crowded. When my 1st visit on christmast n new year vacation with family it was also sooo crowded i thought we are not in hotel but in public market. And my hubby told me probably because it was a high season. Then we visit again on april still same just a bit less crowd.
So not my favorite hotel but if u seek for spectacular pool view well u can stay here."
,,Marina Bay or Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"Skyscrapers area with some eye-catching spots.

It's nice in the day but i'd recommend a night view instead with all the lights lighting up the bay. You can also see the light show from here"
,,Sights .....and Sounds,3.0,,"Marina Bay boardwalk can be a visual treat - but timing is important to complete the spectacle.

While daytime strolls form a good perspective and show off some of the visual treats on offer, a twilight and night walk can really emphasise the experience. The MBS light show (I think two sessions each night) are worth the time to see. It can be viewed from the Marina Bay side or the opposite side. Eitherway, there are a range of eateries and cafes - but the seating is limited and its recommended that the Light show schedule is checked and tables reserved accordingly.
The light show is 'simulcast' with coordinated matched music.

Worth the effort,"
,,beautiful night view,5.0,,The night view is amazing. With all the lights and performances. There is also a shopping mall attached

,,Great Walk Day or Night,4.0,,Always great photo ops to be had. Laser show at night is ok but nothing too amazing. Drinks are super pricey around here. Ordered a glass of wine and 1 cocktail SGD 50. Really that is ridiculous. I travel a lot around Asia and this is the most expensive I have had ever seen. The helix bridge is worth walking across. Have a change of clothes standing by because you will sweat a bit on this walk.
,,Great place to walk,5.0,,"Lovely area to walk around.

Plenty to see and very picturesque.

Laser show every night which is worth a look and impressive images are projected on a mist created by the water.

Also hope to the iconic marina bay Sands hotel which makes a very bold statement to the area"
,,Decompression with a breath of fresh air,4.0,,"What is better after a day of whirlwind sightseeing and hustling through busy shopping malls than to escape to the openness of the Marina Bay. Flanked by glistening glass sky scraping luxury hotels the bay offers the tranquility of the Pacific ocean with its balmy breezes. By night, the wide boulevards and walkways come to life with myriads of joggers and strollers as well as a smattering of sidewalk artists who take away the weariness of the long walk, if you cover the entire length of this miles long journey. If you miss the usual street vendors so prevalent in other Asian cities, don't worry. There are plenty watering holes and eateries along the way that will satisfy most thirsts and palates. You will get a good feel of how Singapore is living up to its reputation as a garden state by providing a space such as the Marina Bay to decompress."
,,formula 1,5.0,,"went to the formula one which was held around this amazing location, city is beautiful, a must do with great restaurants and shopping choices"
,,Marina Bay Laser and Water show,4.0,,There are not many free shows in Singapore and this is a rare one. The 15 minutes show is worth the wait if you have dinner nearby.

,,Light show,5.0,,"It was great to visit Marina Bay to see the amazing view of Singapore's bustling cityscape, you can see how romantic can become Singapore by night. The night time water and laser show is amazing, worth the wait. This is held every night at the sands bay marina at 8:00pm. But, the shops and restaurants are pricey, we didn’t buy anything since the prices are more than in other famous shopping cities."

There are towering skyscrapers that light up the bay at night for some stunning photographs, the Marina Bay Sands has the light show each evening, shopping mall to walk through for some much appreciated air con and window shopping. There are plenty of food places and bars about. You can take a river cruise but it was overpriced in our opinion so skipped it.

,,Things to do in Singapore,4.0,,"One of the areas one would want to go alone or with someone or with family. It's a view that most would like to see with the new architecture of buildings and to appreciate the iconic buildings. On a nice weather, there are those walkways by the waters that you can enjoy with family and friends and enjoy all the good food and drinks all along the riverside. Great area to visit and watch the sunset as well."
,,Great walk and views,5.0,,"Depending on the weather this is a great free activity for the family.

Take a stroll around the whole bay taking in city views, the merlion, gardens, marina bays sands, and the flyer

If you do this around dusk watch the city change from day to night"
,,Fantastic what they have done,5.0,,This is a must see when you are in Singapore just the sheer scale and how it was built and operates is inspiring . We got down there early to beat the crowds and heat
,,Beautiful Skyline,5.0,,"One of the most iconic location in Singapore! And also I'm guessing it is the most photographed place as well. It is where you can see the Marina Bay Sands, the gorgeous skyline, the esplanade, and most specially the merlion park. Place is just absolutely stunning and one can wonder how they can maintain its cleanliness despite the influx of tourists."
,,Strolling along the Bay,5.0,,"Great area to visit, especially as the sun goes down. Great photo ops as the sun sets against the buildings. Night sky with skyscrapers is gorgeous. Fountains are lighted at night making great photos. Outdoor food court is a must - great variety of local cuisine is fabulous. Plan to walk all around the inner riverway from the the Marina Bay Sands hotel to the water spouting Lion and on around to the food court. Take it all in, you will remember the sights forever."
,,Water & Laser show,5.0,,I just have one word about it AWESOME. I have never witnessed anything like this ever in my life. It was fantastic and well recommended.
,,Singapore keeps everything clean,5.0,,Anyplace in Singapore is clean. Clean. Including the river. The central planning committee also sees to it that the views are nice with modern facilities and sights.
,,Romantic Walk at Night,5.0,,"I have seen this place transformed over the past 30 years. From land reclamation, doing up the landscaping, waterfront, merlon park, the peer, the bridges, and ultimately the MBS with shopping mall and the new beautiful financial buildings skyline. Evening and night view is fabulous...the night lighting, the skylines, and the overall ambient. Walking along the Marina Bay is a beautiful experience and more so, if you are with your love ones.
A strong recommendation for people who looked for a good dinner along the waterfront and a few hours to spend along the waterside."
,,one for all,5.0,,"all the amusement you need stand here, just go here and explore singapore... pls spend one day full.."
,,Great place!,5.0,,Great place for evenings. you can walk around the area or visit gardens by the bay. beautiful view and crowd. nice places to have a good dinner or visit the mall.
,,A great place to soak up the 'new Singapore',4.0,,"If you want to get a sense of how much Singapore has changed in the last 15 years or so, then a trip to the Marina Bay area is a must. Firstly, you will find yourself pretty much in the middle of the Grand Prix road circuit and if you take a close look at certain street you will see how the infrastructure has been set up for the night races. In September when the F1 show comes to town the transformation is quite phenomenal. I am a great fan of motor racing in general although I have to say that the road course is a bit of a compromise. It is mostly too narrow for real overtaking and and tends to slow the cars down. There is an area just before the end of each lap down at what is called the 'floating platform' where the cars have to make a sharp right followed almost immediately by two sharp left turns and another right angle right. It acts like a kind of chicane and is only there because there is an area of permanently fixed seating facing the bay itself.
For the arts, the area is famous for the Esplanade (lovingly termed 'the Durian"" by locals because of its stunning similarity to a very popular, but stinky, South East Asian fruit). This is a real world class venue and there is always something worth watching either in the theatre or the attached concert hall. Not far away also is the lovingly restored Victoria concert hall.
If you are a foodie, you will enjoy this area and the nearby outlets in the Bras Basah area. It is possible to find pretty much any kind of food and almost anywhere can be considered safe. My wife works in the F&B line and she is pretty happy to dine anywhere. Because this is a major tourist area, the prices are on the steeper side. When we go to the theatre, we tend to grab a bite at one of the outlets adjacent to the Esplanade. Harry's Bar is a favourite and they have definitely improved their food (it wasn't always brilliant). There are some great Japanese restaurants that serve some reasonable fare as well so, once again, choice is not really a problem.
All in all, be prepared for a fair bit of walking. Perhaps start off at a place like MBS (and the attached Shoppes By the Bay - hate the spelling ""shoppes"" by the way!) and then proceed around the edge of the bay. Have your camera ready, especially at night, as there are some spectacular pieces of architecture both old and new.
Of course, like anywhere in Singapore, if you are on foot carry an umbrella (I like those neat little fold away ones) because sooner or later you are going to get caught in one of our famous downpours."
,,A place where you can spend your evening with loved ones,4.0,,"Great view, do not miss the laser show at 8pm. Nice to walk around and check out the shopping and food options."
,,Great place to walk around,4.0,,Great views of the whole inner harbour and back across to the Merlion. Nice to walk around and checkout the mall with all its high end stores or grab food in the vast food hall. Or even go ice skating in! Plenty to do here!
,,A great stroll,5.0,,"We did a trip around the Marina Bay. Do not miss the light show visible from the front of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. That hotal also had a great shopping center with most of the major luxury brands. Allover, this was a nice almost 5 km (3 mile) walk. The architecture of the surrounding hotels is amazing."
,,Water fountain and laser show,5.0,,"At 8 pm presented a water fountain and laser show titled ""Wonderfull"". Its about life with song entitled What a wonderful world. I was entertained not just for this amazing show but also the theme they presented."

,,Great place,4.0,,"Exceptionally beautiful at night. Nice to stroll around if the weather is good. Captivating. There's a mall and casino too. A place for everyone, any age group."
,,Impressive landmark,5.0,,You wont miss these towers on your way out of the airport and into the city. Very distinct Singapore icon. Awesome at night. The hotel and the shopping mall is just very posh and grand. The shopping mall has all the expensive brands. And the mall links to the hotel towers and out to the Gardens by the bay. There are no restrictions in going in and out of the mall. Great for sight seeing for the budget freaks. Amazing fine dining and grand shopping for the rich.
,,Must see area,5.0,,"The Marina Bay area is a must see region of Singapore with lots to do and see. You can easily spend an enire afternoon/evening here.
Just be wary of of your budget blowing out though if you go shopping in the mall or are looking to visit the attractions as they are all expensive."
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,"Great views, even greater cleanliness. Good place to visit on a sunny day. Don't come if raining as you are more than likely to get wet."

,,BEAUTIFUL NIGHT VIEW,5.0,,"The whole area is just beautiful. I had a walk of the whole circle - from the MBS mall to The Fullerton Hotel. It is all connected beautifully. Lots of local people were walking or running the route. Of course, all tourists were busy taking pictures :-) The MBS does light show at 8pm. It is fun to see if you have never seen one from other cities like HK. Go around 5-6 before it gets too dark."
,,Everything you should and want to do and see in one place!,5.0,,"This is the best of Singapore wrapped into a relatively small area. Top food, hotels, shops, entertainment, casino - all in a beautiful indoor/outdoor setting. Whether you go day or night (should see both times), there is no lack of things to do or see.
Don't forget to bring a fat wallet!"
,,Relaxing scene at night,5.0,,"it nice to walk in this area at night it is so relaxing, although there's always lots of people but it is still a good place."
,,Excellent water display,5.0,,"Try to get there at 8pm as there is a lovely musical water display. Totally free, we watched from upstairs and it was quite quiet. Very busy down near the water. Bit of advice - buy your metro ticket in advance because the queue afterwards was horrendous.
There is also a sound and light display at 7.45 the gardens by the bay. We watched this then hurried across a walkway to the marina bay display!"
,,Nice lights,5.0,,We went here last night . The light show at night is better than Dubai. So much work to produce .You can eat takeaway and watch and listen to the incredible light show
,,Snazzy,5.0,,"Visitied this place at night, modern clean and snazzy. There is even a little light show on the water which was nice to watch"
,,"Promenade, anyone?",5.0,,"Although very nice at any time of day, I'd heartily recommend this venue for an evening walk. And, you wouldn't be alone. Going for a walk in the evening along the waterfront is quite popular -- how could you blame anyone? People are patronizing the restaurants. The lights from the buildings glitter beautifully on the bay water. It makes for a pleasant experience. If you're not exhausted from the day's events, you really should go."
,,amazing,4.0,,The Marina bay includes the Jubilee bridge and the walking path alongside the water front. The small eateries welcome you to taste their local delicacies. Beautiful lights light up the buildings around the area and it is a spectacular sight at night. A vantage point on the river edge Allows one to see the laser show that goes on.
,,Awesome views at night.,5.0,,"Would advice to take a walk along the marina at night after dark. You can rent a cycle also. If you cant walk, you can always do the singapore river cruise which is on till 9pm. There are quite a few docks you can buy tickets from. A must do for all visitors."
,,The Glamour Precinct for Window Shopping,4.0,,"Strategically located between the hotel and casino, this offers all the big name brands with accompanying price tags. It has the best the world has to offer. Amazing that such an obviously expensive retail precint has so many shops with minimalist stocks. It is the best way to cross under the roadway, and if you are lucky at the casino, a handy place to shop. We enjoyed the Window Shopping."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"Ridiculously clean, very well presented and modern, easily accessible from every direction. Great views, well worth the trip"
,,Amazing Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore has achieved so much in such a short time and if anything symbolised this more, it is Marina Bay. Here is where you find the towering Marina Bay Sands Hotel with it super clean casino and prestige shops that line up next to each other better than almost any major city in the world. Stunning architecture looms everywhere; a testament to a modern city that has not only come of age, it has surpassed much of its competition. And then when you throw in a F1 Grand Prix, the Gardens By the Bay, stunning restaurants with world class views, you truly feel mixed emotions - humbled, yet in the presence of something very significant and exciting."
,,Great place to shop and water front bars and restaurants,4.0,,"The lights and sound show is very touristy, but the shopping and casino / bars and restaurants make this area a great place to hang out."

,,Spectacular view .,4.0,,I went to the Marina Bay sands as part of a Singapore night tour. You go up to the 75th floor and there is a viewing area where you can see the whole city.

,,Good evening activities,4.0,,You can walk there. I believe I did it from Clarke Quay to Marina Bay Sands to Gardens by the Bay. It's a long walk but it's perfect for evening activity to fill in your trip.
,,Beautiful Setting,5.0,,"Marina bay is a picturesque part of the city that is well worth a visit. There are bars and restuarants, shops and attractions such as boat trips. Its free to walk round and the views are great. Its very hot all year so use sunscreen and take advantage of the connection by MRT which allows you to access the bay on either side, one train stop is in a hotel and you can ride ther escalators up to the bay and through a shopping centre. The Bay is well used by locals and touristes and we found it not too crowded. Its quite a big space so there is plenty of room for all. There is a glass helix bridge that spans the quay and you can walk from one side of the bay to the other. There are shopping centres close by and it is very clean and well kept. Lovely gardens are at one side and there is a view of the Singapore Flyer."
,,Amazing at night,5.0,,This place is amazing especially in evening. The lights of the buildings and their reflection on the water makes a great scene. Recommended big time.
,,Feast for the eye!,5.0,,A must be visited place in Singapore. Well planed construction and the air is fresh. Be sure to bring water since this walk will make you thirsty.

,,Amazing addition to Singapore,5.0,,"A great area to visit day or night. Access to Marina Sands Hotel, Casino and shops. Plenty of dining options to choose from. Cabs are cheap in Singapore so easy to get around."
,,Bright during sunset,4.0,,During dusk it is a pleasant have the view at the bay. I was very impressed with the way it is maintained by the authorities. Even the visitors will think twice before they try to litter at the zone.
,,Wonderful Bay,5.0,,We walked quite a lot at this place though the place was quite crowded. We visited the place in the early afternoon and left the place late in the evening. The view in the evening was worth it. Overall a good experience.

,,Marvelous Place,5.0,,"Wonderful area with lot of things to do and see. Especially after sunset, the area becomes vibrant with lot of lights and sound."
,,Fantastic area with lovely testaurants,5.0,,This is the place to visit for a nice lunch or dinner or maybe some cocktails in the evening. It enjoyed gorgeous modern architecture. I think an evening visit is more jaw dropping than a daylight visit.
,,"Good city views, especially at night",4.0,,"Its hot during the day, but evening or night walks around the Marina Bay area provide great views of the Singapore marina lit up. Some great opportunities for night time city photos if you are into that.

Lots of attractions in the area (from the Shoppes, Art and Science Museum, Gardens by the Bay, the Merlion across the river) all very walkable. There are plenty of places to eat as well.

There are laser light and water shows from the promenade area outside of the Shoppes at Marina Bay starting at fixed times (check their website for ""wonder full"" showtimes).

We caught a laser show at 9 pm. It was good, although if you have seen Vegas or Dubai fountains they may be underwhelming. Similar to the Disney laser shows. But its still nice to sit there and enjoy the atmosphere and the music.

Recommended."
,,Sparkling night,4.0,,A very nice place to jog or run at the bay sides in the morning and a nice hang out for the family to walk for a night sight seeing. The sparkling reflections of the lights in it's water bedeck the view of the place.
,,Straight out of the books !,5.0,,"This is the place of all the photographs and where all the tourists hang out. It is as picturesque as the books make it look. In our view it is better looking from the city area towards Marina Bay Sands then going up MBS and looking at the city skyline. That said if you want to have a good view of the daily light show, you need to be over at MBS. Nice to walk all the way round in the evening but is further than it looks !"
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,"Marina Bay is worth a visit when in Singapore. Good dining options, direct access to shopping mall and museums and an amazing view."
,,When in Singapore..,3.0,,"You have to go here if not for anything more than to be able to say yes when constantly asked. Admittedly we didn't go up to the sky deck as we didn't want to pay to do so but still enjoyed walking through the casino with the endless self serving drink options and the adjoining mall.
The food court in the mall was amazing. Soo many options to chose from and such great prices. You must go to the food court.
Also caught the light show one night and to be honest it wasn't that great. The gardens by the bay one is better if you have to chose."
,,Excellent Area,5.0,,"We stayed in this area in a 5 * hotel and this is such a beautiful district, completely safe,very clean and so much to see and do. Huge shopping centre with more than enough shops and restaurants and a casino plus many tourist attractions to visit - Gardens by the Bay,Helix Bridge, Singapore Flyer, Merlions,Skypark observation deck,science centre and theatres. Also there is a light show to music twice nightly at the event plaza which is free and worth seeing. Also nice walks around it linked by walkways and bridges and plenty opportunities for photography by day and at night when everywhere lights up. Beautiful ! One of the nicest places I have visited ."
,,Go after sunset,4.0,,"This is a good place to have a stroll after your dinner. If the weather holds, walk along the waterside and enjoy the musical fountain if you have your timing correct. When it gets too warm, go into the mall and cool yourself down."
,,"Nice in the day, better at night",4.0,,"I love cities where you can walk and see the water. It was about a 3 km stroll from my hotel and I so enjoyed all the sites on my way to the marina.

Once there I was happy with the F1 pits, the fancy Marina Sands hotel buildings and the marina. I did not go up on the large Ferris wheel but I but the city views would be amazing.

I would recommend this to anyone in the area."
,,Amazing Building,4.0,,"Take a train to Bayfront ,do a few things while in the area. Look and shop in Marina Bay Sands , Lots of high end shops over a few levels ,food court and water rides , full on. Pay and take a lift to the observation area, looks out over the bay . Your can not access the pool area. Go outside the complex and visit the Gardens by the Bay ,Satays by the Bay further down the peninsular . Walk back and visit the Art and Science Museum, thats a full day, jump on the train and back to your accommodation"

Love the plenty of seats and wonderful town planning for the people to really just sit, relax and just enjoy the magnificent surroundings. Marina Bay is no exception! If I were Singaporean, I would really hang out at this spot all the time..."
,,marina Bay Waterfront,3.0,,"This is a good area to visit, hangout, eat and people watch. The lazier show- 13 minutes is nothing special and is a bit boring. The stage show is free and fun to watch."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is a fabulous place and cannot be missed when you are in Singapore. Make sure you enjoy the boat cruise in the evening when the light display is on. There is loads of activities around the marina Bay and it is an expensive place to be but with all of the activities it means that there is opportunity not to spend loads of cash. The entertainment around the bay is lovely and the atmosphere is safe and welcoming. I cannot wait to get back to the city. Enjoy yourselves.

,,Stop off from australia,5.0,,"We stayed in singapore for 2 nights to break up the long flight. We got a voucher for trishaw tour, part of the tour was a ride on a bumboat down through marina bay. There's a light show which starts at 7 ish. A beautiful city lots to see on marina bay. Loads of history. Places to drink and eat or maybe a walk.

,,Amazing Place,4.0,,"Great views, good for watching the beautiful people come evening. Expensive food and drinks but worth a visit if you get a free afternoon/evening"
,,Fantastic Scenery - especially in the night,5.0,,"Recommend to take a boat ride from Clarke Quay - this is the best opportunity to take nice pic's of the beautiful scenery.

second option is a walk on the Helix Bridge - either Metro Station Bayfront and a short walk toward the bridge or from the other side taxi to Youth Olympic park or Bus station Bef Temasek Ave."
,,Worth a wander,4.0,,It was good to have a wander around Marina Bay while in this part of the city. We found the canal and waterworks most interesting to watch while we were at a cafe.

,,So calm and soothing here,5.0,,"A soothing breeze kept our body temperature at par, as it was so hot outside!

,,Most photographed,5.0,,"The bay has many attractions, but the best is the sight of the three towers of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (MBS) with a rooftop two hundred meters up in the air.

The building is the most photographed object in Singapore. And we couldn't resist photographing the building either. Do you?

Look for more reviews by MulleEllum."
,,Iconoic Singapore place,5.0,,Well Marina Bay is the symbol of Singapore culture - open friendly and attractive . walk along this bay in a relaxed environment is a great experience . The laser show is very good (even more valuable given that it is free) . It think it happened twice . See if from the area close to Louis Vitton showroom
,,Refreshing,5.0,,"There are some very nice places on the water in Singapore. Easy to access, enjoyable for a stroll, a run, or just to sit and observe life."
,,A view of a World Class City State,5.0,,Living in Asia it makes me appreciate how so many things are new and world class and Singapore is a world class city you can stand @ Marina Bay and enjoy the city by day or the beauty by night. Absolutely amazing place.
,,Beautiful views and fantastic foor and bars.,5.0,,"First, the Marina Bay Sands light show is very impressive. Camp in a rooftop bar (Fullerton bay hoter or Kinkis is good) and watch the light show.
The view is spectacular. Wander from the Merlion around the bay to MBS and the helix bridge. You can pretty much ignore the Financial Centre (MBFC) as the bars there are no different to anywhere else, but a walk around the bay is relaxing. If you do want to stop off in MBFC then try Level33 in Tower 1."
,,Best at night all lit up!,5.0,,See the Ship high above and the boats on the water and the Big Durian Theatre. A must see at night when in singapore.
,,Holiday 2016,4.0,,Marina bay is buzzing there are loads of shops and plenty of eateries from the food halls to individual restaurants there catering for all different tastes . I would also advise that in the evening you take a river boat trip from Clark Quay down to marine bay for the laser light show and take in all the history of the area
,,Pretty!,5.0,,The most beautiful place in singapore! gets even more beautiful at night! you can go by metro. almost all best atraction is there.
,,"Shopping Mall, Take A Look By Boat, Take Photos...",4.0,,"We took a look by all over the city on boat. That was an expensive experience. We can see all the buildings at night, listened to the history by a short documentary film. it's about 45 SGD by MRT, and boat. After that, we walked and took photos, then we entered the Marina Bay Sands inside. What a fantastic experience. It's large, about triple Takashimaya Vietnam, and very very beautiful. There are casino, famous brands, souvernies shop... We can find Gabbana, Chanel...Every floor has an kind of many many store as fashion, perfume...I dont join to go into the casino 'cause i forgot my passport at the hotel. We also went up stairs to see all the mall and the view above. There's windy, but we didn't cam into the hotel Marina yet =)) We came out at after 12:00, the MRT shut down then we went by taxi. A very beautiful Marina Bay <3
P/s: You can find music outside at weekends."

,,Stunning,5.0,,Completely transforms at night which is the best time to visit. There's bars right on the front which aren't too pricey. The hotel does a light show each night so worth being there for that
,,Water show,4.0,,Unsure about the water show time. Its awesome to enjoy the water show with all the nice and tall building surrounded. Its romantic instead.
,,worth spending an evening!,5.0,,"The bay at night offers real glittering views around. The laser show is really good.

One should have some water bottle along as there is lot of walking one needs to do in Singapore due to large malls and temperature normally ranging around 27-30 deg C even in evenings in May-September."
,,Marina Bay-World Class!,5.0,,Marina was one of the best I have ever seen! The panorama features numerous ultra-modern skyscrapers in a wonderful setting by the water front. At night the Marina is enhanced with many lights on the tall buildings and also a fantastic light show happens nightly with laser beams and hologram images accompanied with music! The show is adjacent to the shopping mall with lasers eminating from small floating boats on the marina waters.

,,NIghtime,5.0,,Excellent spot at the night time to just enjoy the views across the marina and watch the light show.
,,Viewing Deck,4.0,,The viewing deck of the Marina Bay gives a good perspective of Singapore and the various location points show all sides of Singapore. The information at each location was not in English which meant you did not have all the information regarding that viewing point.
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,This is right next to the New Casino and is full of high end pricey shops.Just really another shopping center which is typical Singapore.
,,Beautiful Stroll,4.0,,Just a gorgeous place to stroll around and take in all the beauty surrounding it. Or sit in the shade and just look around. Places nearby to have a drink or ice cream. A beautiful spot in Singapore that you just have to visit.

,,Good for tourists,5.0,,Great place to visit and have a look around shopping is good but very expensive here Taxis super heap in Singapore and readily abaila6
,,Jaw Dropping Hotel,5.0,,"Massive room, gorgeous view, jaw-dropping pool, well located (close to many train stops), has a casino attached and many high-end shops to window shop. Theres so much to do in the area - you wont get bored. Great hotel overall.

Service was reasonable. Watch out for the guy guarding the pool - he was very rude and makes you feel crap, which is not what you want when you pay that kind of money to stay there.

Also, watch out for the bar fridge as it automatically charges items to your room as soon as you take it out of the fridge (even just to move it). There is not much room to store things like your childs food a milk.

Other than that, it was an amazing hotel. Extremely luxurious."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,It is a ver beautifil place and definitely highly recommended. You can see Singspores skyline and an excellent view towards Marna Bay Sands. Giod for sporting activities
,,"Impressive, as most of Singfapore",4.0,,"Best go late afternoon and enjoy the waterfront, do some people watching, admire the incredible architectures and have an ice-cream at The Fullerton waterfront."
,,Splendid in the night,5.0,,Very splendid to see this place in the night.. the light sparkling and the water makes a wonderful experience.
,,Super,5.0,,Loved the light show...lots of great shops in this area too.Easy to locate eating places with lots of food halls nearby.
,,Best after sunset,4.0,,"As the pictures posted here will attest, Marina Bay is at its prettiest after sunset (though the Merlion itself is probably best photographed on a bright sunny day or at sunset).

I would recommend combining a visit here with the nearby civic district (comprising the National Gallery, Asian Civilisations Musuem - see picture of map), perhaps starting with the museums in the late afternoon. To get from the civic district to One Fullerton and the Merlion, you need to take the underpass located under the Fullerton Hotel (I've noticed this isn't sign posted at all or perhaps I missed it).

The light show is not in my view particularly spectacular; a bit cheesy. The restaurants at One Fullerton are also not fantastic. From One Fullerton, you get the money shot of Marina Bay Sands hotel. Likewise if you walk round the Bay to the MBS side (go counterclockwise toward Marina Bay Financial Center - it's a nicer walk), you get the money shot of the business district skyline."
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,Paying the fee to be able to go to the top or having a drink in the roof-bar. Both is worth the money! The nearly 360 o view is breath-taking.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Quick visit to Singapore due to a long haul flight. Very impressed with the marina bay and the spectacular lighting show. Cannot wait to be back
,,Food court fun!,4.0,,"This complex is amazing, with so much to see and do. I tried the food court ob level B2and found myself surrounded by locals - always a bonus when travelling, I think. Hundreds of different food optiond at a great price. Given the high end nature of this centre, finding cheap, delicious food is a nice surprise. After dinner, head up and out to see the light show on the bay."
,,Try the small boat trips,4.0,,"Although a very nice place to visit during the day, do try one of the small boat trips at night and take a camera with you. You can disembark from the boat at several points along the way and use it like a water taxi."
,,Great place to get a shot of the SG skyline!,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a nice relaxing place to walk and take in the skyline and some of the architecture in SG. You can also see one of the merlions here! While I was there they happened to be filming an episode of The Amazing Race and there were contestants running around looking for the pitstop flags. You'll get a great view of marina Bay sands, the ""durian"" and the helix bridge from here."
,,Lots to see and do,5.0,,"It stands out of the landscape and there is lits to see and do. Eat, shop or stroll its up to you.

Some nice bars and restaurants or the casino ( lots of smokers inside)

Visit day or night for a differenet perspective on it.

,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Very nice place to go for a walk, or sit and watch people walk by. Nice to se the sunset and all the lights on skyskrabers and boats in the evening. As a turist its a must to se the ""Wonder Full"" light and water show by the Promenade by te Marina Bay Sands shopping mall."
,,"Night, Light, Water and Music",4.0,,"A lovely place to sit and watch city high rise lights and reflection in water.See changing colors of Merlion, laser lights of Marina Bay Sand Hotel. Esplanade flashing and much more."
,,a very good integrated hotel,4.0,,stayed at this hotel during the F1 grand prix and considering its proximity to the races the checkin was smooth and staff very pleasant. Ask for Tower 2 for easy access to the Sky Pool and Gymnasium as have seen many guests from Tower 1 and 3 going down to the lobby and then catching lifts at Tower 2. There are floors to connect but hotel staff do not advise guests. Plenty of good restaurants for all taste and good shopping . A new restaurant to try is Seafood Paradise newly opened last week and its Chilli Crab is absolutely fabulous. Price is competitive given its location. Service excellent. The hotel gymnasium smallish in comparison to the number of rooms at hotel. All available space has been turned into restaurants. Obviously management are not health conscious.
,,High brand shops and restaurants,5.0,,"As with all of Singapore this was delightfully clean. Huge place with lots of levels, all the top shops and restaurants. Worth a visit"
,,"Fabulous , Happening , A must visit !!!",5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, this is the place for a must visit. The best place to spent a whole evening. You can spent 3 to 4 hours very easily, be a solo traveler or with friends or family. The most happening place for shoppers , travelers be it local/international. A nice walk/trail along the river side will really allure you. Starting from high rises to beautiful construction will amaze you. There are many restaurants and bars throughout the area. Awesome food ,love to be back again and again. You also may take a ride into the heritage Clarke Quay from different points of the bay."
,,Luxury place,5.0,,"We love been here, all you needs is in here. Place to stay, shopping mall, playground, lights in night, casino. Etc. We love the lasers, front of merlion and the bay. Really cool, always spend a night in here.."

,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Just live this place it always busing.
Its not always tourists a lot of ex pats and Singaporeans love it too.
The view at night it amazing and with so many choices of places to eat and drink its popular all week round.
It gets really busy on a Friday and Saturday evening so its a great place to sit and be amazed at the wonderful sights and to people watch.
Just wonderful."
,,Stunning architecture,4.0,,"Worth a visit for many reasons, the architecture, the views, for shipping, drinking or eating. Marina bay has something for everyone & can be accessed via foot or by one of the many river boat trips or taxis frequently traveling across the bay. it's a great place for photo opportunities also and the shopping Centre here houses all of the tip designer brands along with many eateries & also a large casino."
,,Beautiful is one word to describe the Marina,5.0,,"This area of Singapore is stunning, with the river that winds thru the city opening up into this gorgeous Marina. You can visit both day or night, hopefully both and you will not be disappointed. The buildings, bridges, statues...everything here has been done to a ery high standard. Walk or take a boat tour, the photo opportunites are endless."
,,A nice walk,4.0,,"We found this to be a nice walk around the Bay but shopping is expensive. I advise to walk slow and take it all in as it's a big area. A very good spot for photos. We ended up catching a Double Decker bus went to Harbourfront. From Marina Bay,there are lots of buses to catch to see he sights which I suggest. We didn't get to see it all but will be back next year to finish what we didn't get to see. It is worth the time to see except that the Merrion is disapointing."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Very spacious, beautiful views and a lovely walk for all. Once again so many pictures taken, every step things looked different."
,,Fantastic Shopping Destination,5.0,,"The best high-end mall complex in Singapore. Superb restaurants, luxury brand shops, at the marina/bay linking to Gardens of the Bay and the Marina Bay Hotel and Casino."
,,Lot of Pokestops,5.0,,"Starting from the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, me and my friend walked past the very shiny LV building, over the bridge, past the Fullerton Hotel until we reached the Merlion.

This is a pleasant place and close proximity to good places to see like Esplanade, Raffles Place, Merlion, CQ, River front, Museums, shopping centers, etc many I can't list so many here. Merlion and the river front, great view of the Marina Bay building, Ferris wheel are the major attractions for me. Have enough time even if you are on a short visit to this plae."
,,Must Do,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore it is essential that you visit Marina Bay, and you must put aside at least one whole day or more to explore it properly.

Walking around the perimeters of Marina Bay will take you to some of the most stunning, exciting, scenic, historic, beautiful and entertaining attractions in Singapore.

First of all is the Marina itself, an artificial bay created by the damming of the Singapore River to provide water supply, flood control, and water-based entertainment and activities.

Then there are the Gardens by the Bay, the Marina Barrage, the Marina Sands, Raffles Place, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, Merlion Park, the ArtScience Museum, the Fullerton Hotel, Clifford Pier, Theatre on the Bay ... I could go on an on.

The reality is that Marina Bay is an amalgam of both historic Singapore and the modern City State.

You cannot visit Singapore without coming here."
,,Future is here,5.0,,"To come to Singapore and not take a walk around the Marina Bay area would simply be idiotic. The stunning skyline, modern and perfectly clean surroundings, crazy architecture and the calm quiet buzz offer a lovely strawl. Very impressive for anyone from Europe (the old continent)... it's like taking a trip to the future ;) love it! Many upscale places here for F&B offer if that's what you like, but just a nice walk will do the trick."

,,Expensive but great but expensive,5.0,,"As many already know this place is a must visit when in Singapore. I've been there but never spent a penny. Went into the casino to look around, just like in the movies. At that time, you needed to hand in your passport to enter the casino."
,,Splendid,5.0,,"Other cities with magnificent coastlines usually have a wide and large harbour.Singapore only has a small bay, however the coastline is still very nice. The lights and the buildings at Raffles Place together with the landmarks like the Merlion, Esplanade and Sands formed the most charming coastline. It's not just a small bay anymore with these buildings, it has become the symbol of Singapore. Singapore is such a beautiful place, the skyline is so fascinating, the city and the air is clean, the Singaporeans do greening so well that you can find trees and plants everywhere. It's a nice place to travel as well as live here."

,,Vibrant and colourful,3.0,,"Our visit to Singapore is coloured by the fact that, unavoidably, the Grand Prix was to be held a few day after our departure, so some places were hard to get to. Like Marina Bay.
Having given you a hint of what troubled me, I actually thought it a bit over-rated and boring. The lazar show was great. The sidewalks were interesting and colourful. The restaurants were nice, if fearfully expensive, but will I go back..... unlikely
Singapore has much more to offer the weary traveller"
,,The walkboard near the eiver,5.0,,The bay is well connected to the financial centre. The Merlion. The garden by the bay. Marina bay sands. Is the centre of attractions. Walking distance is walkable I should say. But you are tired. There is restaurant and eateries all nearby.
,,Beautiful View,5.0,,One of the star attractions. Must Visit and cannot be missed on your visit to Singapore. The view is excellent at night and the area in and around is a tourist hobnob! Next to the financial hub of Singapore
,,City views,3.0,,"Very over priced to look at a view. Drinks massively over priced up the top. Very good engineering building it, but apart from that don't bother unless you get up for free."
,,Singapore,5.0,,"Upon landing in Singapore, the Taxi Stand is well organized with sufficient taxis for everyone.... the ride will breeze u thru beautiful neat row of trees along the highway n into the heart of the City. . It is a pleasant and warmth welcome. Best time to land in Singapore would be in the late morning to mid afternoon where the ride is a breeze avoiding any form of traffic.
It is a Shopping Paradise for those whom wants to check out the latest fashion and to source for the latest electronic gadgets and hardware, etc. or, to dine in the many eateries / restaurants found located along the famous 'Orchard Road'. .
U can download 'Grab' App onto your mobile phone to book a car conveniently, to bring u anywhere efficiently. . from just about anywhere in Singapore.
After Shopping, in the evening at +_7.30pm.,
It would be great to take a few nice photos from the Boat Ride, starting from 'Clarke Quay' in the City, and end up having dinner along the Quay, and u can enjoy some night life and listen to various music offered there, as well.
If u r with your Family,
Please bring them to Sentosa Island for a day trip. . U may even decide to book a hotel room there. I found the 'Hard Rock Hotel' to be decent and value for money. The number of activities available at Sentosa are far too long for me to state formerly in Trip Advisor... and please don't forget the Singapore Zoological Gardens at Mandai. Your kids will love it. Please dress casually to enjoy the stroll.
Do also bring your kids for the 'Duck Tour' ride, located at Suntec City at the Exhibition and Convention Tower Block of Marina Centre in the City. They will love the ride on the amphibious vehicle. There again, more shopping and food....
For the Solo Traveler like myself,
I urge u to try and reside in the 'Fullerton Hotel' and spend some time at the Marina Bay Sands'. It is comforting and beautiful. Remember to take the Lift up to the Rooftop 'Pool Deck Level' and have yourself a well deserved rest and a drink absorbing the panaromic view from up there at +_5.30pm.
Singapore has many other areas of interests. . from which u may discover them on your own, when u collect the brochures from one of the Top Airports in the World, at Changi International Airport
Prior to your departure, do drop by at East Coast Park, 'Jumbo' and or, 'Long Beach' Seafood Restaurant' and try out the Black Pepper or, Chilli Sri Lankan 2kg Crabs'!!. Super juicy""!!
At the Airport,
you may even decide to check-in earlier before your departure, just to enjoy the facilities and any last minute shopping, if required.
There r 03 terminals linked by mono-rail ride for free, to bring you around. U can even taste some local food at B2 of Terminal 03. Many other restaurants r also found on Level 02 of Terminal 02. And much more to Offer. . Just for your info only;
There is a future mall being constructed in front of Terminal 01, and Terminal 04 to be opened soon.
Meanwhile,
Wishing u a most pleasant flight and stay whilst in Singapore.
Dr. Lim."

On the weekends, at about 9 or 10pm, there is a free outdoor light show, a little like Hong Kong's light show. It's not bad, worth to watch once.
Then if u need a break, can walk around MBS, go up to the sky observatory or you can just go to any celebrity restaurants/cafes in MBS for a short stop. Then you can walk on to the Fullerton Bay hotel, Fullerton Hotel where there is the Merlion Park (One Fullerton).
There are nice bars and restaurants here as well, as well as the famed Merlion of Singapore.

,,Good view.....,4.0,,The bay is very well maintained as a tourist attraction. Lots of boat rides are available from the Merlion statue. Good place to hang out in the evenings and the night. Can catch a glimpse of the laser show if you are lucky.

,,A must see,5.0,,"This is a must see place on your itinerary. There are some great attractions around the bay and all are in walking distance such as the Science museum ,concert halls and the Merlion. Hope on a river cruise appreciate it further."
,,Spend at least a half day here,5.0,,"This is a gorgeous place to take your time and stroll around, be sure to visit the Sands and the museum. The best place to take it all in before or after in air conditioned comfort is the Starbucks at the Fullerton Waterboat House. There is no more beautiful and comfortable place to have a $5 drink."
,,Magnificent at night,5.0,,Went here on a beautiful clear night with a slight breeze. The lights of the city and reflections on the water provides quite a spectacle possibly rivaling Sydney by night. It is worth walking the foreshore or sitting by the water watching the ferries going back and forth or admiring the beauty of the well lit buildings and infrastructure. Not sure of Singapore's power bill but this is a sight to behold.
,,Quite a Complex,4.0,,"This area is intensely developed, both on land and into the air. I visited twice and some of the other reviews provide more detail. Lots of food and shopping choices and lots of walking. Be sure to check out the Art Science Museum on the water side of the complex."

,,Beautiful for a stroll,5.0,,"You can enjoy a stroll around the bay day and night. But I would suggest to go in the evening as the weather cools off a bit and everything lights up. Stay for a fountain light and music show, enjoy the skylines and get a drink in one of the bars nearby with the views to the bay."
,,A great place to visit during the evening,4.0,,"A single pit spot for various attractions in Singapore. This place is hub for visiting the Garden by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, Merlion Garden, Marina Bay Sands, and the Formula One circuit along with various attractions."

,,Awesome sights & atmosphere not to be missed...,5.0,,"There is no better place to catch the beautiful & awesome modernity of Singapore than right here. Particularly at night, where the impressive lightings creates awesome views & atmosphere against the vast bay & dark skyline. Excellent place for couples spending relaxing time or family strolls or for great pictures.

Whichever of the 360°angles you looked at, you are surrounded by amazing skyscrapers, 5 stars hotels, huge shopping malls, artistic & historic buildings like Fullerton Hotel, The Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands.

And the majestic Merlion spouting continuous jets of water against the bay.

Don't miss coming here, or one missed one of the parts of this city."
,,Stroll round the Bay for a close up view of some of Singapore's most iconic modern buildings,5.0,,"Start your walk at The Sail @Marina Bay, a towering residential development near Raffles Place easily identifiable by the curved edge of one of the two towers. Walk towards the Marina Bay Sands building . You can go into Shoppes (pronounced shoppies!) , the mall at the base of MBS and walk past all the designer shops and expensive cafes, enjoying the respite from the heat. Note: Twice nightly there is a sound and laser show across the Bay. Watch it from the tiers of steps outside Shoppes for the best view of the images projected onto screens of water. To get the best view of the lasers, watch from the other side of the Bay....the rooftop bar at The Fullerton Bay Hotel is a good spot or there is a Starbucks open until gone 11pm. Returning to the walk, leaving Shoppes pass the white lotus shaped building (a science exhibition centre) and follow the Bay around, crossing over the celebrated Helix bridge which gives great views of MBS and the CBD. Pass the Mandarin Oriental hotel and the floating sports pitch and head for the Merlion statue, always surrounded by crowds of tourists. Note the splendid Fullerton Hotel on your right which was the old Post Office. Carrying on round the Bay you pass bars and restaurants and eventually you find yourself by the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Walk through the Lobby of the hotel and back to Raffles Place. The circuit of the Bay takes around an hour at a leisurely pace."
,,"My favorite spot in singapore...very modern, romantic",5.0,,"It's always become my fave spot in singapore. The scene are very dramatic and romantic..with all the lights on, the combination between the helix bridge, marina bay sands, esplanade and merlion...it's the signature of new singapore"
,,Ultimate attraction,5.0,,The Marina Bay Area of Singapore is in itself eye catching. You will be required to walk a lot here. It is advised to take a water taxi from Marina Bay to Clarke Quay OR Merlion. The Water Taxi to Merlion is at 6.30 P.M.
,,Dont miss the light show,5.0,,"The place gets very lively in the evenings. But its equally beautiful in the day time.

There are lots of restaurants along the bay so take your time and have a romantic meal at one of them. Its very hot in July so arrive here around 7 pm when it starts to cool down and you can see the city lite up. We didn't go on the water taxi but you can take one to get across the bay if you don't feel like walking,"
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,"We came here on our first night to take a look at the lights, it was very beautiful indeed and the light show was worth seeing."

There is a light and sound show in each evening at 8PM which is open to all and the laser light comes from the great Marina Bay Sand.

It's a good place to hangout, walk, cycling. But in case of rain, there is no shade."
,,Stunning achitecture,5.0,,"The whole Marina Bay area has outstnding architecture from the Marian Bay hotel to the Science centre this palce has it all.

,,Very affluent,3.0,,Not for the average budget conscious traveller. All high end shops. Good to see how the rich do there shopping though
,,Crowded.,4.0,,"Be prepared for thick crowds as this is a very popular attraction in Singapore. The shops are high end and can be seen in other parts of the city. The building itself is unique from inside and out and a good photo opportunity. The lift to the top is very crowded with a long wait, and maybe best to access this to watch the sky show each night. Bars and eateries are good variety and nice to watch all the chaos."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,we stayed at the Fullerton Bay hotel the light show that was coming from the mall was amazing the atmosphere was like a giant party the bay lit u have to see to believe!

,,Lovely evening in the backdrop of Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"Such a wonderful place to spend an evening. We strolled over from the Gardens by the Bay after watching the Sound and Light Show there across the Helix Bridge. It's a wonderful sight with all the beautiful architecture all around lit up beautifully. The Marina Bay Sands puts up a Laser Show at around 9:30.
We had dinner at the Makansutra Gluttons Bay Hawker's Market. It's more pricier than the traditional Hawker's Markets (this is the posher version created specially for the Marina), but it's the perfect place to eat and enjoy the view.
We were lucky to stumble onto a free concert at the Esplanade Open Air arena. All in all a lovely evening spent in a beautiful ambience."

,,"A Nice View, But Not Worth Planning a Day Around",3.0,,"Marina Bay is an attractive place for a picture or two, and there is some impressive architecture to look at, but unless you plan on sitting for a long time and sketching I would not suggest you plan to spend more than half an hour there. Pay more attention to what is around Marina Bay (i.e. the art museum etc.) than the place itself. There is plenty to do around Marina Bay, and it is a nice view in and of itself."
,,Lovely City Skyline,4.0,,"Singapore is a lovely modern city, however it does not get going anywhere much before 10.30am each day and not before lunchtime on Sundays. Take care in the bars on the water front as they are very expensive."
,,Disneyland singapore by the bay,3.0,,Very shiny corporate money extracting factory by the bay. this place is really like a couple attractions rolled into one. Very clean and well-maintained.
,,Fantastic skyline!,4.0,,"A nice way to spend an evening in Singapore is to wander around Marina Bay when the buildings are lit up. One can have fantastic views of the Marina Bay sands, the observation wheel and the Merlion. I would recommend taking a boat ride followed by drinks and a meal in one of the restaurants that dot the area."
,,Great place for a walk,4.0,,This is a great area for walking (alone or accompanied) and trying various bars & restaurants. It's not the busiest area which makes it more enjoyable and you can go all the way around the bay.
,,Sight seeing tour,5.0,,"For a water area it has a lot more, a floating football pics on one side by the huge shopping mall and restaurants, Fullerton hotel and bars on the other, the Merlion on far side.

In the evening they put on a free music and light show which you can view from the steps in front of the mall"
,,One of Best Place in Singapore,5.0,,"You can see the view of Singapore from the top (SandSky). Better view in the night. Because of safety reason, no tripod and umbrella allowed to bring along, because open roof. Unforgetable moment to visit here with families"

,,Stunning,5.0,,"A great view and a good walk, both day and night. Always something going on. Great eateries and bars surround. A must when in Singapore."
,,Night time walk around the bay.,4.0,,"It's a quick underground ride from the centre and a short walk from the nearest station. There was a pleasant breeze on the waterfront which is surrounded by the giant skyscrapers from the financial district, it's quite a spectacle. There are plenty of bars and restaurants and everything feels very safe as does Singapore in general. The merlion fountain is quite striking, it looks about 20 feet tall.

We went with friends to see the daily laser show but it must have been an off night. It looked more like a 5 year old had been told not to touch the light switches at home, then played with them whilst the parents weren't looking. I'm told that it should have been more impressive."
,,Spare Your Time to Watch Light and Water Show,4.0,,"There is shows every night for Light and Water Show. Amazing arts, and it is free to enjoy. Just in front of the The Shoppee of Marina Bay Sands"
,,At night there is a big light show,5.0,,Very beautiful to walk around and take pictures. Many activities and shops. Altough the shopping mall is very high end and luxury products it still remains a good place to take a breath. At night they have a big light show on the water witch is breathtaking but be on time because there is allot of people and right before it starts it is pushing to find a good viewing spot.
,,Superb nightshow,4.0,,Marina Bay is one of the nice tourist sport.It is near to Gardens by the bay and very near to Bayfront MRT station.Every day in the evening around 8 pm it has light and fountain show which is must watch.The show lasted for 15-20 minutes and it was just superb.It had created 2D pictures with the help of fountain water and lights.
,,Georgeous,5.0,,It was a Saturday night and very clear skies so the views were beautiful. Lots going on and plenty of people about so I felt safe. See it in the day and night though
,,What a VIEW!!,4.0,,All I can say is HUGE!!! If your a high end shopper then this place is it. All the high end luxurious goods you want. If you're after a bargain then this is not for you. I was here for the view. It did not disappoint. The grand scale and engineering feat was amazing!! Worth a look at when you're in Singapore.
,,Spectacular Views,4.0,,"Knowing that a few years ago, this was all water is fascinating. There are amazing hotels, a world class Cruise terminal now and lots of expansion happening. This will be a place to watch in the future for innovation and elegance rising!"
,,Pleasant area with lots to see,5.0,,"Very nice clean safe area to enjoy. You have the gardens the walking paths amongst the trees and water ways. The Sands Hotel and the giant mall next door. There is a science museum and across the channel the giant sky coaster. Although we did not have time to do a boat tour we could see them streaming through the bay and going in to the waterways of the city . So much to do but be prepared to walk because there is no internal transit system , busses or cabs that run inside."
,,For the rich and affluent only!,1.0,,its amazing to see but its anti poverty because everything that you will see here is materialism and the power of money.
,,Great hangout spot!,5.0,,"Stunning views across the bay. Lots of restaurants and bars. If that's a little expensive for you, it's an equally good place to grab a beer from 7eleven and relax by the bay!"
,,"Nice walk, nice view",5.0,,"The Marina Bay is part of a large walking area in Singapore. From here you can access to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, to the Gardens by the Bay, etc. Good place to walk and observe the public life in Singapore.

,,"Stunning architecture, great to stroll around",5.0,,"I just love this area. It's great to stroll around, eat or drink something and go to the next sight. There's always some kind of an event happening, from the Formula 1 to traditional long tail (rowing) races, gourmet festivals or cirque du soleil. In the weekends it challenges Central Park for most healthy spot in the world with all the joggers, skaters, boot campers etc. It's a favourite spot for models and newly weds to have their pictures taken as well - always something to see or do in this area. Highly recommendable!"

,,Awesome Experience !!,4.0,,"We took the Bum boat ride (A part of our city tour), which are electrically operated boats which are inspired by Retro design. The boats take you around the bay across the financial district and the automated voice over does the duty of a tourist guide. We went during the morning hours. I think in the evening after the sunset the the bay will look prettier."

,,"Great architectures, amazing view and that's about it...",3.0,,"Went to the site after visiting Garden by the bay and the site is noticeable from distance for its unusual architectural building particularly the marina bay sands. The walk was a breeze, the area is almost spotlessly clean, pedestrian areas are great and yet the area felt bland... Artificial (well it is) and lonely. Unless you are with someone, it's a bit strange to wander around here by yourself. It's just too much concrete..."
,,Grab a Duck,5.0,,"Get to the Tourist hub at the Singapore Flyer and arrange a trip on the amphibious duck. You get a 30 minute ride around the sights in the city and then a plunge into the bay for a 45 minute paddle around the bay. Nb if you sit near the starboard bow, that's the front right hand side for you landlubbers, prepare to get wet on the very fast entry into the water. You have been warned Quack Quack!"

,,Eyeconic Singapore,5.0,,"If you are also one of those millions of starry eyed travellers gazing through tons of pictures in search of your next travel destination, the iconic Singapore skyline pictures are the ones you would most likely identify even in a glance. Yes, the picture perfect cityscape, with its skyscrapers looking over the bay, futuristically, and numerous art and science installations dotting the shore drive. It's the Marina Bay, the best place in Singapore, to absorb Singapore, in one sight, well almost!
This is where the iconic Merlion is, the Singapore International Sports venue, Opera House, Science and Technology Museums, open Air arenas, the evening light and sound show, the Marina Bay Sands resort and casino, the Helical bridge, the list is just endless. It's a place for umpteen photo-ops, to while away a great evening, to soak in the unmatched vibe of this global metropolis, a must do for a Singapore visit.

,,Breath taking view,5.0,,Marina bay is the vision of founding father Lee Kuan Yew that took almost 20 years to execute. Functions as a water catchment in order to be self reliant for portable water.

,,fabulous technical effects,4.0,,Film was projected onto a sheet of sprayed water. It was indeed very nice. The laser short was great.
,,A good walk,5.0,,"It is a lovely way to approach the Marina Bay Sands and gardens, rather than arriving on the MRT. You get to see the commercial centre, the Helix Bridge, The Flyer and the Lotus shaped museum. Next to that is a lovely pool full of lotus lilies. And of course the smart shopping malls."
,,Pure class,4.0,,The building in itself is worth the trip as it is floating in the sky. The lookout at the top is great but expensive so if you can go to the resteraunt then at least you get dinner included for not a lot more! The night light show was great for both adults and kids alike!
,,Prepare The Camera,5.0,,"coming from another ASEAN-member country, visiting Singapore is quite amazing to see how the modernization works. Particularly, one of the eye-catching spot in Singapore is the Marina Bay, where you can see the MBS with the ship-alike on the top of it.

,,Amazing sightseeing,5.0,,We saw the bay from the Marina Bay Sands hotel and from a boat and all around the bay. The skyscrapers are breathtaking and at night everything is lit up with two lightshows a night. This is what I imagined Singapore to look like before we came and I wasn't disappointed.

We went down in the evening to watch the light show and the view of the Singapore skyline all lit up from there is breathtaking, the light and laser show itself was very good but I should think it gets very crowded on a weekend. There are many places to eat and it has a bustling vibe. Worth a visit even if you don't like shopping!"
,,New and Eye Opening,5.0,,We walked around Marina Bay for our morning walk several times. Since I was last in Singapore this was all new. Eight years ago i would have been underwater. The walk is about 3Km long and is best in the early morning. Even then the heat is coming and it is best to take water with you. I would start at the Helix Bridge one day and reverse it the next. There is always something new to see and the cafes are open for breakfast around 8AM. This would be a good one to tire the kids out in the evening also.
,,A lovely place to wile away some time & soak in the atmosphere,5.0,,"I loved strolling round the Marina Bay area and soaking up the atmosphere. The views across the bay are wonderful - both at day and then, magically, at night. At the end of the say, before sunset I parked myself on one of the public wooden sun loungers overlooking the Merlion in the distance, plugged in my music and chilled out for half an hour or so.

Refreshed I was ready to hike back to the Gardens by the Bay to watch the evening show at the Supertree Grove."
,,A must during a visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Visiting the bay is a must while visiting singapore. During the day it is ok, but it becomes magical during evening and night time. Do not miss the laser and light show in the late evening."

Very hot so take some water with you.
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,We went here in the day time and at night both visits were good but at night it is more atmospheric. The night we went there was a free light show which was amazing. Also walk over the Helix bridge at night for some great photos

,,Beautiful views,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a lovely area day or night. here you can catch the water taxi and relax, enjoy the view eating or drinking at the many restaurants and bars and watch the nightly water and light shows."
,,Amazing Hotel!,5.0,,"From the moment you walk in you will be wowed! A breathtaking structure. Check in was quick and simple. Initially we were offered a room with a view of the gardens which I wasn't to pleased about but the room was still fantastic! The garden rooms also come with balcony's unlike the city view rooms! The room was spacious with a massive bathroom! Due to a cock up with the money exchange concierge called me to say they were upgrading me for free to a city view suite on the 53rd floor (hotel has 56 floors) - even though I had asked on check in to upgrade and they said they had nothing available.

The suite was 3x bigger our initial room and the city view is just WOW!

The views from the infinity pool which is only exclusive to customers of the hotel is worth every penny! The views are breath taking although you will have to wait a while to take the perfect picture with all the chinese posing for hours on end with their selfie sticks. Watching the sun go down with a beer whilst chilling in the pool is some experience!

Be sure to watch the water show that happens around 8/9pm from the actual deck rather than the hotel for the best experience. The mall is great although a lot of shops are top end luxury and were out of our price budget it was nice to window shop, the majority of hotel restaurants are all situated in the mall, the Gordan Ramsey Breadstreet kitchen is a thumbs up!

There are a few choices for breakfast and the buffet can get busy so be prepared to queue but once seated it is pretty much straight forward with a great choice of foods on offer!"
,,just buildings,3.0,,this is the financial district of Singapore. lots of bank offices are located here. some parts are still under construction . if you are interested in building architecture then you can have a visit.

,,Beautiful at night,4.0,,I went to watch the night light show there. It was really relaxing but it was crowded with people when I went.
,,A Must Do!,5.0,,"My husband and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands and decided to make the walk around the bay. Although it was incredibly hot, it was a lot of fun and simple touristy thing to do."
,,Lights galore at night!,4.0,,"I love hanging out at any of the areas fronting the Bay. The energy that the lights and the city itself brings just bustles out of the air. View from a nearby hotel, the Helix Bridge, the LV store, at the MBS, the Singapore Flyer, or even at a nearby makhan area. Daytime and even night brings in both joggers, photographers, tourists, professionals who want to just chill or who just wants a walk along a peaceful yet vibrant area."
,,Ideal for solitude,3.0,,Ideal place to sip in an early morning coffee and enjoy the view as usually there is a cool breeze blowing.

,,Marina Bay,5.0,,Great place to spend an evening.. fire works and laser display. Great shopping centre and plenty of restaurants.
,,Arty and fun,4.0,,We spent the day walking around the bay and could easily return 3 more times for something new to do. I recommend visiting the mall behind the ArtScience Museum and trying a Nasi Lemak at the food court by the skating rink. It was great value for money. There are boat rides for exploring a great deal of the bay from a different perspective. The Esplanade is worth a visit during the day and see if there is an outdoor performance in the evening (normally free)
,,Beautiful Tourist spot,5.0,,I love the beauty of the place. It makes me feel that life is wonderful and colorful. Thanks for this spectacular scenery.
,,I would say Good!,3.0,,"This place is famous for Merlion for which you have to walk a bit. They have kept some interesting things along the way to play with to keep the crowd active, like 4D lights, kids fare etc. This place is also known for it's fountain show. Make sure you reach well enough if you want to grad a place to sit, otherwise people dont mind sitting down on the deck as well. Also in my opinion watching the show from the upper section gives you better view, although crowd will run to grab a place downwards. The show is about history and culture of Singapore and someone like me wouldnt be able to connect more other than for it's graphics and little water drops that fall on you. Akshardham's fountain show is much better. :P

You can see all the commercial banks from here. The auditorim which looks like their national fruit Durian, some high budget showrooms like 'louis vuitton' and it also has a mall connected to it. The Singapore museum is there too, but the entry closes at 6:00PM. It was a check place for us so we spent a good evening with whatever vegetarian food we could manage to get!! :D :D"

You get to see Singapore's skyline. Merlion and MBS is popular with visitors. During National events, you get to catch fireworks from the Bay.

Pavement is friendly for wheelchairs and strollers."
,,Singapore skyline's greatest vantage point,4.0,,"A must see when in Singapore, but probably better appreciated at night - the crowds only add to the anticipation and atmosphere.

The bay's always busy, but it's the best place to see the city's skyline light up with The Bay Sands hotel and pretty lights of downtown. Easily accessible (although the HRT stations leave a little walk) and plenty to see during a romantic stroll."
,,Could spend a day here.,5.0,,We visited this place on all three days of our stay in Singapore. At 7.30 in the evening the have a laser light and water show which should not be missed. A great experience.
,,Tranquility,5.0,,Visit the Marina and just enjoy the peace and quiet in the heart of Singapore. There are also a number of opportunities to sail round it and view the major hotels and the waterside restaurants
,,Awesome architecture - you don't need to shop,5.0,,A must see location even if you don't shop or buy a thing . Marina bay is stunning just to walk around especially at night with a light and sound show.
,,Long walk,4.0,,"Quite a walk from the hotel, full of restaurants. Can be very hot with little shade except for the restaurants. Stunning when lit up at night."
,,Just walk around if you're on budget.,3.0,,The 7.45pm lights show is lovely to watch but there's isn't a storyline to it. Gotta be there early and book a good place to watch the show. Good place to walk around. Food is defs overpriced.
,,Surreal Buildings.,5.0,,Wonderful architecture surrounds you on all sides. Well worth a sightseeing trip. Visit the Formula 1 track while you are in this area.
,,Must check out view from Observatory deck !,4.0,,"the view from the top is fabulous and a must see, definitely worth the amount they charge ! would suggest visiting after sunset .."
,,Nice Tourist Place,5.0,,I have visited on last year for vacation and business trip. Its a hot day but I liked to walking around. Thanks.
,,must visit,5.0,,a must visit place in singapore. it has a very good walk way around the river. at night it just glitters. u can see a lot of attraction from outside just walkign along the way.
,,"beautiful, full of fun",5.0,,"Lovely marina surrounded by attractions including fountain and light shows, light and sound sculptures (interactive), seating facilities with giant fans to cool you down, river cruises day and night, restaurants galore. Once again, very clean"
,,Must see,5.0,,"a patch of reclaimed land years ago, Marina Bay has grown into an indelible part of singapore's iconic skyline. Many major tourist attractions and hotels dot the Bay including Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. It's pleasant to jog or walk around the Bay but not during the afternoons as it can get very warm!"
,,Happening Place in Singapore,4.0,,"The Marina Bay area is an entertainment hub, running around the water front. On it's rim you have the Iconic ""Merlion"" , The Fullerton hotel, Asian Civilisation museum, downtown skyscrapers, Arts & Science Centre, with Marina Bay Sands hotel and Singapore Flyer standing tall in the background.
If you are walking from flyer to Marina Bay you pass the Helix bridge. After crossing Helix Bridge you will land in front of Bay Sands Shopping mall. If you are tired just sit near the lotus pond or admire yourself in the spherical Mirrors(see my pics) provided near the Arts & science centre .
Added attraction in evenings is the laser show.( warning- on the evening I was there, 10th March 2016, the laser show began half hour late and ended 5 minutes later and no regrets expressed by any one). What little of the show we got to see was nothing to write home about."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"The view is so nice. Although we were too tired of strolling and walking around before to drop by this place, it was worth the effort because the view is so amazing!"
,,GREAT VIEW,5.0,,Great view of the skyline and easy walking.Many photo ops wear comfortable shoes it makes life a lot less painful.
,,Splendid Place to Take Lots of Pictures,5.0,,"This can be quite a Tourist Trap. Beware the Heat as Singapore can get quite hot as it is a Tropical Country. Even when the weather is cloudy, I was sweating profusely. It doesn't matter though, as the pictures from this place are some of the best I had taken when I visited Singapore.

Also, I would recommend bringing your own water. Buying water from any of the kiosks here are a tad expensive."
,,What a view!,4.0,,The buildings here are just amazing! We walked round the Marina Bay and where stunned at the different architecture!

The view is absolutely great, Merlion, Marina Bay Sands hotel and Singapore flyer etc. It's quite busy around there but you still can find many great spots for photos, you need good shoes because you will have a long walk. It's one of my top 2 impressive places to see including Song of the sea show."
,,Like from the postcard,5.0,,"Everything is here, the water and the concrete...so Singapore. I like to stroll there because it's quiet especially closer to the Sand Bay Hotel from where the view is the best while sitting on boardwalk. On the opposite side of the bay is more noisy and crowdy. Merlion is not that impressive and little bit kitsch. It also atracts thousand of tourists. Night show at the Bay is also spectacular, if you have time"
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"Marina Bay area is so big, we didn't get to see all of it, which is a shame because it means we need to go back for another holiday. The scenery is beautiful from whichever side of the Bay your on, there's so much to see and do you need a few days just for some of the activities. We went to the shopping precinct at Marina Bay Hotel, shoppers dream, but expensive, how the other half live. we also saw the 2 Domes and Supertree Grove, magnificent to say the least, I would go back again over and over, day and night."
,,Great place to chill,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a great place to chill with a drink or have a meal in one of the restaurants, or from one of the take away food vendors. You can get virtually any kind of food you fancy there."

,,A vibrant cosmopolitan area,4.0,,This area appears to be relatively new and is set against the backdrop of the stunning Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It is right on the waterfront with great views of the city. There is a high end shopping mall with lots of places to eat. Gardens by the Bay is just across the road...
,,Nice to be at during the evenings,5.0,,"After a day of shopping at MBS, wait for the light and water show. The show (featuring Louie Armstrong's What a Wonderful World) hasn't changed the past several years, but it's nice to see it over and over again. Better to position yourself near the bay to feel the fire or at the upper most step to enjoy a full view of the three mists that are lit."
,,Beautiful and peaceful,4.0,,Amazing place with such a beautiful layout and great tourist spots where you can snap photos. Also lots of restaurant options as well.
,,Think they missed an opportunity,3.0,,Lovely to see lit up at night but it is really just another huge shopping centre. Clarke Quay is still better in my opinion. It would have been nice to see more of an outdoor warwefront development
,,Great vistas!,5.0,,"This is s must in Singapore! Go for a pleasant stroll, enjoy beautiful views, stop for a smoothy or a small bite and be relaxed."
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,"Whilst on our honey moon we spent the day at Marina Bay, amazing.
So well laid out.. Unfortunately due to a massive fear of heights we didn't experience the roof bar.. I'm sure it would have been as good as the rest of the venue.

Meals and food and pastries were world class..

Expect a light wallet after a visit though.. Very expensive."
,,Beautyful View day and night,4.0,,you will be able to see lot of buildings which are done very nicely. lot of international companies are there so you can see lot of exprats as well. very nice and expensive restaurants are also in the area.

,,MARINA BAY,5.0,,"great, clean, so much architecture all around from the old to the new, loved it, this i would revisit"
,,Marina Bay Sand Mall,5.0,,"One of Singapore iconic landmark comprising 3 towers with an iconic Surf Board like structure that connects the top of the 3 hotel towers. Just so impressive.
On the ground level are the shopping mall, Museum, convention & exhibition centres and of course the Casino.
I rate this area as an up market district catering to the rich.
Even the foodcourt are charging premium prices but the quality n portions are quite generous. I think it is about 20% or more than Changi Airport T3 basement foodcourt.
The waterfront beside the hotel is very scenic with the Raffles Place skyline. Just beautiful. It's more stunning in the night with all the lightings. The art Museum, the shape of an open palm is located there with guided tour for some of it's programs.
The Helix bridge is equally captivating. Take a stroll, so breezy.
The best time is after 6 pm in the evening. :)"

,,"Excellent view, especially on sunset",4.0,,"If your not a guest and only visiting the observation deck, it is only the very front tip of the boat, the rest of the boat / building is off limits and for guests only.

Light and laser show is must watch and should not be given a miss.
Gardens by the bay is also nearby.

,,Not sleeping there,3.0,,"we were not sleeping in the hotel and we didn't buy anything in the mall, but the place is really huge and fancy.

If you wanna see the amazing pool you have to pay for going up to the hotel, but you cannot use it unless you're checked in a room."

You will have seen the hotel already, large casino, bring passport, expensive shops, and offcourse the skywalk. S$ 20 gets you up there, but it is free when you take elevator to the restaurant.

,,Overrated.,3.0,,"Went to Marina Bay over the CNY weekend. Don't know if I went at a wrong time but the weather was horrible (gloomy and windy) and it really wasn't all that it's made up to be.

,,Outstanding architecture,4.0,,"Walking around Marina Bay is a real treat for lovers of modern architecture. Marina Bay Sands shopping center and hotel stand out with exquisite design, it is like Noah' s Arc had landed on skyscrapers. It gets even more interesting when you enter the vast open space with restaurants down below and the hotels corridors as narrow ledges from where you reach the rooms. On the other side of the building facing Gardens by the Bay the whole wall slopes gently offering every room a terrace with a view. There are two unique buildings on the waterfront side, the Crystal Pavilion with Vuitton store and a nightclub and the Artscience Museum. It resembles a big flower with opening pedals and stands in a pool of aquatic garden. The only eyesore in the Bay is the Float, which was arranged for Chinese New Year, but looked vulgar in contrast to the superb architecture."
,,Lovely walking area,5.0,,Lots to do and see in the area. A lot going on when we visited in the run up to Chinese new year. Especially nice at night when lit up. Felt very safe while walking around too.

,,Iconic Cityscape,4.0,,"Increasingly popular since the first Formula 1 Grand Prix of the modern era, back in 2008, the landscape was already under significant transformation, and the area continues to grow as much as a business hub, as it does as a tourist attraction.

The walk around the bay, at around 5km, is frequently manged by the local community most nights, in trainers, but as a walk offers some impressive views from each side of what is fast becoming one of the worlds most iconic city-scapes, with the historic Fullerton Bay hotel on one side, the Theatres By The Bay on another, the Marina Bay Financial District on the third, with the impressive Marina Bay Sands hotel, shopping and casino complex to complete the square.

Each of these locations has a variety of bars and diners to keep you entertained before you move on to the next, but if you include some shopping at MBS, you can easily spend a day here.

Also worth checking for one of the many events held in the Bay area throughout the year, including yacht racing, dragon boat festival, and many others, in addition to the Formula 1."

A nice way to spend the day trying the wonderful diversity of food that is offered in the restaurants. Plenty of bars to sample as well. This area also has numerous light shows in the night.
,,Go up to the bar!,5.0,,Go before 5PM and go up to the bar. That way you don't have to pay to go and look out. You're not required to buy a drink. Look at the view and remember to go to the back side of the pool and take a look out that way too. Leave before dark and watch the light show from ground level. Amazing experience!

,,One of the best parts of Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay is the most popular (among tourists) area of Singapore. Whether you visit it at day or at night, it will definitely leave a strong impression. I recommend you to stay at one of the hotels surrounding this bay: Ritz Carlton, Mandarin, Marina Bay Sands (from which you can take also spectacular photos, especially at sunset - and you can have a beautiful walk at night in the ""Avatar""-style park behind it)."

,,Great shopping,5.0,,This building stands as a feature on the Singapore skyline. It looks amazing and the light show of a night was good to see. I loved the selection of shops and the easy layout compared to Orchard Road.
,,MARINA BAY,5.0,,This is the best place to see singapore's high rise building along the river. The view is much better in the night as Marina bay is all lighted up.
,,Overrated (maybe I am missing something),3.0,,"It is an impressive enough building, and the waterfront is nice to walk around, but compared to the other offerings of Singapore it is really not that spectacular. The light show with the lasers is really not great. For me this and the Merlion are just parts of Singapore I don't get the hype about. The gardens by the bay, botanic gardens, zoos and other attractions are much better.

Also worth noting we did not stay at the hotel - I am sure the roof top infinity pool would be rediculous.

For a light show infinitiely better take a short walk across the bridge to the gardens by the bay and watch the Garden Rhapsody show where they light up the supertrees (free 7:45 and 8:45 daily)."
,,Artificial Singapore has create a marvel! A man made success,5.0,,"Everything in Singapore is over prized, artificial and boring. Too perfect and no harmony but only technically perfect
BUT
Marina Bay is the great exception. I was totally floored! What a magic place. What an absolutely crazy idea masterminded and completed. Singapore you won me over here. It is one of the coolest attraction in the world. I have obviously not seen it all but a lot. This is on my top three man made places in the world! Skip Sentosa and all the artificial crap, if you only got one day in Singapore, this is were you go!"

,,Amazing structure,4.0,,"When you first see this structure it's striking and hard to believe, whilst not the prettiest building its still quite amazing and you can appreciate the skill and vision to create this.
There is a bar on top where you can enjoy drinks and dance and view the Marina from above - recommend you try if you have time. Be prepared for Long queues unless you are early or have VIP access."
,,Typically high feel,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands represents modernity of Singapore. On one side, you can see glittering three building with a shop on top. On other hand, there is merlion and glittering LV showroom in a midst of sea. Good place to get a feel of Singapore,"

People are extremely police and nice - both local and tourists !
,,Big but ordinary.,3.0,,Nice how the plants are layered and really green on the inside. Plus it has a feature waterfall. But that's about it. Spent about an hour here with my folks. Gardens by the bay is much better place to go.
,,A plethora of sights and sounds,5.0,,"Thus is a huge place, like a little city which inundates your senses. So come prepared. Endless row of restaurants, cafes, branded shops, huge hotel marina bay sands, lovely stand alone TWG tea cafes in the center of the mall, lots of families sitting by the bay, tons of people going to the skywalk, or bar on the top level, and your ears do pop when you go up that elevator.

More window shopping than anything, see tiffanys Cartier etc. Many nice artists creations in other shops, easy access to subways, casino is always full. Amazing pastry shop on sin floor.
Lots to do shop or calm yourself dos and take a walk to the gardens by the bay"
,,A truly iconic amazing hotel,5.0,,"Amazing place everything good said about this place is true which includes the Food, the rooms, the shopping and n architecture.

You can walk around the Bay all around the high rises then through Gardens by the Bay.

Gardens by the Bay is awesome and not to be missed when you are here, walking through it or cycling along."
,,A must-do tourist spot,4.0,,"Maybe not that great for shoppers on a budget and those who don't gamble but a must-do tourist location. It's where you can go up to the infamous Marina Bay Sands hotel to view Singapore skyline, where you can view the Merlion and Helix bridge."
,,Excercise and beauty,4.0,,"It was nice to walk around the Marina Bay, you have your excercise and still see the beauty around it, the only downside is, its hot."
,,The Best View,5.0,,"Modern meets traditional, a place that you must visit while in singapore, great view but unfortunately we miss the light shows"
,,Marina Bay Area Visit,5.0,,We enjoyed everything in the surrounding of this spectacular wonder of architecture. It is surrounded by very beautiful Gardens by the Bay & Cloud Forest on one side . Next to it is lovely Golf Course and Singapore Flyer. Facing front of it is lovely Marina Bay with its awesome Merlin Icon of Singapore. There are some great shopping centres located adjacent to Marina Bay. One can take a boat ride also from Clarke Quay to see the Awesome Architecture of Singapore.
,,Interesting area,4.0,,"This is hearth of city and basically most populated area of Singapore in day time and also great place to visit in night. But not expect to much, if you are there, there are quite good number of fantastic places around."
,,Must do,5.0,,I did a walk around the bay in around 3 hours. Was very hot day but perfect for taking pictures. Strongly recommended

,,Downtown.,5.0,,"It is Singapore's premier commercial, residential, and lifestyle area. So many possibilities for everyone, even if you are not a tourist, for example:

- shop and dine at the Sands,
- visit the Merlion Park and Gardens by the Bay nearby
- view exhibitions at the ArtScience Museum, or
- take in the amazing skyline at dusk.

Marina Bay is only twenty minutes from the airport."
,,A 'must do' in Singapore,4.0,,"A 'must do' place to visit in Singapore, incorporating the famous Marina Bay Sands hotel, the helix bridge, the Merlion fountain, a huge shopping mall and food court, and plenty of bars and restaurants. The nightly sound and light show is spectacular too."
,,Beautiful city,4.0,,"We toured much of the central area.. Marina Bay was very impressive. Although away outside our budget it is a definite ""go see"" spot."
,,Still the same,4.0,,Casino is still the same as we visited previously. They hold light and laser show at night frequently now which is on the pier and it was free. The shops are still mostly expensive brands. The food court is generous with their servings but a bit expensive.
,,Take a walking tour,5.0,,Beautiful views. Be sure to see the Merlion and the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Having a beer at the top of Marina Bay sands hotel while overlooking the bay and the 58 story high infinity pool is fantastic. Go at dusk and watch the city light up and reflect into the bay!
,,the hub of activity,5.0,,"This area seems to be the hub of activity in Singapore. There are water, laser shows here every night and so many events take place on weekends"
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,Did a duck tour of the bay which was interesting and enjoyable. The guide spoke good English and very knowledgeable. Worth doing
,,Grand Outing,5.0,,Spectacular outing choice while at Singapore. Grand buildings and bay front with a top of the club mall .
,,Stunning area,5.0,,"Every time I go back it changes a bit, with a new building or attraction. Always retains it's magic though. Views of the Skyscraper CBD, the Merlion, Esplanade (Durians), Floating Platform, F1 Track, Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands. Sit down at the platform outside the Sands for an 8pm light show each evening"
,,"Traditional meets modern in every aspect, buildings, commerce, restaurants, walkways, bridges - fascinating to see the j",4.0,,"From the Fullerton Hotel, originally the main post office, around the bay past the symbol of Singapore, the Merlion, and the Customs House, you then meet the central business district where you only have to look at the original Bank of China building which originally must have looked incredibly impressive, overshadowed by the towering megaliths which have been constructed around it in the last decade.
Carry on walking Round the bay, across the helix bridge which offers a couple of great vantage points for photos with Marina Bay beyond. Stop and look back at one of the most iconic buildings in the world, the Marina Bay Sands hotel, resembling a cross between Noah's Arc and the Pi sign, and you will have been introduced to a view you will never forget. Awesome!
Continue on past the Youth Olympics Stadium and along to the Singapore Art and History Museum. A lovely morning's, afternoon's or evening's two to three hour's promenade, or longer if you take advantage of the myriad bars and restaurants or even shopping (the Shoppes at Marina Bay) to distract you along the way"
,,Free daily light show,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands performs free daily light shows at 8PM and 9:30PM. It is best to view it twice, one time from across the bay near the Merlion location and a second time from the shopping mall across the hotel with the ship on top. Also try out the food court in the mall. It is a cheap and clean place to enjoy a family meal."
,,Stunning New Year venue!,5.0,,Our Singaporean relatives certainly knew the best place to go for the New Year celebrations. We bought places in one of the many boats on the bay. They take you out to the best firework viewing spot on the water. It seemed like there were hundreds of boats all jostling for position. An amazing experience one we highly recommend.
,,Lovely,4.0,,"This is an experience a person should definitely do when he visits Singapore. Please make sure to carry your cameras to capture the amazing view it gives you. One round takes around half an hour, which is sufficient time to take all the photos"
,,Amazing night view,5.0,,Must go place for everyone! Alot of jogger At evening and night spectacular view. Water and laser show at 8pm in front mbs or can watcb from far opposite which infront of esplanade also can. Great place to spam photo taking and chill with anyone or even alone!
,,One of the most stunning places in the world,5.0,,It certainly is one of the must visits in the world. Singapore is a small country but rich in culture. Marina Bay is the point where East meets the West and the outcome should be named one of the wonders of the world. You have not visited Singapore if you don't visit Marina Bay. Don't forget to check out Gordon Ramsey's restaurant there! Perfect!
,,Walk around at night!,4.0,,"This is definitely a spot to wander around in the evening. I got here at dusk and didn't think it was so interesting, but once the sun set and the lights came on, I could see why people were recommending that I walk around in this area. Make sure you know where you're headed towards, it's not exactly friendly to wander around aimlessly since there are many buildings in the way. If you're headed to Marina Bay Sands to look at the hotel and the views around there, make sure you get off at the right train station, unlike me :)"
,,Marina Bay a Singapore must!,5.0,,We stayed at Marina Bay Sands so of course exploring the bay was a must. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Singapore.
,,A nice walk around outer Marina Bay/Marina Barrage,3.0,,"While the inner Marina Bay is a rather crowded and touristic place, the outer Marina Bay/Marina Barrage is not crowded at all.

It will take you several hours to walk all the way around the outer Marina Bay but it is worth it, because of the unique view of the Singapore skyline.

You can shorten the distance by taking the bus or the river cruise ferry to the Marina Barrage building, and then walki over to the visitor center of the Bay East Gardens, and taking a cab from there back into town."
,,An ever changing view.,5.0,,"8 years ago, this bay is best to enjoy where the Lion Statue of Singapore is. Nowadays, you can see it from both sides and the bay itself is a kilometer or 2 further away, behind the MBS hotel and the Garden at the Bay. Still a nice walk or recommended for an afternoon jog."
,,Very Quiet,5.0,,"Lots of great photo opportunities, anywhere is good.Is Actually very quite as there are not a lot of boats in Marina Bay at any time. Great place to come day or night. Don't forget the light show at 9:45pm!"

Breath-taking city, especially the Lotus building."
,,Fabulous view,5.0,,"We went to the bar which is open to the public 1 level above the skypark, and had a cocktail. The view is amazing , the lights of the city are spectacular ."

,,EXCELLENT PLACE TO STAY,5.0,,We stayed in the Conrad Centennial Hilton Hotel which is in this area by Suntec City and is a great choice for everything. Shopping over 400 outlets and 100 restaurants plus close to most attractions and Raffles hotel walking distance.
,,Quintessentially Singapore,5.0,,"Well, where does one start? Marina Bay is as integral to Singapore as a financial hub, as it is a touristy area chock full of attractions, hotels and F&B establishments of intenational repute.

Top attractions include Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, ArtScience Museum, the Singapore Flyer, the Esplanade and Merlion Park.

Take a river cruise, admire the impressive skyline from the promontory, or simply enjoy a lovely evening at the MBS SkyPark."

,,Amazing,4.0,,Great area to walk around though hot g early or late.we saw what looked like otters in the water.the hop on hop of bus stops here and easy to get he train.
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Clearly there is a daytime and a night time programme here.
The daytime is hot humid and quieter , unfortunately there are lest snack bars/ drink stands open. This means you have to buy tickets up to the super tree and drink there MR18 if you want a alcoholic drink MR 13 if non alcoholic drink.
The view is amazing!!
We stopped for one cold drink mid afternoon but clearly it is catered for after sunset drinking and eating although after dark the view will be limited but pre dust the lights and lazers are amazing."
,,Great walking / jogging with amazing views,5.0,,"This man made bay is located near the ocean and close to downtown and Gardens by the Bay. Singapore is safe at any hour of the day, and I was out during the day and late at night to experience the people and activities. Great sightseeing, restaurants abound. Close to so many activities. Fireworks at New Year's are crazy good!"
,,So much to see!!,5.0,,Gorgeous during the day and stunning at night. So much to see as well with free light show at 8pm by the shoppong centre. Be sure to check out the whirlpool too and of course the singapore lion. Free live music on a Saturday
,,"Marina Bay....be mesmerized, be totally mesmerized!",5.0,,"A must visit when in Singapore.....for day & night scenes. The night scenes will transport your mind, body & soul to another level of tourism. The Bay is bathed by a choreographed series of laser light show with piped in ambience music. The lighting of the buildings around the bay range from antiquity to post modernism & to futuristic themes. Also worth visiting is the Gardens by the Bay, adjacent to the Marina, where it houses plants from all over the world in giant geodesic green houses & super trees collecting rainwater & solar power to give the site a kind of ""Pandora"" setting as portrayed in the movie Avatar. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED especially the night scene!"
,,Nice view,3.0,,nice view of Singapore. usually get too crowded during peak hours. a nice place to take the shot of sunset.
,,Be...,5.0,,Prepared for a wonderful sight that has bright contemporary architecture blended with nine teeth century architecture. Walk around the whole marina...the boat ride gives nothing in addition.
,,A great place to run and walk and absorb,5.0,,"A ""MUST'' to see !!! Endless scenery and wall to wall awesome views of structures ,buildings and simply put Breath taking Give yourself 2 to 3 hours to walk all around the bay You won't be disappointed 😂"
,,See my comments on the Gardens,4.0,,We travelled to this attraction by the subway and had to walk a fair bit afterwards. Flat comfortable shoes for this. Also dollars required from memory.
,,"A great engineering feat, it's a precinct that's more than shopping",5.0,,"Not often is area that's sproutted as having something for everyone really got something for everyone, BUT this precinct really does deliver. A range of shopping and only in Singapore will you find a Harley Davidson store next to Dolce and Gabbana. Upmarket to middle brands. Designer chef restaurants to food halls. Marvels of engineering to spectacual gardens. A free light show at nights that adults love as much as kids (2 different shows o in the marina that you watch from out front of the shopps, the other in the gardens both are great) or stroll along the waterfront to the eatery satay by the bay which is great.A trip to the top of the marina bay sands building is great but if your not good with heights, I would just go to the flower dome.
You can spend an hour, a day or a weekend and still have plenty of things you missed. Such as the art science museum which is always worth a look. Also check out the loyalty club as there is good benefits such as reduced entry to shows or exhibition."
,,Luxurious look and feel surrounding entire location,5.0,,"This one is perhaps the most visited place in Singapore by foreigners. The hotel, the shopping mall, the garden, the bridge, the river and so much more within a single attraction. The color of Marina Bay changes with each passing minute and as day approaches evening and night, the Marina Bay comes in its full glory with vivid and vibrant colors, shows, and mesmerizing activities..."
,,Perfect for that early morning walk,5.0,,"We stayed in a hotel overlooking the bay and each morning we would get out before the heat set in and walk a lap of the bay. Plenty to see with easy side trips to the Gardens by the Bay, coffee shops and of course the Merlion. Always easy to escape to the cool or shelter of the shops at Marina Bay Sands as well."
,,Beautiful part of Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a beautiful part of Singapore. You can visit the Merlion, marina bay sands shopping centre, esplanade theathers etc. During night time you see the city lighting up and there are a lot of places where you can just hang out or have a drink"
,,"beautiful view, place to run, and also business district",5.0,,"This area is a big area composed of High rise buildings and offices; touristic attractions/hotels (Fullerton, MBS, etc.). I would say the nice part in this area would be that there are a lot of people who does runs in the area just to exercise."
,,Stunning City,5.0,,Take the time to stroll the area as it gives you the flavor of Singapore! Great views with restaurants along the way.
,,Unbelievable!,4.0,,"We walked around the whole bay. The view was beautiful and breathtaking.
The beautiful buildings and the whole area is just wonderful to see.
There's plenty of places to eat and drink.
We stopped over and had a drink by the bay.
It's a little hard to find a quiet spot to take pictures without the crowd around Christmas time. But we managed to find a quiet area on the way to Marina Bay Sands Skypark."
,,Nice cruise around the Bay !,5.0,,The best way to see the Marina Bay is to go on an evening cruise in order to see the laser show that comes on at dusk.
,,Absolutely Amazing!!!!,5.0,,"Marina Bay is absolutely amazing, and your better off seeing it at night, its absolutely breathtaking. Everything is all lit up!!

You have an amazing shopping centre, where you can shop until you drop, or you can pop into a little coffee shop or wine bar and enjoy the splendours they have to offer.

You can see the Singapore Flyer which looks so pretty. They do a lazer show which is amazing, so make sure you take your camera. Along the broadwalk you can find many places to eat and drink until early hours of the morning if you want.

One more thing which is amazing is the Sky Park which is a boat on the top of three towers, and its actually a hotel. You can actually go to the top, and see some spectactular views over singapore.

Anybody going to Singapore this is one place you must visit!!!

Happy Holidays!!!

Best wishes

Sharon & Jason"

Having gone to Dubai before Singapore.... This Marina reminded me a lot of Dubai's (vice versa! And I have side by side photos taken during my trips to prove it, hah!). Maybe that's why people used to tell me Dubai is the Singapore of the Middle East and Singapore is the Dubai of Asia, lol!

,,If there is one place you visit in Singapore - it should be this!,5.0,,"If I was asked the one place in Singapore that should not be missed, it is undoubtedly the Marina Bay/Marina Boulevard area. It is undoubtedly one of the most spectacular downtown views you can catch anywhere in the world, especially if you time your visit well to catch the laser show from MBS. I strongly recommend taking a boat ride (check out river taxis instead of the normal tourist boats, they will work out way cheaper for you) from Boat Quay all the way to Marina Bay which gives you a quick glimpse of the spectacular setting.
I love exploring the varied views you can get of the boulevard from the spectacular attractions surrounding it, like:
1. Try some of the rooftop restaurants in the area like Lantern or even 1 Altitude to have a spectacular view of the boulevard from a height
2. Hop over to the Esplanade area and catch a free gig while watching the laser show from MBS
3. Walk over from Gardens by the Bay/Marina Bay Sands
4. Photo ops near Merlion
And the list goes on....But, do not miss this place if you are visiting Singapore. Just remember to time it well, so that you catch the laser show in all its glory"

As seems to be the case in most of Singapore there are a large number of gardens scattered throughout the area"

,,Engineering Marvel of current times,5.0,,"To build a sky scraper is tough. To build 3 skyscrapers is 3 times tougher. To connect the 3 skyscrapers on the top with an over sized boat shaped structure is un-imaginable. Have to see it in person to believe the beauty of it.

Take the 16:00 tour to the top of the tower which includes a tour of the infinity swimming pool as well.
The view from top the of the tower is breathtaking."
,,A MUST if you afford it,5.0,,A MUST if you afford it .. expect everything to be expensive but worth it .. give it a try and enjoy the luxurious taste of singapore best spot .. If you made it to the hotel .. the infinity pool is a state of the ART

,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"Nice area, lots to do. Lots of shops and restaurants. Marina bay sands hotel is worth seeing. Gardens by the bay at dusk is beautiful to see."
,,Simply a 'must do' when in Singapore,5.0,,"There's so much to see at Marina Bay; however, it would be impossible for me to explain every different aspect that is worth seeing (because there's so many).
The best way to experience Marina Bay initially is via one of the water taxi's or river boats (which are inexpensive). From the water you can see the magnificent buildings that pop up all around - then you can the decide which ones' you want to see more of on foot, after your river or water taxi ride. The highlight for me was the Marina Bay Hotel (a very large hotel with a ship on top). The description sounds a bit weird, but if you don't do anything else you must go up the elevator in the hotel and stand on the observation floor at the top and admire the view - jaw dropping! Don't worry it's free to go up to the observation deck - only costs money if you decide to swim in the infinity pool or have a drink in the bar (I was giddy enough with the height - no need for alcohol or a swim to get giddy)."
,,Beautiful Area,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a beautiful area next to the water, with the imposing triple towers of the Marina Bay Sands Complex on one side the CDB skyscrapers on the other and the Singapore flyer in the distance it is really an area worth visiting."

,,Beautiful Marina Bay by day and night,5.0,,"This is the best place to go both at night for the light show and during the day to see Singapore's wonderful attractions such as the Cloud Forest, Flower Dome and the Supertree Grove.

We walked all the way from the Grand Mercure Roxy Singapore in Katong along the beach, over the Marina Barrage and around Marina Bay. It was a lovely walk to do as all these sights came into view as well as the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Singapore Flyer, all of the skyscrapers and the beautiful gardens by the bay came into view. Highly recommended."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Clean, nicely maintained and worth the visit. Suggested time to visit this place is evening.. As the lights come up and the whole area looks gorgeous!"
,,"Beautiful by day, amazing by night",5.0,,The marina bay is a beautiful place to see by day time but is realy amazing by night. Lights and laser shows make a big difference making the place unique. Get there around 16.00 and by the time you make a tour is already dark so you will enjoy the place at full.
,,Pleasant and very clean harbour precinct,3.0,,While it is very clean and very safe it has lost much of its original edge - even the river boat commentary is overly reassuring about the safety of the precinct. Having said that it is a pleasant place to stroll stop for a drink watch the light show and take it in in an informal and relaxed manner.
,,Striking no matter the weather,4.0,,"Even when it's stormy, the marina is really gorgeous. You get a different view and feel from each side. Sometimes it's a bit too crowded near the lion, but usually there's a spot to sit and reflect."

This is such a beautiful experience to spend a few hours around the financial district where one can eat at several local cheap and fast terraced places or go onto the Marina Bay Sand's shopping centre. It is a good 15 minutes walk along the river than bridge. Or take a river boat cruise..
The best view of Singapore is at the top, on the 57th floor of the Marina Sands and it's free!
You can have a Cocktail at the Ce la Vi terrace on the top floor... It's an amazing view from there of the city of Singapore. Especially at night"

,,Nice to go and see,3.0,,Be prepare to do a lot of walking to see everything. There is a carriage that goes around but you won't see everything so you have to walk it. Be prepared to pay for each section as well. Nice to see it once to say you've been there

Most workers are underground/on the MRT trains on way to work and most tourists are still waking up or at breakfast so its s quiet time (relatively) in Singapore to see another view of the city.
Weather conditions blew some smoke in from firs (planned burning) in Indonesia - was a bit hazy and smoky a few days before the rain cleared it up."

Certainly not pocket friendly for shopping for the average tourist, but worth the visit just to marvel at how beautiful hotels and shopping malls can be.

,,Expensive,3.0,,"Nice area, but be prepared to pay through the nose for drinks, they have a strange system in Singapore called plus plus, which means the price you see in bars around the Marine area are not the final price, they add on two different taxes, I bought two drinks one for me and one for my wife, the bar price showed $18 sgd the final bill was $27 sgd. most places have a sign telling you if ++ is included, so you need to look for it."

I think to really soak in the essence of this place, its good to visit around 5pm where the sun is not so hard but enough light for the best views all around! Sunset is around 7pm!

Things to experience at the bay and nearby:
River cruise
Esplanade - Theatres by the bay
Merlion - The symbol of SG
Waterfront - Just behind esplanade (free live music on weeknds eve)
Marina bay sands (integrated resorts) - The huge casino, mall, hotel everything!
Gardens by the bay
Marina Barrage (Bus 400 from Marina Bay station)

Best Train station - City Hall
Although depending on the place you wana visit, one can get our at Esplanade, Promenade also.

Have fun! :)"

The Marina Bay area is where you can find some of the best sights and landmarks in the city - the Merlion, Marina Bay Sands, and many more! There's a lot to see here so you must never miss the opportunity to visit this place. I suggest you start your own walking tour from the Merlion Park all the way to the Bayfront area and do it in the late afternoon where temperature is cooler. Then you can enjoy the nightly fireworks at the Marina Bay shopping mall to cap your day."
,,A must visit when going to Gardens by the Bay and Marina Sands (shopping Mall).,5.0,,"When visiting Gardens by the Bay you get off at the Marina Bay MRT stop. So its a must to plan in exploring the surrounding local areas/things to do. As you walk to gardens by the bay you get to see and take pictures of the famous Marina Sands Hotel, as you can't miss the boat shape on top of the building! After we had finished visiting the gardens and watched the tree light show there, we then strolled to the Marina Sands mall, as there was a water, light and sound show (right outside the mall's main entrance) later on that night. The views and scenery at Marina Bay are breathtaking and very tranquil. Whether your a single explorer, couple, family or bunch of friends... you will love it, as it caters for all.

Tip - try and go around 4pm and stay till 9pm. That way you get to see the place in natural light as well as at night. As the lights at night are pretty. But it still looks magnificent during the day."

,,Crowning marvel of a city that re-invented itself,5.0,,"The botanical domes are beautiful, tho a bit pricey---if you only pick one it should be the rain forest. There is a pricey charge for riding to the top of the iconic ""ship on top"" but just tell them you are going up for lunch or cocktails & there is no charge---clearly the best view in entire city on a clear day. All of this area has been created by land fill---quite amazing. The water taxi is the way to go across to the mall/casino area (you need your passport if you go to the casino). The mall even has an indoor river with row boats. There is a nice museum on the plaza where you get off the boat. Ask directions to take the indoor route to walk (quite a ways) over to the hotel & botanical gardens/parks."

,,Something extra,4.0,,"We did the night cruise on Marina Bay, showed all the places we had seen in the day but under lights these areas are quite magical."
,,"It's a must to visit, but..",3.0,,"It was the first area that we visited after arrival in Singapore. As the main attraction of Singapore, yes we should visit here but..

,,Great walk & views,5.0,,Fantastic views and a great walk around at 3.5km. Lots of shops & restaurants to stop at along the way for a cool drink.
,,"Wow, wow, wow!",5.0,,"Marina Bay is simply stunning! Practically the entire waterfront has pedestrian access and the round trip around the Bay is reasonably short as far as net walking distance is concerned. Approx 45 min or so. Then add all the sight-seeing & miscellaneous stops plus side-trips and the journey is likely to extend considerably, as there is so much to see around the Marina, incl. the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Absolutely must see!"

May take you more than one visit to satisfy your thirst once you have tasted this area.
,,"Technology, innovation, horticulture and flair",4.0,,"Have to award Singapore with very spectacular gardens - combining Technology, innovation, horticulture and flair. Surprise after surprise. Thanks for the experience. I will be back."
,,leisure tour,4.0,,"very very neat and clean , very picturesque , better to go in the evening restaurants are good , children must enjoy at this place"
,,A must visit location to Sg,4.0,,"This is a great place to linger, have a stroll, do some window shopping and eat at tells Ayer, my favourite hawker market in Singapore. Pick the right day and you may see dragon boat races, grand prix. fire works, parades etc.

Just a must on a short visit to the Island, but do have Satays at Telok Ayer after 7pm, washed down with lime juice or Tiger beer."
,,World Class,5.0,,Marina bay is really the heaven with all attractions activities- food etc. At night it was so interesting . Its a must...
,,A must to visit.,4.0,,Safe and well run city. No longer cheap shopping. Eating is inexpensive if you ask the locals where to go.
,,Beautiful setting,4.0,,This is a beautiful location. We spent some time walking around the Marina and it was very pretty. There are some cute restaurants and the mall is gorgeous. Very safe during the day and at night. We loved the view as we walked around.
,,Beautiful view and light show,5.0,,"There is a light show at 9:30. Best view is from the shops near the marina bay sands, but merlion park also gives a different view. Beautiful views at night."
,,Beautiful views at night.,5.0,,"If you want to go out for drinks and have a happy hour at every bar this is the place to go. There a great little pub too, The Penny Black, does all English food etc. if you are missing some home comforts. Very busy area but not all cramped and congested, just a bust hustle and bustle working area. Lots of restaurants / Bars all with great deals. Beautiful views at night."
,,Spectacular view,4.0,,One of the must-go places if you are traveling to Singapore. Have a glass of wine and chill out at Ku-te-da watching the sunset in this beautiful city landscape. The scene captures the skyline cosmopolitan city. There is a casino and lots of high end and middle end shops to suit all walks of life. However I must admit the foodcourt is more expensive than some of the nearby malls. Also you can take a walk or jog along the Garden by the bay to enjoy the greenery view.
,,Nice view of Singapore!,4.0,,"The walk around the bay is a must the first time visiting Singapore. You will have a nice view of the city, and also see some cool architecture."
,,Nightlife.,5.0,,"Amazing place, surreal at night, a paradise for photographers specialized in nightscapes or wanting to improve their night photography. Plenty of restaurants, surprisingly not overcrowded."
,,Awesome Area,5.0,,"A gorgeous area with tons to see. A walk around the bay will reveal great high-end shopping areas (if you came to shop) as well as delcious food markets, historical landmarks, and modern architectural marvels. At 8 PM every night there is also a pretty good light show."
,,"Take a walk, night show of marina bay sons is beautiful from here",4.0,,"Day time and night times is different.
I recommend night time. Marina bay sons has some lazier show at night time. From marina close to Lion and at Marina bay sons is different looking.
If you take a walk after dinner please visit there. There are some bar close to bay.
Please enjoy time!"
,,Amazing day!,5.0,,"Walked round twice (yes very humid) on Singapore's 50th birthday. Packed to the hilt but a great day, lots to see and do!"
,,Charming,5.0,,One of the most beautiful place in Singapore. I had dinner in front of water games and a very charming atmosphere. Go there.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,One of the best skylines I've seen. So picturesque you'll never run out of scenes to shoot your camera at.
,,Just Okay,3.0,,"I wasn't too impressed by this area. It's very crowded and although it has some good individual attractions the overall area didn't really ""wow"" me. The shopping centre at Marina Bay was my least favourite part closely followed by the viewing platform at the Marina Bay Sands hotel which was overpriced."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"I've been Marina Bay on Singapore's National Day.

Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands are great place to visit. Since the area is so huge, it's recommend that to visit Marina Bay in the morning time and after 3pm to avoid the heat during 12pm - 2pm."
,,Happening Area,4.0,,"In the past few years, the developments in these area have completed, and the crowds have returned to this area. Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, and the Flyer are some examples of the attractions. Happening place compared to the ""steamboat/table BBQ cluster"" of the past."
,,Quite expensive but worth it,4.0,,Although the drinks are quite expensive I would definitely recommend visiting here. The view is fantastic and you get a very good choice of beers. The atmosphere was nice even if it was a little crowded. Worth checking out for sure
,,Artificial but a nice spot of Singapore,3.0,,"If you are in Singapore you will come by it anyway. It's artifical but nicely made in a way you will recognize from Dubai or the states. Very big, very modern but lacks charme."
,,Fireworks on arrival,5.0,,We decided to go to the Skypsrk on the Saturday. Little did we know that celebrations were going on to celebrate Singapores 50th Birthday! It took us a short while to queue for tickets but once we were at the top there was plenty of room. We walked out of the lift and he whole sky lit up with the fireworks. Amazing! Had a good look round and had a drink band watched the pirotechnics but then had to queue for an hour and a half to get the lift back down! Don't think this is usual so if you go check if there are special celebrations going on and maybe go in the week and not at weekends. Great views to be seen.
,,A relax stroll around the Bay amidst the National Day Parade celebration mood,4.0,,"I had visited the Marina Bay Sands Casino when it was just opened but I have not really taken a good look and appreciation of the attractions and development around this Bay. At that time when I came, the reclaimed land was still under heavy construction and I found it quite unsafe to roam around the area. Now, it is so convenient and I rode on the free MRT ride on National Day all the way from Yew Tee via Woodlands to Marina Bay station.

It was surprisingly crowded. It was a Sunday and also a public holiday (Singapore 50th National Day 9th Aug 2015 Jubilee Celebration). Many visitors came with friends and family members and crowded at the bay front to take good pictures of themselves with the skyscrapers and spectacularly modern city landscape at the background.

The afternoon weather was a bit cloudy and people were picnicking with ground sheets lay on the floor by the side of the bay overlooking the pontoon of firework equipment. The authority was kind enough to permit orderly `chopping' of places and these `picnickers' were `leasing' the grounds and getting ready patiently to watch the spectacular evening firework display of the National Day Parade. There was a performance stage set up along the bay front with music being played from sound system and free National Day performance and entertainment at night with live screen of the parade being broadcast. At one corner of the bay, there were eateries promoting local delicacies sold at reasonable price set up in tent ages to cater to those who are hungry. But I saw a number of `picnickers' brought along their cooked dishes and enjoying their meals relaxing by the bay front.

There was a Louis Vuitton shop situated at the midway of the Bay and it was crowded with rich foreign customers. Further down the lane at the Shoppes Marina Bay, there was a long queue of visitors waiting patiently to gain entry into the ArtScience Museum which shaped like an unfolding lotus bloom. The queue was so long and I think I probably had to wait for about 45 mins before I could seek entry into the museum. I decided not to join the queue.

As I lifted my head up to see the iconic towering Marina Bay Sands Building complex, I could see the SkyPark that shaped like a ship linking the three sloping towers together. The sight was marvelous and gorgeous. Many visitors went into the Shoppes Marina Bay mall to have their lunch and shops around. Some sat beside the museum under shade near the lotus pond and chit chat with their friends.

As the National Day Parade was to be held at the floating platform, the lane to the other side of the bay was barricaded. I crossed a bridge and landed myself at the Esplanade theatre. There was a musical performance at the main hall of the Esplanade and I spent about half an hour listening to some of the songs being played in the air-conditioned area. From the Esplanade, I could see contingents had commenced marching and turning into waiting area along the main road in front of Stamford Hotel. I could also see army tanks and vehicles maneuvering their way into the waiting lane.

From the Esplanade, I walked across to the Merlion Park. It was really crowded and many photographers had already brought their camera stands and staked up their ideal positions along the bridge leading to the Merlion Park. There was a huge crowd around the Merlion Park area most picnicking at that early hours to immerse in the national day atmosphere and patiently waiting to watch the national day firework display by the bay front. The army officials were distributing national day hats, towels and maps to the picnickers and visitors who rushed to grab the gifts and tokens. I observed that many of the picnickers were not only Singaporeans but also foreigners including tourists.

I did not join in the picnic fun but proceed to visit the Asian Civilizations Museum opposite the Fullerton House.

It was a worthwhile relax stroll around the Bay amidst the National Day celebration mood. It is really a good idea to have a picnic outing with friends and families and immersed in the National Day celebration by the Marina Bay. It is a totally different experience. I think for next year National Day, I probably would come here to have a picnic with my family and enjoy the celebration by the Bay. The beautiful skyscrapers' landscape with the scenic and gorgeous bay front view is free and a must see and a great place to relax and enjoy."
,,"A beautiful location to relax, walk, take in Singapore",5.0,,"Walk for ages, enjoy breathtaking views and buildings, restaurants, shopping centres, see the Singapore Lion, so very much more"
,,Nice view,4.0,,You get a good outlook on general Singapore upperclass life here. Views from the shiptower are amazing and area is worth a visit.
,,Great area,4.0,,Great place to stay. The area itself is a typical area with many 5-star hotels and luxurious malls. Expect to see ferraris and lamborghinis lined up next to millenia walk. If you have the budget stay at on of the areas 5 start hotels and enjoy something special for once. Got easy access to the rest of the city and close to sights like Singapore Flyer and gardens at the bay.
,,A MUST SEE TOURIST SITE.,4.0,,It is a beautiful place to visit.Since it was National Day and a public holiday there were hoards of visitors and tourists strolling around. Some of the roads were sealed off for the National day parade and thus there was less traffic on the roads which made it easier for us to view the sites.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Perfect place to rest and enjoy the viev 👍 there are some restaurants and lots of stores for shoping. Expensive but you shold try. A 'must see' place in singapur
,,Wonderful Experience,4.0,,"The Marina Bay in Singapore has undergone a huge development since the last time we were there and to its credit has turned up trumps. Even though it is out of the mainstream Singapore tourist area it is still worth the effort to get there and take the time to wonder around. Unfortunately on the day that we were there it was pouring down with rain which dampened our enthusiasm a bit. Having said that we still had a great time, saw plenty of interesting things and enjoyed our trip immensely. The best thing I suppose was the rain because it means that next time we go back to Singapore we will have to visit this attraction once more to see everything, especially the night show."
,,Marina bay,4.0,,"During my stay in Singapore I was located near to Marina Bay. I walked around this area many times and enjoyed the bars and restaurants, both day and night times. Would do it all again."
,,"Clean, Green and Business Keen",5.0,,"What a beautiful place with everything you could want, Singapore its self is clean, safe and everyone speaks english
They all have style and grace in singapore and awsome them parks and restaurants
A most see to tick off the bucket list
I promise you will love it"
,,Not to be Missed,5.0,,"This area is very impressive. The Marina Bay Sands hotel built at a cost of $8 billion dollars is majestic inside & out. They have gondolas on the indoor rivers like Venice. Nice shops to look at if you are into Prada,Gucci, etc but very expensive.
The white art gallery next to this amazing building is also impressive. From this area you get a stunning view of Singapore by day or night looking up the river. Walk across the bridge & take in all the sights. Pretty cool."
,,Magnificant Marina Bay complex,5.0,,"Singapore is a small compact and increasingly vibrant city.
Over many visits, for work, pleasure and catching up with local friends, the architecture all stands out.
And one of the defining buildings in the city is the Marina Bay Sands complex, with hotel, museum, shops, fine restaurants and an Asian-world inspired food court.
There is something for everyone and you will find many locals wandering the complex of very hot or very cold or wet days as shopping is a national pastime.
The celebrity chef restaurants are on level two, my pick is DB Bistro Moderne by Daniel Boulud.
The promenade outside the complex gives you great views over the city and you can access the museum towards the right end near the helix DNA bridge.
A great spot to wander for a few hours and work out how many watches, shoes or bags you could buy in one visit!"
,,Nice walk through the city,4.0,,"Enjoying walking around the marina, not too much into city sightseeing but liked how clean it was, amazing food everywhere, not too crowded, nice environment to walk around in"

,,Busy much very city,5.0,,"This place is buzzing with life, come forth and see the urban jungle build from scratch. Lotsa office building and shopping centre and five stars hotel. Transportation is easy and cheap."
,,One of the Best Place in Singapore,5.0,,"Its one of the best place where everyone wanted to visit at least once before going home. you can have good smashing look of the Singapore Skyscraper Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the night Show of ""What a Wonderful World"" which is my favorite ever and don't wanna waste it. There is no fees to visit around marina bay. Its convenient by any way you can come from the Singapore Central area by Bus, MRT or Taxi. Wish you all happy travel. :)"

,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"A huge development encompassing accommodation, shopping and eating that has appeared from nowhere in the past few years.This is built around the former small shipping harbour and still retains the customs facilities. Most accommodation is upmarket price wise."
,,"Great mall, skyline views and night shows!",5.0,,"A must see when visiting Singapore. Great views of the business district and skyline. Highly recommended! Best time to go is a couple hrs before sunset. Browse the malls and then head up to the skypark to get a daytime/sunset/nighttime view. Tickets are only one go so this is the best value. Once that is over with, head down and watch the light/water show on the promenade! Makes for a great evening."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Woth a visit to Marina Bay. The atmosphere was relaxing and comfortable. Clark Quay and Garden by the Bay nearby as well.

,,Wonderful by day and night,5.0,,"If you do this by day, be sure to return at night time to experience the ambience. All the good food restaurants and bars are here and ctaers for all tastes. Can be a little pricey though, but worth the experience."
,,Under construction...,3.0,,"This is supposedly a nice stretch of walk. However, a lot of buildings are still under construction and there are cars along the roadside. So while it is good to take a stroll, it gets a bit dusty at times. The only thing I could look forward is to go indoor to the shopping mall which is HUGE. I still would prefer to be taking a walk at Raffles City."
,,Must see,5.0,,"A must see point of a visit to Singapore. The bay, the shopping mall and of course the Marina Bay Sands Hotel are a just spectacular. If you can book a night in the hotel and experience the superb view from the pool and bar area."

The financial district towards the right provides day and night time sights and lights and the Marina Bay Sands hotel on the left has become such an iconic image of Singapore. But there is more to the Bay than these things. Try a Boat Tour, listen to free music at the Esplanade, eat with locals at Gluttons Bay hawker stalls and just take in the atmosphere. Also go at night to see the light show from the MBS hotel."
,,50 years ? Impressive !,5.0,,"You cannot visit Singapore without walking around Marina Bay.
When you think that this city in only 50 years old, it is just impressive ! Bulidings are not that tall for security purpose (airport) but there match quiet well all together. And the best part, you can return every 6 months you'll have a new tower (almost true...)"

,,"Best place in Singapore to hang around for everyone, especially tourists.",5.0,,"Singapore sometimes becomes boring if you are a frequent visitor. How many times you can visit Sentosa, Universal Studio or Jurong Bird Park? But Marina Bay is always refreshing and comes with a new vista every time. The best time to visit is at dusk and stay there till late night. See the tall buildings, the nice promenade and the Fireworks and the Laser shows in the late evening. If you are lucky, you may see a wonderful show in the evening by the Singapore Air force (mostly in the weekends). The Singapore Eye, Marina Bay Sands and The Gardens by the Bay have added to the spectacle. The view from the Skydeck of Marina Bay Sands is overwhelming and the walk through the Gardens by the Bay is spectacular. Do not miss the light and sound show in the Gardens by the Bay which starts at 7:45 pm. Overall a must see for every tourists who are visiting Singapore. Can be only compared with the Laser show in the Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong and the Bund in Shanghai."

If you're staying in Singapore put this on your list of places to visit."
,,Exhausting but interesting!,4.0,,"Not so easy to get to if you are not living in the city directly. We had to change buses quite a few times and then walk quite a distance, but once you get there, its worth it, though you'd be quite tired. So many things to see & do.. The view was simple breathtaking and given a chance, I would come back!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"This is a beautiful area of Singapore. You can walk round the Marina, or join the many runners that run round. You can walk along the helix bridge and look across the river. It's really pretty at night with all the lights. Definitely worth a visit."
,,"The best view in Asia of a modern, man-made development",4.0,,"Perfect for pictures, Marina bay gives you an accurate idea oh how far ahead Singapore is comparing to any other SE Asian country."
,,Large open space,4.0,,With solar fans around the edge for cooling this large space is good to walk around and get a feeling for the whole Bay Area.
,,"Free to do, visit the marina at night during free sound and light show. First show is at 8, then every 30 minutes after.",5.0,,"Great city views plus free sound and light show at night. Easy to walk and stroller/wheelchair accessible.

Easy/short walk to gardens by the bay. I recommend visiting at night. If you want to cool off the marina sands resort is a short walk or you can visit the mall and grab a bite to eat at the food court. Area has a vibrant nightlife.

Might be best to do garden by the bay and domes (cloud and flower domes extra cost, outside gardens are free) in early/mid afternoon; grab a bite to eat; walk around the bay and hang out in the area at night.

Gardens by the bay also has 2 light shows at 7:45 and 8:45 which I think are better because the music is familiar. Both light and sound shows are awesome to see though.

I would not recommend doing the light and sound show ON the riverboat, it is overpriced an you get a much better view from outside the shopping center anyways.

Happy travels!"
,,must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing architecture, iconic and impressive modern complex. During the night is probably the best place to watch the city."

,,Excellent place with scenic beauty,4.0,,Well Marina Bay is a place to vouch for if u are in Singapore. .Its a place for giving ur camera a treat n place to explore..
,,"Marina Bay, Singapore",4.0,,"This was my first visit back to Singapore since 1963, when I spent 2 years here as a High school teacher with the British Army overseas,{FARELF}. I knew it would look so different And I was right! Nothing looked the same! Marina bay used to be collection of small fishing villages,{Kampongs} with fishing traps, and the Singapore river used to stink to high heaven. Now this land is all reclaimed, and in place of tiny kampongs we have spectacular and modern constructions, almost space age in appearance. No more nasty smells, just lovely scents of tropical flowers.A lovely place to promenade in the cool of the evening. Singapore is land poor, hence the land being reclaimed. All the poor people are now housed and fed, no crime, no rubbish, High rise flats up to 90 stories high mean that everyone has a place to rest his or her head at night. Lee Kuan Yew did a great job, whatever you may think of his politics."
,,"Amazing place, Pride of Singapore",4.0,,Marina Bay area and the Marina Bay sands hotel are must visit when you are traveling to Singapore. It offers so many diverse things and the view is amazing. There are numerous restaurants around this place. If you go on top of Marina Bay Sands you will have best view of Singapore and worth a visit.

,,Excellent way to see the city lights!,5.0,,"Loved the view here of the city lights. There is nice seating available all the way so you can comfortably enjoy. As you can see by now, this place in my opinion is best enjoyed at dusk/evening. If you have like cycling and have rented one on holiday, this is an excellent cycling spot too. Restaurants are plenty should you feel like having a bite."

,,marina bay,4.0,,"one of those places that you must visit if you go to Singapore. tick this one off the list. Make sure to visit the rooftop bar. If you get an opportunity to visit one of the suits, you must definitely take it. its an experience."
,,Light show,5.0,,"Brilliant light show. Loved watching the bum boats all lit up, and cruising along the river. Lots of seating along the bay to just sit and watch the city lights."

,,All under one roof.,5.0,,"Everything you need is under one roof. There is the hotel, restaurants, shopping, the metro system, a convention center and a casino."
,,One of the Best Places to Enjoy Nightscape,5.0,,"You will not want to miss this destination if you adore the night scenery of Singapore. There is a light show at 8 p.m. every day, where flashing lights are projected from the hotel and nearby infrastructure.

The nearby bridges, the coastline, the Helix Bridge, etc are nice places for tourists to take a stroll as well, especially at night. Moreover, restaurants located at the shore may enrich your experience, as you may enjoy the food and scenery at the same time.

If you have sufficient time, it is worthwhile to stop by and enjoy the magnificent light show."
,,Excellent Place,4.0,,"This is one of the best excellent place to visit in Singapore. View from this place is breathtaking. This joint is very well developed into a scenic spot. It is a nice place to enjoy with friends, kids & family."
,,Part of an evening tour,5.0,,"After our visit to Gardens on the Bay, we were taken to watch the fabulous light and laser show in Marina Bay. The best tourist trip I think I have ever taken. Clarke Quay at the end of the trip was thronged with people, sitting out eating and drinking but all behaving extremely well. We then picked up our coach which took us back to our hotels."
,,good place to be,4.0,,its a nice place to visit when you are in Singapore - good chain of restaurant and this is a place where you sit and enjoy watching the busy life of all
,,Urban Oasis,5.0,,"This is a destination all by itself. Spend 2 hours, preferably at dusk, walking all around. There is always something to do, including scheduled water and light shows."
,,well worth a visit,4.0,,"Lots to see and do here at the marina. If its raining then inside are many shops, cafes and restaurants. Walking outside there are places to rest, eat, drink whilst you take inthe view. You can catch the lift or escalator and head through to Marina Bay Sands walkway towards Gardens at tge Bay where you'll have a great view of the gardens and if you're there in the evening you will see it lit up and its quite breathtaking. Go and enjoy."
,,How did they get that ship up there?,4.0,,Just kidding but it looks fantastic and even better by night. You get great views of it from the Gardens by the Bay at night too.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Amazing! Very clean and lots to see - Singapore Flyer is worth a trip. Lots of photo opportunities - must see at night.
,,Stunning view!,4.0,,"The bay is even more beautiful at night than in daylight. There are a lot of attractions around for you to explore, or you can just relax there and enjoy the wind. The boat right is also a very nice experience."
,,"Expensive, but well worth it.",5.0,,"Our second visit to Marina Bay and well worth it, especially if you have time to spend in another area of Singapore as Marina Bay area is very expensive to dine, little of the 'old Singapore' culture to be seen."
,,Nice enough but a bit boring,3.0,,"Pretty and modern, though near the business district so unless you hit the observation deck or the science museum it can be a dull"
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,The Boat Ride is comfortable. Can see many Singapore famous landmarks. The night life there is attracting a lot of young people.
,,Nice views,4.0,,"Night views from the Marina Skypark are well worth the visit especially with the light show on the water. For people who aren't staying at the Marina Bay Hotel, you can get a glimpse of their infinity pool on the city side of the park. We also went to the Barrage in the day time. Interesting that this has been set up to act as a reservoir for the Singapore and Kallang Rivers. Lovely area there to fly kites and have picnics. Nice photo view of Singapore city skyline including Marina Bay Sands and the Domes."
,,Fun night out!,4.0,,We went at night. A group of 8. Fun place. Lots of restaurants and hang outs around. The Casino (Ship Building) and the Avalon disc being top of my charts.

,,Must Visit,5.0,,One of the best places to be in Singapore. Must visit. Loved this place. Hotels in the nearby vicinity are too good.
,,Splendid views,5.0,,Loved this area. We kept coming back here again and again. On a Sunday the CBD is empty so walking around and taking in the views was a super treat for us. The Lau Pa Sat Food court was also great.
,,So much to see and do !,5.0,,"This area is great for all ages, Casinos , Parks , Ice cream shop for the kiddies (Sorbets to die for ) family restaurants , high and restaurants, You really could spend a day here . (Not to mention the roof top pool on Marina Bay Sands Hotel) Give it a go !"
,,Views,4.0,,"One thing that Singapore is great for along the Marina Bay, are great views. Walk all the way around the bay, and there's always something to look at, or a picture to take. On one side is the CBD, and the other, Marina Bay Sands. The place is often busy with things going on. I love Singapore in so many ways, and this part of the city is quite beautiful!"
,,Always something happening.,5.0,,"We were there for the SEA Games and watched the Dragon Boat racing heats. Lovely open views, especially at night when there is a laser show from across the bay. There is also a water bus for trips."
,,views to die for,5.0,,after a little walk we arrived at bay for a wonderful view of area .Plenty of shopping was told this was a must and fount it enjoyable
,,The Buildings & The View,4.0,,"We have take a lot of pictures of the building surrounding there, Hotel Marina Bay Sands, Garden by the bay, Singapore Flyer, Marina Square Mall, Esplanade, Merlion Park, Marina Barrage and several attractives place near by."
,,Great Place,5.0,,It is the main attraction of Singapore.......nice place......good to spend you evening there........

,,Singapore landmark,4.0,,"take your picture to show the world that you are in Singapore. Merlion, esplanade, marina bay sand, and Singapore flyer can be found in this area"
,,Lots to see,4.0,,"The amazing thing about Marina Bay with all its attractions, hotels and open boulevardes is the fact that just 50 years ago it was all water. It's all built on reclaimed land and with the Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands Hotel and other attractions it's an interesting part to visit."
,,beautiful night stroll after dinner,5.0,,"beautiful views of Spore skyline, MArina Bay Sands, Opera House. nice walk by the river. great for photographers. Nice drinking, desert and eating places"
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,Enjoyed this area so much.The fabulous Marina Bay Sands Ship Hotel as well as the shopping malls.Also great eateries with variety of foods.Very easy to reach by train.
,,Stunning Night View,5.0,,"It's recommended for you to visit Marina Bay during late evening or night to avoid hot weather. Plus, the view of the skyscrappers during night was absolutely stunning. To get the best experience, u must try the Singapore River Cruise for just $25 (Adult) & $15 (Children). You'll be amazed with what u see."
,,This is a must!,5.0,,"This is a must do when in Singapore. Although one of the most touristic places, it is a very nice place, especially at night. You have a lot of bas and restaurants to chill looking at the bay."
,,Financial center with good views,3.0,,"Certainly one if the things to see in Singapore, but not much more than a bay with skyscrapers, restaurants, hawker centers and a promenade to walk or jog around the bay. Suggest to take a full walk around the bay, take a walk over the helix bridge, pass the grand stands and enjoy the view from one of the Nanny restaurant and bar tables. If you got a chance to see it from on topv of the sands, give it a go. Nice area, but for my taste a bit overrated."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,You could spend quite some time here walking round the bay. The hotels and shops surround this and the whole area is clean and looks safe. Brilliant spot.
,,walk right round the marina bay and see Singapore,4.0,,"To understand where things are and to experience the city, walk RIGHT round this starting at Merlion Park and ending close to it again heading to the Raffles Landing site memorial and Parliament. By doing that you can look and see the traditional CBD, the even newer Marina Bay Financial Towers, Asia Sq between the two and you can look at the weird science fictionesque ship shaped casino in the sky straddling three tower blocks and you can experience a huge airconditioned shopping mall and see much much more. It will only take about 45 mins to go round but think about the heat and schedule a drink break half way!"
,,Best place to stroll,5.0,,"Loved the time we spent strolling around the Marina Bay and would say it is a must do in Singapore. We spent most of the day here then headed up river for an hour before calling at Lau Pa Sat hawkers market for dinner.
We headed back to he Marina for the light show which for us was a bit of a let down but still pleasant enough & delightful to sit and rest a while after a day on our feet."
,,The View is amazing.,5.0,,The food and view will blow you away at this place!! Worth the expense. We went up at sunset to enjoy the view and experience the amazing fine dining.
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"We were there during afternoon time and the weather was perfect, a slight breeze blowing across and also the apt amount of sun.

One gets an wonderful view of the harbor and all great buildings around the city. one call also see the city traffic and speed and motor boat rides. Must visit and needs some time to be spent to enjoy the beauty and surroundings."
,,A relaxing walk.,5.0,,"It was lovely to walk along the promenade, watching the big ships out to sea waiting to come in for unloading,, it was beautiful to see at night with all the lights on."
,,Over Priced Over Hyped,2.0,,"The buildings are a wonderful, especially at night but the prices are VERY high for anything and everything here."
,,impressive,4.0,,"great walk around, mainly just before dark and after that during the evening, lights are really good. peaceful, clean and modern"
,,Thank you Mr Lee for making Singapore so powerful to create places like that,5.0,,Just amazing. No matter what time of the day you visit this place - it make a great impression. All seems to be perfectly planned and suited. Modern and unique architecture. Every few meters you stop either to take a memorial picture or just to enjoy a view. It is perfect for strolling and admiring the great progress the country hade made under the reign of its former prime minister.
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"Definetly a must go place in Singapore!Wonderful place for shop too. Visit during the night, and they will ensure your evening to be relaxing and pleasant one!"
,,#AmazingSingapore,5.0,,"Must see place in Singapore. Probably one of the best place. a lot to see here specially the Merlion Park, Gardens by the bay and Singapore Flyer. if you have a lot of time in Singapore you should visit this wonderful Place!!!"
,,Great fusion Western-Asian,4.0,,"Is a place where you will find several attractions, including the Merlion, the Esplanade-Theatres on the Bay, the Marina Bay Hotel, the Singapore Flyer and boat trips around the Marina.
The Marina also finds herself all the business centre, composed by its skytowers.
The walks around are large and very clean. It's a place where you can walk around, resting and also take advantage with watching at the same time various views, each with different perspectives depending on location. There are also some places where you can eat some meals, since the most simple to the great cousine.
We arrived at the Marina Bay by walk, from the Asian Civilization Museum, crossed the Cavenagh Bridge and in a Fullerton Hotel entries we reach an underground passage with all the refinement of this hotel and with several photographs of the colonial era."
,,Sit and Chill,5.0,,"It is your best knownl view of Singapore bay, but much better in the flesh. and it is a great place just to sit and enjoy a warm evening with friends and pass a few hours and its all free ."
,,A must see for every visitor to Singapore,5.0,,What Singapore has done in the Marina Bay area is nothing short of spectacular. Starting at the Merlion and getting your photo with the Marina bay Sands in the backdrop makes for a great photo opportunity. Walk the full area and end up in the Marina Bay shops for a nice lunch and expensive shopping.
,,Not a Favourite for Us,3.0,,"Went to the Bay to see the night Marina Bay light show and found it rather disappointing and couldn't recommend it. It is nice to walk along the boardwalk and we also took a bum boat ride back to Clarke Quay but found that overpriced as well. It is just as easy to do a walk along the river, you see just as much and don't have to pay the $18 per person the boat charged."
,,Singapore recommended,5.0,,A very relaxing and pleasant venue to spend an evening. Plenty of activity here and good places to dine as well.
,,Iconic Must see place in SG,4.0,,"The location has become iconic of Singapore, you cant leave Singapore without a stroll on marina bay.
Its a nice cozy walk in the evening which is recommended, there are lots of other attraction on the way which also makes it worth going. You can also do some shopping in this area if you have fat wallet :("
,,Great walk,4.0,,"Easy to walk around lots of shade and bars/shops if you want to pop in. When we were there there were dragon boat races and it is quite a hub. No cars, nice architecture, including double helix foot bridge."
,,Good exercise & scenery,5.0,,"Good place for exercising; see ppl doing it all the time at sunset. I walked early in the morning but the sun was still intense; I recommend bringing water. The views of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, Helix Bridge, science museum and the downtown skyline are all beautiful day and night. Great photos from every vantage point. The Merlion is across the other bridge parallel to Esplanade Drive. The Marina Bay Shoppes are too expensive for my taste but it's a good stop for resting bc it has air conditioning. :) the huge area in front of the Shoppes has a water/light show every night around 8 or 9 pm. Suntec City and Bugis shopping Centers are nearby for endless food choices. Clark Quay along the Singapore River and Chinatown are a little further at about 30-45 min walk or 10 min by taxi."
,,The image of Singapore,5.0,,"A very pleasant bay in the middle of the city, an example of well-designed city planning. Lots of attractions."
,,Day out at the shops!,5.0,,Architecture amazing. Could have wandered around all morning looking at the different building designs. So different to where we live. Eating/coffee areas menus took a bit of guessing on the prices.
,,Best Location for a Modern Artificial City!,5.0,,Singapore is a small island with high buildings and you cant see much of any history around. The city is very clean and well organized. Marina Bay is one of the best places to have a nice city view especially after sunset!
,,Attractive bay in a modern city,4.0,,I crossed the bay on foot by walking over a gorgeous and modern pedestrian bridge. It had 4 viewing platform. You can see the swell of the tops of the Gardens by the Bay. The Merlion is in the distance and seems small from this viewpoint. One reaches Marina Bay Sands at the end of the bridge. There are older landmarks like the Fullerton Building. This area gives you a feel for Singapore- modern and vibrant. And ever so clean and new.
,,beautiful Place,5.0,,"everything is so Good over there at Marina Bay,, please try to go both day time and night time as well you will get different beautiful views and i am sure you gonna like it so much..."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Recently visited marina bay on a stop over to Australia amazing scenery and there was still some of the formula 1 circuit at the bay really worth a visit
,,Excellent place to hang on,5.0,,"Nice place to hang on for an amazing experience. Coupled with surrounding malls - Vivo for relaxing, shopping, dyning and for connectivity to other parts."
,,One of the landmark to take photo,4.0,,"Walked along Hylix Bridge to capture view of Singapore CBD. Its a place to take pic with Marina Bay Sands background. I went there in the late afternoon, the weather is just nice and view is 5 stars"
,,Stunning views,5.0,,"The Merlion is the big attraction but the Bay is beautiful and well worth a visit. There are other attractions around the bay including the hotel with the boat on the roof, the Opera house, the State buildings and so on. This area will major in the 50 year celebrations due in August."
,,sky high bay,5.0,,Marina bay was a very pleasant view with skyscrapers right next to the sea. It looked even nicer from the water and we saw it from the water on our duck trip which was fun and interesting at the same time.
,,Nice to walk,5.0,,"go make sure that you take with you some good walking shoes, great place and at night the light show and water its nice to see enjoy"
,,Fun see,5.0,,"The buildings in this area is spectacular, best seen at night on a river cruise night tour. River cruise was great and romantic."
,,So Singapore,5.0,,"This is an impressive complex with Marina Sands bay hotel, grand prix track, Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the bay and a lot more. It's worth walking around and seeing by night and it's perfect for photos. It's the sort of place you only Singapore would develop. Beautiful"
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"As I’ve said, Singapore River empties to the Marina Channel. The reclaimed area of the Marina Bay houses the newly-built Marina Bay Sands, an integrated resort. It has the mall, hotel, and casino in three towering buildings with a ship’s replica on top connecting them! You can get there by feet from the Esplanade through the ingeniously-engineered Helix Bridge wherein you can also pass by the Singapore Flyer, the world’s largest Giant Observation Wheel!"
,,Landmark with Charme,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Are is the City Center of Singapore. It features the Marina Bay Sands, The Fullerton Hotel, The Esplanade, Shopping and food opportunities. Its the in place to be and in the night it develops to on e of the Party centers in Singapore. Basically, you can spend a whole day and night and most probably the whole holiday in this area without getting bored"
,,Love this new island!,5.0,,"The island is man made, to keep out large ships that need to dock are now docking away from the area. Sentosa island is right next door, and Marina Bay is so beautiful!!"
,,Buzzing,4.0,,A great place to hang out in one of the restaurants just watching the world go by. The Merlion is the attraction. There is an open air food court Gluttons Bay on the side of the bay near the floating football field which is well worth a visit.
,,The place to be if you're on a short visit to Singapore,5.0,,Probably the best place to spend a couple of hours before checking out China town. For free you can walk through the Gardens At The Bay and the Marina Bay Sands!
,,good day walk around featuring many different things.,4.0,,"Really enjoyed the history and the water features, especially the nighttime light displays. Unfortunately evenings can be very loud for the older traveller."
,,Stunning grounds and location,5.0,,"What's not to love about Marina Bay. We took the River Cruise and hopped off to walk around the gardens and boardwalk. Go up the elevator to the top of the ""boat"", and don't forget your camera for panoramic views of Singapore!"
,,Charming waterfront,5.0,,"We love sitting and enjoying the bay, at certain time in the night (likely 9 PM) they played music with wonderful water fountain! You just need to sit and enjoy this attraction."
,,Beautiful for a Walk or Run,5.0,,"This is a very wide promenade on two levels - one it stepped down right next to the water, so it is never too crowded unless there is an event at the soundstage (which may attract you for a different reason). You can take a boat trip from here or ride/dine in the Singapore Eye, have a drink or snack in one of the cafe/bars, but mostly I love to run along here with a view of the oh-so-weird Marina Bay Sands, Merlion and City skyline. It's a knockout view."
,,underground,3.0,,"When we visit marina bay the first time about 3 years ago. It was still a open place and a lot of sand. No its looking beautiful. The only thing is that al in underground, but enough daylight is coming in."
,,Unimpressive,1.0,,A body of water surrounded by forest of steel and concrete. Uninteresting. Boring. What else is there to say?
,,Definite city landmark,5.0,,A must-do at night and catch the very nice display of city lights walking around the bay. There are several choices of waterfront restaurants and bars to enjoy the view.
,,Enjoy your time.,4.0,,"I enjoyed watching the people and the buildings around here. There is a light show at night but in my opinion, it is not that amazing."
,,Light show on the bay,4.0,,We were walking along the bay and noticed people began to sit along the bay so we joined them. A light and sound show started which was really beautiful. The lights and pictures were reflections on mist which was thrown up from the side of the water. A lovely and unexpected show.
,,Pleasant area,5.0,,"We really enjoyed exploring this area: has only added to our enjoyment of Singapore as being a modern, clean and entertaining place to visit."
,,The place to go for a sunset,4.0,,We went there to watch the sunset and it was very nice to see Singapore changing from daylight o night lights
,,Great place for an evening walk,4.0,,"A very nice place to walk around by day, and even more so in the evening.
Be sure to see the Merlion, the marina bay sands building, the laser show (at 09:30PM I believe?) and the theater.
My favorite walk would be from the Merlion, to the theater, walk passed the F1 tribune over the helix bridge and into the gardens... all every nicely lit in all sorts of colors in the evening"
,,must go,4.0,,You have to be there for the ambience and the peace alongside the hectic night life around. Its beautiful at night. Dont miss the laser light and fountain show. You can walk all the way around to the Singapore Merloin. Plenty pubs and eateries. Suitable for kids and oldies. Taxi's easily available all over the place.
,,SIIGHT TO SEE,5.0,,"A Sight to See if you visit Singapore . Perfect place to see royalty and luxury, excellent sight to view the most expensive casino property"
,,Love Marina Bay,5.0,,"Overlooking Marina Bay from our hotel we appreciated the changing atmosphere through the day. From the stillness of the first light to the bustle of the late night. The explosion of light from Marina Sands side to the romance of the lights on water from the boat tour. All the amazing food places, the smells the music the lights what an atmosphere."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Great place to be in evening as it is very Vibrant and active. Lot of places to walk and plenty of shopping and of course, plenty of places to eat. Happening and well maintened. There is good Casino for visitors which is of excellent quality."
,,good place,4.0,,Nice scenery. Have a good backdrop for photos. The skyline at night is good Worth to visit! Do come soon
,,Over the top,4.0,,"This area is definitely over the top -- the three tower Sands Hotel with the ""ship"" on top, the luxury mall, Flower Fields and Cloud Forest domes, the laser tree light show, and, if that's not enough, the casino. Something for everyone."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Well worth the walk from the esplanade. scenery is stunning and a fine example of Singaporean enterprise
,,Great Views of Singapore,5.0,,It is a relaxing place with lovely views of Singapore both during the day and at night. It is a good place to sit and watch the people passing.
,,good atmosphere,4.0,,"lovely restaurants gorgeous views and very relaxing, nice place to stroll around. Restaurants were priced right, and a great atmosphere."
,,Brilliant place to hangout!,5.0,,Great place for a post-dinner stroll. We sat at the boardwalk until the wee hours of the morning. Perfectly safe as well.
,,Spectacular View,5.0,,"An architectural marvel, Marina Bay sands offers an aerial view of Singapore. Best time to visit is the twilight hour, when you can enjoy both the day light and the illuminated view of the city. Half of the place is restricted for public view, yet what is open for visit is worth the value for money."
,,breathtaking views,5.0,,as everything in Singapore perfect and clean and interesting very well organized and easy to visit with good guides
,,Refreshing and solemn,4.0,,"Everything's perfect. The Marina Bay Sand, The Merlion, The Gardens by the Bay and the variety of food venues you can choose from ... perfect vacation venue for my family and yours too. Go ahead and explore the beautiful Singapore!"
,,Always cool-air,5.0,,So crowded but still the air is so cool. Outdoor is so breezy at evening and warm yellow light with the sunset. Indoor escalator rule of thumb is to stand on the left for any one whom would like to walk fast on the right (so civilized). Singaporean is more likely to walk me like a baby in need of direction. Free travel map from the mall to the official map from government is great help when I forget the printed map on internet at the hotel.
,,Beautiful Skyline,4.0,,Marina Bay is a stunning area at the heart of Singapore and is surrounded by some of Singapore's iconic buildings such as The Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It also is surrounded by other attractions such as the The Singapore Flyover and the superb Singapore Skyline. Take a relaxing stroll around the Marina taking in all the attractions and finish by watching the light show beneath The Marina Bay Sands Hotel starting at 20:00 or 21:30. The only downside is that it's very busy here.
,,Splendid view of the bay,5.0,,"Easy to get to if you want to see Marina bay and take a leisurely walk and view all the beautiful sights. We got off at Marina Bay MRT and took a walk towards Marina Bay pier passing the iconic Marina Bay Sanda hotel nearby. If you are feeling hiot and need cooling down and you have the time you can also visit the shopping mall inside. From the pier nearby you can take the river boat to go across, takes approximately 5 to 10 mins boat ride to Merlion. It will cost Singapore $6 to get across and you will be able to capture the surroundings by the water and capture very good photographs. However if you feel like walking you can also walk along the bay to get to Merlion. It's best to get there an hour or two before sunset and just before sunset to arrive by Merlion and you will be in a perfect spot to capture all of your beautiful snaps. You will have great views of marina bay sands hotel and all the tall buildings that's dwarfs the place where you will be standing. Also you will be able to take close up photos of Merlion here. This is a must place to visit when you come to SIngapore."
,,Hype but must visit,3.0,,"here was so much hype especially about the laser show that we trudged it all the way after walking heavily in neighbouring Gardens by the bay to make the 8pm Show on weekdays ( Later 9 & 11 pm on weekends). The building itself is apiece of art & style - no doubt - On the rooftop you get a birds eye view of Singapore- Go at Dusk to collect both day time & night photos. ( tripods not allowed) - The laser show in itself was a flop - Seen better stuff iN Dubai & KL.
Mind you the food court is impossibly occupied on weekends & so ended up at Punjab GrilL Fine dine restaurant"
,,A must See in Singapore,4.0,,an impressive area with tons of things to see and visit. You can a few hours here or as much time you have.
,,Beautifulllllll,4.0,,"the place offers amazing view, especially during the evening time. Watching the sunset from the marina bay sands was a beautiful experience."
,,Great Place,4.0,,"This is an upmarket location with great shopping and a good range of fine dining restaurants. Beware, if it rains (as it does most afternoons) be prepared for a lengthy wait for a taxi"
,,The iconic Marina Bay view that is postcard worthy,4.0,,"Do come by at night after 7pm to enjoy the night scene which I feel is a lot more enchanting than the day view. Not forgetting Singapore weather is mostly on ""I am burning mode"".

You will probably need around an hour there to explore and take photos."
,,Great View,4.0,,"Singapore's visionary planners and engineers have conjured up a magical locale. On land reclaimed from the sea, they have laid out a gigantic complex of parks, gardens, enclosed climate-controlled green spaces, leisure locations and a huge magnificent resort. One would need two full days to cover the entire complex and would still not be done! Truly magnificent!!
The only negative is that given Singapore's hot sunny days and tendency to welcome sudden showers one would have liked more shelters or covered spaces -- maybe just the canopies of spreading trees to take cover. Until then, just carry adequate protective gear."
,,Amazing ski line,5.0,,You can see the Marina Bay Hotel from all around the bay such an amazing building. We walked around the bay taking in all the different views. Lots of new high buildings but then in places are some if the old in contrast.
,,Lovely way to spend an evening!,4.0,,"This place has a lovely chilled out feeling and is a great way to spend a casual evening with friends and family. We strolled along the charming deck, taking in the little restaurants, the water lilies and we're just in time to watch the light and sound show."
,,EXPENSIVE,2.0,,The viewing areas were being renovated so you could pay for high tea but the view was totally blocked.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"All the places. Good to visit with friends and family. You will definitely enjoy, will find something special, specific !"
,,A way to burn calories,4.0,,This connects to some the tourist places in Singapore and its nice for a walk when its not so warm. It also provides a backdrop for lovely pictures.
,,Awesome View,5.0,,The view is worth a visit be it at night or day. The Buildings are a sight to see in themselves. Would recommend a boat ride to take the sights and sounds slow and from afar. The day ride may be hot and a tad humid but brave the Heat and watch the beauty of Singapore unfold.
,,Interesting place,4.0,,Marina Bay is a very interesting place. You can find there the imposant lion monument... and you have a fantastic view on Singapore's most famous hotel.
,,fantastic marina,5.0,,"this is one fine experience is singapore. a must place to visit for all, families and children, better at night"
,,Nothing Fancy,3.0,,It's nothing fancy. But if you go to Singapore you kind of have to go there. But it's nice for a walk around in the eve or an early morning jog. Don't go there during day time unless you want to get burned.
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Beautiful area where the finacial institutions are located around a bay area. Very upbeat skyline with beautiful walk ways around it. For those tired of walking one could use the water taxis to cross the bay area. High end shopping facilities and top restaurants with a fine selection of nice and comfortable hotels overlooking the bay area.
For those who have only a couple of days to spend in Singapore this is a nice area to stay. The Marina Bay also has beautiful gardens accessable to everyone and not to forget large theater where one could enjoy the latest plays and music performances."
,,Beauty in mid of bz city,4.0,,"Beautiful place and good for photo shots. The building (hotel in specific-Marina Bay Sands) is in the shape of cruise at the peak of the hotel. If its a sunny day then its prefect for photoshots and walk by the walk way as its next to river and merlion facing at the opposite sides. There is boat rides and full of branded n luxury items to be purchased such as LV, Gucci etc."
,,fabulous,5.0,,"We scootered around the bay - saw the Merlion, the helix bridge. Just lovely to be near the water. Some nice time away from the business of the city"
,,Not all that,3.0,,"Marina bay is dominated by the marina sands hotel, hotel restaurants are line up near the waters edge. In the day it is rather draining to walk around due to the heat, at night it comes alive. Worth a look but not a stop over."
,,worth to go,3.0,,It is worth to have a look if you have never been to this place. But I think one time to be there is good enough. Too many tourists. The staff of local juice and food bar is not friendly. Maybe they are tired to see so many tourists every day.
,,beautiful flowers,5.0,,"if you like to explore in nature ,this would be the perfect place.there are orchids,roses and other elegant flowers!"
,,Awesome at nighttime!!,5.0,,"Take pictures, take a boat ride, see Singapore's history, clean water, roaring lion, nice crowd , good restaurants, overall gr8 place."

,,A zone for young & old,5.0,,"This review is about an area surrrounding marina bay, garden by the bay east & west, the barrage. Away from the busy roads of the city, is this green area filled with flowers, trees, water and skyline.

,,I love Marina bay,5.0,,"I know it's overly Commercial and over priced but the area is very iconic. Great place to take guests and give them an ""ahh"" experience. Go at dusk and watch the night lights come on."
,,marina bay is a great view to catch spore skyline,5.0,,this is a man made place but they have done a great job of creating a concept. catch singapore skyline here with Marina Bay Sands in the back drop. take a boat ride from marina bay to boat quay to clarke quay and back. its a journey back to singapore history. skip the merlion.
,,Excellent Place to Walk Through,5.0,,This area is beautifully laid out. You can make the trek in few hours or you can take your time and enjoy every aspect of it.
,,its worth,5.0,,"the place is really amazing its a bay,you can view the bay sands hotel which is a main atrraction,there is the singapore flyer and much more"
,,Nice place to walk and have a drink along the shore.,3.0,,Nice place to walk and have a drink along the shore at the multiple restaurants.

,,Singapore at it's best.,4.0,,"Amazing structure. Lovely to walk around and admire the bay , the buildings . Lots of great places to eat as well."
,,Nice view but that's it,3.0,,Nice view but a bit too many tourists around this area. Shops and restaurants are a bit too pricey. I do recommend this place to visit at least once though since it is one of the trademarks of Singapore.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"This place is stunning, all of the nighttime pics of Singapore skyline are here and you will be awestruck by how many there are and the cosmopolitan nature of the city as well as the green nature of it. Well worth a visit."
,,Lovely Restaurants,5.0,,"A great place to stop and watch the world go by, there are a few restaurants to choose from, go for nice walks and just appreciate the location."
,,Iconic!,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a 'must visit' location when in Singapore.

Many photo worthy landmarks of old and new Singapore are located around the bay and the skyline is breathtaking both during day time and at night.

Given that Singapore tends to get hot and humid, I find that it's best to visit at night."
,,Gorgeous stroll,5.0,,"Some of the best restaurants, walking, and skylines in Singapore are found at Marina Bay. Marina Bay is perhaps the best place in Singapore for people to stroll. I highly recommend here as a reason in itself to fly to Singapore."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Take a trip around the bay, it is just so worthwhile, full of quick boats that go down the river too, so much to see"

,,Beautiful n spacious,5.0,,"Beautiful views, not too overwhelming with the lights, spacious areas to walk through, great restaurants lined up around. Most see in singapore"
,,Visitors!!!,4.0,,"We loved the Bay but not the visitors!! Seems funny saying that as we were overseas visitors there on a tour. The area was packed, far too many buses had arrived in a short time. The rain didn't help as we were not only in a crowd but the umbrellas were annoying too. We need to return for a leisurely visit outside the bus tour times!!"
,,excellent,5.0,,Just a wonderful peaceful area away from the bussle of main area of the city couldn't believe all the different species of plants and the set out of it all
,,Cityscape of beauty,4.0,,"This has got to be one of the worlds truly great central city viewing points. Many highlights with a 360 degree view from many points. CBD lights are impressive, but the highlights are definately the Merlion and Marina Bay Sands. Many great photo opportunities here and a great atmosphere with free concerts, light shows and eating options. Get here just before sundown to give you the best opportunities to see it in various lighting conditions. Impressive."
,,Decadence,5.0,,"This was luxury. I just wandered around the Mall for several days, seeing so etching different everyday. There was a free light show to music at night that was very entertaining. A gondola ride in the middle of the centre?? And a water feature the other end that was very cleaver. The staff at the information desks, went out of their way to help with directions. They were extremely hospitable and friendly. The food court had so many different and inexpensive choices, I was hard pressed to make a decision, I thought the phone cupboard was a great idea. Along the wall, there were cubicles with every type of phone cable for people to charge their phones while they are. Very considerate. No one touched anyone else's phone. The honesty system works well here."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"We had a great walk around here. Just looked through to the casino! But the shopping centre was beautiful and we then went out and had a drink on the promenade to wait for the laser show.
Laser show was great, view it from Marina Bay side otherwise you won't get the full effect of the show."
,,marina bay,5.0,,One of the most amazing places in Singapore. once you go at the top of it you can view singapore from a great height. The top floor is supported by a open space bar and a n infinity pool.
,,fantastic view,5.0,,I really liked Marina Bay. It is so beautiful and impressive. I did not like that it was deserted and it was so hot. But that is Singapore
,,Worth going,5.0,,Its worth going to Marina Bay when you are in Singapore for a holiday. The shopping centre is great and sky deck is must see.. it would have been awsum if they let people use swimming pool at the top.. you can only use it if you are staying at marina bay hotel... may be have a fee to use pool.. so people not staying are still able to use it.. but everything else was great. I would try to stay there next time.. :)
,,night at a dreamland,5.0,,colorful everywhere. Day time you will find the beauty at the Garden by the Bay. When it appears nighttime open your eyes to a dreamland. Mostly the theme was going with water and laser lights. You can take a walk around the Bay and face for a picture at Merlion while eating a $12 Durian ice cream.
,,nice scenery,3.0,,i visited this place just to take a picture. it was nice by the way...try to get to the top...the view is amazing worth to visit

,,A nice place to walk round.,3.0,,Nice place to walked round but really no different to any other marina. We walked around at night after the flyer but it would be better during the day.
,,Night out,4.0,,This is a great place for a night out; both with family and friends. Don't miss the designer labels!! The laser show at 8pm each night is also pretty good.
,,Best part of Singapore,5.0,,"The marina bay area of SIngapore is gorgeous indeed with very well planned mix of water, office buildings, residential buildings and cultural landmarks.
In a way this could only happen in Singapore which plans well 20 years in advance and has the capacity to see the vision through .
A must visit place in Singapore"
,,Great night view,5.0,,"Marina May is a must see when you travel to Singapore. It not only has skyscrapers standing around the lake, but has beautiful night views illuminated by the boat, shopping mall, bridges and many other small attractions around."
,,Go for Beautiful View,5.0,,Cool Breeze in the evening with beautiful view of the city makes it a must visit if you are in SIngapore. Also try and see the Lazer show which takes place at 8 pm and 9.30 pm and if you have time do take the boat ride. Nice place to relax and spend time with your loved ones. Also have some interesting eating options nearby.
,,Once the Waterfront - now a Bay,4.0,,Very modernistic; take a boat trip up the river (about 40 mins) - but excellent view of the surrounding sky-scrapers
,,Everything at one place,3.0,,Visit this place around evening for the best view. They have light and sound show across the bay and you can walk around all the attractions easily or can sit and relax to absorb Singapore beauty.
,,Worth the visit!,5.0,,Well worth the visit to Marina Bay. Plenty to see and do here including the Merlion and also recommend a Singapore River cruise. It goes up the river but also goes around Marina Bay and includes commentary. It's a huge bay and you can walk a long way so make sure you wear comfortable shoes.
,,very beautiful,5.0,,"loved it so much to see and do very entertaining, we had romantic dinner on 57th floor was expensive and worth trying once, we did sky flyer loved the view beautiful and great, nice walk around the river, took Ferris very nice and night light is great to see."
,,A must see,4.0,,This area is a definite must see when your in Sinagpore. Its an iconic location that everyone seems to know about. Very easy to get there on public transport
,,a beautiful marina,5.0,,"Many areas are beautiful in Singapore. This bay as well, in particular at night with its beautiful skyline."
,,Beautiful setting,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore for a short stay, this is a great place to centre your trip around, as so much that you would want to visit is around the Marina Bay. Be sure to catch the laser show in the evenings over the Bay."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We visited Marina Bay a couple of times while we stayed in Singapore. Once during the day and once in the evening for sunset. Both times were beautiful!
It was rather crowded with tourists who were seeing the Merlion - but once you move away it has a feeling of calm and tranquility.
I would recommend going for sunset as once all the city lights come on it's stunning!"
,,Great for an evening or early morning walk!,5.0,,"Great for an after dinner stroll! Use the Bayfront or Marina Bay MRT train stops. Beautiful views at night of the harbor, downtown, and made totally of reclaimed land!"
,,PERFECT place for shopping and gambling and food !!!,5.0,,Worth a stroll along the bay and taking in the sounds and atmosphere of Singapore. Do not miss this at any cost... if you have not taken a walk around Marina Bay - you have not visited singapore
,,Wait for the laser show,4.0,,We went hearing of the laser show that happens here at 8pm. The show is good...and the promenade is great for cityscape views and a leisurely walk. Do not miss!
,,Nice location,5.0,,Visited in evening magnificent view. Prefer to travel by boat n enjoy good sight seen with family. Light show is ok not as good as Hong Kong one.
,,Kaleidoscope of fun activities,5.0,,"A 3.5 km Waterfront Promenade around Marina Bay includes a new eco-friendly visitor centre and The Helix linking Bayfront to Marina Centre where the Youth Olympic Park is located. The Promontory at Marina Bay is used as an interim event space and public space used for activities such as theatres and carnivals. There are currently 7 rail stations: City Hall, Raffles Place, Marina Bay, Bayfront, Downtown, Esplanade and Promenade serving Marina Bay. It is surrounded by plush hotels, malls, eating joints and lots of fun activities to choose from."
,,It's just... okay...,3.0,,"I'm very impressed with what the Singaporean government has done to modernise their country, with an abundance of iconic and sky-tearing structures. Even though this is a bay and there are trees, nature is absent and is replaced by artificial alternatives."
,,A great place with fresh air,4.0,,"A great place to bring your family there, fresh air...nice & quiet place to play kites or jogging .."
,,Lovely Marina Bay,5.0,,"It really is worth the visit to walk around see the Bay and surroundings, we took a mini cruise across the bay and it was lovely"
,,Awe inspiring,5.0,,"Whether you are admiring the buildings or people watching or just sitting on a bench and relaxing, this is a great area to while away a few hours, day or night."
,,Wowed,5.0,,"A great area with so much to do to entertain all. We got the MRT and the stations are so conveniently located. Be prepared to do a bit of walking, but the view is amazing from every angle around the river. The light show is a fun and classy evening for all."
,,good for a walk.,3.0,,"Pretty good for a walk at night, good lighting conditions, plenty of people around. Don't expect too much else."
,,Iconic Singapore,5.0,,Worth a stroll along the bay and taking in the sounds and atmosphere of Singapore. Perfect place to go after dinner or for a walk before dinner
,,Wow!,5.0,,"What a beautiful city. We enjoyed our walk round marina bay and sat in the sun watching the boats and buildings. Would love to come back to Singapore. Lots of shops, restaurants and things to do here."
,,Beautiful Bay!,4.0,,"Its must place on itinerary. The first thing you will see is the MERLION,the mascot of Singapore. with Towering skyscrapers on one side,the Marina bay Sands Hotel on other and towering Singapore Flyer on horizon,its a memorable place to visit.
Best time will be in the evening as u can see both in daylight And in the glory of night"
,,"Great atmosphere, great views",5.0,,"Marina Bay is my favorite place in Singapore. Start your tour in Downtown (Raffles Place), walk to the Bay at the Fullerton Bay Hotel and continue towards the Merlion from where you have the best views of both Downtown and Marina Bay Sands. After that, continue over the big bridge, bypass the concert halls and keep walking towards the stadium ('The Float'). You will have great views of Downtown from there. Next, walk over the Helix Bridge before checking out the Sands complex. After that, continue on back to Downtown and make sure you stop at the awesome sun loungers which you will find directly at the water."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Walking around the marina gives the quintessential view of Singapore from all of the travel books and brochures. I'd recommend going in the evening when the city lights up. Standing beneath the towers of glass makes you feel quite diminutive in comparison, and the laser light show over the bay is novel and worth a look, but altogether lackluster. Check it out if you have time, but not a ""must see"" place."
,,"Orchard road, but at a different location.",3.0,,"Its "" wonderfull"" but at the end of the day its Orchard road all over again , high end shops that are good for looking at but that's it. Mastercard theatre is good for last minute theatre sjows, just buy at the door.....of course,you have limited choice of seating."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Worth a visit both day or night for the great views of the city and on a night a great free light show nice walks on the promenade and a huge modern sopping mall
,,Wonderfully spectacular,5.0,,"Great walks across the bridge, marvellous cityscapes, close access to the gardens and, by night, the Marina Bay Sands light show - cheesy but great to watch. An easy walk from the Marina retail area and a great place to be."
,,Scenic beauty,5.0,,"I liked the entire ambiance, took a boat ride to cover all areas, one can go for shopping if interested in international brands"
,,A picturesque place.,5.0,,Had the chance to visit the sights here. Beautiful bay with great views and fine eateries. Oh so clean and friendly. A must see place. And always warm but with a sea breeze.
,,Water light show was amazing !!,4.0,,"Well worth a visit in the evening! Be prepared for expensive beer! Food prices quite reasonable, although certainly not if your on a tight budget... For the shopper there are all of the high end brand stores in the shopping centres... The scenic water show is worth a watch at night!! An interesting place to people watch!! Bungee spring worth a go too!!"
,,Great light show,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore put the marina Bay Area on your list, bars and Restaurants abound, the light show which is great,draws a large crowd and. Is worthwhile for young and old. After that wander in to the casino if it is to your liking, just remember to take your passport for free entry thus saving a $100 singapore."
,,Amazing Place To Visit,4.0,,"Its the famous place to visit in Singapore... It's quite.. An impressing light show, concerts, The shopping mall and an unbelievable food court and a nice walkways all around the area. Amazing high rise buildings.."
,,ALMOST SHOT BY THE CROW CULLING MAN WITH THE GUN!!!!!,1.0,,"Marina bay itself was quite nice. We were enjoying a walk from the Marina Bay Sands hotel, around to the beautiful Merlion statue and then on to Clark Quay, when I suddenly heard a very loud gun shot close by.

I ducked, thinking it was a terrorist attack or something. Then another shot.

I looked around and noticed a man in uniform walking along towards me, holding a large two hand rifle, which was pointed at the ground.

As he walked toward me, he suddenly noticed something in the nearest tree, raised the rifle muzzle straight up past me, and shot above my head into the tree.

A big black beautiful crow fell out of the tree, which another guy picked up and put in the sack he was carrying.

I couldn't believe he was so casual about firing the gun amongst civilian people, & I was disgusted seeing him kill the beautiful birds.

I filmed him doing it, and he came over to me and said 'no camera, no camera'.

Sorry Marina Bay, but the crap score is for the crappy experience at Marina Bay on this occasion."
,,A modern marvel,5.0,,"While at the Marina Bay its difficult to ever imagine Singapore to be a fishing village. The Merlion from which the land of the Lion (Singha is lion and pur is land) is the symbol of a brave vision. Its amazing to see the laser show, the water spouting lion, the football arena overlooking the bay area and the commercial enterprises which make Singapore the top APAC business destination. COlours by the bay has some of the cleanest and yummiest street food. If the weather Gods are merciful the place has a different feel in the day and atransforms itselg to a gorgeous CBD at night. A must vist techno marvel."
,,This is the Place,4.0,,"Marina Bay is anchored to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino affectionately known as MBS. This is the place to be full of the best stores, the best restaurants, the best shows and theaters and of course the Casino. MBS casino is much more popular than Sentosa and is packed with the Asian crowd. Although the restaurants can be a bit formal at times, the food selection is always good although higher priced than other locations. The big brands are all represented and always offer you tax refund slips for your purchases."
,,Great view of Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"Was quite impressed with the bay, the view of the city and Marina Bay Sands is breathtaking. Was going to walk towards the Merlion but there were so many tourists taking photographs and we had been to see the Merlion on Sentosa Island which is much bigger. The shops at Marina Bay are very impressive (all brand named stores, Dior, Gucci etc) food court also looked good. I'd recommend visiting the bay."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Whether you are on a short visit or a long trip, this bay is a must. Not only this place is in excellent conditions all around the area, but visitors are amazed by the buildings surrounding the bay, of course including the Marina bay Sand Hotel. Make sure you primarily go for a stroll at night time."
,,Quite a beautiful view of the city from here,5.0,,"Marina Bay is the center of a lot of activities and photo ops. First of all, you have a beautiful view of the skyline. Also, the Marina Bay Sands, the Art and Science Museum, and the symbol of Singapore the Merlion spewing water into the bay which in itself is a photo opp for a lot of people. If you don't take the time to walk around Marina Bay you are really missing an important part of the city."
,,Marina Bay Cruise Centre,5.0,,"A fairly new large, spacious facility with great space able to handle our smaller Ocean Princess cruise ship along with the much larger Cunard Queen Elizabeth at the same time of debarkation. Newer equipment with very efficient and friendly operations staff. Immigration was quite quick and easy.
I don't know and never experienced the the older facility."
,,Nice walk around the marina,4.0,,Enjoyable walk around the marina taking in the sights and lots of pictures. It can get very hot so I suggest to take bottled water and sun cream. Defiantly a must do for first timers to Singapore
,,BEAUTIFUL !,4.0,,visited it at night to do some photography...I had a lovely walk by the bay...saw the Merlion...took nice pics.. It was late at night but very safe..Marina bay looks very pretty....
,,"good shops, gardens and the view from the top is great",3.0,,"It's like Vegas in some ways, too big and flashy and expensive for me but it is awesome and I can tick it off the list now!"
,,Perfect by dusk,5.0,,"We watched Marina Bay both from a Hop on, hop off bus deck and from a boat and we recommend the latter. Especially by dusk the view is very impressive, with all those sky-scrapers being illuminated. It is also interesting to walk around and see shop-windows and malls with luxurious goods, though so expensive it made us look twice at prices."
,,Amazing things to do,5.0,,"Marina Bay is not only the famous Marina Bay Sands hotel. It's quite more like the sea with an impressing light show, the shopping mall, a unbelievable food court and nice walkways all around the area."
,,Spend good time,4.0,,Although it was around 11 am in the morning and heat was unbearable - still we managed to spend about 1.5 hours at this place - taking pictures and having drinks at restaurant... Overall good experience.
,,Very edible,4.0,,Fascinating and lavish place with an excellent breakfast at reasonable price. Good start to a day in Gardens at the Bay.
,,"A moderen , very nice and inviting bay",4.0,,"Here I saw some sitting places where you can have a rest and sit down for a while, to observe afternoon/evening many young people doing sport activities and even read a book or newspaper. You can also do sport i.e. to run
The bay is situated between the very nice shopes avenue and the water. An inviting place ."
,,A fantastic skyline,5.0,,"Not sure whether it will be in the same place in a coule of years time, plenty of land reclamation and building going on."
,,Dont' miss light & sound show,5.0,,"Every evening in front of Marina Bay Shoppes, there is a light & sound show for 20 minutes. It's a very nice and free attraction. You can just sit their and relax."
,,Romantic !!,5.0,,"Worth spending 2-3 hours there and have a nice romantic time with your beloved and entire Singapore at backdrop. Visit during/after sunset for comfort/better view. P.S: gets closed at 10pm sharp, so plan accordingly."
,,"it looks so beautiful at night or even in day,",5.0,,"you can go there at noon but it is so hot, so i suggest you to go there in the evening or else at night. you can go acrross the building and see the inside of it (the hotel)"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"what a beautiful place to visit, i would recommend everyone to go, good food every where lots of things to see and do"
,,better than space travel,5.0,,"If you want to experience how someone doing space travel must surely feel, take the tour to top of Marina Sands Hotel and explore the underground shopping mall complete with canal, bridges and gondolas! Didnt have time to explore the Gardens but they look amazing from aloft. We had just flown in via Abu Dhabi and the architecture in Singapore makes UAE looks old fashioned!"
,,Stay and See The Light Show,5.0,,"A nice walk around the water and people watch, but the best is the light show at 7 and 9:30 nightly. See it from the side of the water where the hotel is on as this is the best view. Don't forget to stop and see the Merlion!"
,,Walked the entire bay - plenty to see - great place for photo's along the route!,4.0,,"Set out from the hotel (Marina Bay Sands) about 7am one week day morning with the purpose of walking the entire Marina Bay area and checking out what is there and taking pictures. I was not disappointed!!

Once you get on the bay side which is just across the street from MBS you can literally walk the entire bay in either direction and end up back where you started. Great opportunity for taking photographs on the Helix Bridge and on all sides of the bay. The downtown area is a great photograph as a skyline and of course the Marina Bay Sands. Perhaps some of the best pictures I took of MBS was across at the Merlion Park directly opposite the Marina Bay Sands but on the far side of the bay. It's a much further walk than one would think when looking at it from the hotel room. There is lots to see and do."
,,Well worth a stroll,5.0,,"This whole area is well worth walking around in the day and the evening. The light shows at night are impressive, and the view of the sunset light on the high-rise buildings across the bay is worthwhile. With all the interesting architecture around, there are plenty of photo opportunities.

,,Amazing Singapore,5.0,,"Have previously lived and worked in Singapore and now revisit most years, the Marina Bay is a great tourist walk, it's free! it's hot every day! but it's great to wonder around the bay, take photos of the evolving skyline, stop off for a rest and one of the hundreds of coffee shops/bars etc enjoy a cool rest in a shopping mall.

Some of the places you can visit include the Helix Bridge, ArtScience Museum, Shoppes at the Marina Bay, on the opposite side of the Marina Bay Sands is the Gardens by the Bay and across the Helix Bridge is the Singapore Flyer.
So this is a place you can stroll leisurely to spend a few hours or an entire day."
,,SINGAPORE WITHOUT MARINA BAY IS INCOMPLETE!,5.0,,"This is like the Central Part of a Circle, that will make it unthinkable not to visit. With the water as the focal point of the scenery, the hotels surrounding it also reminds the traveller how modern Singapore is, with a passion for preserving the nature around it. Don't miss this part!"
,,comparable to battery park,4.0,,The place reminds me of battery park in new york. You can have a view of the singapore skyline from here as well as you can view it in night in nice weather. The place is lively and a perfect hangout for young couples and family alike.

,,Great piece of urban engineering,5.0,,"This is an amazingly ambitious and successful piece of urban engineering that has completely re-oriented Singapore towards the bay. Whoever dreamed this up is a real urban visionary. Yes, it's driven by commerce and shopping. But it also provides lots of great public space as well as a fine setting for the soaring glass towers all round. It will be even better once the garden areas have matured.The best overall view we found was from the outdoor bar at Level 33. For a micro view see the vast model in the Marina Bay City Gallery."

,,One of the most impressive skylines in the world,5.0,,"Marina Bay has become the new symbol of Singapore, it is surrounded by a myriad of landmarks that just listing them will take quite some time, but a good sampling would be as follows: The Merlion Statue, The Fullerton Hotel, The Customs Building, Fullerton Bay Hotel, Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino, The Shopes at Marina Bay, The Arts and Science Museum, The Esplanade Theaters. The best way to take this all in is to walk, wear comfortable sneakers or flip flops, shorts and a t-shirt and don't forget to apply sunscreen, as you will while hour away enraptured by the amazing sights on offer, you must take photos, at least with your cellphone. Walking around the entire Marina Bay Area (it is well worth the effort) will take you between one and two hours. Granted, it is warm, but there are so many places to go and escape from the heat and sun, to get a refreshment, a meal or shop until you drop, that before you realize it a half day has gone by and you are not done seeing amazing places. If you are staying around the area, ask your hotel if they rent or loan bicycles, another great way of visiting this fantastic place. If you don't feel at all like walking or riding a bike, then at least take a river cruise that includes Marina Bay, it would be unforgivable if you did not visit this place."

,,Awesome,4.0,,"We heard so much of it that not setting foot there during our holidays, it will not be complete. It was awesome and very trendy. Definitely for those upper class. Unfortunately did not have the time to go up to the skypark. Merlion is just opposite which is walking distance. We took a bus which was just 5 mins from Bras Basah and stopped just right infront of Marina Bay. Very convenient to get there.

,,Busy place but worth a visit.,4.0,,"We walked to Marina Bay one morning from our hotel.It was hectic with tourists.The MBS Hotel is a must see it cost something like 30 Billion to build but is a spectacular sight and dominates the Marina bay skyline.

This area is well worth a visit but can get very busy and very hot so best to do it early morning or later in the day."
,,Amazing place.,4.0,,"You must visit the Marina Bay. You get a good view of the beautiful buildings of Singapore. You could easily spend a couple of hours walking around, café, restaurants and the mall. Definitely worth a visit."

There are plenty of shops and restaurants around and we could have sat all day watching the world go by. Also a great place for people watching!! Worth a visit if in Singapore.
,,View at its best !,5.0,,"The cruise along the canal is worth taking as it covers the whole marina bay and gives best shots at the buildings near the bay.

The laser show at the Marina Bay Sands is also worth watching. It happens everyday at around 8pm.

The hotels that i would suggest for you to stay so that to get an amazing view and would be nearby the happening places also are Marina Bay Sands and Mandarin Oriental."
,,Astounding.,4.0,,"We did not manage to visit the pool which is renowned for its seeming to disappear over the side of the building! At the time we visited, it was only open to residents of the hotel. But we did ascend to the top of the hotel to see the surrounding views which were spectacular.
Well worth the visit. We caught the underground train from the centre of the city, the trains are very clean and a joy to travel in."

,,Great place to hang out,5.0,,"I really like this area, it has this modern vibe but at the same time it feels peaceful and free. Superb for a jog or to just sit and watch the catamarans sail past.

Cant wait to be back!"
,,Jogging at Marina Bay Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is my home for the past 8 years of my career and young adult life. I've been to many places, attractions, and events in this lovely and clean city state. One of the best places here that I really love is taking a night jog at Marina Bay Singapore. It's in the city's CBD (central business district) surrounding the enclave of Singapore bay it's a circle route which you can start on any directions and with it you can run and marvel at the fascinating and futuristic surroundings along with other people running with you the experience is breathtaking and stress reliever. While running you can see the iconic symbol of Singapore - the Merlion, then going westerly route you will see the Esplanade (shaped like a Durian), then the famous and newly built Marina Bay Sands Casino and Resort (on top of it the grandeous Shiplike rooftop desk with an infinity pools, restaurants and bars), then going along the bay you will see the towering buildings of the different companies headquartered in Singapore, then numerous five star hotels and back to Merlion. I am blessed and happy to call Singapore my second home and running here is part of my life,"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"If you decide to stay at one of the following hotels you will have s breathtaking view which is amazing daytime and nighttime and don't forget to tell your hotel to out you on s high floor facing the marina , they will charge you more but it's worth it , highly memorable

,,"Lazer show, cool breeze, café everywhere",4.0,,"This is a great hangout spot! There are many restaurants, cafés, and ice cream parlors in sight overlooking the marina! At 8PM sharp the laser show starts for 13 minutes (don't know why 13) every night."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"If this is the Marina Bay garden light show we are talking about it is brilliant. A beautiful setting day or night. But, the light show and music are a must to see. Easily travelled to, as is all off Singapore by the underground rail system. The light show I think is 8pm 8.45pm and 9.30pm. Enjoy."
,,nice place,5.0,,"nice to have a walk around stop in China town and if you like sea food definitly shoulf tra black pepr Lobster there, nice wiev for a MBS Hotel specialy at night it is amazing"
,,Nice view,5.0,,"This place is amazing. Literaly, A M A Z I N G.
Specially at night. sometimes street musicians show performances.
By the way, lying on the sun bed near the Marina Bay Sands Shooping Center and seeing the singapore's best night view is one of the best things to do in Singapore. MUST GO."
,,Shows off singapore,5.0,,This place really shows how much work singapore does to look modern and beautiful. We had a lovely time walking around here at night. Would recommend after gardens by the bay
,,A night visit is a must,5.0,,"We visited both day and night. During the day it's great to see all the buildings, but at night when the lights are on it's even more special. An amazing place to visit and easy to reach with public transport."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Interesting story about the waterfront since it used to be underwater. Very clean, nice people and buildings all around you. Find the shade. It's very warm in the winter and unbearably humid in the summer."

We got there in the afternoon and stayed to watch the laser show from the Merloin side. Have seen better light shows however it was entertaining and we would watch it again.
We will be back!"
,,Like Jazz...,5.0,,"The boyfriend and I improvised both an afternoon and a night separately at Marina Bay, in between our visits at Gardens by the Bay. Be sure to catch a sunset to see the skyline on a sunny day. The sky turns a lovely shade of pink that slowly turns into lavenders and cyan. When you catch Marina Bay at night, the Sands Resort puts on the ""Wonderfull"" music and light show for a grand total of free. I recommend figuring out the location and time a few hours before the show starts to get a good seat. We lucked out and just happened to catch the show just as it was starting, but didn't luck out on seating. Despite being on tip-toe with craned necks, the view left us marvelling. With the work of projectors, lasers and well-timed music, the show was absolutely impeccable.

Sometimes, near the bay front, whoever manages the pier will play lovely jazz music. It's a perfect picture of what Marina Bay is like. Peaceful, calm, improvised. People simply slip off their shoes, rest on the plentiful seating and enjoy the view."
,,Best way to view Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay is beautiful. All the sights, sounds, food and drink around the Bay are what Singapore is all about. A must do. You can walk around the entire bay and I highly suggest it.

Best pictures are on the east side of the bay where the Float at Marina Bay is located."
,,Lovely view and amazing sunset if you get there on time :),4.0,,"Singapore is a concrete jungle of sort, but there are still places you can go and immense yourself and sit and watch the sunset. Just sitting by the lake is good enough for me to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. There are many things you can do, from going to the shopping center or just sitting by the lake or taking a boat ride on the lake itself. If you are in Singapore you got to visit it once at least :)"
,,Must See!,4.0,,"We toured around the Marina Bay on our first day in Singapore and thoroughly enjoyed the day. Walking around the promenade gives a fantastic view of the downtown financial district as well as the majestic Marina Bay Sand Hotel. There are plenty of attractions around the bay as well including the aforementioned hotel, the Gardens by the Bay, shopping district with many high end retailers, and other cafes."
,,Great view from roof top,4.0,,"I am really enjoy the scenic view from top of roof where I can see skylines, garden bay the bay and other neighborhood building. But I don't like the way of officers who offers us to take picture with fake Marina Bay Sand background. The price is quite expensive for only one picture, it costs 50$. The picture quality is also average."
,,Loved it,5.0,,Really nice place to walk around with great view of the marina bay resort & surrounding high street building & attractions. Must visit. Plat to reach by dawn & stay back till eve for great landscapes. the walking lawn around the lake has got few restaurants also.

,,excellent architecture,5.0,,It is one of the main attraction of the singapore. it is an awsome place. the laser show at night was fantastic. like to visit one more time ......
,,Wonderful Waterfront,5.0,,"I recommend every new visitor see the waterfront area at least once. Clearly a lot of thought went into design and development. The local amenities are first-class; from food to shopping to site-seeing. Photo opportunities abound and the nightly light show over the bay and Marina Bay Sands hotel is impressive. Get down to the bay early to get a good seat as it can get quite busy around light show times. Even better, find yourself a cozy table at one of the many waterfront restaurant patios.

The waterfront pedestrian walkways and wide plazas are perfect for rollerblading in the afternoon sun!"
,,Nearest sight seeing spot,4.0,,"This area has Marina bay sands, sky garden, super tree, marlion, F1 stadium, etc. At night, there are illumination shows at every night around 20:00."
,,Picture perfect of Singapore,5.0,,"Marina bay is like you feel in Singapore - surrounded by the skyline, bay and hotel and art buildings, it is a really nice feeling that you are in one of the world's best place. Laser shows add icing to the cake..."
,,Worth to see,5.0,,"one of the amazing places on Singapore, the view and to walk over there worth to do, you should have cup of coffee and to enjoy this charming view."
,,Must see,4.0,,Always took our visitors to MBS to the top sky deck. Better view than Singapore flyer look at the shops afterwords as something different and nice top end shops to ogle at. Wonderful piece of architecture well worth visiting.
,,A Little Bit of Everything,5.0,,"You can eat, shop, relax...a bit of everything. Some great photo opps with the Merlion and other sights. The only downside is the monument to bad taste and gaudy show, which is the ship that sits atop the three buildings."
,,Perfect getaway,4.0,,"Located within the district of Singapore, it provided an astonishing yet memorable view of Singapore through the eyes of a foreigner. During my visit here, there were many buildings and interesting architectural structures such as the Merlion statue which are worth a visit. Other than that, I also recommend coming for the National day celebration when fireworks will spread the sky with its glorious colours. This also creates a friendly atmosphere for discussions amongst friends."
,,Great Place to Hangout,5.0,,The Marina Bay area is a nice place to spend the whole day. One can even take a early morning walk/jog! There are also designer shops at the bay area where you can buy or browse. Plenty of foods too. There are nice restaurants as well as a large food court.

,,Cloudy and rain,5.0,,"went here around lunch time, weather was very on and off, had a light lunch staff and service 100% the sky bar opened up a few hours later, we had a few Singapore Slings and took in the View.

I would think better at night but still a amazing sight from so far up."
,,Aesthetic,5.0,,Its a very calm and serene spot to lay down and unwind oneself. The Merlion (Mascot of Singapore) is a grandiose and offers photo-op.
,,Worth Of visiting,4.0,,your trip to singapore is not complete if you did not visit here. But go in the evening to have spectacular view.

,,Huge,4.0,,"Three 70 storey towers are joined at the top by the model of a ship, incorporating lookouts, restaurant and bar and an incredible swimming pool high amongst the low lying clouds. Impressive place to view the amazing changes made to Singapore by the constand reclaiming of ocean for building blocks. The price to go to the stop was a bit steep."
,,Fanastic Day In Singapore,5.0,,"This is must see in Singapore. You can spend all day in these area of the city. We arrived from the Metro Train about 10AM and explore the bay area, the city, and walk to china town from here. Then we stayed until midnight to watch the news year celebration fireworks.
We meet people from many different countries from Europe, Asia, Australia, and the US.

It was a great day in Singapore."
,,Brilliant space with amazing architecture,5.0,,"We came back to Marina Bay (and also the Gardens) a number of times during our time in Singapore. You look across at some amazing architecture, much in the financial district, all of which is great by day, but really comes alive in the evening with highly creative lighting all round. Enjoy the sound/light show (for free) sitting outside the Marina Bay Shoppes looking across the Bay, with three water sprays as ""screens"" for the show. Take one of the many river trips which come into the Bay. Walk across the double-helix bridge. Apparently much of the Bay has only recently been finished. And best of all, walking around and taking it all in is free."
,,21.30 is the time to be there!,5.0,,"Amazing place to spend an evening. Posh shops if you like, or fine dining at the Marina Bay Sands. For me it was being outside under the palms and watching the (free!) 'sound and light' show. Incredible! We just kept coming back."
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"Wow, the entire skyline and fabulous views are enchanting......great places to eat. Safe, clean and on the weekends free concerts"

,,"Spend the day, and visit the pool on top",5.0,,"Beautiful twin hotels, good shopping and ice place to spend the day walking. Good food, local and otherwise."
,,Lively and Interesting,4.0,,"We visited this primarily to watch the Extreme 40s Catamaran racing, for which it is an ideal venue. It has an excellent walkway all around and some fine hotels and shopping centres available to drop into as you go. Easily accessed by bus or taxi, it provides a interesting experience of the new Singapore"
,,Beautiful at night!!,4.0,,Our group of six went to the Marina Bay one evening and took in the incredible lights as well as the light and laser show. Enjoyable to walk around and see the colourful lights on the boats and buildings. The weather is so nice that you could walk around for hours.
,,great architecture,4.0,,Lovely area to have a drink-the architecture is great. At night everything is lit up and there is a laser and light show.
,,Great skyline..,4.0,,Went there during the day and at night to check out the lights. Must say I was expecting lights on the buildings like Hong Kong so was a little disappointed. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a fantastic piece of architecture!
,,A unique experience in the world,5.0,,"amazing how the Singaporeans do it. What tremendous vision and investment in an incredible place. Sights are impressive. Options for entertainment - endless. And in the end, you can have a lovely walk or jog around this unique development"
,,Relaxing afternoon watching sailing,5.0,,"This area has lots to see, great public seating areas around the bay and many restaurants and bars. Expensive area to eat and drink but views are outstanding. We sat and drank a few beers whilst watching the extreme sailing series which took place on the water. Large shopping mall with all the designer shops you would expect to see in Singapore. Boat trips available around the marina or just walk around to see the amazing architecture."
,,"Lovely area, especially at night",5.0,,This area is great and full of free things to see and do ( as well as many you pay a fortune for !). In the evening there's a buzz of activity which increases. The light shows at Marina Bay gardens and then Marina Bay are excellent !
,,One of the best bays in the world,5.0,,"I used to live in Sydney, and I have visited Vancouver, as well as Hong Kong. I would have to say that Marina Bay definitely belongs in that list of beautiful bay areas.

I would definitely recommend taking a camera and venturing along the bay during the daytime. There are plenty of restaurants and shops and other destinations that you will encounter along the way. The cityscape is simply gorgeous, and the entire bay is set up in a manner that is easy to navigate without a map. The combination of natural (environmental) beauty and fantastic building architecture make this destination a real joy to visit, time and time again.

My advice would be to take the MRT to Marina Bay station and just go explore."
,,For an evening out,4.0,,"Marinia bay is a nice place for spending the evening. Easily reachable by MRT, it has an outdoor area with wooden steps which also serve as a seating area leading upto the waterfront. You can chill out there in the evening with friends or family and gaze at the skyscrapers across the water and the ships. Afterwards you can go windowshopping at the malls or have dinner at the restaurants in the mall"
,,Fascinating sights,4.0,,"this area of Singapore has lots to see. The architecture is varied and you get a brilliant view across the bay to the Boat building'. The Merlion is majestic as it pours gallons of water back into the water.
A definite must to put on the visit list!"
,,Singapore now with a little of Singapore back then!,4.0,,"Nearly fifty years ago I disembarked from a small sampan at Clifford Pier having come from a ship at anchor in the Eastern Roads. Clifford Pier is now a restaurant belonging to the Fullerton Hotel and the Fullerton itself was the post office from where I would send mail home to the UK. There we no skyscrapers in those days but nevertheless, it was a very busy and bewildering city. Times change and what the tourist now finds is Marina Bay, a lake surrounded by tall buildings which has been made possible by extensive land reclamation to seaward. Over the last 30 years I have watched as the bay has been transformed into what it is now and it is quite stunning. If you are passing through Singapore then Marina Bay is a must see. Look a little closer and you just might find a little bit of old Singapore. This is a city I loved back then as a fresh faced seventeen year old and I still do now as a grumpy old sailor."
,,Best views in Singapore,5.0,,Beautiful views from the Marina Bay Sands. Be prepared to spend big to eat and drink around here though! A pizza and two beers cost me around $50AU..
,,Spectacular City of Singapore,5.0,,"A very modern, spectacular harbour area to visit, much to see and do if you have the time and money, so many eateries, shops, theatre complex,views, light shows etc"
,,Lovely Walk,4.0,,Great place to walk and soak in the beautiful views. I would recommend to come here around the dusk time to get both the day and night time views. Lots of places to eat and drink on the entire waterfront and lots of places to click great pictures.
,,good,4.0,,"If you ask about marina bay,you have come to the right person! It has a picturesque walk and a fountain! Either than that,i forgot! Bye bye! KID!!!"
,,heart of singapore,3.0,,"the most famous place in singapore, i enjoy staying in this place, love to see the view, worth to visit in the evening,"
,,Picturesque walk,5.0,,"The views of modern Singapore are spectacular gone are the old bum boats which are now used as river taxi's taking tours of the Singapore river. Restaurant and bar's are situated around the water front where you can get a varied selection of local and international food dishes. Wherever you take photographs you will capture the flavour of the advancing pace of Singapore, the high raise modern architecture buildings. The famous Merlion is there protecting the Singapore river and is a place for your photo's to be taken. The statue of Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles, born on 6th July, 1781 founded the Singapore city. Statue stands on the very point, at the North Boat Quay where he first stepped after landing in this city. You will enjoy your walk and then relax at one of the bars."
,,Heart Of Singapore,5.0,,Good sight seen its a heart of Singapore many Sightseen nearby too must add your trip .....Worth to visit better to reach in Evening & stay till light on
,,nice for a walk by the water,5.0,,good to see the water and all the boats. pleasant to get away from all the shops! recommended. places to eat and drink and just close to the centre but far away in terms of space and feel.
,,Takes away tiredness and gives a mind blowing experience,5.0,,"Gardens by the bay was not only one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to, but also the free Garden Rhapsody show near the cloud forest, and low cost entry spots like flower dome, cloud forest are actually one of the best things I have experienced from the Singapore tour"
,,Grand architecture,4.0,,"We spent our time here just walking and taking in the breathtaking views and enormity of it all. The architecture really has to be seen to be believed. The shopping mall with shops, cafes and restaurants on several levels is spacious and fairly expensive. However, there is a food court area, which held most of the people, offering a variety of inexpensive food. A good 2-3 hours can be spent here."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"Beautiful, awesome and great place to enjoy times in Singapore. Got there twice. Nearby places are small Merlion and Marine Bay Sands Park. Must-Visit destination."
,,Formula 1,4.0,,Awesome to watch the F1 Grand Prix from this beautiful location. Only readily accessible if you have tickets during F1.
,,Marina Bay is amazing,5.0,,"Amazing but expensive area. I really enjoyed it, to se all the buildings and the architecture is impressive. Dont miss the Merlion, its one of Singapores landmarks :) We went up to the Marina Bay Sands observation deck and got an amazing sight over Singapore. The tickets are about S$23 for adults. We also strolled around the Marina Bay shopping mall, very luxury but to expensive. Nearby you can visit Gardens By the Bay, very beautiful especially in the night or when its dark and if you like ferris wheels you can enjoy Singapore flyer. Dont miss the light and water show, its infront of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and its for free."
,,Night time lazer show,4.0,,Fabulous place to just walk around. Must see the Merlion and watch the lazer show about 8.00pm. plenty of bars and restaurants to sort all tastes.
,,Well worth a stroll around...,4.0,,Definitely well worth a stroll around... the water and light show is worth seeing if you are in the area...
,,Good place to sit and relax,4.0,,I was there in Jan 2015 and just sit on the bench which was side by the bay. You can sit and relax and can feel breeze which give you a new freshness.
,,Must see when in the city,5.0,,Your trip in Singapore isn't complete if you don't go to Marina Bay. Take a walk in the surrounding area and have your photo taken in the Merlion Park; there's a platform to get a better view of the Merlion or Marina Bay Sands.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Marina Bay is a lovely place to walk, and there's always something going on. Have a photo at the Merlion, take a river cruise then enjoy happy hour on the boardwalk before a really cheap meal at Gluttons Bay, a small but fabulous hawker centre overlooking the Bay."
,,Spectacular Views Everywhere!,5.0,,"From all sides of the marina there are incredible views. From one side you can see the beautiful Marina Bay Sands Hotel with the 3 towers and infinity pool on top. You can distinguish palm trees around the pool if you have good eyes. ;) We had stayed there 2 years ago and enjoyed the view from the top for 3 days!
At Christmas they have floating balls in the marina and people will write wishes for the new year or whatever they want on the balls. We were able to contribute when we went into the mall off the Pan Pacific Hotel.
From the MBSH side you can see huge high rise building, some hotels, some office buildings. The view is spectacular at night when the buildings have lights on. If you want to go to the top of the MBSH, the men will need to have long pants.
There is a water and laser show at night that is not to be missed! There is no cost for this show. We went again this year.
As you walk around, there is a bridge that was covered with lights that added to the charm of the marina by reflecting into the water. The walkway goes along the water, past some colorful stands, the Singapore Opera House and to the opposite side.
The view from the opposite side is equally spectacular as the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a must see sight. There is also Merlion Park with a Singapore icon that is half-fish and half-lion. It is shooting water out into the bay and famous throughout the world. There are several eating places along the marina and one can continue along the river walk from there.
Highly recommend visiting the area even if you aren't staying there."
,,New Years Eve Spectacular,5.0,,"We planned our trip to spend New Years Eve in Singapore. Marina Bay was the place to be. The festivities began early, continuing till well past midnight. The fireworks over the water were beautiful! It was a splendid and emotional night. This night ushered in Singapore's 50th year of independence, so it was more spectacular than usual! Aside from New years, this area is beautiful. Many boat tours are available, a close up visit with Merlin, visits to the cafes of the Cay area. All in all , a low key special part of Singapore."
,,See in the evening before sun goes down,5.0,,Totally take the time to stroll along the water. Start where marina Bay is and cross the Helix Bridge over to the pavilion. You can take amazing city pics from there as the sun goes down.
,,The place to be in Singapore,5.0,,"The marina bay with the marina sands, the promenade and the shoppers at the bay is definitely one of the highlights of singapore. Especially in the evenings it becomes a new futuristic world with the colourful illuminated skyline. The light and laser-show is simply unbelievable. the combination of light and music is awesome."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,It had the classy feel. The view was breathtaking and unforgettable. A lot of people because we went on a weekend.
,,Singapore Iconic Site,5.0,,"This view is truly Singapore and defines the amazing city. To view the soccer field on the water, Merlion from a distance, the museum and Marina Bay's 5.5 billion dollar project...all in one scene..truly amazing. All views around the bay are great. A must see for the picture memory of Singapore."
,,A nice Stroll,3.0,,A nice stroll aroeund the marina bay is worthwhile for excerice but most of the bars and restaurants are very touristy hence quite expensive.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"awesum take your walking shoes, theres so much to see and so many levels of food and clothes you wont want to miss out , so take comfrtable shoes"
,,Best place to spend an evening :),5.0,,My wife and me visited this place during our tour of Singapore in January 2015. The place is ideal for spending a cool evening while walking around the bay foot paths that border it through out. Huge sky scrapers populate one side of the area while the other has a comparatively simpler yet elegant exit from the huge mall which houses the shops of big names in fashion as well as a Ferrari showroom. :) there was a surprise rain in the evening which kind of ended up taking our time there waiting for the rains to subside as we didn't carry any umbrella with us.
,,Relaxing walk with nice night view,5.0,,Walk along the Promenade at the Bay was very relaxing in the evening. Nice night view and lights show. Excellent route for jogging.
,,jaw dropping scenery and prices,4.0,,dont go without your camera the views are amazing. benched beneath outdoor solar-pannelled fans and other space aged facilities blew our minds. prices of (bland) restaurants did the same
,,"Fantastic Architecture, a nice way to spend the day",5.0,,"This a great day to spend the day. There's something to see for everyone. For shopaholics, a big shopping mall (with Venice style gondolas..), the bridge towards the marina, with a vies on the three tower hotel with a ship on top of it, is priceless. You can see the Gardens by the Bay, which I unfortunately did not visit, but it looked worthwhile to do so. We took a boat tour to Fullerton, which was nice, you get to see the modern buildings from more angels and every view is different. From Fullerton we walked to Boat Quay, where there are many restaurants to choose from right at the water edge. Nice way to have an evening meal."
,,nice for evening walk,4.0,,nice place for a walk. a lot of people jogging around. nice view on a business district. large luxury shopoping center arround.
,,On top of the world,5.0,,Take the time to visit the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel . You can see all of Singapore and beyond. If you purchase a drink in the bar you do not have to pay an entrance fee. Drinks are a bit expensive but well worth it.
,,Meh,3.0,,"I really don't get the appeal. This is like a giant shopping centre- very clinical, lots of big names, and plenty of eating places, but hardly worth the trip. There is nothing else in the area. No restaurants/cafés overlooking the water. You could be anywhere(indoors!)."
,,Lights show,5.0,,"The best light show in Singapore, without a doubt. They make Singapore brighter, happier, easier. I thought I was on holiday when I was on business."
,,tower of arts and technology,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands basically has everything that a very luxurious . It has a mall , a museum , a hotel ,and many more. Kids would love being here because you can ride a sampan ( similar to gondola ) . In the Marina Bays Sands , there is just a wonderful theatre . The Marina Bay Sands hotel is just unimaginable !89"
,,Big choice,3.0,,"To big and noisy as its next to reception. The food selection was very good and your meats were carved and if not cooked enough done more I front of you. Good salad ,fruit and deserts."
,,The rooftop Bar is awesome,5.0,,"The Sands complex at Marina Bay features a rooftop structure resembling a boat that spans all three towers - something like 50 stories high. Two bars, one restaurant, and a swimming pool with an infinity edge makes it interesting. Free to go up, beer is $20 and up but not required. Amazing views of ships waiting the world's busiest port!"
,,Must visit for Singapore,4.0,,If you visit Singapore you have to be there otherwise trip is incomplete. Couple of excellent hotels near by which are like identity of Singapore. Excellent place to be ... in evening. Do carry an umbrella as it rains anytime.
,,superb,5.0,,"excellent place to shop dine & spend quality time with the family, shopping is expensive, but you sit next to the river & enjoy the breeze & the colour of singapore."
,,Best attaraction,5.0,,"Marina Bay is amongst the main attractions in Singapore, you will see quite a lot of tourists in and around this place. The place is quite accessible via MRT (train) as well as bus. If you wish to be hear just follow the tourist map and is a very well known place."
,,A beautiful place to visit!,5.0,,"This is a very beautiful, relaxed and exciting place to visit. There are many things to do here; the shopping mall is fantastic, the food court is amazing, the skyline is magnificent. I only had a short time to visit - but enjoyed it very much. Next time I want to go up to the ""Ark"" on top of the buildings, and ride the giant ferris wheel. There were many museums and entertainment venues in this area as well."
,,Great,5.0,,"Had a wonderful time here, the atmosphere was so relaxing and amazing. Easily for us to see the greatest skyline of Singapore"
,,"Awesome views to see, great hawkers market, and an architechtural marvel.",4.0,,"This should be a must do for your trip to Singapore. High End shops, low end shops, Hawkers markets, casinos, views of the city and then out to the harbour. A must do to get an idea of how many ships Singapore really has, and how small the city is. The hawkers markets are awesome."
,,simply beautiful,4.0,,The place is really worth visiting while being in the city.there is lots to see there.You can view it at nite when its very beautifully lit.there r many resturants to cater to ones need.one can relax in peace n also enjoy a ride in the cruise.
,,great atmosphere on 31st,5.0,,"We went to one of the family friendly parties here on 31st and the entire area was crowded but magical. Nice fireworks at midnight and crowd generally wellbehaved. Even otherwise we were here for the light and sound show and it was nice, worth the wait at the Event Plaza at Shoppes Marina. Great tourist hangout with nice bars and restaurants alongside"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Beautiful place - would definitely go back ..stunning place to have a walk around the harbour/ shops on a evening and to sit and have a drink over looking the harbour looking at the skyline on a evening
,,Interesting architecture,3.0,,"This is a huge gambling casino, hotel and shopping complex. I do not make it to the roof top bar and did miss out on what must be the best views in Singapore."
,,Wonderful views over Marina,5.0,,"This area is stunning, especially when day turns to night. The lights and atmosphere are electric. A nice place to relax and take in the spectacular views with people from different nations all enjoying the superb walkways around the Marina. A fine selection of restaurants and bars where one can relax and take in the sights."
,,Great place on a clear day,4.0,,"Excellent views and lots of things to see and do, the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay, Skywalk etc etc. use the MRT to get there and allow time to go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel."
,,Picturesque,5.0,,"We went out in one of the small boats which leave fron the singapore river. I recommend doing it after dark as you are surrounded by high rise buildings, riverside cafés and lights everywhere. If you can arrange it when the light and fire show is on its a bonus. Highly recommended"
,,Good City VIew,4.0,,The place is good for an evening. Most of the photos you see when you search singapore is from this place. one side is the marina bay and other side is tall buildings and a river in between.
,,Singapore Trip,5.0,,Excellent place to visit. The Marina Bay sands hotel from the topmost viewing gallery offers excellent view of Singapore with Singapore flyer and the most of Singapore highrisers
,,Evening,5.0,,"In the evening this is a great place to be, just go out of the mall through the Louis Vuitton store and you will have an amazing view of the skyline and the music fountains!"
,,stores stores stores,5.0,,the shopping and quality of stores is really fantastic. the cafés are yummy and getting there is great using the metro system.
,,My Moments at Marina Bay,5.0,,"There was nothing to dislike in Marina Bay. At the time of my visit, there was dramatic show was held on. There was lot of crowd, even no one hurts others. Because of the cool climate and large spaces travelers enjoyed their moments. Obviously I too.
Never forget the same in my life. Especially there was light water show occurred. I was even seen that atmosphere in my life. That was really awesome. It implied a full story on the show.
And fireshow on water is the highlight thing happened. It is really lovable. Even it was a free show, it stands in my memory ever."
,,Marina Bay Sands Hotel - Hugely Overrated!,2.0,,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights on the way to Brunei.
It was a huge disappointment. The staff were unhelpful. We had club rooms that entitled us to a dedicated 'quick' check-in.
We waited in a queue in front of the desk for over an hour! During this time only three people in front of us were checked in. When we did get to the desk our luggage was taken by a porter and that was last we saw of it for around two hours. we phoned reception several times as we were waiting to change and go out. In the end one of our party went down to reception and seized the trolley with our luggage himself.
While the pool on the rooftop was certainly spectacular, we had though that it would be for the use of hotel guests but as day tickets were available for visitors it meant that it got really busy 7 sun loungers were at a premium. If you are on a quick break to a sun and sand destination you would expect this and be happy with it, but when you are paying the prices this hotel demands you would expect a bit of exclusivity and to feel a bit special!
We ate at the Coup d'Etat on the roof one evening & all agreed it was a very over priced disappointment. Including wines the bill for four of us was around £800. The food was ok but not noteworthy, the wines the same and the staff obnoxious and full of their own self importance. After that we decamped to Raffles and had a great time - that's where we will be staying in future!
When we booked out we tried to register our disappointment with the staff on the desk and they were completely uninterested."
,,Thrilled,5.0,,"I visited the Marina Bay Sans in the evening and what an experience it was. Entire Singapore can be seen from top, plus the structure is so magnificent that it will keep you thrilled. The plus point, after getting down you can collect your Photo at a very nominal price"
,,Great sights by day and night,4.0,,"We were here during the day and night to take in the backdrop of the bay and add a few photo's to our collection. It's easily accessible by metro and bus and nobody really hassled us to buy stuff, which has happened in many other Asian cities.

A great place for a walk or run, or to go on a segway tour. Ramped-up prices for a meal or drink but people will pay it for the views."
,,A lovely area with lots to do there,4.0,,"There is a casino, restaurants, and a mall to check out. Also the River cruises depart from the docks there, so that may be a good way to come and go to the area. Be sure to visit, either the bar or the observation deck at the top of the tower there for exceptional city views."
,,Way too busy and commercial,3.0,,The views at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel are astounding but if you don't like to stand in line or big crowds avoid it.
,,Amazing architecture,3.0,,"An amazing foyer and arcades under the road, and then entry to the viewing tower, worth the cost. There is also a great food court"
,,"Trendy, nice place",5.0,,"I was stay at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Also I enjoied Marina Bay. There are many shops, Gondora, Casino etc. Especially looking out Marina Bay at night, it is very beautiful."
,,"Hit the bar, skip the sky deck",5.0,,Access to the lounge and bar is free! Use your money to purchase a drink rather than access to skydeck which has worse views. Cocktails are great!
,,Anyone for a Gondola?,5.0,,"Excellently constructed shopping centre with a canal running through the centre of the mall. My grandson simply loved the gondolas, and we did indulge several time, in fact surprised they didn't make me a share holder!,

As one might expect, shopping here is a tad expensive but of course quality goods only.

Did take a sneak preview at the casino, but less than impressed as the non-smoking area seemed to be heavily ""contaminated"" from the smoking area below.

Had previously stayed at a hotel in this area (Marina Mandarin -excellent) but on this trip stayed with friends."
,,Touristy,4.0,,View. Expensive to visit the observation desk though but great view. Big shopping centre but didn't have time to shop.
,,Remarkable,5.0,,"You come here not to idolize this mega structure of marina bay sands because Marina Bay area consist of many hotels like the Ritz Carlton, Pan Pacific etc.. Do have a stroll to the Helix bridge which is connected to Marina Bay Sands Shoppee and take a river cruise to boat quay nearby. Get your bragging rights and snap away all the photos required.

,,Spectacular.,5.0,,Great place to visit when in Singapore especially at night where you can view all the Marina skyscrapers brightly lit up.
,,Visit the Singapore Flyer,4.0,,This is the Singapore version of the London Eye. We went about 5.00pm and paid our money (good discount for 60+ if you buy at the ticket office rather than off site) and walked straight on with no queuing. Great views.

,,Unbelieveable,5.0,,"Really unbelivable what has been built. Not only the building from outside, as well inside. A huge mall invites for shopping and on top of the building you have one of the best bars with Kudeta. Will come back."
,,Wow architecture,5.0,,"Fantastic architecture with great shops and restaurants. Be aware, the singapore prices are really high and shopping isn't really recommended."
,,Amazing shopping experience,4.0,,Best place to shop in singapore. Has tons of restaurants if you are tired and wanna have a bite. Views are amazing as well.
,,Steak or misteak,5.0,,No misteak here at level 33. Another fabulous meal. Not the cheapest but worth every penny. View from balcony just amazing. I just can't express my feelings about restaurant's location. Best to visit at night. Just awesome.

,,Great Location,5.0,,"Feel well area. Many people, restaurants bit expensive. Easy to access by MTR. The restaurants opposite Sands have nice seating and are cheaper. Lightshow at 8 and 9.30 pm but don't expect too much. Best time to stay there is after sunset."
,,Beautiful architecture,5.0,,I bet u ll never find a place which is so beautiful and the building so nicely architected.. Very nice new year celebration takes place in this place and i was also the one to witness as i had spent my new year eve in marina bay..
,,Great Views at the Top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel!,4.0,,"We had the view of The Gardens at the Bay from our room.
Though we arrived at 12pm, our sons didn't get into their rooms 'til almost 6pm"". Everyone tried to be helpful, but I didn't think the right hand knew what the left was doing! We had to have them in our room until theirs was ready! I don't understand why, as the room was the same number queried by us at 12pm; even though they said at the time that this wasn't their room! We had them sharing our room until theirs was available. In the meantime, we had numerous calls telling us that their room was ready, but no one seemed to have the keys, etc.

Even the supervisor agreed the service we had experienced was appalling for this type of hotel and offered us some compensation.

We stayed there for 2 nights and felt the first day was a shambles!

However, the view at the top was great! The infinity pool superb!

The restaurant was overpriced and not that great! It was very windy and towards the end of the evening, it started to rain! We found the snack bar food much nicer!

The lunch menu was very nice - but not much of it! So make sure you are not starving! ;0)

The Sky Bar was very crowded - no where just for hotel quests!

There's a gym you can use but I was too busy visiting the shops below! There's also a great food court in the basement!"
,,it is a good place to shopping,5.0,,"really nice place to shop,and some interesting places near it ,just like science art museum and so on"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Took the MRT to Marina Bay (closest is Bayfront) to enjoy a walk along the main streets. Visited Gardens by the Bay (free) and enjoyed the stunning views the city had to offer. Great way to spend the night. The Shoppes close at 11pm so plenty of time to walk through on the way home.
,,Worth the visit to see the main water feature !,4.0,,Very high street shopping experience with all the Big names. Don't think many Tripadvisor participants need to rush there to pick up a bargain. The food court has some great stalls & worth a lunch if having a look around.
,,Marina Bay City - Singapore,5.0,,"Wonderful place. Full of amazing buildings ,gardens, bridges and restaurants . Dont ´miss it. Go during the day and at night."
,,"Beautiful and captivating, this is a can't miss spot in Singapore",5.0,,"Marina Bay is particularly captivating at night, during the light show. Recommend you dine at one of the water-side restaurants and enjoy the view."

,,Singapore,5.0,,"The quality and Presentation of this complex is excellent , the neighbouring gardens , and harbour are outstanding attractions"

Marina Bay is a place for people from all walks of life to work, live, explore, exchange and entertain 24/7. There are apartments set a midst lush greenery near Singapore’s waterfront.

State-of-the-art office space and transport infrastructure provide seamless connectivity for all. It is a place with a chain of attractions and round-the-clock energy that continues during and outside office hours. There's something to do for the all, great place to unwind."
,,Wow what a beautiful place,4.0,,We watched a spectacular laser light show here. We loved the entire area with it's restaurants and atmosphere. Not to be missed when in Singapore
,,Marina Bay area ... worth a visit,4.0,,"Some misguided reviewers think that this attraction refers specifically to the Marina Bay Sands hotel/shopping complex. This is mistaken since there are separate entries for those properties. This attraction refers to the bay area.

We enjoyed walking around Marina Bay. Its a nice open area. Its well served by MRT stations. There are plenty of attractions, shopping outlets, restaurants and hotels in the bay area. There are boats frequently stopping around the bay. At night you can get a great view of all the lights. We admired the business people driving their motorised standing scooters about. That looked like a fun way to get around."
,,Great Shopping Mall and location,4.0,,Always a very clean tidy area. Great location and easy to access. Transport options are good. Prefer Marina Bay shopping mall over orchard Road Tip - allow a good amount of time for shopping
,,Shopping and Sightseeing,4.0,,"Nice area to visit for the whole day to spend shopping and sightseeing. There's something to do for the whole families, from gambling, shopping, cinema, food and beverages, and just for walking around."
,,Why all the hoopla?,2.0,,"Shops and things all very expensive, all very commercialised. We did go to the flyer which is also reviewed."
,,Fantastic Day or Night,5.0,,"The Marina Bay area in Singapore is clean, lively and always a relaxing place to visit.

There are many cafes / bars to visit, shops and attractions such as the Merlion.

Catch a river boat to add a little more magic to your visit.

A night the landscape comes to life as buildings and the whole area are lit with multitudes of coloured lights. Fantastic for memorable night time urban landscape photos."
,,"Great shopping mall, casino and garden!",4.0,,"Great shopping mall, casino and garden! Lots of variety and international designer brands. It is perfect for someone who has time on their hands and is willing to spend."
,,Different things to different people?,4.0,,"I was confused when reading the reviews as some people describe their experiences of the hotel, restaurants or the cruise terminal. This is not unusual as Marina Bay is billed as a resort. However my visit, as part of a hop on hop off boat trip, was a stroll around the area. The architecture is certainly impressive as are the city views. There is the inevitable shopping mall full of designer brands and lots of food outlets. Would have liked to see the light show but there was not enough time."
,,Pollution harms Nature,1.0,,"""Marina Bay Sands Light and Water Show"" flared gasses that cause Climate Change. This display epitomizes how we're causing mass extinction. Singapore can afford to be a leader in saving Earth from greedy materialism."
,,"New, interesting and expensive",4.0,,"Marina Bay is quite a new part of Singapore being built on the reclaimed land, filled with large amount of new buildings, shops, museums, hotels and other attractions. The architecture is new and modern, so prepare for loads of glass, steel and concrete. Fortunately you will also find some tree and grass here and there and then there are the spectacular Gardens by the Bay."
,,Spectacular views..,5.0,,"Mainly visited MBS for the skydeck views. A superfast lift took us up in no time and we were greeted by the views of the Gardens by the Bay, Flyer and of course the Merloin etc. Watched the sunset from up here and just enjoyed the views till the citylights came up. Amazing..."
,,impressive,5.0,,"This huge hotel is wow. We went up to the observation deck (23,- Singapore Dollar) and had a great view on the city."
,,Amazing during nighttime!,5.0,,"The Marina Bay is perfect during nighttime! The clean streets,light/water show and the buildings and sky scrapes around the area makes it incredible!
You can see the light/water show best from two spots, one is on the Marina Bay sands side, and the other one is at the other side (the hotel) of the bay. The water show is best to see from ""Sands"" and the lights show is in the opposite side.

/Alexander"
,,Great area in Singapore,4.0,,"The Marina Bay area is definitely worth a visit when in Singapore. From the impressive buildings/architecture to the great food and chilled out vibe, it's a pleasant area to spend quite a few hours. Of course, this is a touristic area so beware: it can get busy. And of course, since it's Singapore, nothing here is cheap..."
,,Skydeck spectactular views,3.0,,"The views good for photos and seeing the city layout and changes from previous visits. Not a lot else. Best to book for a meal through the hotel to see all the facilities, but swimming pool only available to guests."
,,The pool is to die for!,4.0,,"We were spoilt by our apartment and upgraded here for a few nights. The place truly is amazing and the infinity pool is incredible though if you are travelling on a budget, everything here is very expensive"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We loved this area. It was so nice to walk around, especially at night time. You need to visit the LV building, it floats in the water."
,,Truly spectacular!,5.0,,"We stayed for 4 nights and were treated like royalty. Make sure you get a club room which gives you access to the club are at the top. You can have breakfast, afternoon tea and canapés here which are all included in the price and there is a special VIP check in area. The building itself is incredible and the main atteaction of the infinity pool at the very top is absolutely magnificent. However, get to the pool early as it does tend to get crowded as the day goes on. Access to shopping is via an escalator from the hotel to a large shopping mall (mainly high end) and Gardens by the Bay can be accessed via a footbridge. Such a wonderful place!!!!"
,,A very pleasant afternoon,4.0,,"We have been to Singapore a few times and been to most of the attractions. This time we wandered around Marina Bay and thought it was time well spent. Great shops, food etc and a great view around the various bits of the bay."
,,Merlion,3.0,,"I honestly didn't feel so awestruck with this place; it was crowded, the food was overpriced and I didn't really see the big deal. Tourists would be happier visiting museums or maybe even the mall and other food places located in other parts of town (Chinatown and Little India)"
,,Marina Bay Sands & Singapore Flyer are the main attractions here,5.0,,"A tall and beautiful addition to SG skyline, the steady boat shaped roof top (Garden) sits beautifully on three stellar towers of MBS. Strategically located, the its visible from many parts of SG - the most impressive view to us was the view in the Night"
,,Amazing building,5.0,,Been there a few times before and still love it! Shopping caters to all sort of people! Go for a cup of tea to TWG !
,,Costly visit,3.0,,"We arrived under the impression we would be allowed to purchase tickets allowing us to travel to the top of this spectacular hotel & purchase a drink, enjoying the views. This was not to be, we found out we could purchase tickets (8 of us) and travel up to the section that was partitioned off away from the pool area, stand only as this area had no seats and pay money for this experience !!!!!
Not impressed at all, I'm afraid."
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"the Marina Bay Area is beautiful. There is something for everyone in this area. One tip I would give is...if you stay around the tourist area, food is quite expensive. There is some great food just outside these areas and reasonably priced."
,,A must see.,5.0,,This area is a must see while in Singapore. Lots of shops and eating areas. I loved the view from the top of Marina Mirage building. The view over the city was amazing. The double decker buses drop you right outside.
,,The Pride of Singapour,4.0,,"This area has undergone amazing transformation in the last 25 years with amazing feats of modern architeture, land reclamation and construction of huge gardens parks and high rises such as the Sands Hotel and Shopping complex, Modern Art Museum, beautifully appointed open spaces for public use. A definitely must see. Not too far from it, The Singapour Flyer (wheel larger than the London Eye) gives it a great air conditioned perspective, that makes it even more impressive at night."
,,Wonderful Singapore Attraction,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a wonderful place to spend the whole day...or several. The area includes Gardens by the Bay and all they have to offer, a casino, a fabulous hotel, a monstrously huge shopping complex with skating rink and canal complete with gondolas, and a wonderful night light show."
,,A sight to view. Door to heaven,4.0,,"One is on top of the world. The way this hotel has been built. 3 towers, very high and take you to near the heaven. The restaurant both open and closed at the top DA KU TA gives the panoramic view of whole Singapore. It was sunny day and sky was clear, thus view was excellent. better than from the SKYEYE."
,,A 360 o exciting view,5.0,,The place it total new .All around are places you have to walk and its the place where fireworks made night to day during New Year festival.
,,Merlion is beautiful,5.0,,"This are of Singapore is a must see and the Merlion which sprays water from its mouth into the bay and the building shaped like a hand of bananas is almost as fascinating at the building with the boat shape on top. This is a hotel and one can pay a fee to go to the top to check out the view over Singapore, breathtakingly beautiful and clear construction."
,,Great place,4.0,,A place worth going to. Plenty of things to do. Shops restaurants good views ...etc. got MRT there. And casino. Can spend all day there! Got everything you need~
,,"Wow, what a place",5.0,,"Hard to imagine who had the vision to build such a place. The Hotel (Go up to have a drink on the roof), The shops (The LV one is the best looking store I have ever seen), the size. very very flashy"
,,Ok for evening walk,3.0,,"Let's be honest, you will go there no matter what we write;) Then go there in night to enjoy the lights, night view and a walk NOT shopping or food! Prices are elevated there."
,,more shops,3.0,,"the marina bay sands hotel is here, worth a trip up the elevator to have a look from the rooftop viewing platform. if you dont have a head for heights give it a miss. there's a typical singapore shopping mall and some restaurants. the light and sound show in the evening is worth a visit."
,,Great sights,5.0,,We used the metro from our hotel and then walked back along the river which is an interesting walk with the mix of old and new. The bay is a great place to spend some time watching the boating and admiring the buildings.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"Marina Bay is situated in a developing party of Singapore and hasn't reached it's full potential yet - there's still quite a big of construction going on so feels like it's in an industrial area.

Despite that - it's starting to show some of the pizazz and glamour that will befall the area once it's complete.

The Marina Bay shopping centre is quite large and busier than expected - a unique (gimmick) feature is the indoor gondolier and water area which shoppers can enjoy (for a fee).

The outdoor area will be perfect for Singapore to host events and the floating Louis Vuitton store will be a treat for LV tragics.

For me, the highlight was the floating soccer ground - I just loved the concept of Singapore making the most of the space they have.

Across the road is the Marina Bay Sands Hotel - which I've written a separate review for (I wasn't a huge fan).

Overall though, the Marina Bay area is worth a look - if only to take a pic of the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex and relax in the air conditioned comfort of the shopping complex."
,,Top Area to visit Lots to see and Do!,4.0,,"Have been here a few times and love walking around the area. Lots of restaurants and cafes.
Merlion always looks good at night and then there's the lights and water views. I love Singapore as you can wander around and feel safe. When I first visited this area (quite a few years ago) the river boats used to be smoky and smelly but that's all gone and I must say for the better.
The whole area is a pleasure to visit!"
,,wonderful place!,5.0,,"so much to see and do here. if you take the lift up to the viewing deck of marina bay, be prepared to be harassed to buy a photo. pretty confronting. I heard the light show on the water front was spectacular, but I found it quiet dull. Worth a look but dont go out of your way. The casino itself was boring. You can't drink alcohol whilst playing, and I couldn't even find a bar or licensed area."
,,Great View,5.0,,Be sure to go up tower 3 at night to see the view. It's free to go up this tower. The view is so spectacular it almost doesn't look real.
,,Seen from river cruise,5.0,,Went around the bay on the river cruise which I recommend you do as it gives you a wonderful view of the bay and commentry on its history
,,Nice,5.0,,This place kinda reminded me of Navy pier in Chicago Illinois USA. Nice place to stop. I recomend using the Hop on Hop Off sight seeing bus.
,,Great place,4.0,,"Marina Bay is a nice to place to spend a lot of time, either shopping or eating or just enjoying the bay of Singapore. The shopping centre is rather big with most of the famous designer stores but as well stores for more regular prices. It is all rather impressive to see, and the hotel is adjacent to the mall, close by as well you have the gardens by the bay which is a must see in Singapore. Although we didn't try a boat ride in the bay, there are plenty of opportunities to do so at affordable prices. Singapore Science Museum is just next to Marina Bay - entrance fee is SD 25 for adults.
Don't miss Marina Bay, it is part of visiting Singapore"
,,Great mall to walk around,5.0,,We enjoyed the large expanse of this mall and also found there was a nice eating marketplace at the bottom floor which had great food and was reasonably priced.
,,Great place to visit at night!,5.0,,"We visited yesterday at 7pm we took a water taxi from Clarke quay to Marina Bay- we went to see the Merlion at night, was quiet busy but awesome to see at night! On our way back to the water taxi we had to wait 10 mins for boat. We were lucky that the driver wanted a quick breAk as we got to see the lights display from the back of the taxi, he was very happy to sit at the pier until the light show was nearly finished? Our daughter loved it."
,,Segway tour around Marina Bay,5.0,,"The whole family did a Segway Tour around Marina Bay. It was heaps of fun and laughter as well as being educational, the kids loved it but also took in the history of the bay. I only wished it went for 2 hours instead of 1 and gone around to the Merloin."
,,Comfortable Bay,5.0,,"Entire Marina Bay is very clean, very comfortable walking here. At night also very beautiful, you can saw the Marina Bay Sands Hotel from here."
,,Very cool,4.0,,"Great place to check out high end boutique shops
Great food at the food court - great choices and prices
Take note of the local jargon - it's ""take away""and not ""to go"" or ""take out"" if you're planning to buy food and bring it with you"
,,Great view and shopping - expensive,4.0,,"Wonderful architecture. There is a mall and casino on the lower floors. Most Luxury brands are there. The Casino is super expensive. The rooftop is the view deck. Nice view of the sea, the river, Raffles place and Gardens By the Bay. Though a bit expensive.
The roof top also has an infinity pool but could not go there as it is only for people residing in the hotel.
There is a daily laser-water-sound show in the late evening. Its free and really nice.
Finally the food court in the mall is really good as well"
,,Just a Nice View. Nothing Else !!,3.0,,"You take the elevator & reach 56th Floor from basement in less than 45 seconds & reach the terrace. What you see is CBD of singapore & driver front from top.
Nothing special & not worth 23 SGD - for anyone who have travelled & been to any high rise hotel / corporate office / etc."
,,Ultra Modern Architecture,4.0,,"Was there at night, the area can best be described as ultra modern architecture. Be sure to catch the amazing light and water show Wanderful at the mall."
,,Breathtaking = £££££,5.0,,"Amazing place with incredible views.... Be sure to take £££ with you though, its expensive and they don't miss out on anything! The Marina Sands Bay Hotel is out of this world - the pool is infinity (although you have to be staying there to actually be able to get in!) and the food and drink are well worth a try - tiger prawns and lobster are highly recommended. Couldn't recommend this highly enough - once in a lifetime!"
,,"Enjoyed, some staff were rude though",4.0,,"We were asked for ID upon entry and were accepted as we are of age. Although we got up, up top we overheard someone (head staff member) talk behind our backs. He wasn't talking in English but in mandarin or malay. Anyhow he looked at us and proceeded to talk to a bar member asking (from what I heard that was brief english) how we got up, that we weren't of age and to check our ID AGAIN!)

That they did. I was a bit offended of this. One this is a bar on one of the most iconic places in the world with one of the highest ratings going, yet you are there questioning customers paying for drinks behind their back!?

One person who was there on work experience was good though, he told us the joys of working in such a place which was a good insight.

The drinks are dear and nothing special and tables aren't available except for standing up ones and there are only a few of them.

The views are 5* apart from that it's not really worth going up."
,,amazing place,5.0,,"Marina Bay good for night time all the nights on , people running around but too expensive for me , hope there will be a day I CAN STAY THERE FOR FREE . HAHHAHAHA"
,,What an infrastructure!!!,5.0,,"Went here during xmas and experience bad weather but I took full advantage of seeing the mall. Wow, what a place. This mall is filled with designer luxury shopping. The way the rain water is used into design for the gondola ride is quite impressive. Singapore is by far one of the richest cities in Asia. They are well advanced and if you are in the area I would suggest going.
I did go up on tower 1 and got up for free but had no view bc of rain. Found a restaurant on top!- expensive but how many times ate you going to be at the Marina Bay Sands?!"
,,Excellent place,5.0,,We did a boat trip of Marina Bay. The place was very good. The announcements in the boat were very good. It's a nice way to see this area.
,,Visit at day & night and eat at the Foodcourt,4.0,,"Marina Bay is only for the rich people for shopping. As a backpacker you can only find food at the food court that's within the budget and delicious. The surroundings of Marina Bay is worth the visit. The high buildings and the Helix Bridge are beautiful in daytime, but even more nice at nighttime."
,,Breathtaking,4.0,,its such a romantic place to just laze around and do people watching specially at night. Awesome !!!
,,Must Visit Shoppers,5.0,,Good place to click fotos and doing shopping. Garden by the bay is close by and both can be planned on the same day. Its not far off from Merlion.
,,Great Views! Great Shopping!,5.0,,Some of the best shopping and restaurants I have ever seen! So many shops to see and restaurants to choose from!
,,Good scenery,4.0,,Good: It gives wonderful scenery. It serves boats going both land and water. Bad: Water was not clean. Even color was like mud. Too much tourists (almost chinese)
,,Walk. See. Explore. Enjoy!,5.0,,"We spent quite a bit of time walking around Marina Bay, both during the day hours and at night. In addition to reviewing the Ku De Ta (please see that review), in which we both ate lunch and had drinks, we explored all over the area.

Have on good walking shoes and be ready for rain, sun, humidity, and changes of weather, and it will be fantastic.

An added bonus was watching the city prepare for the 2015 New Year's celebration. The ""50"" red and white balloons in the water and all of the preparations for the celebration were great to see!"
,,Stunning view on New Years Eve,5.0,,"Went there on New year's eve. View were as usual stunning, lots of decoration for new year celebration. Crowd control was excellent. Perhaps the best place if you want to capture Singapore skyline. Convenient location near MRT stations (Marina bay and Promenade stations).
Very good place to visit with family especially for night views."
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,"We were worried that the cloudy skies will hinder the view, but the Marina Bay was beautiful regardless. You can see everything from the Singapore Flyer to the Marina Bay Sands hotel from Merlion Park. It was like a postcard!"
,,Lot of happening events at Marina Bay,5.0,,"Christmas , new year period visit here to take many nice photo.
Explore the area with appn will be good , there many hidden area that need to walk in to experience.

The events also a lot , be it music , art , performance etc.
Look out for the program on it webpage , plan and enjoy fully."
,,Show at Marina Bay was spectacular,4.0,,"We used the walkway to walk from the Gardens on the bay to Marina Bay. That in itself is a wonderful experience because you get to the city. We did this at night with our pram and three kids and managed just fine. Seeing the city at night was amazing and there were wonderful photo opportunities.

When we got to Marina bay we were just in time to watch the light and water show - and it was absolutely amazing. I think it started at 21h00 or 21h15 and the next show was scheduled to start at 11pm. This is one of the best water shows that we've ever seen. A movie is projected on the water that shoots up into the sky. It was spectacular and we were all in awe.

Definitely a must see if you are in Singapore!"
,,zoo,5.0,,an excellent and well maintained zoo in very natural environment. truly an amazing experience. the polar bear was not to be seen which was the only disappointment. the zoo authorities can make covered walkways along the complete zoo to help tourist when they get stranded in rain suddenly.
,,A stunning building in the Harbour of Singapore,4.0,,"If you have a few hours to spend a visit to the Marina Bay Hotel and Shopping complex this is a fun place to shop and to visit the Hotel Pool on the top floor, awesome view but you have to be good with heights! I personally would not suggest this visit for small children or the elderly and anyone not good with heights and the Restaurant at the top was definitely Average and not worth a stopover. On a clear day the views are stunning and although I did not stay at the Hotel, I certainly would NOT consider staying here as it,s a tourist location with thousands of visitors entering and leaving the hotel each day."
,,One of the best places of Singapore,4.0,,"You should go with day light and by night. Amazing views, you can do a great walk mixed with some shopping and other places to see, enjoy the views and the City Lion, the city's icon, and finally relax with that landscape. So cool to have such a good, clean and safe place to do some jogging with those views..."
,,What a view,5.0,,We didn't stay only visited the Ku de Ta bar on the top!! Understandably THE best view in Singapore. Take the lift straight up the 57 floors and enjoy the impressive skyline. AMAZING!

End your visit with a trip to the top of this Hotel Complex for the most amazing views of Singapore. This was by far my number one sight in the whole of Singapore ( Botanical Gardens second).
It costs about £10 / US$15 to go up but is worth much more than that.

Marina Bay is a must visit location for Singapore, as it is right near the exhibition centre, Marina Bay Sands Hotel observation deck and bayside gardens."

,,"What it Lacked in Color, It Made Up for In Technology",4.0,,"To me a review on the Marina Bay, should not be about the hotel on the bay, but of the bay itself and its surroundings. The Marina Bay is artificially produced on reclaimed land, so it is silty, brown and not very pleasing to the eye. However, the skyscrapers, Esplanade and Merlion, Historic Fullerton Hotel and the tourist boats putzing around make up for the bland looking water.

It takes about two hours to walk around the whole bay, but can be done. Take lots of water and comfy shoes, as it is hot and muggy. They are getting ready to have a huge party here for Singapore's 50th birthday party on Jan 1, 2015, so the city/country has decked out the bay with concrete walkways, music and light show venues with modern architecture in every direction.

The bay area is very different at night so go after the huge light shows on and across the bay begin after 7:30pm."
,,The view is just great!,5.0,,"The Marina Bay has one of the best night city views I´ve ever see. You can imagine the evolution of the bay just taking a walk or sitting there only to see. You can see very old buildings (particularly a very old British hotel) and just in front, in the other side of the bay, the Marina Bay Sands, one of the more futuristic design buildings."
,,FANTASTIC,5.0,,"Ow my god, it is amazing to see how modern this city is!!! EVERYDAY at night they have this amazing light and water show on the Marina Bay, i cryed .... it was really pretty!

,,Singapore marina,5.0,,This is a brillant place to go plenty to do and see shops boats and of a night there is light shows dancing water. Restaurants bars . Good night out .
,,Fantastic view and scenary,5.0,,Take a walk aound from singapore flyer and to the Fullerton Hotel and then down by the channels in the evening. It's amazing.
,,World class,5.0,,"Excellent place to bring visitors around with the hotel, malls, convention centres and next to it Gardens by the Bay. Good to walk around in the evening with the lights on especially the yearend. Satay by the Bay is also an excellent place to end the day for dinner and relax."

,,Pleasant experience,5.0,,Excellent place for a leisurely evening walk. One can admire this wonderful city just looking around at the beautiful structures around Marina Bay
,,Beautiful Location,5.0,,"We visited Marina Bay with our Son who is an Expat working in Singapore. Have to say that we were blown away with the setting and how many things there are to do. Plenty of shopping and restaurants and the views of the surrounding buildings were astonishing. There's an outdoor floating stadium, a park built on top of a building that houses a shopping mall and casino. If you get a chance, take the boat ride which goes in and out of Marina Bay that will tour you through the city. There are various stops where you can get on and off. Singapore has quite a history and seeing it by boat is very relaxing. Marina Bay itself is very large so wear comfortable shoes if you plan to walk. Overall, great place to take pictures as well as have lunch or tea."
,,Bay walk,4.0,,"Take an evening stroll all the way from the esplanade, Theatres by the Bay on to Elizabeth walk pass the merlion on to the bayfront at marina bay sands. It's well worth the views.
Brought a friend there who's an avid photographer. The night skyline is fantastic from all the different angles around the bay.

Good exercise in the cool of the evening and doesn't cost anything either."
,,Early morning walk,4.0,,Enjoyed our early morning walk. Less people. Nice place to do some jogging or walking.Place is clean and well maintained. Fresh air too.
,,Singapore icon,5.0,,"If you lived in Singapore in the 1980's what you would see was the resting place of bum boats ferrying marine supplies and perishable goods for the ships. There are no buildings - just reclaimed land. But plans were a buzzing! Result is what you see today - a beautiful bay with lighted river boats running, integrated resort, residential and commercial high rise. A new frontier of Singapore."
,,I love this place,4.0,,"During the day, once can just walk around the Mall and go window shopping. If you have some business to attend to, there is a huge convention center nearby. If one wants to gamble, there is a Casino. If you are hungry, lots of restaurants to choose from. If you want to go outdoors, you will see the beauty of Singapore from another angle. I truly recommend this place for all tourists to visit."
,,Amazing city view,5.0,,We had drinks at the top and its a must visit for anyone spending even a day in the city. Don't even get me started on the shopping. The city's cleanliness never ceases to amaze me
,,Grand looking and good for shopping,5.0,,"Was here 1 year ago and came back to visit my friends. Stumble upon the once amazing skyscraper. It still look as grand as a year ago and the number of branded tenants increased. Most of the big names are in the shopping malls and the price is decent. Bought a few Zara shirts at only SGD 200++

Also went with friends to the casino and unfortunately we all lost money. It is a shopper heaven but remember not to gamble."
,,Excellent view of the city,4.0,,The view of the skyscrapers are excellent. Also the walk and all the amenities nearby are also top-grade. Crowded though.

,,Nice view,4.0,,I visited Marina Bay as was attending a conference in the convention center.Liked the place very much and you have got good views from here especially during night time. Lot of options to walk around and plenty of shops around. Must visit for any fellow travellers.
,,Fantastic transformation of marshland just 10years ago!!,5.0,,"What Raffles imagined in 1819 has truly materialized. An entrepôt with spectacular views and lots of free public spaces from what was reclaimed marshland. Shows what urban planning, success and design can do. As a Singaporean I'm proud too : ) enjoy everybody."
,,Shopping and exploration,4.0,,"I just went on the way to the airport, i guess it is almost now a world wide tourist attraction with the Infinity pool ontop. Unfortunately we did not get to go there but we did have a good exploration of the shopping mall and majority of the food places. There is an excellent range, mostly designer (of course) but also a majority of ok prices. The food choices are almost endless with a good food hall giving you options that are world wide but there are some limitations in qualities. When we went we were also lucky enough to have the fake ice skating rink which was fun to a certain extent but not that realistic. Overall I would have liked to stay longer."
,,beautiful,3.0,,excellent architecture... tourist will be fascinated to check out the building from outside rather than going into it
,,lovely multi-function space,4.0,,"a nice place to be at where there are so many things to do.

,,A Must Do Experience,5.0,,"Marina Bay in Singapore is a huge attraction all by itself. The area is anchored by the Marina Sands Hotel of course, but the area has many other attractions, such as the Science Museum, the Gardens by The Bay, the water front etc. Easy to get to via the MRT, a couple of stops service this area. Easily spend a day looking around the shops in the Sands shopping arcade, (have plenty of cash available) and bring your camera as there are many pictures that can be taken of the iconic hotel."
,,Very nice view of high rise and the bay,5.0,,"Definitely worth a stroll (main mrt stations around this area are Bayfront, Promenade and Marina Bay) around as the area is clean and beautiful.

,,Nightime sound and light show extravaganza!,5.0,,"Lase light show that was unbelievable. It shows the progress of a young child through the ages.

,,Free night time light and sound show,5.0,,"Spectacular free 15 minute daily light and sound show commencing at 8pm and 9.30pm, with an extra show at 11pm on Friday and Saturday. The various coloured light beams appear from numerous buildings around the bay, and from some locations music is broadcast over loudspeakers. It's probably most dramatically viewed from the open air theatre near the floating sports pitch, or from one of the boats that ply the bay. Nearest MRT stations are Bayfront, Raffles Place, and Downtown."

,,Don't miss to visit this place!,5.0,,"The view is great from the Skypark, the entrance fee is reasonable, but the photo is too expensive. They should have offered other photo packages rather than just one."
,,"great view, but would have liked to be able to visit the bar",4.0,,"Great view of Singapore at sunset, would have liked to be able to go up and get a drink at the bar - but hotel guests only. You can also go to 1 Raffles Place for a even higher view and a cocktail."

There was no explanation given over the public address system and when we asked a staff member walking around we just got a shrug of the shoulders and they walked off. There were lots of family group with aged parents and very young grandchildren.
At least on the return to Singapore disembarking and finding a taxi was easy."
,,Marina Bay - NOT Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"I was reading some of the reviews here and I think many people are confused - this review is not about the hotel, rather it is about the large body of water that sits between downtown Singapore and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. That being said, I quite enjoyed the marina itself. It is a pleasant focal point of the city. There are plenty of places to walk (ie: promenades) and the open expanse of water allows for many different views of the city."
,,The new downtown!,5.0,,"Marina bay has it all:
A world class boulevard, The most iconic hotel, biggest brands for shopping (dont miss the floating louis vuitton showroom), a casino and loads of restaurants to choose from. And not to miss the nightlife with Ku de ta, Pangea and avalon. The gardens by the bay, the skywalk promenade, the laser show, the museum, cruise on the singapore river. Theres something for everybody..You could spend all your money and time here! :)"

,,Awesome view to Singapore,5.0,,Probably the best view of Singapore! It was affordable of 20 dollars per adult. We visited early on a Sunday and it was no queue.
,,What Ingenuity!,4.0,,"As much as I advocate leaving nature on its own, how the planners incorporated a small city like Singapore with nature is admirable. I did not feel suffocated and intimidated. Walking around the city felt like a walk with nature too."
,,Great View,4.0,,Make sure you get to the observation desk on the 56th floor to get a good view of Singapore from above. Just make sure you go up there on a sunny day when it's clear.
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,"All brand names in one shopping centre. Take your credit card!! And take a pic of your passport on your phone, for duty free shopping!!"

Well done!"

,,Ferry Terminal to Batam,5.0,,We travelled to Batam by Horizon Ferries leaving from Marina Bay Ferry Terminal. There is a lack of signeage directing people to the Ferry Terminal. However once we found it everything was very well organised.

,,Fantasyland for Adults,5.0,,"Amazing architecture linked to the Songapore casino and great shopping mall fronted by the gardens by the bay. A great adult playground. The ""tea tray"" structure housing reacreational pools, gardens and excellent restaurants is a must see and experience.
The gardens are a wonder. Try not to miss this part of the city."
,,Beautiful surroundings,5.0,,The marina is beautiful. Great place to take pictures however the gift store staff followed us and constantly asked what we wanted instead of allowing us to browse
,,Stunning area,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the Marina Bay part of Singapore, its quite stunning with the Marina Bay hotel dominating its skyline."

,,Bit fancy,5.0,,"Look this is a 5/5 place. no messing around. the shopping mall on ground level is ok to window shop many expansive shops. theres a few decent restaurant by famous world chefs. I recommend the pizza place. $40 a pizza. but they are amazing.

Get a taxi for about $10 from orchard road or get the MR, only a few stops from everywhere."
,,Serene and Beautiful,5.0,,"Great place to visit while in Singapore, especially at night. Sweeping views of the entire skyline by the marina, the highlights being the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, The Singapore Flyer, the Fullerton Hotel and of course the mythological Merlion!

Must visit if you are in Singapore. Plenty of Restaurants and Bars with seating by the bay, to spend some memorable time there."
,,Has everything,4.0,,"Marine Bay has everything you want, great restaurants, bars, hotels, theater and a casino. Not to mention shopping malls. It's very clean and has wonderful views. The air is also pleasant and there are many places for walking."
,,Singapore's new in place,4.0,,"Most of the activities in Singapore are now all happening in the Marina area. The broadway shows, concerts, art exhibits, laser shows, the huge Louis Vitton flagship store even the Gardens by the Bay are here. They have developed a whole area that has it all....shopping and restaurants ....high end stores or food outlets like the restaurant of Wolfgang Puck can ba sampled at the Marina Bay mall. If you prefer to try your luck at the casino...there is one here too. All under one roof."
,,Tops,5.0,,The Marina Bay shopping complex is as good as any we have ever scene. Breathtaking. And walk around to the other side and some good value restaurants and the day /night I was there there were 3 concerts and FREE and good artists.
,,the best mall in Singapore for dining,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a great place to go for dining, it simply has the best and most fine dining restauranrs which actually know how to give service in Singapore. They also have the best rooftop bar in Singapore in in Sky on 57, the restaurant is cool too but the outside bar is outstanding.

With other restaurants like DB Modern and Cut taking your breath away (as well as your wallet) combined with more casula but no less pricey cafes like TWG it's a must for those who desire the best gourmet and wines in Singapore combined with the best services (which of course you pay a premium for).

wouldn't bother with the shopping, ku de ta or the casino though....."
,,Long Queue on Taxi,3.0,,"Avoid afternoon long queue on taxi during afternoon, almost 1 hour. Food at restaurant also expensive compare to other area in Singapore. The quality and the service are poor."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Probably this is the heart of Singapore. Especially during night time view is spectacular. This place can't be missed if you are visiting Singapore.
,,How the other half live!,5.0,,"This is worth a visit. A sprawling centre with expensive shops catering to the well heeled! All the fancy brand names are found here. Window shopping is a great option! There is a nice food court for lunch, offering local specialities.
Also the location for the casino, an indoor canal, complete with gondola ride ( if you can't make it to Venice )"
,,Everything you need under one roof,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is reminiscent of the mega malls / casinos of Las Vegas.

The complex is huge with every retailer and attraction you could imagine. The layout is logical and it's easy to navigate despite the size.

MBS is the heart of Singapore. This is where locals and tourists go to shop, dine and be entertained. It's noticeably busier on weekend but never feels overcrowded except when trying to get a reservation at a restaurant on weekends!

Yes, it's commercial and there is an 'anywhere in the word' feel to it but the shipping is world class and we had some wonderful meals at the restaurants on the upper floors. Well deserved reputation as the the entertainment hub of Singapore."
,,The heart of Singapore,3.0,,Modern buildings all around the bay... Truly its the Singapore business hub. Spectacular architectural work!!!
,,Beauty,5.0,,"Charming! Beautiful! All the city lights, the feeling... Especially when there was a city run or something going around in there. Skyscrapers, shopping mall, restaurants, cafeterias, Marina Bay was full of interesting things and views. Something for everybody."
,,Well planned marina,4.0,,"Feels like these places are from simcity.well planned spaces, buildings and water bodies.its what one expects. Maybe Dubai meets and overdoes this buy u get the point.well worth the visit."
,,Excellent views at night,4.0,,"A really worthwhile place to see at night, especially if it isn't too foggy. The whole city really lights up, during the day it is a drab."
,,Marina Bay area,5.0,,"So coloutful, and notice that people now look for :
The Durian ( Espalande Theatres by the Bay)
Merlion ( the Merlion figure) reflecting SIngapore's maritime position as a port ( mermaid part -tail-fin, and shape of the figure) , and the Lion emblem (Singa).
This makes up the name for Singapore ( Singapura - meaning Lion City).
and the multi-activity Esplanade Promenade.

Lots of food, in stalls, small restaurants, and top-end Restaurants ( in the Marina Bay Sands main building area).

Do not miss the Fountains Display in front of Marina Bay Sands Building, every hour from 8pm onwards . Projections onto a fountain curtain tell the story of Singapore."
,,Really fun :),5.0,,My husband and I loved Marina Bay - so beautiful and there were so many things to do and so much to see. Highly recommened it if you have a few hours to spare - or you could stretch it out to all day.
,,Favourite place in Singapore,4.0,,"There are so many things to do in this area and it is within walking distance to other attractions as well (City Hall, Bugis/Arab St). There's of course a lot of shopping and food (Glutton's Bay is slightly more expensive than heartland hawker fare but not too bad and tastes pretty good). On evenings from Friday to Sunday there are usually free performances while the Esplanade houses acclaimed ticketed acts as well. Esplanade also houses some interesting gift shops that sell high quality souvenirs and interesting cookies with a local flavour.

On some weekend evenings, in the open area beside the MBS there are sometimes hobbyists flying planes and that was fun to see. There are of course the iconic Merlion and Fullerton Bay hotel in this area. A walk around the river may take around an hour depending on your speed and there are nice upscale dining/cafe/bars for you to chill at if you just want to spend the evening taking in the view which is rather spectacular. Most nights there's a laser light show shining from the top of the MBS and a water-light show thingy in front of MBS itself. Otherwise you could also sit along the MBS/ Esplanade and bridge near the Merlion to take in the view for free. From the bridge towards the Merlion you can walk in to a park that leads towards the old and new parliament houses and nearby there are also some memorial monuments.

The area is well connected by MRT. You can alight at Bayfront in MBS, Esplanade also has an MRT in the underground, you can walk through shopping centres from City Hall MRT or through the office buildings from Raffles Place MRT."
,,"If you have never seen Marina Bay, you haven't been to Singapore.",5.0,,"One of the best views in Singapore, particularly at night time. Go up to 57th storey of Marina Bay Sands or the Flyer to get a panoramic view of the iconic Singapore's skyline - with one side the Financial centres of Singapore and the other side the beautiful MBS, garden by the bay and Marina Barrage. On a clear day, you may even catch Batam island beyond the coastline."
,,wow.,5.0,,"amazing souvenirs, amazing view, so many pics,iconic building,shopping malls are amazing. quite expensive but good. lovely cafes there as well."
,,cool place,3.0,,it's so popular for japanese. it was great and fantastic view but pool was dirty and cold. one time enough i guess.
,,What a Space to Relax IN,5.0,,"Kites flying above and around you, never had such a relaxing moment in a long while. All these happening at a height of around five levels high and you are looking out into the Straits!"
,,Iconic landmark,5.0,,Take photo and upload it on Facebook or Twitter! That's how you deal with Singapore. This iconic landmark hotel tower just quite amazing and beautiful from a far. Unique ship attached on top of the three towers makes her considered as one of greatest architecture/ building ever in Singapore.
,,Nice place to spend an evening,4.0,,"If you are looking to spend an evening enjoying the cool breeze and the night view, this is the place to go to when in Singapore. I went there to watch the Merlion and I ended up taking a long walk all the way up to Marina Bay Sands. The place is well lit and a place where every tourist loves to visit not just due to its views but also because of the pleasant walk....evenings are always the best time to visit."

,,"It's nice.... but it still is very commercial, focused on eating and shopping",3.0,,"If that is what you are looking for, then ou will not be disappointed. But if you prefer something a little less commercial, then a walk through should suffice. Time your visit to coincide with the evening laser show, well worth the fifteen minutes of music and lights."

,,interesting place,4.0,,interesting place to visit. Many nice shops all in a mall. Nice restaurants and many branded goods to choose from
,,Visit both during the day as well as night.,5.0,,"Singapore is at its best at Marina Bay. With the many small eateries lining the bay, you can savour the many delicacies typical of Singapore. There are boat rides which are good too. These boat rides will play you a short history of the bay as they take you for a ride. Then you can stroll on your own and enjoy. In the evening the show is terrific. It is better to be near the Marina Bay sands to get a good view than from the opposite side."
,,loved it,5.0,,"Loved it around the bay, day and night is so beautiful, and always something happening. Lots of bars, restaurants and entertainment"
,,Must visit at Night,5.0,,"Go there during evening nigh ttime. There is a lightning show that start at 7.45 or close to that time...It so beautiful looking at tall giant tombs created with plants..in evening different lights are reflected to them which give them a true beauty.

,,Wow,5.0,,This was an amazing experience. The lift up to the 57 th floor took only seconds and then the view was incredible. This is definitely a must do even though I was scared of the height of this building. The shopping mall was amazing too with the absolute top end shops. A joy just to wonder through.
,,the man made gardens,4.0,,"walking around the man made gardens next to the marina bay sands hotel was beautiful especially at nite. the park lights up at nite, also the hotel had lovely food where all the staff eat I think on the bottom floor- they had everything indian, malay, thai, Japanese, chinese soups, etc
the best taste and its cheap too"

,,Marina Bay,4.0,,"Plenty to see and do in the area, don't be lazy and get the bus around, walk around the bay and take in all the sights and get an ice cream!"
,,"Beautiful setting, don't eat there though",4.0,,His is a an amazing setting but you can get much better food and drink away from the waterfront and I mean MUCH better. Definitely worth a walk along though.
,,Very Pretty at night,5.0,,"The whole place comes to life, and it is as you see in the photos of Singapore. Very easy to get to on the MRT. You can take in the sights such as the Helix Bridge and the design is based on DNA. A must see place"

,,The famous Marina bay,5.0,,Brilliant view and iconic. Dont miss it while being in Singapore. Your Singapore tour is not over without a mandatory visit!
,,Main place to see in Singapore,4.0,,"This is the attraction probably every tourist goes to. Its nice to walk once around the bay and see all the famous buildings. For food, I can recommend the best Hawker Center around Singapore 5 minutes away from teh Bay: Lau Pa Sat"
,,An excellent place to take an evening stroll.,5.0,,"This is a walk recommended for the evenings considering the sun can be harsh. Also the evening lights literally makes the place come alive. The Merlion, Fullerton hotel, Marina Float, Marina Bay all are here giving a great view . walking shoes recommended . Taking a taxi in and out from here during peak hours attracts a surcharge so be prepared."
,,A walk you must take,5.0,,"If you are a traveler this is a walk you must take. You can easily spend few hours walking around the bay. The view is very nice and you can take many good photographs be it's street, people or even some good architecture and landscape. Evening would be the best in my opinion because the sun can be very harsh during the day time. There are few places you can stop for a drink and relax"
,,A sunset cruise,3.0,,"Starting from Marina Bay we took a boat for a round trip, it was a nice leisurely ride and since it was already dusk we could sit out and watch life go by on the banks. The commentary helped understand where you were and what was the situation before. Though you can hop on hop off, we stayed put. The river was clean and there was no smell or traces of diesel on the water. It was a 55 minute ride but enjoyable with lots of photo ops.

On the banks they had bands playing at different places, so one can surely pass a lot of time out here."
,,Impressive,5.0,,I love this bay. Always happy to do some photograph during my short visit to SIngapore. :) There are more and more people visit the place and made the venue quiet crowded now.
,,day or night,4.0,,I have been to Singapore 4 times now and over the years I have watched the Marina develop more and more each time. The marina is a lovely place for a stroll in the day or evening there is a light water show in the evening. We went at sunset and went to the bar at the top of Marina Sand Bay and watched the view. Marina Sand Bay is an amazing architecture gem and worth seeing. plenty of places for food and drink round here.

,,Stunning such a lovely landscape,4.0,,"The Marina Bay has lots of iconic buildings around its shores. The buildings make for a very varied landscape. For me the most iconic is the Marina Sands which looks like it's got a ship on the roof!!

A fab way to enjoy the bay is to take a ride in the famous Bumboat."

,,Landmark of Singapore,4.0,,Nothing much to like for me personally but its overall good place for taking pics. Special crushed ice-creams @ 10$ Walked all the way to Singapore flyer from Marina bay.
,,If you have nothing to do at night. just come here,5.0,,"There are many attraction and small- small thing that will capture your eyes. TO see how the people go back from work, rush to MRT, and fill the bars near by. See the tourist take pictures like mad! Hahaha
Definitely a spot that you need to visit if you come to Singapore. If you have time go around the Marina Bay area and you will find a lot landmark within walking distance.
The perk here: you will find the famous 1$ icecream sold by old uncle(s) it is just ordinary ice cream but the atmosphere and that ice cream are perfect match. This ice cream also sold in other places like Bugis, Orchard road, etc."
,,Unbelievable particularly at night,4.0,,Walk around the area at night - you won't be disappointed. The hotels are amazing and worth having a drink in their bars!
,,Marina Bay,3.0,,"Although Marina Bay is a great shopping venue, it was same old same old, not a great difference from any other shopping venue anywhere in the world. The surrounding area is beautiful"
,,True Urban Living,5.0,,"Since Singapore cannot grow out, they develop up. Marina Bay is what urban living is all about. There is plenty of recreation for land and water. There are facilities within the Marina Bay Sand that you never have to leave the towers. Restaurants, casinos and personal services to your door. Everything is built state-of-the-art and is sustainable. An architectural wonder and designers dream."
,,Worth a quick visit,4.0,,"The Marina Bay is a nice pace to walk around. Lots of restaurants and very close to the Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino. There are sailboats, bikers, walkers, joggers. Also a good place to see the daily light show at night."
,,Night n Day,5.0,,Must walk around Marina bay by the night and day...lovely experience...a must place for ppl who want to click pics...
,,The heart of Singapore,4.0,,Catch a bumboat and be amazed by the grandure of this amazing city. A highlight is in the evenings there is a laser show over the bay from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Still it seems a peaceful spot in a vibrant city.
,,Night tour,4.0,,The night tour includes the lookout from the 57th floor and was well organised but there is a restricted area that you have access to. Overall good value and superb views
,,shopping and food trail,5.0,,casino is nice if visitor like to play their luck. lot of attractions like art museum and theater. shoppers can shop lot of branded goods
,,so beautiful,5.0,,well worth seeing. such a big scale but so worth visiting. we went on a coach trip but can easily get a taxi to here.
,,Only the best,5.0,,"If you want to visit one of the most beautiful shopping malls with the most exclusive stores and brands, this is the place to be.
Above and next to the mall there is a well designed and gorgeous promenade where one can enjoy a stroll or just sit down looking at Singapore's skyline. Also very much recommended during the evening in the dark as the promenade is well lit. It's nice to walk here by foot from the waterfront promenade, passing the beautiful theatre and Helix bridge."
,,Quite stunning at early evening,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands,The Fullerton, city skyline, the lights & laser show, and many others,stunning place to be, all set by the riverside. There were many people there, probably thousands, but never felt too busy!"
,,Must visit attraction in singapore,4.0,,"the architecture was impressive, nice urban city with nice view and cleanliness. During my visit the haze was very bad (like 100-200 meters-view-bad) so it reduced the visibility. But this area is a must visit if you came to singapore."
,,Gotta go here!,5.0,,"A huge hotel, casino and shopping mall, lots of great shops and restaurants, plenty to see and do, a must do is the laser show that is put on at night for free, it is really spectacular and not to be missed!"
,,Marina bay fountain show,4.0,,We went marina bay in day time as well as at night.. both equally feels good . Light and sound laser fountain show time 8pm 9.30pm . Friday sunday may have another extra show.. this may not be the best fountain show .. but laser show with image is something unique... and this 12-15min show I must say one of the favourite attraction.. we loved it.. get down at mrt bayfront... to reach here.
,,Great landscape,5.0,,"Cool mall, awesome LV building on the coast, very clean and variety of expensive shops to at least take a look at. Has an internal ""river"" that reminds you of Venice and it's a cool hang out. Negative: too crowded as most of attractions in Asia."
,,very fascinating,5.0,,"wow, that was something imaginary beautiful, unusual and very fascinating building. I will say i enjoyed all about what was there to be offered to the tourist. The shops were in the best possible way of things to see and bay if you want too. Also the incredibly beautiful view from the top of Marina Bay, beautiful swimming pool and the very best restraint-bar."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"A very impressive bay, especially at night. Would recommend standing under the Marina Bay Sands at 19:00 and 20:00 for the light show- also an amazing view at night looking onto the CBD."
,,Worth the Visit,5.0,,"I missed the F1 race by a few days, but walking around Marina Bay while they were still dismantling the grandstands was quite interesting. There is a wonderful contrast between the historical authenticity of colonial Raffles and the modern artificiality of the while Marina Bay complex. I was fortunate enough to catch the Friday evening light show and concert on the bay as well, which was fabulous. If you are in Singapore, you really need to make this a stop on your itinerary."
,,Land of Sky Srapers,4.0,,"Multiple point to see the city icons like Marina Bay Hotel, Marlion and business districts. Best time to visit at the time of 31st Dec night to see the fire cracker show."
,,A nice view on modern Asia,5.0,,Marina Bay has on one side the breathtaking skyline of Singapore and on the other the biggest shopping mall i've ever seen (covered in glass). Everything (!) is super clean. If you are not the type to stare amazed at skyscrapers you can either go shopping or maybe continue to the Singapore flyer and enjoy a truly amazing view from above...
,,Just a tourist attraction,3.0,,the boat like architecture on top of the tower. Too touristy for us and not worth a special visit. Walking around the public park areas of both Robertson and Clark quays is better
,,Great Place To Photograph The City,5.0,,I spent a couple of hours wandering around Marina Bay while on a transit in Singapore. This gave me all the inspiration I needed to return next year to experience the city in its fullest. The skyline is marvellous. The water is clear. The restaurants are plentiful. I can't wait to return.
,,excellent shopping,5.0,,"Last july ,i had a transit in Singapore and i visited Marina Bay Sands in Marina Bay , it's a beautiful place to visit and the shopping centre was amazing, there's a lot of stores,and there's TWG tea and food court , wonderful :)"
,,"Fork out for to go to the top, so worth it!",5.0,,"We raced to get to Marina Bay Sands for sunset after a busy day of sightseeing and activities in Singapore. We wanted to watch the sunset over the city, unfortunately it was a cloudy day so we didn't see the golden sunset we had hoped for but it was still so worth paying the money to go to the top. You are restricted to an area for non guests but you still have amazing views. When you get there for 6:45 ish you are able to get photographs of the city skyline in the day and at night, you also get to see all of the skyscrapers light up one by one. The view is beautiful and really makes you appreciate Singapore and how hard the government have worked to make it so modern, well thought out, clean and innovative. Seeing the view from the top was such a highlight and it helped us to pinpoint other areas where we wanted to visit the next day such as gardens by the bay. This is a must do if you're spending a weekend, week or longer in Singapore."
,,Being Touristy Here!,5.0,,"This is definitely the heart of Singapore. Come here at night the city is pretty much alive!

They have live performances and also plenty of activities here! The beautiful skyscrapers at night are awesome (refer images).

Do not miss this spot! Definitely worth your time here ;)"
,,Not to miss!,5.0,,The Marina Bay is indeed very beautiful especially at night. Going to the Marina Bay was my favorite thing to do when I visited Singapore since its close by many other attractions. The best way to get here is by taking the train. There's also a light show during night time.
,,Journey to three Asian Countries,5.0,,"Marina Bay was a well conceived idea which a planned of the community was displayed with High Tech command to see the many features of the community like the business & industrial sections residential section, the good landscape garden along Marina Bay and others. I am really impressed with the way the community was conceived and planned where perhaps other communities can use such planned as a model with modification supported by many creative mind of the subject community. My wife & I truly enjoyed and appreciate the displayed of variety of flowers, plants, and trees. Singapore should be proud of such developed creation.

Our impression however of Singapore in 1979 is the most cleanest country in the world but our visit last Sept. 2014 changed that impression. It became a typical city like any other cities."
,,can spend a whole day,4.0,,the shopping area n food court r good slightly expensive... the walk around the marina bay especially in the night is very romantic areas r lite up n beautiful to watch
,,Just amazing view,4.0,,"The hotel has so many activities around it and you can enjoy so much of it. There is amazing mall below, easily connected to both BTS and MRT.

Rooftop view is incredible and 8 PM show is worth watching.

On the observatory deck there are stupid glasses that make images little hazy. It's way better to sit down and take images or wait for night time so that it can block the glass out.

One of the best singapore view. There is so much to do around the hotel. Garden by the bay is right below. I wish I could have stayed in the hotel as enjoyed the infinity pool."
,,Bumboat tour,4.0,,Have never done this before on previous stop-overs and chose to do this as husband has mobility issues but not wheelchair bound. Nice and relaxing with commentary seeing the sites of the bay from the water.

,,Great View,5.0,,The cute merilion is here and across the river is the famed marina sand hotel with a boat connecting the top of three buildings. Iconic location for the trademark singapore photoshoot.
,,"Sterile, cold and uninviting",4.0,,"Singapore knows how to do clean, neat, high efficiency albeit sometimes a little too sterile. This description aptly paints Marina Bay and the complexes in the area. The shopping area is clean and neat and tidy and all that, but its a little soul-less. Its sterile to the point that I felt I was walking in a medical laboratory you see in sci-fi films. You could hear echoes - not surprisingly considering the empty space between the floor and the glass ceiling! If this is the intention, then, well - its really well done. There is also nothing much to do except shop and dine in really expensive shops and restaurants and cafes. Even the food court is rather upmarket. Oh - if you like gambling, this place is also for you of course. Personally, not my cup of tea. Changi airport feels more inviting than this place."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Nearest MRT - Bayfront
It is nice how the Marina bay has been changed with the downtown buildings, Marina Bay Sands, Arts & Science Museum, Original Merlion, Singapore Flyer and the best singapore hotels all around.
The Light show in the bay during weekends and holidays is nice to watch [Around 7:45 pm & 9:30 PM].
Nice walk on the Helix or DNA bridge.
You can take a river cruise in the bay or opt for the duck tour around the same.
Nice Shopping Mall with casino for tourists."

,,Beautiful space,4.0,,"Marina Bay is a lovely space - you wouldn't think it had been developed on reclaimed land. The broad open bay is framed by the gigantic modern Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, but the colonial style features of places such as the Fullerton Hotel and the Clifford Pier are balanced well. The effect is finished off by the wonderful Lotus inspired ArtScience Museum and the rotating Singapore Flyer wheel. There are pedestrian walkways all around, so you can do a complete circuit to see it from every perspective."

,,"Impressive buildings, expensive shopping",4.0,,"Nice area to walk around, both during the day and evening.

In the evening, walk down to Gardens by the Bay for the Garden Rhapsody light show."
,,Really beautiful at night,5.0,,"When everything is lit up at night it's like something out of futuristic movie. It's really pleasant to sit around the bay at night. There are restaurants and the night I was there, there was also a free concert. I really liked the area."

The area is especially lovely at night and there is a laser and light show from the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
,,Where's Noah's Ark?,3.0,,"My cab driver, Jeff told me this joke. Noah's Ark has been found. It's on top of Marina Bay Sands.
It's MASSIVE and you will lose yourself so don't split up. There is a little Venice here where you row a small boat with your family. Of course, it's the fantastic Casino. The laser light show was lovely. We got wet cos we were on the lower floor but it was worth it. A great family place."

,,Marina Bay is fab,5.0,,Take a walk around Marina Bay during the day and then again at night. Take in the Marina Bay Sands and take the lift to the 57th floor to see the amazing infinity pool on the roof top. BIG TIP ... The hotel is three towers ....

Some stores may give off the stand offish vibe when u walk in with just a pair of shorts and thongs on but most others were quite accomodating.
The nite light shows on the waters in front of the Marina Bay sands hotel is a must see and the canal ride in the mall is also something to try."
,,frozen beauty,4.0,,Although this place is mostly artificially created it has its own beauty in it. I would call it frozen beauty. There are lot of sophisticated restaurants and Casinos etc here. For the average traveler everything is expensive here. But its worth for the price you are paying. This place is very clean and cleanliness is the main theme in Singapore. If you are planning to travel to Singapore you must visit this place.
,,"Beautiful City, Beautiful Night View",4.0,,"If you are in Singapore then visit Marina Bay at night for beautiful view of city of lights.

Very hot at 0930 am, walked up to the coffe shop for drinks and to sit in the shade, not allowed in!! hotel guests only, (funny thing it was empty!!!!

Don't forget to pass through the Louis Vuitton shop which is architecturally impressing and go further to stop at the Art Science Museum. Really impressed by the architecture and design of buildings.
,,Interesting and Modern,5.0,,"Marina Bay is well connected via Singapore's amazing transport system. The buildings there have modern architecture like Singapore's ArtScience Museum. Though there are a lot of buildings, there are also plenty of trees that create a balance between the urban environment and nature. There are a lot of malls and a lot of eateries."

The area is has been totally renovated and the rsult is fantastic, not just the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel but the coffee shops, concet hall, helix bridge, and other places, make the whole area come alive.

,,Venice in Singapore,4.0,,"It was the very first thing I saw at the Marina Bay.

There was only one issue I did have and that was because I had a baby at the time I wasn't allowed into the casino even for a peruse. Fully understand the under 18 policy however they should make allowances as the casino is designed for tourists and have a ban in children 2-17 years of age.

Respect their laws and then continued to ""shop around"".

There are plenty of shops and stores that would place my home country to shame that I went back for a second time a few days later.

To the traveller, it is well worth a stop and peruse."
,,new and nice area,3.0,,"nice area , but restaurant in this area are too expensive , the same restaurant at clarck ques but for half of the price"
,,Two Marina boat trips!,5.0,,"Visited last August. We loved the harbour bum boat tours so much we did morning and late afternoon tours to see the skyline at its best and it was brilliant. We also walked along the front and although nowhere near as good a view as from the water, we really liked it. Visiting is an absolute must."
,,come at evening,4.0,,"Don't come before afternoon, come at evening, and wait until 9pm, You can go and wait at bay in the middle, there is a show of light and water an music. this is really cool, is you bring camera, you need find a good cornor"
,,Really great to walk around with a good food area,4.0,,"Enjoy this place for what it is, a really high end mall in a beautifull setting containing some quite good restaurants. It is worth getting your mall fix here :-) If you get the chance take a look at the Casino on the (lower ? ground floor) but do remember to take you passport as id if you are a foerigner in Singapore."
,,Nice view from the top,4.0,,It's a very nice view from the top of the viewing deck of the Marina Bay Sands. The entrance fee is worth it. Although the souvenir photo is too expensive.

,,Excellent area,4.0,,"Views across the river were great for photography! The shopping centre is quite exclusive, but not the shopping experience we needed :)"
,,A must see,4.0,,"A must-see in its genre. Great view from top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel (23 SGD), nice bay. Restaurants are expensive and not so good generally speaking, however they often offer gorgeous views of the bay. Perhaps better enjoyng a relaxing (but expensive!) beer or cocktail on the downtown side of the bay. I would recommend to visit in the evening, better temperature, and one can enjoy the water shows. The Museum of Arts and Science deserves a visit."
,,Great views of stunning architecture.,4.0,,"Seeing Marina Bay is a must if you're visiting Singapore. In the past decade the area has been filled with impressive architectural splendour. From fishing village to global financial powerhouse, Marina Bay is a testament to how far Singapore has come.

I suggest you spend an hour or two walking around Marina Bay, perhaps incorporating the inexpensive, and interesting River Boat Cruise that will also take you through Clarke / Boat Quay. You get some great views of Marina Bay Sands, The Art Science Museum, Esplanade, Barrage, and many of the beautiful old and new buildings that meld together to give the CBD its unique landscape.

Worth a visit, if only for a quick look!"

Look at is from the Marina Bay Sands side, amazing!"
,,Awesome Architecture,4.0,,"The Marina Bay has developed fabulously over the last five years. The Merlion Park and Fullerton Hotel are both close to this location. The Marina Bay Mall/Shoppes enable you to pop in for some shopping, eating or walking indoors for a break from the hot sun. The Marina Bay Shoppes is also a great vantage point to view the Wonderfull Light and Water Show. You can visit the Marina Bay, either in the day or night, but the lights make it a lovely sight at night."
,,Great place to visit n spend an evening there,4.0,,"Beautiful architect around the area, have a seat at the cafe to enjoy the bay views would be a fantastic pastime. On occasion you may find a mobile ice-cream stall selling the 'legendary ice-cream sandwich' of different favors like durian..."
,,Very neat area with a little of everything,4.0,,"This is one of my favorite areas in Singapore to visit. There is a little bit of everything here, from food, to exhibits, to parks to shopping ... all walking distance.

,,Beautiful,4.0,,One of the best architecture I've ever seen: marina bay & the shopping malls at the marina bay are both worth a visit during your stay.

,,great atmophire,5.0,,wonderful in the evening such a great choice of restaurants and bars the fountain display was superb and the relaxed safe promenades were great for all ages

The Merlion, Marina Bay Sands, the gallery, city skyline and the Singapore flyer are just some of the highlights as you walk around on this very flat easy walk. Beware of the sun, as you are exposed most of the time."
,,Surprising building,5.0,,"Impressive architecture. The backside is really surprising. And what a view....In the evening there is a lasershow, best seen from Waterfront side, near to the statue of the lion-fish fountain. Unforgettable."
,,let's see the Mirlion,4.0,,very crowed especially in the afternoon but when we close to the bay we feel windy. so we can sit and drink with great view.
,,Great Architecture with Spectacular views,5.0,,"Easily accessed by train and underground (7 stations in all) this is a place you should not miss if you are in Singapore.There are lot to see around here and the main thing is the waterfront Promenade. A walk along the promenade is a lovely experience and there are boat rides too.In the evenings there are displays of water fountains featuring lights, laser and holographic movements and the show is called 'Wonder Full' and there is no doubt that it lives up to it's name.You can best enjoy this from the top of Marina Sands hotel which has spectacular views of the entire city.

Skypark which displays great architectural skills has a number of restaurants, gardens and an infinity pool which is amazing. Connected to the hotel towers (there are 3 with 55 storeys) are Expo and Convention Centre, Shopping Mall and a Casino. A canal runs through the length of the Shopping Mall which houses Designer outlets. It is expensive here but the service is great. Even if you can't afford some of the things you love to have going in the shops is an experience itself.

All in all a nice place to have a walk around, specially when the sun is setting for the spectacular views.Try one of the restaurants and there are lot to choose from to complete the whole experience."
,,Well worth seeing,4.0,,"Shopping mall with restaurants and hotel, overlooking the water by the Gardens on the Bay. We took the water taxi across to Merlion Park."
,,Beautiful site in the evening,4.0,,"Went here with some friends who works in Singapore. They treated me and my wife dinner near this area (esplanade if I can remember the name of the area). We went there from Chinatown which our hotel was located via subway train (fare was cheap, like less than a S$). We arrived there after 15mins. took us 3 lines to get there. I can't exactly remember the colors of the lanes we used. anyway, the area is marvelous with the lighting from marina bay sands hotel and the merlion statue on the other side was breath taking. Many stalls of food is in the area, expect lost of people eating there though. but it was all worth it. I am planning to be there again and will definitely go to the merlion statue."
,,Jumpstart your Singapore trip from here,5.0,,"Liked:
Places to see all around - Marina bay sands, fullerton hotel, merlion, esplanade, promontory, flyer, gardens by the bay, marina square mall, photostops, river cruise, river taxi, fireworks on days of national events, food, etc

,,Great walking area,5.0,,This really is a must. Just stroll around the Bay. There is so much to see and do. If you get tired of walking there are plenty of bum boats or water taxis to get you around. Take drinking water with you. Walk across the Double Helix from hotels. Explore the shopping scene and grab a coffee or lunch along the way.
,,It's the kind of place where everything is big and quiet.,4.0,,"Marina Bay is one of the more business-oriented districts of Singapore, just like Raffles Place. However it has much more malls and places of interest. Everywhere, the buildings are huge, especially at the bay, where all the hotels are. The shops here tend to be much quieter and less crowded. However, you tend to get lost from one place to another as everything really looks more or less like ""that"". You'll like it if you like quietness, and if you can get your way around without getting lost, well done! Check-out Suntec City, it is huge."
,,Nice 360-degree Views,4.0,,It's a tourist's haven - Merlion to one side next to the Fullerton Hotel and right across is the famous Marina Bay Sands. The view is very scenic and nice for a late afternoon stroll.
,,Visit the food hall.,4.0,,The food hall in the shopping centre has such a great variety of international foods that taste excellent. The main shops are upmarket and very expensive. A trip to the top of Marina Sands is a must as the view is stunning and gives you a good overview of Singapore itself.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Very picturesque - great (but expensive) shopping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
,,My favourite place in Singapore,5.0,,"I loved Marona Bay more than any other place in Singapore. I guess because thats tye essence of what Singapore has to offer. With its skyscapers and river, and boats, and culture, and gardens and notoriously cosmopolitan residents.

You are losing out on something if you arent taking a promenade or a boat ride near Marina Bay in the evening. :)"
,,Rise Buffet Restaurant,5.0,,"This luxurious buffet has everything a diner would like to try.It has dishes from Asia (Japanese,Indian) as well as roasts,Italian,Malay and anything else you could think of.The desserts are to die for."
,,Great Way to Spend some Afternoon Time,5.0,,"You can see it from all around the water, but Marina Bay is a great way to spend a nice afternoon in Singapore. Walk all around it, take in the sights, eat some snacks, and enjoy the good smells and good views."
,,The views are just amazing,4.0,,Sky park is just a nice place to appreciate singapore from atop. There are some good views of the city and you can get very nice pictures. The experience is limited as soon you just don't have anything else to see. Recommended.
,,Number on in Singapore,5.0,,"Of course, if you are visiting singapore, you must go to the marina and see all the famous attractions there including the Merelion, marina bay sands hotel, flyer, helix bridge... You need to go twice at lest. In the day and night. You can try also boat trip. Every evening make sure to watch the light show."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands looks great especially at night. Awesome pool area. Huge mall. Not great food though. The whole area is great and you can stroll around in the evening..
,,Great Service,5.0,,"Getting there is a mission as each time you ask for direction from the staff you get a different direction but once you reach there it is amazing - view, food and service are just outstanding"
,,"Stunning, visit late afternoon and stay until lights come on",5.0,,"The title says it all. Lots to see here, including the Flyer and of course the huge boat shaped hotel!!! The shopping mall is huge, with huge names too....bring several credit cards as it's the more 'top end' brands :-) the food in the lower level of the mall is nice and varied so plenty for all taste buds and reasonably priced too.

We went up the Marina Bay Hotel (boat shaped hotel) to the observation deck $23 each, which is steep, but the view is stunning. Don't wait till it's dark to go up there and they do warn you that it's an open deck so you will get wet if it's raining. I was told by a local after we came down that if you ask to go up to the bar for a drink...you get the same view, but don't have to pay!!!!! Oh well...maybe next time!"
,,Good indoor hawkers area but scary internet,3.0,,"There is a wide variety of food here in the foodcourt next to the ice-skating rink. There is also free wifi you can use in the Mall. Just beware using it. When I checked my mails, just about 10 minutes after I went online with my tablet, I received a scam email saying they transferred money from my bank account at that moment! So make sure you don't make any sort of financial transactions using the free internet...and keep your email account off as well to avoid receiving such emails. Who knows what else they could do?"
,,Over rated,2.0,,Another city with big skyscrapers and buildings. I disnt find anything exciting about it. But I will admit that singapore got things organized. Rest is all hype in this tiny expensive city.
,,Good sights,4.0,,"Take an electric boat from Clarke Quay from one of the many boat vending companies, and the hour long trip along the marina, visiting the main CBD, Fullerton Hotel, Government house and ending up in from of Marina Bay Sands hotel to witness the laser show around 8pm in the evening make it good sight seeing. But don't get over excited about the laser show, its pathetic!"
,,Laser show,4.0,,I stayed to watch the laser show which was brilliant. There is also an MRT station there which is very convenient. I would definitely recommend taking a visit to Marina Bay.
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Great place. A 'must see' is Marina Bay Sands. Beautiful gardens with different themes, Architectural wonder and a Casino if you want one!"
,,Try the echoing funnel,5.0,,We went to see the light show which was a great free attraction. On the way out we saw people standing around a massive perspex funnel with water swirling through it into the river inside the mall below. If you stand on one side of the funnel and get a friend to stand on the other side (directly opposite) you can hear each other speak.

It is mainly shops shops and yes shops. Love the air-conditioning though. You walk through this area to get to the gardens.
,,Urban and tall skyscraper view,5.0,,Urban and tall skyscraper view. it was nice to walk around by the Marina bay. Perfect experience for tourist sightseeing.
,,Same as the Cloud Forest. No benches....,5.0,,Singapore should make it known that they just dont care about old people who are weak or ill. Advertise and saay that this place is not suited for the elderly.

,,AMazing view,5.0,,The Marina bay is fantastic! amazing view over the river! You have to go there when you stay at Singapore! It is obligatory!
,,Looks like a ship,4.0,,Marina Bay is famous for the Marina Bay Sands hotel which is three buildings brought together by a huge ship shaped top floor. The Marina Bay area is also home to the Gardens by the Bay. It can be accessed via the main road or by walking over the Helix bridge
,,Marilion,5.0,,"One of my favorite place to shot photo,and the Lion was amazing, n it look awesome in the night. i didnt get to go in the night but must watch"
,,The Cleanest City In the World,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our stay in Singapore, in particular Marina Bay. We did the duck boat tour that gave us tour of the surrounding area and a boat ride on the Marina including a close look at the Merlion. The sights were fantastic. We really enjoyed the gardens by the bay and the casino. The only draw back was that it cost $20 per person to view the sights from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We did not go to the lotus flower arts museum, but perhaps next time"
,,Family tour,5.0,,Best location in singapore. We can find all best attractions around marina bay. We use to go around everyday as we can get to see new things everyday.
,,Great place,4.0,,"Breathtaking views which includes the Marina Bay Sands hotel, Singapore flyer, Artscience Museum, Fullerton Hotel, Gardens by the Bay (especially at night) I suggest going there on a late afternoon, eat durian ice cream and dine at Makansutra Gluttons' Bay. And don't forget to wear good walking shoes! :)"
,,Truly spectacular,4.0,,"Clearly a Singapore icon. Great photo opportunities reasonably accessible and very modern. Maybe a little touristy at times but still great. Try catching a short boat ride around this area if you can as it is very worthwhile and can give the visitor a different perspective. Take care Singapore is always hot and humid. Food and drink in this area can be a litle pricey too. Overall, a great Singapore highlight."

,,evenings are best here.,5.0,,LIKED the options of the bars and food variety & the clean environment. Most restaurants / bars close at 10:30pm for food; drinks could be served until 11pm. Dislike: non-availability of certain beers which are better in taste than the ones offered.

,,"Worth checking out, especially at end of the day",4.0,,"We visited the Marina Bay area late in the day to meet some local friends for dinner. The MBS centre is very large and full of shops to look in. Crucially, it is very well air conditioned, so a welcome break for the kids too. There are plenty of food options.

,,Great board walk,5.0,,"Bring your camera.Great city scape and well maintained like the rest of Singapore...Got the mall, the MRT, and gardens of the bay all there aswell, easily make a day of it. Make sure to catch the free firework and laser show at 8pm!"
,,Upmarket end of town,3.0,,The shops are definitely for those who want to and can spend. Some lovely features in the mall and the lily garden outside was interesting.
,,very nice view,5.0,,"love the place, it is worth to visit place in Singapore, very convenience, easy to access, spacious. the water show was really nice."
,,Awesome Place to be,5.0,,A terrfic place in the centre of Singapore. Lots of shops resturants and I reccomend a river cruise.
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"Very nice buildings and good views ready to make awesome pictures. The shopping is cool, with some nice fountains and great stores."
,,Enjoyed the Garden On The Bay!,5.0,,"We took the subway to Marina Bay station and took a walk around the area. Very clean, safe. The shops had good value. The Garden On The Bay was a uniquely spectacular botanical exhibit. Bravo!"
,,Cool hotel with unique rooftop park!,4.0,,"Just had to check this hotel, luxury shopping complex, and casino complex because the three hotel towers are joined on the very top floor by a park like structure with pool, plantings and a bar that stretches across the whole span. You can go to the top for free if you spend some time at the bar (obviously not cheap, but no more than buying tickets to the observation deck) and have a drink and hors d'oeuvres. You get a fantastic view even though you can't go on the observation deck. The pool and park area are for hotel guests only."
,,amazing,5.0,,please don't miss. we can find all kinds of plants & flower in one roof.The waterfall is so good.lots of varieties of cactus.Unbelievable how beg trees have grown under he roof.
,,Amazing for shopping,4.0,,Marina bay sands and the shops are fantastic. Never have I seen so many luxury brands crammed into one place. Must see if you've got a big budget for shopping
,,"Yes, it's pricey",5.0,,"but WOW, what views from the Sky Park! And the architecture is stunning. This may be a Dubai-esque buiding, but it is an iconic addition to the Singapore skyline, a la the Sydney Opera House. I do not think I would want to stay at this hotel - it is too big (2800 rooms) but it is worth a visit. The attached mall is immense and full of expensive shops. The food court is depressingly similar to food courts around the world, but there are good restaurants to choose from."
,,A Must when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"Go to the Sky gardens on the 54th floor of the hotel (the one that looks like a boat in the sky ) then stroll the Mall, at 8pm see the light show but before you do all that visit the enclosed botanical gardens you will have a brilliant day"
,,thrilling,4.0,,"Lovely, lively and fun place. Great experience- a must do while in Singapore. Interesting views and very picturesque"
,,marja63,4.0,,"The city looks wonderful at evening and night.
And the show by the river Marina Bay Sands is really something to see during evening.
There were also really great exhibitions of dinosauros and Annie Lebovits`s photographs at the nearest museum.
Museum itself is really beutiful building."
,,Go on Saturday evening until August 2104,4.0,,"A mentioned in most other reviews, this is a very attractive part of Singapore. To make your visit even better in the next couple of weeks, go on Saturday night to see rehearsals for Singapore National Day on 9 Aug. The main fireworks happen at 8pm, but there are plenty of smaller bursts at the back of the stage leading up to that.
There are also flypasts and displays by the water police to fill in the gaps.
The boardwalk at Marina Sands is a good spot to view the fireworks with the city lights as a backdrop. Get there by about 7.30 and watch the city lights come on as it gets dark.
After the fireworks, go and watch the light and water show."
,,Awesome View,4.0,,Marina Bay in itself is a place you could easily spend all day if you love shopping at high end shops. It is worth the trip to the top to get an amazing view of Singapore although your access is restricted to the northern end. At night you can get into other bars at the top but this is quite pricey
,,Nice views but $$,4.0,,Paid around S$23 for the Skypark admission. But they only let you up to the east edge of the top floor of the hotel. Don't go if you're wanting to experience the infinity pool or the whole circumference of the rooftop floor.
,,Getting ready for National Day - 9th August,4.0,,"The harbor and surrounding areas are gearing up for their National Day and as a result practicing of music, lighting, bands, fireworks etc are being held everywhere around the bay. So even though we won't be here we have had a bird's eye view of what it will be like."
,,Wonderful Sight by Night,5.0,,Must visit if in Singapore. Spurlge in execllent options of shopping offring all World Calss Brands.Family will be delighted to visit. Breathtaking view in night from the Top.......Incredidble
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,One of my favourite places I've ever been to! Would love to live here one day! Architecture is amazing and the shopping centre here is unbelievable! A must see in Singapore!
,,"Must go up to see the views, but pick your times and options",4.0,,"Marina Bay is a must see as you can see the whole of Singapore.

You have a few options:
1. You can pay S$ 23 to go up skypark, and will be on the furthest perimeter (but close at 23:00) except for hotel guests and people at bar and restaurant
2. You can go up the sky lounge, there is a standing bar and you still enjoy the great view (most drinks are S$ 23 as well), so you choose between the direct perimeter view or a nice drink
3. You can go to Ku De Ta, the restaurant, we decide that 10:15 is too late to wait and went to the bar, but stayed way beyond 11:00 (so should have made the option)

We also encountered a huge queue first night (Friday) at 22:30, but relatively no queue at 21:30 on Saturday, so something to take into account when to attend."
,,Not worth the price to access skypark,3.0,,"This place is a maze, and the $23 ticket does not allow you to even see the infinity pool. Marina Bay Sands is cool, but not really if you've been to Vegas."
,,A must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a must see when you go to Singapore. Best way to enjoy the place is to walk around it. From Shoppes at Marina Bay to the hotel at the back then to Gardens By The Bay, Best to visit Marina Bay in the morning for the sunrise."
,,Boat,5.0,,"Love the building, as soon as I saw it I fell in love to it. I regret because didn't have time to see the inside the building or eat in one of the restaurant inside or went to the top deck were you are able to see the whole Marina Ba. Overall is my favourite attraction."
,,"Nice place to shop, sight see, and eat",4.0,,"After a walk around the gardens by the bay I stopped in the mall for some lunch and shopping. I was able to catch a ride up to the 58th floor and take some nice pictures from the roof. It was excellent. Interesting was the indoor river is used for fire protection if needed. Anyway it was a modern mall, prices a bit high but most are in Singapore. Overall great experience."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Went up to the viewing deck on Sands Skypark which although not cheap to do was a great experience as the views are amazing and its a real landmark. The shopping Mall at the bottom has just about every designer store you can think of and more...Steer clear!!
,,Sightseeing and Shopping,4.0,,"A good area for snapping pics and shopping. There's esplande, the merlion, the marina bay sands to take a picture of.. or to selfie :P"
,,"Shop, Shop, Shop",5.0,,"Spoilt for chose if you have a hefty budget, lots of designer stores. There is also a big selection of restaurants to suit every budget."

,,Beautiful Bay,5.0,,"Go to the bay area at night, it is worth to pay for several visits. How ever the water show in front of Bay sands was not a funny show, you can skip it if you don't have tons of time."
,,Excellent night experience,5.0,,"Walking around Marina Bay at night is a really magical experience. There are many and varied experiences eveywhere, from glitzy hotels to ordinary food markets. The vistas are wonderful."
,,So much to see,5.0,,Every day is a beautiful day in Singapore - walk around a while! But remember it's extremely hot so take some water. You can walk around Marina Bay for hours - make sure to hit up the shopping center in the convention center.
,,Lovely walk,5.0,,We started at the flyer then walked over helix bridge and visited the skylark and then walked all around the marina to the merlion park. Then we walked across the road to the esplanade and back around again to the skylark to see the light show at night. Big day but great doablewalk. The family loved it it was their estuary in singapore
,,beautiful at night,5.0,,"Known from postcards, this place should be visited. I recommend the bar up on One Altitude (right by Raffles Place); great view over the bay (especially at night, of course)."
,,Fancy,5.0,,"One of the largest and fanciest complexes I've ever been to. The shopping mall contains loads of fashion stores, as to be expected. Loads of other activites to do also.Really nice place to spend a day in."
,,Night Laser show,5.0,,We took a bum boat from Clarke Quay and travelled to the new Marina Bay Hotel. Not long after the laser show began and it was excellent. The whole trip lasted about 2 hours and the charge was well worth it.

,,Majestic stroll and photos.,5.0,,"When I lived in S'pore, I used to go for a stroll around Marina Bay and make some photos. The area is full of beautifull buildings and even on a cloudy day, you can still make amaizing photos. There are lots of eateries in the area, also plenty of shade and sitting."
,,Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,My family and I really enjoyed this area. The light and sound show in the evening was a highlight and must see. Transport was easy and shops and eateries plentiful.
,,a day in marina bay,4.0,,"IThe whole area is just great, caught the MRT to the Marina, all without any hassle,What a great system they have operating for ease of travelI wandered around the shops and found some great gifts, Enjoyed lunch and then wrnt back on the train...Great outing"
,,Fantastic at night,5.0,,At night Marina bay really comes to life. They have a water and laser light show that is spectacular but make sure you are right in front of it to get the whole show. You can walk around here late at night and feel absolutely safe. Somewhere I would definitely visit again
,,nice place for a stroll,4.0,,"We took the wrong exit from Marina bay sands shops and found ourselves in front of Marina bay. Looking from Marina bay sands side you can see the famous icon of the lion. We took the stroll along side the bay to reach the other side, there you can get a magnificint view of the the new singapore icon, the marina bay sands.
I would recomend this to those visiting Singapore."
,,The Marina Bay,5.0,,"What can I say!!!! What an amazing place! It housing many places to eat or shop and if you get tired of that you can go outside and sit right by the water and take it all in. Singapore is one of the best places I've ever been, It's a must!!"
,,Get off Orchard Road for a while,4.0,,"There's plenty to see, do and buy, but watch for the crowds at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Casino complex. Love the Artscience museum, too."
,,Great walks.,5.0,,"Plenty to do and see, will take you the whole day to see everything, a must at night, with the lazer show from the Marina sands hotel at 9.30pm."
,,Then and now!,5.0,,"Considering what this place looked like 20 years ago, the planning and implementation in Singapore is exemplary and nature is a very good partner in all that. and they have a very good reason.Sure they have draconian rules, but what a relief to experience a city without graffiti and rubbish. Equally good to see people being proud of their city"
,,Awesome shopping and views,5.0,,"The view from the top is worth it, and the shopping is fantastic. Do not miss the food court. Unbelievable. The floating LV shop is a must too!"
,,What a ship,4.0,,"We went to Marina Bay to take a trip up to the top of the Marina Bay Sands. Being 57 floors up, at sunset is breathtaking, you can get up there early as we did and just buy a drink at the bar but I must say it will cost you a penny or two, we bought a beer each which cost $46.00 needless to say we drank slowly, but it is apparently the same cost if you wish to take a stroll around on the 56th floor and they will take a photo of you which you can purchase but honestly a selfie and a beer is all you need and the photos and memories. Glad we did it but unless we win the lottery I dont think we would do it again."
,,Massive and Awesome,5.0,,"Building into reclaimed land is a feat and the gout that constructed Marina Bay have designed a beautiful area that looks more and more incredible no matter which angle you view from.
Start with the Merlion and finish on top of the Marina Bay Sands... breathtaking!"
,,Visited Marina Bay Sands and Marina Bay area,5.0,,"Watch the laser show at Marina Bay Sands, free!
15 minutes, the laser will light up the sky. The water show too (8pm and 9:30pm - may change accordingly)!
Tried the chicken laksa at basement food court for S$8.50 for supper at 11pm. Then took MRT from Marina Bay MRT back to Orchard MRT directly. You could also walk to Gardens by the Bay, it is linked. Totally worth it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We walked her from the clarke quay round to the sinagpore flier and glad we did, it was fantastic and our last day we took the boat cruise, an amazing place"
,,lots of selfies here,5.0,,"Once you arrive here, you just want to stand/lounge around and soak up the atmosphere for a while, whether it's admiring the surrounding looming architecture, people watching, jogging, or taking tons of selfies. This place is accessible to an infinite number of possible attractions, whether in the daytime or at night."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. Spaceship like structure floating over the buildings, which is actually a roof top garden! We didn't actually go to the top, but wandered through the Marina bay complex and had dinner there. Note: if you want to wander through the casino you need to show your passport. We were surprised at this and didn't have ours with us. Apparently locals have to pay an entrance fee - they try to limit locals visits as they have a tendency to get hooked...Marina bay is a great place to visit when in Singapore."
,,A must see,5.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without seeing Marina Bay, it is surrounded by iconic buildings, hotels, towering office blocks and if you do not want to walk your way around take one on the many boat trips. We decided on our last day to take a boat trip 22 SGD per adult (40 mins no getting off), alternatively for 30 SGD (get on and off at various popular spots). You can only pay by cash for either trip. We saw the laser show which starts at 8pm, this was not great but it is free!"
,,Something different,3.0,,Great to go and have a look. Very over priced however enjoyed the views. Nice place to go to kill time. I probably wouldn't go there again unless needed.
,,The Best at a super high price,3.0,,"Marina Bay is a really nice place to visit. Here you can see the best view of the city skyline however the prices of the shops here are only for the super rich as every thing is over priced just because of the area.
The best part about the Marina Bay is the Stunning Views of the City from the Promenade"
,,Excellent..better than Dubai Marina,5.0,,Awesome place...If you have time opt for a boat ride at night would cost you around 22 SGD for 1..Child below 3 years free..The ride will cover the entire river and it looks amazing at night....
,,Good views from the Esplanade,3.0,,"Take the time to walk all the way around Marina Bay, best in the early morning or late afternoon / evening. Sok in the views from the various vantage points. If that's not enough then go for one of the river taxis."
,,happening place,5.0,,"As such the whole of Singapore is hot and happening but Marina Bay stands out :) and tall!

Because of its Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Marina Bay Water and Light fountain show which i truly loved. Watching the 9:30 pm show was a pleasure.

I would recommend fellow tourists to reach 15 min early for the show as the best way to watch is by standing at the very front"
,,If you don't take it too serious - Marina Bay is what singapore has to offer -in modern lifestyle and buildings.,4.0,,"Take it as it is. For what it is: a big show of abilities (financial, architectural and technical) if you don't expect anything else -then its a wonderful commercial Center. !"
,,This is Singapore,3.0,,"Marina bay is a place that will remind you that you're in Singapore. If it's your first time in SG, then you have to come. Cool area with many attractions in walking distance. Perfect to walk around at night but it's kinda too hot during the day."
,,Really breathtaking,4.0,,The marina Bay Area is really cool with loads of places to visit and relax. We really liked it at night time and was the best view.
,,A must visit in Singapore!,5.0,,We loved this area. Some of the attractions in the area are: Gardens by the Bay Marina Bay City Gallery Waterfront Promenade What we enjoyed most were the night time views of Singapore from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Absolutely superb.
,,The best place in Asia!,5.0,,"Nothing to dislike from this amazing place, is a must if you around Singapore - we were there for transit for 11 hrs and we done so much :-) Love this place!"
,,OK if you like modern,3.0,,"I think this used to be the World trade centre where you catch a chair lift to Sentosa.

I'm not a real fan of Singapore with it's grey skies and oppressive humidity. It tends to be a concrete jungle. There is a lot of shops but one doesn't save much now compared to Aussie prices. It used to be great for shopping many years ago.

The best place to eat and see is Stuart docks where the river comes in and the Lion of Singapore stands guard. Lots of small, inexpensive eateries line the river banks"
,,my favorite spot,5.0,,"Singapore's trademark attraction where Merlion is. I am still amazed by the Wonder Full Light Show which is pretty similar with Sentosa's Songs of the Sea, but Marina Bay's show is free, every 30minutes from 8pm that showcases Singapore's history. Leisurely stroll with enjoyable CBD view of busy Singapore by the bay (visited March 2011)."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Fantastic area with several amenities in close proximity to each other,the mall is huge(and beautiful!) and you can spend hours just wandering around browsing etc. The complex has 2 MRT stations,Marina Bay and Bayfront so is easily accessible also . . ."
,,"Awesome, love this place",5.0,,"Absolutely amazing area. Great atmosphere, fantastic, must see whilst in Singapore. such a wide variety of things to see and do. Appeals to a variety of ages. Very easy to get to and many things to occupy you for quite a few hours."
,,Nice Water Show,4.0,,Great show with lights and water jets every evening in the bay. Some nice bars for a drink or snack. The shopping centre is worth a visit to see the indoor waterway Venetian style!
,,incredible views. fancy mall,5.0,,is probably the best place in singapour. theres a river inside the mall! lots of sushi and nice water show at night
,,Must see,5.0,,"The whole area is just a delight to look at, we went both in the daytime and evening, make sure you have comfortable shoes for all the walking!"
,,The shoping centre is a must see.,4.0,,Great to see the hotel site but the shopping centre was quite amazing. An ice rink and the Venetian Canals are just 2 of the attractions.
,,One of the best location in Singapore,4.0,,One of the best location in Singapore. It would great If you get a chance to visit it both day and night time because the ambiance is very much different.
,,nice to travel to by ferry at night,3.0,,worth travelling up lifts to ku de ta restaurant to see the view but you can also get this view from the singapore flyer
,,Great of a night,5.0,,Lovely place to eat drink or even just walk / a little hot in day at times so evening walk is better. Lots of bars and places to eat can be a little pricey
,,so expensive,2.0,,Very expensive place with ugly buildings. I would rather go to China town and the Muslim area. More real.
,,Dazzling,4.0,,Evenings at marina bay is just awesome. Entire singapore seems to dazzle and lite up in this area. Light and sound show a great event.
,,Great Location,4.0,,"Marina Bay is known as the Singapore's Central Business District. But there are so many attraction there.

,,Good,4.0,,nice place good place great place scenic place beautiful place cool place chill place expensive place
,,very nice,5.0,,we went to the marina bay observatory in the evening. just at sunset and before rains were going to start. dark sky and heavy wind was amazing with the view of singapore
,,just walk around,4.0,,"It is a fair walk but you see and experience more including the Merlion. If you want go to Clarke Quay and take a ""bum boat"" as this will also take you around the Marina and Singapore River but you get to see the show from the water and you can\t get off. This is also a good experience."
,,Beautiful Views,5.0,,"It was overcast, then rainy but the views were incredible. Great spot to walk through and take photos. Visit Merilion on the backside (across the bay). Would definitely recommend for anyone going to Singapore."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,Wow!! A must see when visiting Singapore. Plan to spend a few hours to truly enjoy this beautiful architectural works. There can be large crowds visiting but it was worth the time to see it. From the Ku De Ta resturant in the evening the view was awesome; the food was excellent with very attentative staffing. The visit was awesome!!
,,Easy walk,4.0,,This is the trademark area of Singapore. It is easy to walk all the way round the Marina in less than an hour and well worth it.
,,Futuristic magnetic and magnificent night beauty!,5.0,,"We are so happy we went at night when all of the lights came on and you could see the vastness, detail and intense planning architecture and artistry that went into the designs of this beautiful city landscape! Clean serene and breathtaking! Never seen anything like it before! First class!"
,,WOW,5.0,,"Everywhere you go in Singapore you can see in the distance three towers with a ship on top.. it turns out its a hotel, but you can pay to go up to part of the ship.. the bit that juts out into the open air. Brilliant views, a must to visit."
,,science fiction today,4.0,,"Despite that lack of peace, due to the many constructions being build all around the area, it's one of the places on earth where science fiction meets today."
,,Magical at night,5.0,,"The Bay is very beautiful and at night just comes alive, what with all the lights and we were lucky enough to experience a laser show off the Marina Bay Sands building and the ferries crossing the bay."
,,Mega city action!,5.0,,"If you like a well laid out city, this place is for you. It has great architectural design, and is the perfect place to go for a stroll or take your honey :-)"
,,Pleasant stroll,3.0,,"The architecture surrounding the marina is very nice and the views are pretty. It makes a pleasant place to stroll, but it doesn't really have much to do unless you go to the Marina Sands Hotel and spend a fortune. It is quite a small area and abuts the Colonial District and Chinatown/CBD. It is a nice area, but I can't get carried away by it."
,,Don't pay $23 to go up to viewing deck of casino,5.0,,"Instead, buy a $16 beer (or cheaper soft drink) in the lounge on pool deck. Only guests allowed on pool deck, except for in the lounge bar which is open to public. Not only is it overlooking the city and parks etc, but also the magnificent architectural beauty that is the pool hanging between the towers. Wouldn't see the pool from observation deck."
,,Great clean place for entertainment!,5.0,,"This Marina is a great place to go for entertainment. It's safe and clean. Restaurants are all lined up along the Marina with a mall shopping plaza inside. There are people out jogging, families out with kids. There are also these neat play areas that have physics like experiments for children to learn. The food around there area is great too. Beautiful view of the downtown area across the water, which casts a mirror reflection day and even more so at night. There is a huge stage with live performances and music. If you're in Singapore, you should at least get out and take a walk around this place."
,,Go there at night!,5.0,,"Walk the Marina Bay during night (after sun is down) and you will appreciate it so much more. I have walked it during day time and night time, and night is so much better. With all the different light that are on, your really get a great view.

We started by the Marina Bay Sands hotel and waked over the bridge to the other side, and after the Formel1 course there is a hawker center with really good food!"
,,Nice view,4.0,,Had a great time...new Singapore. Fresh feel. Great place where you can get all sorts of experiences.
,,Stunning view,5.0,,We had lunch at the Sky on 57 restaurant. The meal was simply delicious. We sat out on the deck and had the most amazing view of Singapore. They brought us a pair of binoculars to enjoy the unending vista. Must visit . It saved us paying to go up to the observation deck. We had a great lunch instead.
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"There is so much to do in Marina Bay
Lots of shops and so many restaurants. There are attactions close by as well if you cross over the bridge you can visit the Cloud Forest Dome a must see so beautiful, especially at night the night show is amazing. Close by is also Marina Bays Sands Skypark at the top you can see all of singapore. At night if you go to the Waterfront Promenade you are see the light show from Bays Sands Skypark. Along the Waterfront Promenade you can take a boat ride which is especially nice in the hot summer the cool breeze blowing your way"
,,Beatiful landscapes!,5.0,,"So clean and ordered! awesome. Nice ,all center too (any boutique you would like you can find there). Good transport communications too."
,,Very nice to walk around,5.0,,I walked around Marina Bay...Nice view with the Marina Bay Sands hotel dominant in the opposite side.
,,A key Area to Visit,5.0,,"Marina bay is a lot more than just the new development of Marina Bay Sands. If you have the stamina you can walk around the whole bay. You are in reach of the Esplanade, the Skypark, Gardens by the Bay, The Merlion, bum boat rides, The Flyer, F1 track, restaurants etc. it can keep you busy for quite some time and is also a good spot to see the light show at 8 pm and 9.30 pm."
,,Excellent place,5.0,,"The marina bay is one of the best location. Not to mention the view from the sky-park, its excellent. Evening is perfect time to take a view from the sky park, you can see the city both in the daylight and artificial lights when it becomes dark. Soooooo coooooooooooool.."
,,Uniquely Singaporean,5.0,,"This is an amazing feat of engineering and very Singaporean. Take a swampy backwater and turn it into a prime attraction by buying sand from all your neighbors; add amazing gardens, a unique hotel and a terrific casino. I takes a country that thinks well beyond the box to pull it off."
,,Mind boggling,4.0,,"I cannot believe how huge this development is. It is quite overwhelming. On the hotel side it is worth going up to the restaurant on the 57th floor, 1st Tower. The view from both sides is breathtaking. We had a cocktail which was expensive but drank in the view. It would be a lovely place to dine in the evening with the Singapore lights. On the Casino side, it is floors and floors of Casino, shops and restaurants. It is well worth a visit just to see this amazing development. There are many options to dine from budget to 5 star."
,,One Stop Trip,5.0,,Best place for a city tour. Lots of spots and attractions. I love photography and I could take good pictures from any angle. Marina Bay Area is amazing.
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,Didnt get to go the gardens because it was raining. Hotel was a nice place just hard to find halal food for muslim travelers. They only had 2 halal restaurants which is coffee bean beastro and nanyang food court. Coffee Bean service was a dissapointment though. My friend had to wait an hour for her food!
,,Just for a photo,2.0,,"Visit this place just for a photo and thats all. Nothing that amazing, since you will not be able to see the infinity pool at the roof top if you are not a hotel guest."
,,Marina Bay,3.0,,As usual - neat & clean & safe !! Extremely hot & humid with no shade around the Merlion. Could do with a few benches and shade
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Marina Bay houses Marina Bay Sands, Marina Bay Gardens, Singapore Flyer and many many attractions. Take out at least 4 hours for this place and visit the huge mall within with water flowing in the basement and enjoy a ride on the boats. Going to and from Marina Bay is easy. There is MRT train system, taxis and even bus network. The cheapest however is the MRT."
,,Extra ordinarily beautiful..,5.0,,"The visit to the top floor is lil expensive, but the ur worth watching the expensive buildings around.. The view of flyer, gardens by the bay, marilion, clarke quay etc...."
,,Must see site,5.0,,"Spent several hours in and around the Marina Bay Area. Lots of spots to stop for a bite or refreshment while watching the sailboats. Did not catch a show, however I hear they offer many. Check the calendar before going."
,,It is ok,2.0,,It is not a unique or once in a life time experience. All you see is skyscraper by marina. To see Marina properly you will have to pay for one of those attractions otherwise the view you get is not that great.
,,Great view,5.0,,Went there in the morning. A very beautiful landscape. Went there in the first hours after a whole night flight and no sleep at night; still the view removed all the tiredness and recharged up for the day ahead :)
,,Nice architecture,5.0,,the place is so clean and nicely designed. A must to go place for stroll on both night and day time.

,,Superb view,5.0,,"The view was superb, just like in the movies, where we can see the bay with big buildings and their city lights at the horizon. When we were hungry, we just need to go inside the marina bay building and had dinner at the food court. Its a must visit in singapore."
,,Great place to start a walking tour of Singapore,5.0,,"This is the perfect place to start a walking tour of Singapore at night. Go at around 6pm to catch the light show. After the show, you can check out the swirling pool of water at one of the lobby entrances near the show. From there you can walk to the LV store and check out the wares..."
,,See the famous MERLION of Singapore,4.0,,We travelled to Marina bay by local MRT especially to see the famous MERLION of Singapore and to take the pictures for wonderful memory of our trip. They charge nominal entry ticket and the green fountains give pleasant view. Its located very near from marina bay station and you can also walk from the stattion or travel in HOP Up bus for sightseeing in Singapore city
,,Observation deck,4.0,,Great views all across Singapore. Well worth the $20. Spend ages looking at the sea and the ships and the solar trees and all of the buildings around the waterways.
,,Superb Views,5.0,,Do not miss out on visiting the hotel and having a cocktail or 2 and take in the magnificent views from the Marina Bay hotel. Easy to get to by using the MRT.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Have to go to Marina bay! No trip to singapore is complete without that. Go in the evening for the light show.
,,A must to visit while in Singapore,4.0,,"Marina bay is where famous Marina Bay Sands hotel sits. Although we did not stay in this hotel because we are on a cruise, we had a chance to visit and enjoy the shopping mall underground of this hotel. I would say the prices specially for name brand goods are expensive but they have good selections. They have other malls in Sentosa Island that is more reasonable just to compare. The hotel has a park & swimming pool at the very top of which we were told exclusively for hotel visitors only. This area is where you will find Singapore river cruise & well known Merlion statue so to me a must to visit while in Singapore."
,,Entertained!,5.0,,"Free entertainment! :D There are so many things happening around this area that even if you dont have any plans you are likely to bump into a free show (singing or dancing), some rides, a lot of stores, etc."
,,WOW,5.0,,I could not stop taking photos of the remarkable buildings - and the view from the Bar at the top.......BREATHTAKING!
,,Nice!,3.0,,"The Marina Bay is a nice area for a stroll. While I was there I actually saw a movie being filmed. Nevertheless, I've seen nicer bay areas, and this wasn't anything that special."
,,Leisure or pleasure?,5.0,,"A stroll around here, either in the morning, when there are kites aplenty being flown near the barrage, or in the evening, when the lights dazzle even the most hard-hearted, is always worthwhile."
,,disapointing,5.0,,went for lunch at the marina bay sands....not impressed comparing to the beautiful casino resorts in vegas was very ordinary so noisy & cluttered the shopping plaza was very large but virtually deserted glad we stayed elsewhere & would definetely not stay here
,,Wow,5.0,,"What a lovely view. We went at night and wandered around, much better than through the day. If you want to eat around the marina go early as most of the kitchens were closing at 10."
,,lovely views,5.0,,great views of the city..views of marina bay sands hotel and the art and science musem..plus there is the shopping mall right there...lovely walk by the river..took the boat cruise which dropped us off on the other side at Clarke quay and we were very happy to stop there where it is a vibrant area with lots of restaurants
,,Must,4.0,,"It is a must in singapour. Excellent view and nice places inside to grab a bite.it is a mall just crossing the street, but be ready to have money, everything is very expensive"
,,Marina bay,4.0,,Amazing place that you cannot mist in Singapore. Nice view and quite place for running. Very close from the city center and very easy to' get.
,,Great spot - well Worth the visit,4.0,,"Great spot to visit, visted during the day but you must also go at night for the light show. We went in the morning then returned for the eveing show.. A real Singapore must do!"
,,What a great night,4.0,,This we were taken to on our first night. The laser display was fantastic something we have never seen before very enjoyable
,,One of my favourite places to spend our evenings,5.0,,"One of my favourite places to spend our evenings for a relaxed time with your favourite people. Good view, open air, the wonderful light and sound show remains an attraction for tourists, lots of food options and great place to walk."
,,Attraction in financial district,5.0,,"I love jogging around the Marina Bay in the mornings. The air is crispy fresh, the sun gentle and you work out a good sweat before going into the office. The distance is about 4km, starting from the MBFC Towers, along MBS, up the Helix Bridge, toward Esplanade and Raffles Place, finishing back at MBFC.

Evenings are popular with joggers too.

If you're staying in one of the hotels in the area, Fullerton, Fullerton Bay, Westin Asia Square or Somerset you should definitely try the bay out one morning. Beats the hotel gym by miles I would think."
,,Not to be missed landmark in Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay is indeed an attraction for all ages.

The Marina Bay Sands Hotel's top 57th floor (next to the swimming pool) has a really surreal view of both the city and ocean view.

I personally love the ocean view which oversees the Gardens by the Bay and also the boats and ships in the ocean under the horizon that has a fine line distinguishing the ocean & sky.
Simply breathtaking scenery!

Not to mention the mall at Marina Sands is huge & visitors can have an overview of the Casino from the top of the mall."
,,something for everyone,4.0,,"wonderful blend of city life and urban retreats, the Marina Bay area offers a plethora of dining, entertainment and lifestyle facilities. dine with a view of the city for prices catering to all budgets!"
,,wow....We are on the 56th Floor,5.0,,"Tallest hotel building opened for travellers to admire the beauty of Singapore from the 56th Floor. The lift doesn't stop anywhere but directly takes you to 56th Floor from where you can enjoy the great scenary of Singapore, the Ocean, the Roads and much more."
,,One of a kind sight. Must visit,4.0,,It's a must see building in Singapore. Definitely go to Ku De Ta for dancing and drinking. The Din Tai Fungnin the basement is great for its dumplings. Great place to hang out. Must visit.
,,luxury and mixed experience,4.0,,"Luxury shopping mall, a lot of good brands there. Some restaurants provides nice food, however no every restaurant offers same good quality service. Certainly, overall 95% satisfaction you can get there and still need to improve."
,,WOW!!!,5.0,,"I still think this place is straight out of a StarWars movie, in smashes my senses every time I look at it, but winning $2000+ at the casino makes this a must see every time I returns!!!!"
,,Good shopping centre and lots of attraction,4.0,,"Theres a really big mall to go shopping name suntec city and marina square. Lots of attraction such as singapore flyer, marina bay sands, garden by the bay."
,,Wonderfrul light show,5.0,,"Although not widely publicised in the Singapore guides (I’d read about it in the Adelaide newspaper some time ago), the Tourist Information Centre gave us the performance times, and we managed to catch the 9.30 pm show overlooking the Marina. It was well worth the taxi ride across to the Marina at the Sands Casino complex, and we sat enthralled watching the brilliant pyrotechnics of this spectacular light show. Well worth the visit."
,,great place for fun,5.0,,"enjoy shopping, cinema, nice restaurant in the top of the hotel. there is beautiful view as well (it is paid, but you must see it.."
,,Nice,5.0,,Went on a duck tour and manage to see the ferris wheel and the Merlion and also Marina Bay Sands hotels
,,Luxury,5.0,,"Luxury shopping mall, a lot of brand name at there and you can enjoy all of space in Marina Bay Sands."
,,Watch your pocket!,3.0,,"interesting area to wander around and inspect, but as it is one of the tourist spots of Singapore prices are also higher= we paid $7 for a coffee. The light show is worth hanging around for if your young children are not falling over in exhaustion!"
,,Impressive Attraction,5.0,,"We love to walk around this area - it is beautiful, peaceful and impressive. Just walking around the bay is worth it with the wide promenade and the architecture surrounding the area. Staying outside is enjoyable enough. Then there is the mall that is unbelievable - major store after local store after major store. With shops and restaurants and a casino and entertainment center. The iconic hotel, Marina Bay Sands, is beyond amazing. And it is so convenient to get here on the MRT. Of course the cleanliness goes without saying - well worth whatever time you can spend there."
,,Magnificent gardens,5.0,,"We allocated half a day to see the Marina Bays Sands Hotel and gardens. The gardens are a must for keen gardeners, but half a day was not enough. However we very much enjoyed seeing what we could in the time that we had."
,,Top of the Asian World!,5.0,,"During a business trip to Singapore, a trip to Marina Bay Sands was required! First I went up to the observation deck. There is a nice restaurant up there (Ku De Ta), but it requires reservations and proper attire, so check before you go. I was turned away. Then, I walked along the public access to the rooftop pool. Only hotel guests are allowed to swim. Nevertheless, it is breathtaking! Finally, I spent some time in the Sands Casino below. The tables are fun and fair. I broke even and left, and that's good enough for me in any casino. Overall, it was a fun and exciting evening."
,,Noah's Ark on steroids,4.0,,"Its big, impressive and a must see. The hotel has a connecting shopping mall and both have their own MRT stations. Stay for the light show and the water dome at night.
The mall has large food court serving mainly asian food with the odd stall selling Indian or Italian food."
,,Beautiful walk at any time of day (well except maybe in the full sun),5.0,,"There's a great promenade around the entire bay so you can have a good fitness routine (running or walking) while enjoying spectacular urban scenery. Marina Bay has so many interesting features that are integral to it, you could easily spend a couple of days here."
,,The best in Singapore!,5.0,,"Locals and tourist in Singapore shouldn't miss to tour themselves here in Marina bay. Fantastic location to relax, to dine great food, be entertained, hangout and of course to take photos ."
,,"Great view, great air",4.0,,The view was great and great environment. I love to just walk around in the area and see people taking photo with funny style.
,,Spectacular views of the city,5.0,,"The area itself is brand new and spotless. We paid a fee to go to the roof of the hotel were the views were simply breathtaking. On one side you see the newly completed Botanical Gardens from above, and on the other side you see the bay itself and the rest of the city."
,,Great Views but poor facilities at SkyPark,3.0,,"We visited the SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands as we were not hotel guests, the views were amazing however the bar was restricted to hotel guests only so we could not get a drink in the boiling weather. Also there is no seating area on the observation deck so there is nowhere you can sit and admire the view. We were only there for a couple minutes and had to leave to get a beverage as it was boiling hot and it was difficult to stand for too long which was a disappointment"
,,Marina Bay Singapore,5.0,,The Marina Bay is an excellent location to spend a wonderful evening...away from all stress or work. Just stroll along and feel the fresh air!! The Marina is surrounded by beautiful buildings and statues as well.
,,Marina Bay - A place for everyone,5.0,,"A wonderful place to spend at least a few hours if you don't have time, leisurely walking along the bay and take in the awesome view. Beautiful architecture, very well planned, spacious and clean walkways with plenty of places to rest tired feet. There are much that you can do, shop, eat, listen to the free performances outside the Esplanade theater, go to the terrace at the top level of esplanade, there is a library with a free piano too! Walk along the bay, the places of interest are well connected, can even walk to Marina bay sands, plenty to see and shop with nice views. The Gardens by the Bay and Flyer are not too far away. One can actually spend a full day enjoying the place itself."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"Quite an amazing spectacle, lazer lights fired onto water spray all to music. Its a wonderful world just finished it off perfectly along with the bubbles catching the lights - beautiful! Don't sit too close to the speakers or your ears will drop off!"
,,Marina Bay. Plenty to see and do on and off the water.,5.0,,"Marina Bay you’ll find in the South of Singapore and there is plenty to see and do.
A lot of the land in that area was reclaimed in the 1970s and there’s been a huge mix of commercial, residential, hotels and entertainment built there, with some fabulous looking architecture.
The Bay itself, like a lot of things in Singapore, is man-made so that now the Singapore River flows into the bay instead of directly into the sea. As a result of this work it meant that Singapore got a new reservoir that provides a fresh water supply and plenty of lifestyle attractions in, on and around it.
Also, up until this work happened, apparently flooding in Chinatown was a regular occurrence.

Getting there is easy. There are 7 MRT stations that service that area and we caught a river taxi in from Grand Copthorne Riverfront. It was a great leisurely cruise in and interesting to see the bridges get older the closer we got to the Bay area.

Day or night there’s plenty on the go and there’s a few “must do’s” including the world's largest floating stage which has seen plenty of live entertainment and even soccer games I’m told! Apparently the seating in that area will hold around 30,000.
At nighttime there’s an amazing show of lasers, searchlights and music.
It only goes for about 15 minutes, but does light up that area every night, a couple of times a night, weather permitting. Oh, and it’s FREE!!!
We saw it, quite by chance, from Marina Bay Sands and it was amazing!!
I’ve since found out though that you have to be on Marina Bay Sands side to watch the Water Show, and you have to be across the other side of the Bay to watch the Light Show so you can catch the first show at 8pm and then walk over the other side to where you can see the Light Show at 9.30.

Food and bars? Plenty to choose from and to suit all tastes.

Have fun!"
,,Need to be more Muslim-friendly,4.0,,"Top things to do in Singapore! Even if you are a backpacker with a tight budget, you can still explore the uniqueness of its modern architecture. The view is decent!

However, I'm a little bit disappointed to find out that there is no Muslim prayer room available for public use around the area. The nearest one is located at UOB Plaza (Raffles MRT Station). It was a huge disappointment after a long walk from Esplanade just to get know that we need to turn back.

Considering the number of Muslim visitors from my observation, I really hope that the management team will consider to provide a room for Muslim to practice their faith.

Minus the ""Muslim-friendly thingy"", Marina Bay is amazing!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Lots to look at and make your jaw drop, like the rest of Singapore you wonder at the scale of what they have created. Another must see in both daylight and after dark."
,,Marina Bay - great place to explore,5.0,,"We explored Marina Bay and the Sands complex. Very nice area, beautiful gardens and views at night from the top of Sands hotel. Do note that the Sands does charge to be out on the observation deck (if you're not a hotel guest). But you can walk around some parts for free and get decent views. For the elevator up, you have to be lucky if somebody who is a guest has a key and pushes the floor."
,,Impression with The Wonderful Light Show.,5.0,,This is an incredible view infront of the shopping mall at night. I had a great time here and I was impressed of The Wonderful Light Show. It makes me miss SG very much.
,,Huge modern shopping complex,4.0,,"Huge modern shopping complex, conference centre, cinema's, food hall and casino. An insight into high end shopping and dining."
,,Breathtaking view,4.0,,It is so beautiful view that it should be explored in different time of day and different weather conditions. I did not have time for that unfortunately and was up there on only a foggy day. It would have been marvellous to go there at night to see the lightshow of the magic trees or the laser show on the bay.
,,Laser show,5.0,,Excellent show in the night. Shows images in the water and the music and story is amazing. Worth watching for free.
,,Poshly Divine,5.0,,"Marina bay is a quite delightful fun filled with many things to do . Such a Marina Shopping mall , The river side , Marina Bay hotel and resturants and the latest Super tree Marina Bay restaurant ."
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"The skyline, the merlion, the river, the skyscrapers,is just amazing, all nice and clean, spacious, it is a must when you visit Singapore. It is probably the first place you will go. I really liked it. It is an incredible city.."
,,A beautiful place,4.0,,"At here, you can spend your time one day in Casino and for a shopaholic, you will enjoy your shopping including food and drink here is awesome."
,,Top,3.0,,"I think this is the financial center of Singapore? As I saw many top building with modern design/equipment, etc

The Marina Bay building is HUGE!! It could represents Singapore to the world instead of the Sealion, LOL.

Unfortunately didn't have time to go to the top, hopefully next time I will be there.

For those who travels to Singapore, please don't miss this."
,,Great Shopping and One of a lifetime view,5.0,,Stayed at Sands Marina Bay. Exceptional. Unbelievable roof top infinity pool and dining. Shops at Sands terrific.
,,Great View,4.0,,"Really good view , better at night than the day, gives you a real contrast from the old streets of singapore, the skyline lights are great"
,,Superb hangout!,5.0,,I enjoyed every place near Marina bay. There are many food joints nearby & I eat some tasty food here. The river cruise is cool & enjoyed the long ride.
,,Went to the top,3.0,,Limited area that you can visit on Ku de ta if you dont stay there. I found the views to be great but drinks were expensive. Small area so nothing much that you can do.
,,Impressed,5.0,,Although designer shopping is not my forte I must say I was impressed with the amount you can do here. Also a good range of restaurants.
,,Superb Architecture!,5.0,,A must visit in Singapore. The architecture are absolutely amazing with all the facilities that worth a visit.Be sure to catch the sunset in fine weather here and the view from the sky park is mind blowing experience!
,,Great show,5.0,,Don't miss ' wonderful' show !!! must see place in singapore specially at night . awesome night life and great scenes at the bay
,,Two parts,3.0,,"1. The shopping centre was OTT. Who buys anything there?? There is no one in the shops as they are too expensive! You are not acknowledged by the staff if you do enter. Average
The convention centre is huge but functioned very well for our meeting of 4500 delegates plus partners and trades. We only used a small section of the building. The environment was neat tidy, well set out by the water. Loved it. the nearby train service was a great way to avoid a 30mins hot walk to our hotel.Very good."
,,Buzzing,5.0,,"Wonderful to spend an evening here.Good restaurants,shops and lovely to sit outside and have a drink.The architecture is amazing especially seeing the buildings all lit up against a beautiful sunset.This is definitely a must to visit."
,,The future of Singapore's CBD,5.0,,"The government has been shifting the Central business district of Singapore from raffles place to Marina Bay. As such, you can see a lot of new office buildings here. There are a lot of high end restaurants located around this region. The Marina Bay sands resort and casino is also located here. A good place to take photos and a good stroll..."
,,View of a view,4.0,,"have seen all the above from 7000 ft down as an airline pilot- to see it at ground(plus the height of the 'towers"")level was some thing else-better than LIBERTY statue in N.Y., LONDON EYE.TOUR EIFFEL and many other around the world mentionables"
,,Worth a walk,4.0,,"walk along the boardwalk at Merlion Park, and if you can take the heat, all the way around - it's a lot further than it looks on the maps - it's quite-a-hike !! But worth it."
,,Good evening stroll,4.0,,We wandered around the Marina Bay on our first night. There are lots of little restaurants and plenty of outside seating. Busy and buzzing.
,,Great photos,5.0,,"Awesome photo opportunity if you can get some good weather. Heaps to do, and the architecture is mind blowing!"
,,A great moment,5.0,,Just be here for an hour and enjoyed the great atmosphere of the Bay and the skyline as well. We recommend to arrive here at late afternoon when you can see both the sunset and romantic lights of the buildings.
,,Another fantastic area,5.0,,"This area is very impressive, particularly the mixture of old colonial buildings with towering skyscrapers. It is almost better at night with spectacular light shows on the lotus shaped museum building."
,,Incredible skyline,5.0,,"Incredible skyline, different from anywhere else. And the Clifford Pier oozes old-fashioned sophistication."
,,Must visit in the evening-great experience,5.0,,This area is a must visit in the evening. You can take a walk around the area or go for jogging . It has some bars and restaurants . Enjoy lovely views of the bay area that gets well lit up in the evening. After dark you can visit casino .
,,Nice place,5.0,,"Fantastic place, worth the visit, nice atmosphere, plenty of shops. At night time it is great with all the lights. Great for a walk"
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,Fabulous shops - very high end. Night time sound & light show was really enjoyable. Walked across the Helix bridge to get there - it's a great feat of engineering.
,,Lovely views.,4.0,,"So, to be specific, this is not one place, but rather a stretch of road/bay area, with lovely views of Singapore. Even if you don't make it to the Marina Bay Sands, like I didn't, the Bay itself it pretty. The evening I went, there were pretty light shows and music shows going on across the Bay and the atmosphere was lively. A nice place to bring anyone who might be visiting from out of town/country."
,,Ordinary Great Building,3.0,,"This building is great but like ordinary building, nothing special in here except the casino, so i suggest if you not go to casino don't waste your time go here because you can see this building from far away."
,,Worth Seeing,4.0,,"I didn't expect much at Marina Bay, but the shoppes, gardens and the boat tour plus the architecture is worth the trip."
,,best view of singapore,5.0,,You get the best view of singapore from top of this place. Do not miss if you plan a trip to Singapore :)
,,So much to see,5.0,,Walk around the whole marina as you get to see so much. Plenty of eateries along the river and the shopping centre has all the upmarket shops plus aircon to escape the heat.
,,Great place to wander,5.0,,The shops are upmarket but browsing is great. At night the laser light show over the water in front of the shops is amazing. Get there early and get a spot in the middle for the best effects
,,Incredibile place,5.0,,Everthing is fantastic at the Marina. I felt like living a dream especially at sunset and when all the lights were on. Couldn't be in a better place.
,,the most beautiful and highest swimming pool.,5.0,,"we paid $15 for going to the top of the Marina Bay sand and have a swim there, it such amazing and best view to everywhere, we can also have delicious drink and take a lot of pictures, the crew is very friendly and nice, they guided us to everywhere. it was the incredible beauty."
,,Very good at night,5.0,,"Food court is awesome, nightly light show is also very good, get the a bit early to get a seat although people will still squeeze in between."
,,Superb place for remarkable moments...,5.0,,"You can easily reach Bay by public transport.

This is one of my favourite place to wild time chatting with friends and loved ones when in Singapore. It’s one of the marvellous Bay that I have visited. To add to its magnificent beauty it has graceful architectural buildings surrounding. After dusk when the lights are on it creates a divine image all together with its colourful reflection in water. There are lots of shopping and eateries around.

One can spend hours and hours sitting here enjoying the people around. If you are here in evening you get to watch the spectacular light show. The light show happens the opposite side that’s MBS. But can be front viewed from here.
It takes place at 2000hrs and 2130hrs and on wkends at 2300hrs too.
It’s a light sound and Fire art show however from this area you can view only light and fire art. For music you too far. If you on the promenade you can experience all 3 :)

This is a great place for photography."
,,What a view,5.0,,"It feels like 70% of all touristic attractions are located on the bay. The view, especially at night are to die for. Make sure you camera can take good night pictures to take advantage of the opportunity.

Don't forget to check out the water/laser show in front of the Marina Bay Sands in the evening"
,,The Best View in Singapore - Must See,5.0,,This really is the best view in Singapore and in its way is as iconic as Sydney Harbour. The mixture of the old and new (more new than old) is interesting with some areas such as the Fullerton Hotel providing a contrast to the modern Marina Bay Sands. The whole area is worth walking around and taking time over.
,,A place in earth,5.0,,"This is one of the most wonderful places in the world. A marina surrounded by huge buildings, with a lighting and water show , and an atmosphere of fantasia. Cingapura is one of the most perfect and agreeable cities to visit."
,,Great and iconic scene of Singapore,4.0,,"It is one of the areas you want to see if you visit Singapore. The hotels, the skyscrapers, the traditional building in junction with modernity. The bay, the lion. Good one."
,,excellent,5.0,,marina bay is the too good see hotels and lot of bars and restaurants and malls .i enjoy with my family.
,,mindblowing,5.0,,the food the buildings the shopping the atmosphere is second to none . i loved the LV shop in the water the museum the friendly people .
,,Dont miss a visit here.,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands, the shopping, the food, the vistas, the hotel all add up to not just a hotel or a shopping mall, BUT an attraction that you can just wander around and ogle the fashion, the impressive architecture the views across the bay sample something from the not so boring food court which offers an array of dishes from across the globe and at a reasonable price.
If you interested there is also the Casino which from the top level looking down to the main floor is really a sight."
,,Great Area. Lots to do.. a Must visit.,5.0,,"Marina bay is the most visited area of Singapore... Its got malls, a wonderful worlds one of the best hotel, lot of bars and restaurants. There's so much to do here and a trip to Singapore is incomplete without a trip here."
,,Great architecture and views,4.0,,We went for the architecture and soaked it all up. Some amazing buildings in the Marina Bay area and it's easy to forget the sheer scale of them after a couple of days. My husband was in architecture heaven.
,,I love <3,5.0,,"I love this place! & #ilightmarinabay made it memorable!

Things to do:
1. Go up Skypark/ Ku de ta...
2. Sleep on the deck
3. Drink
4. Watch the city light up
5. Check from before the ongoing cultural activity - when i was there it was ilightmarinabay
6. Walk around the promenade, helix bridge...
7. Have a nice meal & drinks

I love it - you can be part of the crowd yet move away. Just like the anchored ships outside the bay"
,,Magnificent views and shopping centre,5.0,,"Marina Bay holds home to Marina Bay Sands, a very grand hotel, and an adjacent shopping centre named The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. The shopping centre was three stories and included an ice rink, a large food court and numerous water features with a gondola ride being offered in one area. I stayed to watch the laser show which was brilliant! There is also an MRT station there which is very convenient. I would definitely recommend taking a visit to Marina Bay."
,,Went there for the Laser Show,5.0,,"This laser show is absolutely awesome! I love the Wasserspiele in Hamburg and have also seen the light/watershow in Dubai, but seeing this one I had goosepumps all over!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Great area & location with fantastic buildings & scenery. Also the gateway for the Singapore Flyer, boat trips & the Hop-on, Hop off buses on offer."
,,"Very ""Asian"" shopping center",4.0,,This is a gigantic shopping center with a nice view. I would recommend to go in the evening when they project videos with soothing music on the water fountains in the interal harbour. You'll find something similar in Las Vegas (but there the music is aggressive). The bridge by the night is also very nice. If you want there is also an internal canal with boats. I found that a bit kitsch.
,,A beautiful place for a walk,5.0,,We walked around the Marina Bay area a couple of times recently. It is a very pretty area especially early in the morning when the sun is still rising.
,,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Casino",4.0,,"Nice and a porch location. Singapore Flyer, MBS Hotel is worth a visit. A lot of walking if you like exploring. Can also opt for the river cruise."
,,fabulous,5.0,,Went here at night and the views were brilliant. The colours of the lights which lit up the city were just amazing.
,,Amazing,5.0,,We loved going up to the Sands platform and looking at the views over the city. The restaurants and shops are wonderful. The outside art installations were very interesting. Long queue for a taxi at night after a restaurant meal but at least it wasn't in the rain.
,,Very Open area,4.0,,"MBS is here. A water taxi to it's end, then walk around to MBS and Gardens by the Bay, it's a good sized walk and lets you see the opposite shores from different angles. 3 super sized fans are situated half way along the walk to cool yourself."
,,Beautiful area of Singapore,4.0,,We walked to the Marina Bay area and it is well worth it. Definitely a highlight in the city -- the architecture in the area is beautiful and the bay offers stunning views. Do it!
,,Developers Dream,4.0,,This reclaimed area of Singapore is wonderful. The hotel is very grand. Not much to do for kids though and quite expensive to get to the top of Tower 3 for the view. Choose a clear day
,,Amazing Light Show,4.0,,My husband and I decided to see the Light and Laser show on our last night in Singapore and were impressed with the quality of the show. We also took a boat cruise along the river to view the Marina Bay area from a different perspective during the day. The Shopping Mall was extensive (and expensive) but worth a look.
,,Just walk around,5.0,,"Just walk around Marina Bay and take in the awesome views by day and by night, no need to spent anything."
,,Top of the world views,5.0,,"Marina Bay can be accessed by travelling to Marina Bay MRT station. You literally exit out into the shopping centre and then travel up to Marina Bay Sands. If you are not staying in the hotel you will be asked to pay an entrance fee to view Singapore on the rooftop viewing deck.

The view is amazing on a clear day and worth seeing at least once when in Singapore. The view from outside of Marina Bay Sands is also amazing."
,,Towering structure,5.0,,"Singapore's main CBD is centered around this. Dominating the skyline with its unique architecture, the night view is amazing."
,,Rain. What else can I say,2.0,,"Waste of money""............"""" What more can I say.............................nothing was open until 12, they should of offered a morning price..........Lethe view is great but not worth $85 for ten minutes in the rain.............."".........!!!!!!?..............."
,,Great place,5.0,,"When you get to Marina Bay, you'll reach satay by the garden, and you can have really good taste for the satay. At the night time around 8pm, they have lighting show with music, worth to visit."
,,Fantastic Views,4.0,,"The views are wonderful, especially in the evening. I didn't have a drink here as it was stupidly expensive, but glad we went up for the views. Definitely worth going"
,,Go up top for the view....but don't stay here!,3.0,,"The Marina Bay is obviously an architectural wonder on its own merits, but it has the stupidest staff imaginable, the most ridiculous prices on earth (a $100 per person food minimum in the restaurant!)...and every nouveau riche, Chanel bagged, ill-mannered wannabe lounging around the rooftop bar ordering Cristal by the magnum and being as obnoxious as possible. Our bartender was completely incapable of making a martini, and the overall service was nothing short of unacceptable.
But...the views are spectacular, and almost worth the other aggravations. Check it out anyway!"
,,Stunning Photo Spot,5.0,,"One of the best spots to get stunning metropolitan landscape photos in Asia. I kept going back there 3-4 times during my 2 weeks stay in Singapore to capture amazing pictures of Marina Bay, CBD and Singapore skyline from different angles and at different time of the day. The pictures I got were well worth the effort. I'd definitely visit there again."
,,Great,5.0,,"Went there on a Saturday night, buzzing with shoppers, diners. Wonderful atmosphere. Loved the late night shopping, nothing to dislike at all."
,,Beautiful stroll,5.0,,"We walked all round the marina as it gives you great views of the strange Marina Sands hotel building which dominates the skyline and the Singapore Merlion statue. Just under the bridge from the merlion, heading 'inland' is a stall selling delicious ice lollies which help cool you down."
,,great spot,5.0,,"it's hard to believe that a city can be changed adding a hotel, a museum and a mall but this is what happened in Singapore with marina bay area!"
,,Cross the helical bridge,4.0,,"If you visit the Gardens by the Bay it's well worth returning by crossing the helical bridge to get to Marina Bay. The mall connected to the Marina Bay Sands is pretty big and a good place to eat after a hot morning in the gardens, plus there are some good views of the skyline from here."
,,Entertainment Central,5.0,,The Bay has been the most brilliant construction in modern Singapore. New Years Eve saw thousands of people out and about enjoying the live concert and light show. Amazing.
,,A Shoppers' Haven,5.0,,"If wifey is in the mood for extravagance, this is a place she should be........good my sweetheart headed direct to the foodcourt and that was perfectly fine with me!!! The array of resto was absolutely mouth-watering from main dish to dessert!!!"
,,So much to see you don't where to look first.,5.0,,"Marina Bay is really dead center in Singapore surrounded by so many magnificent buildings, both high rise and traditional colonial that you can spend a long time just looking around. The best observation point is from the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel where there is a bar and pool. Walking around the bay is also very nice with parks, jogging paths and even a waterfront soccer filed and stadium seating."
,,Very average,3.0,,"Marina Bay is a large area and it's nice, modern but lacking life (at the time of my visit). I think my expectations were high, but it's a nice space for performances however there were none. It is was a nice walk none the less around the bay. Go in the evening and at time if there is something on (like the F1), as it is sure to be more of an experience."
,,THIS IS SINGAPORE,5.0,,"We saw it from the Skypark, walked around it in the evening and saw it by the river cruise. It is iconic Singapore. Not to be missed. It's different each time of day and from each perspective. Just do it, again and again"
,,High class shopping mall,5.0,,"This is a beautiful shopping complex full of designer brand shops and eateries, beautiful window displays, museum and theatres."
,,simply beautiful,4.0,,"a beautiful scenery on the bay of Singapore. we got there around 8pm and raining :(
still, the scenery is not something you can just let go without taking any documentation. the Sg Flyer and Esplanade on the left, Marina Bay plaza and Merlion park on the right, with a touch of light show. it just simply amazing"
,,The most iconic area of Singapore,4.0,,"Sydney Harbour, Australia. Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. The Bund, Shanghai. They are all supreme examples of riverside architecture and leisure facilities combined to make amazing attractions for tourists and local people alike - Marina Bay in Singapore easily fits into the same category. In fact, Marina Bay is actually a locale where many other attractions take centre stage.

Merlion Park contains a few shops and cafes and is adjacent to One Fullerton, which is a integrated office/retail complex on the marina. The Merlion of course is the national ‘animal’ of Singapore (albeit mythical), being half fish and half lion. It is a great place to take some photos with a virtual 360 degree view around Marina Bay, with great photo opportunities everywhere you look. Of course, it is good to get a ‘selfie’ in front of the Merlion statue while you’re there too!

The Esplanade Theatres are Singapore’s answer to the Opera House in Sydney or the Royal Albert Hall in London. These theatres have an exterior resembling that of a durian and are quite unlike any other sight in the region. Just like at Merlion Park and One Fullerton, there are many cafes and bars around this area of Marina Bay, too.

Walking past the famous Mandarin Oriental hotel from the Esplanade and past the F1 circuit grandstand and floating football pitch, you will eventually come to the Singapore Flyer. It must be noted that the Flyer is located across the road and not literally on Marina Bay itself.

Back on to Marina Bay proper, you encounter the Helix Bridge which takes you back to the Marina Bay Sands integrated resort complex. At night this bridge is especially spectacular as it is lit with thousands of neon lights. It is a pedestrian bridge although many joggers will use the bridge as part of their fitness routines. Once again, this area of Marina Bay provides great photo opportunities."
,,You Must See The Light Show,5.0,,"The evening light show is amazing. Get to the shopping centre at the marina, there is a wooden terrace at the front near the water. There is lots of space so don't panic about getting a seat. This experience, with the city in the backdrop, is unforgettable!"
,,So much to see and do here,5.0,,"Simply walk around and experience all the shops, displays and of course all the wonderful looking food eateries."
,,Singapore logo,5.0,,"There are many things to do and see here. It is worth to go to Marina Bay Sands Hotel's rooftop, enjoy the drink and the view"
,,Go back to the future,5.0,,"Marina Bay is mostly impressively new and futuristic. See the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, but located slightly off the Bay front is the stunning Fullerton Hotel, a former Post Office. Spend a couple of hours, walking right round the bay (about 3 1/2 km), stopping off at a marina front cafe for a glass of wine or welcome cold beer. Snacks are not too expensive by Singapore standards. The Art and Science museum is small but has some interesting exhibitions. There is a dinosaur on there just now and a fabulous Lego one last year. The shops at the Marina Bay Sands hotel are real high end, so don't expect to be bargain hunting! The Marina is a popular after work jogging track, so time your visit to avoid this is you don't want to be jostled by people running into you while being distracted by high energy music! They literally bump into you!
The Singapore flyer is situated at the Marina and is slightly higher than the London eye (as we kept be told!) you can walk through the Marina Bay Sands hotel to access Gardens on the Bay. A tackier thing on the Marina is the Merlion - think of the Little Mermaid in Copenhagen and you'll know what. I mean about the Merlion. It's not worth a special visit. Catalonia is an expensive trendy bistro of glass which juts out into the bay. Ok food and drinks, just quite pricey but great views. Kinki bar has great views opposite the MBS hotel for great photo opportunities. Lastly - the whole area has an underground shopping mall which links MBS hotel and Raffles Place, so even on a rainy day you can find something to do."
,,Visit the galleries,5.0,,We always make it a point to pass by and check out what is on display. Very interesting selection and collection each time. Very informative and educational for kids.
,,Modern Infrastructure,5.0,,"It is a unique experience to see the technique adopted to utilise space and build empire for MNCs. Peaceful, clean and pleasant atmosphere. A lot of feeling to motivate young generation. Singaporeans are committed to achieve height in the world maintaining discipline, law & order and doing business despite lack of natural resources."
,,Worth while to visit,5.0,,"There are lots of things to do and see, really worth going up to the top floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel for a drink and taking in the views from the very top ( if not just to sticky beak at the amazing hotel facilities !) There are lots of shops in the mall and plenty of things to keep you occupied if the weather is not on the sunny side."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,"This is one of the most amazing cities we have been to. Marina Bay has so much to offer and see. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is the most amazing hotel I have ever seen. Also the the Gardens at Marina Bay look like something out of a space movie. So much to see in the Bay, worth spending the day sight seeing."
,,Best in Singapore,5.0,,"This is my personal fav in Singapore. The MBS is one of the key attractions here, and taking a pic at Merlion would complete your SIN trip. There is laser show at various intervals after 7pm daily and it never ceases to amaze me. Lots to walk and see around here. Go for it!!!"
,,tourists,4.0,,This is a real tourist spot so really busy during the day but a must to see The Merlion and the river and across the way is the Casino
,,It has everything,5.0,,Not only does the area offer many attractions but includes many eating venues and a casino. Easy to spend the whole day.
,,Unique,5.0,,"I pass by this place almost every week and it never fails to fascinate me. The blend of elegant buildings and the water especially during sunset are out of this world !The nearby attractions like the Flyer, the Marina Bay Sands are also not to be missed."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"A must see for all tourist, this is absolutely divine!!! You have the most beautiful view of Singapore from the Marina Bay."
,,overwhelming view,5.0,,"Both wonderful during the day & night but at night, of course, with all the lights it is overwhelming. When it is dark the light show takes place evety 30 min or so. Not very impressive if you have seen some light shows within Asia but still watchnable so to say. Better to watch it from the Merlion side. The view is breathtaking."
,,Mariner Bay a must See.,4.0,,We visited Mariner Bay a few times during our stay as there was so much to see particularly at night to watch the laser light show form the top of Mariner Bay Sands Hotel and also at the Gardens by the Bay which is also a must see. Its pretty harbour at night with many food outlets and restaurants and a sampling of different cultures.
,,Pretty skyline.,5.0,,"It's a good place to see many pretty view of singapore, go at night if you really want to see beautiful scenery of singapore!"
,,What a Lightshow!,5.0,,"This wonderful complex includes a 2600 plus room hotel, shopping mall, casino and resting on top the three pillars of the hotel is boat like structure with some unbelievable views of the city. At 9:30 they have a lightshow which is wonderful!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Awesome place to visit. Love to see sunset from the top. Swimming pool is awesome but only hotel boarders are entiteled to entry there. While going to top floor by elevator you will surprise to see that only four button is available ( only for B1, 1, 56, 57). By taxi, bus, MRT/LRT you can go there."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"considered as one of the symbol of singapore. Not only the service but the more important is the swimming pool, which is placed at the highest floor."
,,Good place to spend time,5.0,,"We spend 2-3 hours here. We took the river cruise which explains the story of the bay area. We went to the Merlion, and the Marina Bay Sands Mall.
The Merlion was under maintenance and covered with scaffolding's so could not take nice pictures.
We went to Singapore Flier and Gardens by the Bay and Clark Quay and spend a lot of time strolling around."
,,Evening well spent,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning 360 degree view when you are at Marina Bay.

Please spend atleast 3-4 hours here.
You can take the river cruise.

You can go to Merlion, Marina Bay Sands Mall and Skypark, just sit near the bay area or take a stroll around this place.

There is a free sound and light laser show everyday at 9pm, which is a must watch."
,,Amazing view and awesome water show!,5.0,,"I like the water show with sea breeze blowing against your face.
Although there will be many people but the there are 2 shows a night. There are plenty places to sit but be sure be there slightly early to have a better seat. A nice place to chill and relax and filled yourself with the urban atmosphere that Singapore offer."
,,Very Nice For drinks,4.0,,Nice to seat and have a drink and eat overlooking the water. You can take aboat and go across it. Its next to the hotel in the mall.
,,The View Point,5.0,,"The top 5 attraction in Singapore, Must see!!! The view point on Marina bay is amazing , price around 20-30$, and you get amazing view on night or day Singapore, one of most interesting and lovely picture that will stay with you for log time."
,,Overpriced everything,2.0,,Skip this unless you are on your way to the gardens. It does have clean toilets if you must. Shop staff are not inviting if you don't drew to the 9 s
,,A must see,5.0,,You can't be in Singapore and not be in Marina bay.. definitely a must see... the walk around is pleasant and plenty of resto choice.
,,the great SINGHA,5.0,,landmark exhibit of singapore. best time to visit is in the evening when lights are on & playing. boats also contribute to this.
,,One day is not enough!,5.0,,"Yes! allocate a day at the marina bay... because it has a lot of attractions to offer. the GArdens by the bay and the marina bay bay sands is a must to see! Spend time to take pictures of the awesome architecture of the marina bay sands and the two cooled conservatory of the gardens by the bay! In our next travel to SG, we will surely book a room so that we will be able to get inside the infinity pool and experience once in a lifetime swimming experience."
,,Amazing bay,5.0,,Spent whole night at Marina Bay in the end of March . It has a wonderful views with a lot of high building. Especialy with the Merlion statue will make people never forget about this bay (The National Animal of Singapore) Overall best time to visit here is night time or early in the morning the see the Sunset (Dont forget to take some photo)
,,a mesmerising view,5.0,,it is one of the most beautiful scenic place in singapore. when you go up on singapore sky the place looks amazing . the view is just authentic.water is surrounded by so many beautiful architectural buildings.
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"A new development, well planned and implemented. We spent several hours walking around the marina viewing the many awesome architectural achievements surrounding the marina. Observed the spectacular light show in the evening and took lots of photos."
,,Excellent in the evening..,5.0,,Its best to go here in the evening.. The Raffles MRT is closest to the MERLION park. The Merlion is a sight to behold in the evening after sunset..
,,Excellent,5.0,,Great for shopping and spoilt for choices for a good culinary experience. Had food at Ku Da Ta on the top floor of marina bays. Highly recommended for get togethers.
,,A must visit in Singapore ..,5.0,,This hotel/casino/shopping mall/eating mall has to be seen to be believed.. The jewel in the crown is the Hotel which spans three towers and is an amazing piece of architecture.. It's rooftop pool is simply jaw dropping. There is a cost to view from above but my advice would be to go for a drink at the Ku De Ta which is a bar on the same floor as the the pool and will cost less than paying for the viewing gallery.Either way.. Get up there !
,,Stunning Interior,4.0,,"Lovely hotel, very nice breakfast and the steak dining room well worth a try, staff are a little too helpful to the point they can be annoying when enjoying your steak. Good location, near MRT"
,,Lovely day and night time walk,4.0,,"Beautiful area for walking during the day and the night! There is so much to look at, and at 8pm Marina Bay Sands has its daily light show!!"
,,Stunning Location,5.0,,"This is a jaw dropping place. The architecture is remarkable, shops are really high end and the casino makes for quite an alternative. By American standards, the casino is impressive in appearance, but offers few perks. Drinks and food are limited and pricey. The area as a whole is well worth a visit."
,,Luxury Shopping,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a very beautiful place one must go while in Singapore. The commercial building is so huge everything is inside. The shops and boutiques are superb. The whole mall is so attractive to go around you will not notice the time. Those who love signature items such as bags, shoes, jewelry, fashion apparel, you can find it there. There is also a casino inside whenever one loves to try their luck in gambling. There are various food shops in the Food Court where food served are affordable and delicious."
,,Only Entertainment,4.0,,Lots of entertainment available at one place. The laser show that was taking place was excellent and the best show that I had ever seen. Lots of activity to do. Never miss to visit the place.
,,Great building,4.0,,"its a must see in Singapore, I mean it dominates the downtown skyline and is a great place to wander around. Singapore has many great buildings and this is one of the latest. The casino is huge, the shops are plenty and the food is very good, if a little expensive. But its definitely worth a wander around to see the spectacular construction, and get to the roof for amazing views if you can."
,,too upmarket,3.0,,- everything's so expensive there - dead fishes in the artificial reservoir (and it's for drinking?) - should have spaces for people to do a picnic/bbq
,,Lovely modern tourist spot,5.0,,"Evening lights up the buildings like magic, the sights are ethereal.. This is the most exclusive and unique attraction of singapore. I dont know if there is adequate accessibility thru bus or metro..Night charges in taxis are expensive."
,,Of course you'll go there,5.0,,"What's there to say? You will go through Marina Bay if you go to Singapore. Great view of the city, access to must-see attractions, easy to get to."
,,Very nice place,4.0,,"all tall buildings with not much greenery a lake beside with boating facility few good restaurants and few shops Dinosaur museum is good n the mall near by is awesome ""kopitiam"" is food court n one will get asian cuisines overall nice place to visit"
,,Wander,4.0,,Lots of things to do here. Many shops and restaurants etc. The evening light laser show was a bit of a disappointment though.
,,Pricey but good..,4.0,,A very different part of Singapore. The shopping complex under the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is very good but can be a little pricey. A few food options and not to mention a decent view of Singapore.
,,Beautiful Skyline,5.0,,Marina bay offers amazing skyline with a very beautiful water body and this is indeed one of the most important attraction in Singapore.The laser show from the marina bay sands hotel is very good with some sound effect.The nightlife is very lively at this waterfront area with all the major food & leisure joints.Overall a wonderful area to spent some evenings in singapore.
,,Money talks,4.0,,"There is so much to do here, lots of shopping and eating and so much more. It can be overwhelming if you not the shopping type."
,,Beautiful views at night,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands looks great at night especially with beautiful view across the water. Night laser show was also very nice with great sound and light effect.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Went during the day and the architecture is amazing! Went back during the night for the light show and it was even more beautiful when lit up at night.
,,Great lights,3.0,,"Visited the Lights at Marina Bay on 24 March. Highly recommended but do use proper walking shoes as there'll be lots of walking. We did not bring a tripod but if you wish to take some nice photos or selfies, a tripod is recommended."
,,Beautiful walk and not so heavy !,5.0,,I quite liked the waterfront and the amazing view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel ! It was an easy walk all around the harbour and I do recommend it !
,,Plenty to see,5.0,,"Lovely place, where you can sit and relax, take a 40 minute river trip. Lovely shopping mall. Plenty of places to eat."

,,"""Ship across buildings"" Worth Seeing!",5.0,,"Although we didn't stay at the Marina Bay Sands, ""Singapore"" immediately comes to mind when one sees the building. We took the subway to the Marina Bay Sands and shopped and ate at shops along the way to the hotel. It is magnificent to see. It is very large and crowded, but if you are in Singapore it is worth stopping to see and take photos. Even if you're not staying at this hotel, you can pay a fee to go to the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Otherwise, it's free to just walk around and look. An exterior photo of the Marina Bay Sands taken from afar is a must when visiting Singapore."
,,glamourous with peace,4.0,,"I had a long hectic day then reached to the bay and found so gorgeous Merlion. then looked at the awesome architectures, then the flyer. suddenly found some beach chairs, managed an empty one and fell asleep indeed for more than hour. when I woke up it was dazzling with color fountain with music. freshened up myself and went for mustafa centre next."
,,ausum,4.0,,this place is a must visit at night time...they have a laser show here which is a must watch...there is the famous marina bay tower as well...quite a good place to hangout.
,,Lovely.,5.0,,"We first went to the Marina one evening after a very long exhausting day sightseeing. We were looking for somewhere to eat around the Marina. Most restaurants were closed. However we ended up eating in the food court of the large shopping mall. Plenty of choice there. Second time we went we were able to see street performers and the beautiful water/lazer show. Great atmosphere, young and old alike mingling along the waters edge. Also there was several light shows along the footpaths."
,,Dont miss the show,4.0,,It is a very nice place to sit and relax. Gives you nice view of the Merlion and also the bay with the business district as the backdrop. Dont miss the light and sound show that happens every evening. Try and get a seat at an elevated area.
,,so much to see,4.0,,this area is so nice and so much to see you can spend an entire day here. a huge tourist attraction area but never packed with people.
,,Amazing,5.0,,It is very impressive to see and experience the Marina Bay Building. Architecture is really amazing and by observing the structure you wonder how the architect and the engineer could work together in such a proyect. It's amazing and they manage to build what looks like an impossible structure.
,,breathtaking skyline.,5.0,,"a true picture perfect image of singapore. an array of restaurants and bars, very lively even on a weekday with a breathtaking view of the skyline along the marina. Lovely place to be int he evening."
,,Big but not special,3.0,,Didnt see it in night time which probably would have been better because in daytime its just a tall building amongs others.
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,"Fantastic shopping mall, with light show in the evening a must for any visitor, I don't normally enjoy going to any shopping mall, but the sands is different light pleasant and just a great place to hang out, restaurants there are of a great standard too.We ended going there three evening just to walk around and watch the sights"
,,Jazzn'',5.0,,"loved this place to see a concert ....so peaceful , taxi line was long after the concert but people were very well mannered. This place has it all.. high end shopping, food court , casino and beautiful view ."
,,What a beautiful evening at the Marina Bay Singapore,5.0,,"We spent a beautiful light festival evening #iLightMarinaBay at the Marina Bay Singapore last night. Themed ""Light + Heart"" this year, the decorations were truly amazing and impressive. Altogether, there were 28 light/art installations at the area.

The decorations were interactive and impressive. We joined many other families to spend a beautiful evening at this very special place.

Some may say that Singapore is always too warm to be outdoor. However, the night at the Marina Bay area is actually quite cooling. We arrived the place after dinner at about 8pm. The decorations were located around the bay area, and we were glad that we had the chance to visit the ""floating platform"" too.

If you like to visit a special place when you are in town, you may like the evening at the Marina Bay too!

Tips:
+ admission is free
+ bring a good camera to capture the night views bring a bottle of water
+ visit the place when the sky turns dark must try the local Singaporean
+ style ice cream - the uncle near the bridge serves very fresh local ice cream for only S$1.20!"
,,Another must see,5.0,,"Huge complex housing a casino , mall, art and science museum, and cloud nine on the waterfront. We ate at the top at the restaurant. Fabulous view on the town. Another must see and do if you are only there a few days."
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"How can one not consider going to a place that involves one of the most unique building structures in Singapore (the world)? However, while the view from the top is nice, there really is not much to do if you are not going to have a meal/drink in the rooftop restaurant. However, if you combine a meal, SkyPark ticket, and ArtScience museum pass this place might be worth it."
,,"Lovely Views, shopping mall only if you have money",4.0,,Marina Bay itself is a lovely area. The Marina bay shopping area was nothing to rave about. Not many shops and no atmosphere. Would not bother again. Marina Bay Sands hotel observation deck is worth a visit.
,,Air-conditioned Horticulture Paradise,5.0,,"Definitely a ""must visit"" for tourists visiting Singapore. May be a bit artificial but who is to complain if you can find an air-conditioned park, a green house, a garden museum, a ""hoticulture's paradise !"" Entrance fee is a bit steep but worth the money. The Singapore government should be commended to push this idea through and create something for the public to enjoy. I enjoyed the cactus variety."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Visit the marina sands bay rooftop --- at 200 meters above the sea level, the hotels are a must visit. The singapore flyer is a must visit too, but it is at 165 meters above the sea level - but visit both :)"
,,Skypark,5.0,,"Skypark is the most amazing place to visit, trip is worthless if you have not been to skypark. The never ending swimming pool gives u adrenaline rush for the time u enjoy the surroundings. good place to have fun."
,,Something to experience,5.0,,"The shopping complex next to the Hotel is a must see, as is the hotel. The shear size and variety of shops is exceptional. Shops are a bit pricey but the foodhall is excellent value. Evening activities and light show is worth going to see."
,,A Must See Part of Singapore,4.0,,This is probably the most scenic part of Singapore's waterfront. We took the MRT to Raffles Place and walked along the riverside toward the waterfront and the huge Merlion fountain where tourists all clamor for pictures. From there you can see the Singapore Flyer and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (apparently the world's most expensive) with its huge 'boat' spanning the top of all three towers.
,,Cool Place,5.0,,You haven't been in Singapore if you havent gone to Marina Bay. Relax and enjoy the bay surrounded by modern skyscrapers! .
,,Excellent Commercial and Recreational Area,5.0,,"If are found of huge mall then its a must visit!! dont forget to walk towards merlion along the river from here in the evening. Its a costly place but you will find every brand and other intresting thing here . Best way to reach here is by river taxi from Clarke Quake Central. Try to cover Singapore Flyer , Gardens by the bay and Marina bay sand attraction by river taxi . Rather then MRT. its cheap quick and convienient too"
,,Beautiful both during the day and at night!,5.0,,"We walked for merlion garden to marina bay sands which took about 20 mins. When we entered the department store, the decor was incredibly beautiful and modern. We went shopping and had some snacks. You can find most of the luxury brands (LV) as well as affordable brands (Charles & Keith) inside this massive place. Definitely a must visit for all tourists in Singapore."

,,very nice place,5.0,,"Marina bay is must visit place in singapore. there is a boat ride as well , which is worth paying. Restaurants are expensive and better to carry food if you want to spend more time. excellent train and bus connectivity"
,,Fascinating area for walking,4.0,,"Catch the water taxi and enjoy city outlook on the way - same cost to go to the barrage and then wear your walking shoes and walk back through the gardens, through Marina Bay Sands Hotel, through the mall and around the Marina Bay precinct. Check out the Art Science Museum while you are there."
,,An evening in blissful environment,5.0,,"I have been given to understand that Marina bay is created by reclamation of land. you can spend a blissful evening around Marina bay which together with Singapore river, marina barrage and Merlin park forms a awesome complex of evening walk and relaxation."

,,Awesome,5.0,,Marina Bay is one of the most beautiful place in Singapore. The view from flyer is just too good. The shopping mall in the hotel is very good. One can spend hours outside hotel on promenade. Worth visiting.

,,the breeze is nice,5.0,,"我從clarke quay徒步走到sands, 也走到flyer, 是結合商業及海港的美麗地方! 若有預算可搭乘遊船, 雖然時間不長, 但可以體驗不同的角度看濱海灣~"
,,An interesting engineering achievement,4.0,,"Effectively Marina Bay has been created via land reclamation and the building of the barrage across the mouth of the Singapore River to create a fresh water reservoir. The Bay itself is really just a body of water, the main reasons you'll find yourself here is to check out the Merlion, Helix Bridge, the Barrage itself or Gardens by the Bay or to do some damage to your credit card at the nearby shops."
,,Beautiful.,4.0,,"Marina bay is a wonderful place to enjoy an evening while in Singapore. It's excellent for a pre-dinner walk along the water line. Of course, the place is also visitable during daytime, but the real charm of it starts at dusk."
,,Marina Bay area and Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"The bay is a good place to visit, especially at night when it is lit up. A good way to see it first is by bumboat a 40 minute trip for about $16. The Marina Bay Sands roof can be accessed by lift ($20 - 23) and gives unrivalled views. Beware to have a drink there is a bit more expensive as you might expect BUT after 6.00pm men have to wear long trousers,"
,,PHOTOGENIC!,5.0,,A must visit place for all the tourists! It is the most photogenic place in singapore! The surroundings are awesome. Nice view from all 360 degree

,,Stunning - so clean,5.0,,Great place to walk around and explore - also great to view from on the river by river taxi - day or night a stunning view with lots of history.
,,Irresistible!,5.0,,"It seems that wherever you go in Singapore you eventually end up in Marina Bay. Or at least we did. The Helix bridge, the waterfront, the shops and the restaurants, the breathtaking view of the business district during sunset, the light show in the evening is simply irresistible. Or very simply a walk at the basement of the Marina bay sands (not to mention the staggering view from the top) after dinner is truly memorable."
,,Good place to spend time in the evenings,4.0,,"The development has a mall, sound and light laser shows, fountains, a concert hall and a museum. Plenty to do, great people watching space"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,It you're lucky enough to get to the top the view is mind blowing. Otherwise just walking through this enormous building is worth a visit!
,,Go on have a sticky beak,4.0,,"Absolutely enjoyed walking through marina bay and soaking up the atmosphere of it all. There are heaps of shops for you to browse through and plenty of places to grab a snack or enjoy a sit down meal. There is also a casino there (make sure that you have your passport on you to show on arrival and when you leave). Wander the gardens (you wont be disappointed with them, they are spectacular). Leave yourself at least half a day to get around this complex so that you can take your time and indulge on the experience of it all."
,,Nice walk,5.0,,"This is amazing to see also shopping is really good in complex. There is a lot to see around area can spend the whole day there. Also there is a casino, food, hotels, gardens."
,,nice place to walk around,4.0,,"Somehow you always end up here when you wander through Singapore. And there is nothing wrong about that. Enjoy the view on the skyscrapers, Marina Bay Sands and so on. Have a look at the Light show at 8pm in the evening. Although it is not that spectacular.
There are some good places to ear. Especially just 50m before the helix bridge. It's a bunch of streetstalls which all serve fantastic food!"
,,A must visit place in Singapore >3,5.0,,"One in Singapore must visit this place, the heaven of Singapore. Everything here is so amazing that you enjoy every moment spent here and you carry some unforgettable memories with you......

The best thing about Marina bay is that everything is just next to each other, So its a one stop for everything you want to make your visit memorable."
,,good view,4.0,,"Good view of Singapore from the top, nice swimming pool. lay down on sun desk sip cocktails or wine will be a perfect evening for you."
,,Best place in Singapore,5.0,,We took many pictures here. See my pictures. No need to say anything else. We went there for 3 time during our 4 days stay at Singapore. We took some best pictures here and it was really memorable. We will always miss the place.
,,A real hub of hustle and bustle,5.0,,"This is a cracking place to walk around and take in all that Singapore has to offer.

At night this place is a hive of lights, food, fun and good times. During the Luna New Year celebrations there was a huge tent of food stalls, a fantastic show of lights that had the usual amazing back drop of more lights.

We took photos, looked around but most of all enjoyed sitting in the F1 stand with some Dim Sum taking it all in. You would be missing out big time if you didn't spend an evening here."
,,Lots to see,4.0,,There are often free concerts by a wide variety of performers ranging from classical music to pop dancing. I'm not sure if there is a programme listing events but it's fun to just go and take 'pot-luck'.
,,Excellent views,4.0,,"A nice place for travelers to enjoy. Especially you should go in the evening. I really enjoyed the light shows after 8.00 pm. I missed the casino. You should be careful if you are with family and want go back to hotel after the lights show, the Que for Taxi could be very long."
,,Good to see,3.0,,"Travelers are very easy to find the way, discipline are good, traveling way is very fast and can reach to every place within small time"
,,Great views,4.0,,"Went to their top most floor to savor their views of Singapore. We were not one bit disappointed. Great customer service and focus by the staff. Always polite and courteous. The dinner at 'RISE' was a bit on the higher end but what the hell, we were on a holiday !!"
,,Good for taking photos,4.0,,"Nice place, very good to take photos. Evening will be best time at around 7.00pm. You can take a walk and you can also see light shows after 8.00pm."
,,brilliant,5.0,,"Everything I liked about Singapore in one very large space, walking around there is so much to see, the cloud forest, the large metal trees, so much to see, you could spend easily 3 or 4 hours looking at all the different types of trees and flowers."
,,Stunning view,5.0,,"Me and my friends went thing both nighttime and daytime. At night, it's really beautifully ""decorated"" because of the city lights and all that. We even went see the light show. It's a amazing. Best of all, the light show is free(9:30pm or 11pm). The show has water, lights and some fire effects. It's a MUST SEE. During day time, it's a very clear city view. It'a a breezy windy area. I would recommend to go there. Around the place, it's all luxury shops like LV, Miu Miu etc etc. But overall, the buildings around it are nicely designed as well."
,,Absolutely Stunning,5.0,,The Marina Bay area is simply awesome with its stunning scenery especially at night. The awe inspiring Marina Bay Resort building dominates the Bay area with its Ship like rooftop and the Science Building that looks like a Lotus flower. There are too many things to list but this area is a must visit.
,,"A beautiful shopping, dining, walking area",5.0,,"This newer area in Singapore can be a destination in itself ! Hotel, casino, extensive shopping, live on- stage entertainment, gardens, waterfront walking and boating are all around you, even a skating rink inside the shopping mall.
Luxury names in shopping, plus tons of other stores. Mostly clothing, shoes and purses, vs. electronics.
Same thing in food; high end restaurants or a huge food court with many ethnic varieties of food.
It is very popular, especially during daytime and the evenings seem to have lighter traffic."
,,Worth a walk around,4.0,,"This area has developed really well. Lots to see and do. The new hotels look very appealing, as does the development of the bay itself. I was a bit limited in seeing this area properly on my most recent trip as it was F1 GP time which made it harder to get from one part of that area to another. Will have another look this year."
,,the only free thing to do in singapore - a must,5.0,,"beautiful place and for free in february the sun sets after 7pm, so dont go there at 6 like i did every single thing in singapore is overpriced... its good for backpackers also museums are free after 6pm"
,,Plenty to Entertain,5.0,,Always something happening day or night high end shopping or just strolling around then over to the gardens and a whole new world
,,Must see at Singapore,5.0,,This place the one of place you must visit in Singapore for the light show. You can also visit the Garden by the Bay.
,,MBS,4.0,,"Lots of walking,best to do late afternoon towards evening, went up to Kudeta,2 tigers were $37 as expected but sadly served by bottle, no glass was offered. View is worth the while and recommended.Great place to visit during evenings."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens and botanic houses built on reclaimed land. The gardens include great views over the water, some unusual sculptures and water features."
,,Great for Shopping,5.0,,If you're in to high-end shopping Marina Bay Shopping Mall is the place for you.. apart from the good food restaurants in the area.
,,Rooftop bar,4.0,,"Went to the Lounfe access bar at the top of Tower three which has spectacular views over Singapore. Excellent time had by us, but the price of the drinks served is absolutely exorbitant, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars"
,,Magnificent Marina Bay,5.0,,"This place is wonderful but don't just settle for 3.5 kilometre walk around the bay, if you like walking try the extra section that takes In the Heritage Trail, you will love it!"
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"Quite simply, it is a great development of Singapore. A pleasant was to enjoy a day at no cost. A level walking area all over, great for strollers or wheelchairs alike."
,,Great view,5.0,,A quick trip to the observation deck was rewarded with great views of the whole of Singapore and the 1000s of waiting ships in the bay.
,,Got to be done,5.0,,"Definitely got to visit. Obviously goes well with the visit to MSB. After disembarking from the MRT pop into the ice sculpture place on your right before the hotel itself. Meant to go to cool down but didn't get in. Take the tower 2 walkway across to the casino and shops. We wandered around lost which wasted time. Brilliant loads of shops, cafés and entertainment."
,,Just a must see place to visit,5.0,,Marina Bay is just a must place to visit with shops and bars the whole area is wonderful. The river taxis are so cheap 3 SGD for a trip anywhere around the bay or all the way up river to Clarke Quay with great views for so little money we used them all the time to get around.
,,Another great attraction,5.0,,Singapore is an amazing city with lots of great attractions. Marina Bay is very impressive the Merlion stands magnificantly overlooking the bay. Everywhere is spotlessly clean with many bars and places to sit. We were there the evening before Chinese New Year and there was a magnificent firework display which lit up the whole of the bay. The bars and restaurants are very modern but if you do like a drink you need to enjoy 'happy hour' which is 5.00 - 8.00pm as drinking in Singapore is very expensive.
,,Enjoy the bright side of life,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a fantastic place for entertainment and shopping. Magnificient, elegant region. Shiny business district, luxury hotels, You can feel the presence of money. Spectacular laser show at night, it’s an unforgettable experience. I love this city."
,,Human creativity,5.0,,"This is seriously the icon of Singapore and I mean it (although it doesn't matter :) ). Take circular rail link and go there. Walk around, eat, drink, visit Flyer, visit Gardens by the bay, just do anything you want and you will love it."
,,Good Place to spend an afternoon site seeing and taking holiday snaps,4.0,,"Good place to spend an afternoon as lots of picture opportunities and a nice walk around the bay to The Marina Bay Sands. There's lots to do at Marina Bay like Gardens by the Bay, eat by the bay, walk to marina bay sands, picture opportunities or meet up with friends like we did.just walk The area is quite scenic with the gardens, the bay and Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the background. We spent an afternoon taking pictures and walking around this area and had a great time. There's lots of interesting sights to be seen, well worth a few hours of your time."
,,Wonderful place to spend a day,5.0,,"There's tons to do at Marina Bay: Gardens by the Bay, eat by the bay, watch the kite flyers, bike, jog, or just walk around. The area is quite scenic with the gardens, the bay and Marina Bay Sands building in the background. I spent an entire day walking around this area and had a great time. There's lots of interesting sights and good food (although a bit pricey) at Satay by the Bay."
,,Water and light show,5.0,,"I had the opportunity to watch the water and light show at bay, and it was worth it. It's also a great place to walk around."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Where do I start marina bay is wonderful take a boat trip on the bay but you must go into marina bay sands hotel and visit the viewing platform the views are just amazing and take lots of pictures just stunning views and dont miss the shopping centre that too needs to be seen you won't regret coming to hotel mind blowing
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,We took a trip round Marina Bay in a junk boat which was the perfect way to see the sights. The Singapore Flier(tallest big wheel in the world) looks over the entrance to the bay and the world famous Marina Bay Sands Resort (three tower hotel with a large ship on top) towers above the bay on the left. The National Theatre Complex is on the right and here you can see the iconic Merlion. The bay leads to the river that takes you down to the quays! Lots of good food places there for all tastes. Each night there is a music and lights/laser show over the Bay - not to be missed.
,,Bay of the future,4.0,,Marina Bay has lots of attractions to keep the family interested. We especially like the Art Science Museum and the Ferris Wheel
,,Unbelivable,5.0,,Spent the whole day at marina bay. What an absolute treat. The shops are world class and there is nothing that you can't get there. There is a fantastic food court with a large selection of local food. The casino is one of the largest I have ever seen in the world. But you need your passport to enter. Lots to see and lots to do there. Great fun. Also the nicest Louis Vuitton store in the world
,,There is no place that is more beautiful than Marina Bay,5.0,,I couldn't think of any places in Singapore that is more beautiful and interesting than Marina Bay. Maybe Sentosa is the one. Lots of entertainment services in Marina Bay. One of them I love is Casino. Make sure you don't miss Water Show in front of Marina Bay.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Busy, exciting and entertaining. We made it in time for the water show and it was unique. The restaurants along the water are beautiful and relaxing. A boat tour also gives you a better view of the Marina Bay Sands. Facilities at the pools are great. The view from above is breath taking."
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,This is one of the most beautiful man made area anywhere in the world. The architecture is breath taking whether for the Marina Bay Sands or the Esplanade. You can take a boat tour. Just walking around is very relaxing.
,,It worth flying a long distance,5.0,,"I liked The Waterfall Show, that goes in front of the Shoping area - it's not that high but more sensual, with bubbles and fire."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is almost a town by itself. It is full of shops, places to eat etc. The views from the top of the Marina Bay Hotel are spectacular."
,,superb view,5.0,,"visiting the marina bay and the grand marina bay sands hotel,visit at night the view and laser show is spectacular as good as any worldwide"
,,Nice location,4.0,,Great view of a few attractions. Love the promenade and the way things have been designed. There are a lot of eating options as well as a high end shopping mall. Did a nice long run along the promenade on a weekend.
,,Marvelous,5.0,,Worth staying around the Marina Bay take lots of picture and eat lots of food from various cafes/ restaurants or just the hawker stalls that are famous around Singapore. I recommend staying here to shop/eat.
,,A very pleasant mall with great views,4.0,,"This is a very modern shopping mall with good restaurants, clean appearance and great location. The variety of shops is as good as most of Orchard Road (except maybe some of the top designer shops) and has a much better open feeling. Recommended when in Singapore."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"I recommend that you check it out. Better yet, book an overnight stay at the hotel. Definitely worth it!"
,,Take lots of money,5.0,,"Amazingm, what a shopping centre and had an amazing iced coffee just forgot the name of the place. had lunch at the 3 star Michelin restaurant, oh to eat like this everyday.... dream on."
,,Beautiful place to wander and explore,5.0,,"Marina Bay was definitely one of the highlights to our trip to Singapore.

We wandered around this area for at least half a day, doing some shopping, eating food from one of the many restaurants and cafes, and just taking in the scenery. Its very easy to get around, heaps of buses and trains are available, but we just walked until we found beautiful locations and photo opportunities.

Lovely. While in Singapore you must explore this area!"
,,"Brilliant Architecture, Upscale Atmosphere",5.0,,"There's so much to see here. The impressive Marina Bay Sands is such a brilliant man-made structure that's picture-perfect day and night. There's also a lights and sounds show at night along the bay that's free for everyone. Plus, there's a shopping complex at the lower floors of the building, teeming with designer stores, restaurants, and cafes for the upscale market.

It's a modern and high-end atmosphere that's virtually free from huge crowds. It's the perfect scene for postcard-quality photographs and a relaxing ambiance for those who are too tired of seeing busy streets and crowds of people.

Be wary though as the prices of the goods here are not for the budget-constrained. We cannot afford splurging on the stuff here, so we just dined in the food court area of the mall. There are great food selections here as well, although the prices are still a bit higher than anywhere else in Singapore."
,,Depressing view of what society may become,2.0,,"The harbour area (with the Helix Bridge at one end) is pleasant as facing across on to some older buildings i.e. a nice contrast between the old and the new.

The vortex-type fountain on the outside of The Shoppes complex is novel - but then when you go inside and see a 'false' canal and gondolas your heart sinks. Finally, you think, Singapore has crushed your will to live. Just shops, shops and more shops.

I am sure at odds with the vast majority of reviewers but just a slither of some culture would be nice."
,,Very nice waterfront,5.0,,"Take the boat ride, soak in the scenery, and take some great pictures. You can hop off and on one time too!!"
,,Amazing place to see during the day and night.,5.0,,Had a great time walking through the Marina Bay area. It has such a great view of the city and so many things to see up close. Well worth the time.
,,It is amaizing !,5.0,,"All the complex with Sands hotel and from the roof of sands, is one of the best and nice places we ever been."
,,Pleasant bayside shopping and relaxing,5.0,,Went to see the Merlion then caught the ferry over to Marina Sands. Lots of shops and basement food hall. Visited the Marina Sands viewing deck which was awesome and a must do for a birds eye view of Singapore.
,,Centre of everything,5.0,,Draw for example 2km or one mile circle around Marina Bay area and there are lots of major attractions. Whole Marina Bay area is simply stunning and something you get never tired to watch.
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,This is a spectacular place to walk around. There are many places to explore and the Architecture is some of the best that I have ever seen.
,,Competition to Dubai's Burj Khalifa and massive City Mall,4.0,,"Having been to Dubai a couple of times now with Emirates, you can see why Singapore had to build something like that in order to compete for customers. Orchard road might have been a great tourist attraction in the 90's but now it's a bit ""old fashion"", especially after seeing Dubai and its massive/luxurious shopping malls.
I certainly like the whole area, the fact that it's situated between the sea and the river with traffic all around gives the impression of a central hub to the area. Fancy shops (or shoppes as they call it) including Harley Davidson and Ferrari inside the complex. A mini Venise canal with little boats (no gondolas), ice skating rink (like in Dubai!), evening show on the water (like in Dubai!). but Singapore has its Grand Prix, Dubai hasn't... yet."
,,An experience!,5.0,,A futuristic architectural experience - this is a city with luxury shops & views. Enjoy the stroll have a coffee or a drink & pretend you can afford to stay there!
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,A must visit place for its scenic beauty and refreshing atmosphere. We visited this place in the first half of the day
,,Ok but..,4.0,,"Marine Bay Sands Shopping Malls are magnificient if you are a millionaire-I have never seen so many Designer Shops in one area. Unfortunately, there is a lack of decent Restaurants and Coffee Shops, which was all I wanted after walking around for a couple of hours."
,,Spectacular location,5.0,,Really amazing to visit this place at night. It has the enormous 3 high hotel buildings with a ship on the top - it has to be seen! A lovely place to visit after a trip around the Gardens by the Bay at night.
,,Once in a Lifetime experience,5.0,,Having travelled the world and seen most major hi rise constructions etc. I can personally recommend to all that the Marina Bay Complex is something not to be missed. The area is a world of entertainment and spectacular views.
,,Excellent to look at by night,4.0,,"We walked from the Flyer across the Helix bridge and down to the Marina. Before the Helix bridge if you go down the slope a bit there is a spot for some great photos of the Sands hotel, the Helix bridge and the science centre. We were there by night and the lights and the laser show off the buildings was very impressive.

The Sands hotel has an observation platform open to the public for a fee, worth a look although the views were not that different to those you get on the flyer. The shopping centre has all the name brand stores you would expect, and is open late.

Although the canal setup is impressive, it's nowhere near comparable to the Venetian Macau.

The sands hotel itself is architecturally interesting and impressive.

Nice views of the Singapore skyline looking back from the helix bridge, also."
,,Marina bay sands what a view,5.0,,We went to the observation deck at Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore and the view was spectacular. Great for photo opportunities and the price was quite reasonable. Its a must do experience if you are in Singapore.
,,"Nice place, for ordinary people more to watch than to buy...",4.0,,...the shops. Difficult to take a picture of the scenery of downtown if you dont take your tripod with you.
,,amazing,5.0,,"amazing view! for the first time going abroad, and visit this place. u dont have to pay for just looking around near park and river . im very pleased and i hope someday ill visit again.
tip: im visit on regular day which is theres not many people. just tourist. =]"
,,Great Place,5.0,,"Awesome ambience at Ku De Ta, next to the famous infinity pool at the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Excellent view of the city. Friendly staffs. Clean and refreshing every corner you go."
,,"Best for Shopping, gambling & spend $$",4.0,,"The absolutely nice place and enjoyable venue.

This place is designed to make you happy, spend your money.
I do not say the place is expensive but the environment makes you want to shop

If we are not considering full of luggage and most of the luggage had been packed for flight in the afternoon, may be I may end up buying 1 more luggage in this place"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"The building was awesome, great location, it was such a sight passing by there from below the hotel, and from the Merlion Park. It now serves as a symbol of Singapore."
,,Visiting Singapore? It has to be done!!!!,4.0,,"Walk across the stainless steel winding bridge to this iconic building with the hotel straddled by a huge concrete ship!!!, take the lift yo the top and visit the viewing gallery and be amazed!!!. I watched this building being built, to be able to walk thru the shopping mall and see it in it's full glory day or night this place stands out and never ceases to amaze me. The coiled winding stainless bridge that leads you to the shopping mall is in itself an amazing sight a real photo shoot. Looking over the water to the Fullerton hotel! the post office! the Singapore flyer etc the Singapore sky line is truly an amazing sight that need to be seen and enjoyed. Of course if you lime yo gamble then you may spend a lot more time in the casino, gold luck!!!!"
,,Marina Bay- A Must to Visit in Singapore,4.0,,Try walking around the Marina Bay area while in Singapore. Dotted with several hotels and shopping establishments. Not as crowded as Orchard Road and doesn't seem as cluttered. Walkways make it convenient for you to go around from one area to the other. Have comfortable walking shoes though.
,,A good place to visit even when you're not into Casinos,4.0,,"There is a shopping area for mostly high end items though as you go on lower floors, you'll find more ""affordable"" brands. There is a food court area too if you're craving for local/asian dishes. The place is huge so you won't feel if to be too crowded like the other malls in Singapore."
,,An unforgettable night view,3.0,,A night view around Marina Bay area is quite gorgeous and I don't think it's debatable. A lot of people are jogging around and mix of cultures can be appreciated. Different style of food choices are available around this area. Weather was perfect as well. Only disappointment to me was.. the size of area is far smaller than I thought it would be.
,,Another Marina in Singapore,4.0,,"Not sure why Singapore is so obsessed with the word Marina. Its so easy to get lost between Marina Square, Marina Walk, Marina Sands, Marina Link etc.. Anyway, this was our first time to the newer part of Marina and it was quite impressive. As with Singapore its all about shopping and food in a large concrete and steel structure. However, this is a pretty good one."
,,"I mean, it's the Marina Bay?",5.0,,There are very few man made landmarks in the world as attractive as this one. It is an absolute must see if you are in South East Asia.
,,Bustling Locality,5.0,,A very vibrant and bustling locality with the musical fountain in the evenings and the shoppes at Marina Bay offering the best is luxury fashion and a nice promenade around the lake.
,,Beautiful Views,4.0,,"ok,, Marina Bay Sands Hotel,, Impressive,, just do not eat there, too expensive.. take in the Malls,, eat at Beanstro,, 50 dollars for Two, not bad for the area,, but, allot to see and do in Marina Bay, take your time,, no charge to window shop!"
,,Incredible architecture,5.0,,Fantastic land mark. You have to pay to go to the top of the hotel. There is a mezzanine that will allow you to get a good look at the hotel lobby and take photos of the Singapore Flyer and surrounding area.
,,Cracking view but you pay for it,4.0,,"The view at Marina Bay is to die for, but be prepared to pay big money to enjoy a beer or drink or food whilst you admire it. One beer at a Marina Bay bar cost me AUS$15."
,,Awesome View at Night,5.0,,Visit here at night and you can just look around the marvelous view from pretty much anywhere you stand :)
,,Great for a relaxing walk,4.0,,"With an environment like the busy Singapore, this area provides a good relaxing weekend hang out place. And provides something for everyone, a mall for the shopaholics, a nearby Gardens By the Bay providing an outdoor oasis, an upscale hotel, a casino, and a promenade for those who just wants to enjoy the bayside."
,,Impresive building,4.0,,"Great view from the top of the building also plenty to see round about, shops very up market and rather out of our price range but nice to walk round and dream. The art on show at the time was a bit beyond our limited knowledge of the art world."
,,GOOD FOR DESIGNER SHOPPING,5.0,,Although designer shopping is not my forte I must say I was impressed with the amount you can do here!! Also a good range of restaurants.
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,We loved Marina Bay - walked around there and enjoyed it immensely. So much to see and do. There wasn't much there on my last visit to Singapore in 2000. The shops are high class.
,,Interesting area,5.0,,This is an interesting area with art exhibition centre and large shopping mall. Great views over the city if you go to the top of the building!
,,The structure...,4.0,,Nice building..nice place for photoshoot...nice place to hang out... Nothing much impressive...but yes..for those who shop high end bran may go there :)
,,Shop till you drop,3.0,,"Shops after shops after shops. Nearly all exclusive types such as Chanel, Prada etc which you can see along Orchard Road as well. All very expensive. The food is also either very expensive or really bad food court types or both! Only bought something at the chemist as the shops don't cater for larger ladies!"
,,upmarket shopping in pleasant surrounds,4.0,,"the shopping is expensive and many brands are located at marina bay. the ambience and setting is lovely and one does not feel that are in the usual mall type setting.
lovely restaurants, great take away places and tea/coffee places
the location on the river and near the museum make it well worth a visit."
,,Singapore by the water,4.0,,Marina Bay is surrounded by many of the biggest and best of the buildings in Singapore and can be explored by boat or on foot. If you go to their web site there are some trails to follow depending on what you're interested in. We were told that the skyscrapers had been specifically planned and built to give a three dimensional effect. In reality the result is spectacular especially when lit up at night. Great for shoppers but also some green areas to chill out and relax
,,glittering,4.0,,"As you could imagine, this is the wow panorama of Singapore. Enjoy the glutton food court on the esplanade."
,,A luxury shopping centre,4.0,,"The shopping centre there is a central place for all the big and luxury brand goods, even a shop to book a ride on Ferrari. If you want to try your luck, try the Casino!"
,,Most happening place,5.0,,It was gala time there on25th Dec. Almost all singaporian throng there to have fun and frolic. Atmosphere is electric in Marina Bay. You just don't feel like going back.
,,Stunning modern architecture,4.0,,This is a great example of modern architecture; it is also located in a close proximity to the Gardens by the Bay - well worth a visit.
,,nice area to explore,5.0,,"We wandered around Marina Bay and took a river cruise. The area is like a picture perfect postcard during dusk when all the buildings are lit up against the evening sky. You must stay and watch the ""Wonder Full"" show-a show with laser, lights, water and music. You'll be awed by this show. A MUST SEE. Also impressive is the Shops at Marina Bay Sands. There's an ice skating rink and boats going up and down the canal inside the shopping mall. Nearby is the helix bridge, a pedestrian walkway."
,,Nice to walk around.,4.0,,Nice to walk around and say you've been. Plenty of little things to see and do. A lot of attention to detail has been paid to the appearance of the area.
,,Bayeutiful !!,5.0,,A must see when in Singapore. Gives access to Garden City and the Merlion.Take a river cruise by day or night to get a better appreciation of the city and help you plan where to go when back on land. Spectacular views of some great modern architecture.
,,The very touristy spot in Singapore,5.0,,"The view is iconic with the great Marina hotel standing tall. You can see the Merlion spouting water through its mouth into the bay. Best time to visit is in the evening when the balmy sea breeze refreshes you.
But beware of crowd & noise and at times a shower.
Watch out for a little Merlion close by towards the main road about 50ft away from the real attraction. It is beautiful too."
,,Wow!,5.0,,This place is amazing to walk around. So big & spacious. We enjoyed having a coffee and cake at the waters edge and watching the boats on the canal.
,,Stunning,5.0,,Visiting family in Singapore. They took us to marina bay to watch the laser/ music display. It was purely magical and free as well.we would recommend it to anyone.... not to be missed
,,Marina Bay Sands Shopping Complex,5.0,,Whilst in Singapore it is interesting to visit the shopping complex opposite the Marina Bay Sands hotel. It is full of high end shops like Gucci and Prada. Like the rest of Singapore the complex is kept very clean and organised. The casino is also in the complex. The arrangement is Singaporeans must pay $100 to enter by all other nationalities are free. They even have a gondola ride inside the complex
,,The view is amazing.,5.0,,"I did not stay in the hotel. I went to the viewing deck and spent a couple of hours overlooking the sights of Singapore. Truely amazing, You can see almost to Malaysia.
Many many shopping options also, although only for the well off.
You should spend the day just walking around this entire complex. It is truely an amazing place. But what else would you expect from Singapore."
,,awesome view,5.0,,We paid 23 dollars for adult & 17 dollars for kids just for the entry to the marina bay but it was worth it.We couldnt see the infinity pool& the garden as entry was prohibited there but still the night view from the 56th floor was excellent &advise everyone to visit there once during your stay in singapore
,,Make sure you also visit at night,4.0,,A walk around the Bay especially at night is wonderfully relaxing. Everything is lit up and people are friendly and cheerful in such a wonderful setting. The Makkansutra Glutton Bay food market is well worth a visit. Take a river cruise to see all around the bay.
,,"Great place, must visit",5.0,,"Relatively new, if ure looking for shopping, casinos, good clubs, good food and great place to just sit by the river and chat Marina Bay is the place. It is definitely and must visit if ure visiting the city. In fact the next time I am so going to stay at one of the hotels in this location."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Of course this is a not to be missed place. The Helix bridge and Singapore Eye are really amazing. You can plan to visit this in the 2nd half of the day so that you can also see the sound and light show. They way they have maintained the entire infra is amazing.
,,Brilliant !,4.0,,"The place deserves all the accolades that come its way! One would be spoilt for choice on shopping , Adventure seekers will find their destination in the Splendid Casino there..fine eateries and restaurants .. Do take some time and explore all that Marina Bay has to offer! It sure will exceed the expectations!"
,,Excellent Walking Destination,5.0,,"This is a very large area with many components.
The Mall, Sands Hotel, Gardens, Waterfront Promenade and the High Rise Towers are a spectacular result for a large construction site only a few years ago.
It is an area best explored on foot.
The three level Mall is easy access from the MRT station.
Walk the length of the Sands hotel ground floor.
Visit the SkyGarden if you are happy with heights.
Easy to reach the Gardens by the Bay.
This is an area you can spend a day exploring.
The lighting at night changes the scene."
,,A great place,5.0,,"The best place to go for a walk and discover so much that Singapore has to offer. Not only is there the hotel and the great views from the top, but just next door is botanical gardens and on the other side is a fantastic shopping centre, complete with cafes, restaurants and casino.

It is very easy to spend a lot of time in the Marina Bay area, even easier when there is a train station underneath the shopping centre."
,,big price for big view,3.0,,not my cup of tea. great view but really short and nothing else to do up there. wouldn't recommend it unless you were desperate.
,,New Years Eve Fireworks,5.0,,We got in to the bay area around 6 pm and had a casual spicy dinner in the food hall. Outside around 7 pm we found a good spot to view the fireworks and chatted to some locals and watched the crowd grow. Soon enough we were delighted with the pyrotechnic display at midnight and followed the crowd back down onto the metro. Awesome Bay area
,,Refreshing and clear,4.0,,Escape the built up environs and go for a morning jog or walk at Marina Bay. Catch the floating soccer pitch or stop for a coffee.
,,great views,4.0,,"really spectacular inside and great views from the top, I made the mistake of not going just before sunset so only got to see it by day, I would recommend going when you can see by day and then night close to sunset"
,,Fabulous - factor this into your budget!,5.0,,It was just amazing to go to the 57th level and have a drink at Ku De Ta looking out over the lights of Singapore. We were able to watch the lightning in the distance whilst enjoying a very creative and enjoyable cocktail. Be prepared to pay for the experience as a glass of champagne is around about $36 SGD. Well worth it though.
,,Grand Prix Heaven!,4.0,,"We visited during the grand prix, so access was restricted to certain areas, but you could still see everything you wanted, the hop on hop off boat tour is a great way to view the whole bay!"
,,stunning,5.0,,"This is one of the landmark buildings that makes up the spectacular Singapore skyline. Yes, you pay even to go up to the top floor for the view, but boy oh boy is it worth it! Please google the building with its boat shaped sky restaurant if you cant goo there yourself. If you do go to Singapore, do yourself a favor and see this modern marvel..."
,,A world-class spectacle!,5.0,,"One must spend at least one evening dining on Marina Bay, then walking the circumference of the harbour..from the City to the Gardens to the Hotel. Visit the floating Louis Vuitton store and enjoy the nightly laser, music, video and water extravagana every few hours - it's over the top. Other water-based cities could take a page from this experience to keep people safely enjoying the harbour into the evening!"
,,Amazing,4.0,,Do visit the area. It's magical especially at the evening. Go for a stroll till the merlion and have a cup of coffee or dinner by the sea.
,,Interesting and Fresh,4.0,,"The Marina Bay area is definitely worth a visit when in Singapore. It is well laid out, and spacious. It reflects clever design. With quality shops, hotels and dining places, it has plenty to offer most visitors. The skyline is distinctive. The area is refreshingly new and modern."
,,Marina Bay Sands is unique on this planet...,5.0,,"Every time we come back, the palm trees at the top of Marina Bay Sands seem to grow bigger and bigger. The Chinese Engineers should have taken into account all the extra weight coming year after year but still : it's really impressive ! the fireworks for every New Year is a must and I hope you already assisted..."
,,Architecture originals,5.0,,"This whole area is filled with fresh ideas. Theres something everywhere you look, that honestly feels like youve never seen the likes before."
,,Best view of modern Singapore,4.0,,"Since Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and its surrounding waterfront has sprouted, it has no doubt become the most distinguishable skyline of Singapore today. Best place to savour this view no doubt is at the Lantern Bar at Fullerton Bay Hotel - we love it so much we go there every time we are in Singapore.

The laser light shows come up hourly - I think. We saw it at 11am, so worth checking out when it starts, but presumably from sundown ~ 7pm onwards."
,,Nice area,4.0,,We enjoyed walking around marina bay and looking at all the shops. The view at the top was outstanding
,,A must see by nightfall,4.0,,"A beautiful experience and water show that occurs at the evenings after the light show by the gardens by the bay. This is an abolute must see by all visiitng to really see the Bay come alive. Also, there is no charge and is really a beautiful night walk, with easy access to the MRT.
My suggestion is to walk through the hotel after the light show, and walk to the other side of the bridge. It is quite remote, so no tourists and being so high up, you get a stunning view of the whole city and even the water show. Honestly, discovering all this gems by mistake was the hihglight of singapore for me."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Go there at night and enjoy the laser show and the view. Also a boat trip is nice to explore the city and taking some photos.
,,Fantastic people watching opportunities,5.0,,"Shopping Malls with all the biggest names in high end retail-with prices to match, restaurants where you will be spoilt for choice."
,,Fairy tale view,5.0,,Love staying in this area and evenings are so much fun. There are so many places you can hang out . The way it has been planned is so amazing
,,Wow!!!!!!!,5.0,,"Nothing ever surprises me these days in respect of the amazing developments to be seen in Singapore.
And, Marina Bay will certainly not disappoint. It will be a scenario of cameras at the ready to snap the spectacular developments around Marina Bay. The Marina bay Sands Hotel is a magnificent view in itself with its three towers supporting the huge swimming pool in the shape of a boat at the top.
The National Theatre of Singapore is housed in one of the towers and superior shopping malls are in abundance where you can purchase all the latest designer clothes etc.....
Along with the rest of the local attractions the whole complex presents a spectacular scene for what is a small island.
Don't miss it if you visit Singapore!!!"
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"Marina Bay has an amazing view with the Fullerton Hotel on one side and Marina Bay Sands on the other. The skyline is also punctuated with the Singapore Flyer and the Merlion.

We took a walk around the entire bay and it took us a good one hour at a leisurely pace. There are many hotels where once can sit and have their food. There is also a Starbucks outlet for a quick coffee."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"We went here on the way to the Gardens by the Bay thinking it would be a quick trip, we ended up being there for hours. The shopping mall is huge and very impressive (it has a river running though the lower floor). The whole building is really impressively built and unique. We also dined at the Ku DeTa restaurant upstairs which was outstanding. The casino was average compared to many I've visited, nothing to special there. Overall, this building is a must-see. Next time I'd like to stay there and take advantage of that awesome looking infinity pool."
,,Essential Eames Done Well,4.0,,Special visit to see Essential Eames. Extremely well designed exhibit that covers considerably more than the famous chair. Only glitch was that the viewing screens for the many videos are small. Museum setting is spectacular and one of Singapore's best photo opportunities.
,,Marina Bay Mall is the best...GOLD!!!,5.0,,"I will be focusing on the mall since we did go around this area. Using the MRT, your last stop will be the Bayfront Station ( yellow line) after the Marina Bay Station ( red line). Most of the shops here are very high end- Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Chanel, Hermes, Dior, Armani ...to name a few are represented in this sprawling mall. Very nice, not so crowded.. Sephora (cosmetic) store is also here. One of the best malls in Singapore!!! We ate at their foodcourt and all Asian Countries have their respective counters. The Philippines is represented by Gerry's Grill... Nice!!! A three minute walk from the mall will take you to Gardens By the Bay.. just walk through the tunnel at the lower level. Have a grand time!!!"
,,New Years Countdown from a BOAT!,5.0,,"My cousins and I rented a local boat to take us from Clarke Quay to the front of the Marina Bay Sands for New Years Eve fireworks display, which was amazing!!

My cousin and I also walked around to the Merlion Park and we saw the Bay from the Skypark above. Just a gorgeous bay and a real pleasure to behold."
,,Wow?,5.0,,"We started our evening on the Esplanade, which gave us a marvelous view of the whole bay area. Clour shows, laser shows from the Marina Sands building all contributed to an aamazing experience. Drinks in the bar area and food in the street food food courts also made this an attraction that did not break the bank."
,,Amazing place!,5.0,,Great place as the day and night! Everything is clean and perfect - typical for Singapore :-) The best view will be from the Helix bridge.
,,A lovely location in Singapore,4.0,,This is a very pleasant part of Singapore which on our visit was being prepared for New Year celebrations. We enjoyed the laser light show which fantastic. Lovely eateries to enjoy
,,Lots to do and great views,4.0,,We were able to spend New Year's Eve at Marina Bay and it was quite nice. We also walked around the next day and did touristy stuff. Well worth a visit.
,,Light and Laser show,5.0,,"For a better view of the show, maybe you need to be at Esplanade or Merlion Park at the other side. We were standing near the LV infront of the Marina Bay Sands, hoping for a better view but some of the view was blocked an not clear as we were actually standing behind the laser show displaying area. Really love the environment there, the lighting, landscape, architecture, design and city skylines. Its really a photoshooting heaven and a place to chill too! Clealiness? Well, there is no such thing as ""dirty or filthy"" in their dictionary! every nook and corner are maintained well and clean!"
,,No expense spared!!,5.0,,Amazing place...could not afford to eat drink or stay here though. Expensive expensive expensive...We did go up to the skywalk and the views of Singapore were fanatstic..
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Even if you're not in the shopping mood you must head to the Marina Bay area. The shopping complex is one to behold - a canal with boats, a rain bowl, views across the river and of course access to the incredible Marina Bay Sands Hotel. For food head downstairs for value for money selections or partake in the restaurants on the top floor."
,,no idea why this is a destination,2.0,,It wasnt poor and it wasnt good. It was an decent place to stroll around to stretch the legs in the open air but the scenery isnt a big draw. If it gets too hot you go inside the shopping centre...like everywhere else in Singapore- a shop is never far away
,,Great view,4.0,,"High end mall, casino, expensive Hotel. Definitely worth a visit once while in town. Must bring your real passport to enter the casino. I hear the view from the top floor of hotel is fabulous but there is a charge of around 20 SGD."
,,"Great Place, Worth a visit",4.0,,"A great place to spend 5-6 hours. Can visit this place post afternoon and many things to do around.

Visit the famous Merlion, take a 45/60 minute boat ride followed by a visit to the ferris wheel. The boat ride will show the entire location around Marina Bay. If you have some time to spare then also visit Marina Bay Sands and spend time at the Sky Park and the casino.

All this can be followed by dinner at either Boat Quay or Clarke Quay.
Worth making this a part of your Singapore trip if time permits"
,,awesome mall,5.0,,"argueably the best mall in Singapore,situated close to marina bay with all the top brand shops like Gucci,visage,l Vuitton,many shops to choose from,with a huge food court...good luck getting a seat"
,,"Marina bay, Singapore",4.0,,"This is a very bustling place, with lots to do. The marina bay sands hotel holds a large shopping centre, outside In The evenings there is a fountain and laser show which is amazing. You can go up to the top of the hotel to enjoy the city views, but go to the bottom of the third tower and get access to the bar as it is free (only to buy a drink) whereas the sky deck is $20 each and the view Is the same. Across the bay is gluttons bay hawker food area, try the chilli crab - excellent! There is also an art and science museum.just to walk around this area of Singapore is worth it, all the things going on are a bonus!"
,,Very nice,4.0,,The area is a little bit out of the way but easily accessed by MRT or bus. The mall there is out of this world. I've never seen a bigger mall.
,,Lovely marina striking skyline,5.0,,"Visited the marina which includes lots if free stuff from floating football pitch, science museum , unique Soave malls with a river running through them , amazing sky line , and bonus saw the grand price track it's a great way to spend the day lots to look at , admire, or simply stroll around wether your 20 or 80 + a very modern marina with lots of high quality bars and restaurants !!!"
,,Wonderful skyline and architecture,5.0,,"Wonderful area in the heart of the city of Singapore. Musts to visit are Merlion, the Skypark on top of Marina Bay Sands and Helix Bridge. Personally I preferred visiting Skypark instead of the Singapore Flyer. It's cheaper and the view is better. I also can suggest a river cruise by night. Then you see the skyline of Singapore from Marina Bay and Singapore River. A good place to make photos from the Singapore skyline is Marina Barrage."
,,Do it especially at night,5.0,,Take a long walk along the marina at night see the shows of lasers and water at 8 and 9.30 pm it is really worth it walk all around the marina from marina bay to Fullerton
,,Holiday Gem,5.0,,Loved wandering through the shops and eateries in the Marina Bay area. Bought some really great gear (and an exquisite pair of earrings) and ate really good food. Never tired of 'just wandering.
,,A Good Walk,4.0,,"A nice walk around the Marina taking in the shops at Marina Sands Resort, part of the f1 track and the statue of the merlion. Still under some regeneration but still worth the walk."

,,A nice place to walk about,5.0,,"I basically just walked around it a lot, on one occasion it was stop/start monsoon rain but around the edge of the bay are solar powered shelters that sense when someone is underneath and a big fan starts up, very refreshing and very clever."
,,Do it,4.0,,"I think everyone would do this excursion anyway, and it is impressive. The light show, whilst brief, was good."
,,Lovely walking area,4.0,,Very nice to walk around and relax. There are great restaurants and shops and you can walk your way across the bay and to the Singapore Flyer.
,,It's a must see,4.0,,"It's a marvellous, new age construction. Easy to get to as the train station (MRT) is underneath. Shops are at the high end. Very clean. Nice place to get out of the humidity. 8pm each night has a water and laser show."
,,Visited for dinner and drinks,5.0,,"My friends and I visited Marina Bay for dinner and drinks. It was very costly, but an excellent experience. The views over Singapore are phenomenal. While we were there a light show was going on in the harbour below, so we had the best views looking down. The rooftop is certainly not for the faint of heart as it is incredibly high."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I visited on the Friday night whilst the F1 was in practise I was sat in a bar near the Merlion and lucky me happy hour two large Australian reds for price one, sat listened to the cars race by, guzzled the wine and watched the light show in the bay wonderful time"
,,D BEST,5.0,,"This is Singapore's Iconic structure, Shopping mall, Casino in short the place to be. If you visit Singapore then this is the place to be, to stay to eat to go for clubing and also for shopping.. Must visit."
,,Great run with essential sightseeing,5.0,,"A quick 5km run and you'll get close to the Merlion, theater hall, art and science museum and Marina Bay sands while doing a loop around Marina Bay. It was empty around 8am so it felt like I had it to myself."

,,Nice for walking and watching,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore visiting the Marina Bay is a must do. After dinner, my family took an enjoyable stroll in the bridge while we were met locals jogging in the area. Then we sat by the benches facing the bay and just enjoyed the view. So beautiful! I think you can spend all day visiting! The sights at night is beautiful with the highlight being the Marina Bay light and water show. It is also a place that offers pleasant shopping experiences and a variety of eating venues.
It's a must see and I'm sure you'll agree when you see it for yourself."
,,Great when viewed from the water.,4.0,,"If you like food, this place is a must. Try to be seated before 8.00pm to take advantage of the Happy Hour drink discounts. River Cruise is a must, 40 minute cruise is just long enough to take it all in."
,,Beautiful Place,4.0,,"Love the lights and water show during the night, it is amazing and wonderful show. The place is high end shopping, variety of foods and shops in one place. The place is clean, wonderful environment and safe."
,,My first time,5.0,,Its good scenery for a first timer like me. One of the best landmarks in Singapore. A huge shopping mall and classy one. If I visit again will probably stay in their hotels. We watched a light and sound show for free.
,,This place is a complete knock-out,5.0,,"The area looks marvellous, you come there and don't wanna leave it anymore. It's just beautiful. The shopping centre, however, is just fantastic - the structure, composition, overall atmosphere and of course the shops and shops and shops - a truly great place to visit."
,,Nice area for a walk or a drink,5.0,,"If you can stand the humidity, it is a great walk during the day. But in the evening, when it gets somewhat cooler and the humidity somewhat lower, the bright lights and the light breaze make it a wonderful way to enjoy the scenery and just take a nice long walk in the area."
,,Too concrete nothing spectacular.,3.0,,"Tall skyscrapers surround man made bay. Too commercialize anf at time noisy. None of the building stand out. Look alike elsewhere in any other metropolis. Whenever any event hold nearby, traffic standstill overcrowded. Good eyeopener for rural folk but not to many. Can give a miss if you are in Singapore."
,,An Eye Opener,5.0,,"Very impressive, awesome buildings - recognized worldwide as icons of Singapore.
It is a memorable walk around the bay taking in a lot of interesting attractions. A walk around the shops at the base of the Marina Sands Hotel is worth the look - but don't expect to buy anything unless you have a loaded wallet!
Great place for photographers.
Not to be missed if you have a stop-over in Singapore. All attractions are within walking distance and transport in and out of the area at your fingertips."
,,Beautiful views,4.0,,"Come and take a walk around the bay to see the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Merlion, the Durian theatres and get great views of the city."
,,A beautiful walk at dawn!,4.0,,"This is one place couples would love to visit! ... Located just below the iconic Marina Bay Sands Convention Center, one can take a lesiure stroll around the entire bay area withness the beautiful city lights and dazzling lasers from the top of the MBS hotel. Remember to whip out your camera for that momentous shot!"
,,You can spend hours gazing at the bay,5.0,,"Marina bay Singapore is not just like any other bay as it holds many attractions by its side.for me the best time to go around marina bay is at night stand still and see the bay presents you a beautiful performance .waves laugh out loud,the lights run across the bay and the bay gets enchanted when the Singapore flyer by its side go wheeling and the lights poured on its face .the light show doubles its charm as the bay has its quite spell working on you.go on staring at it and you will feel rejuvenated."
,,Gorgeous bay; try to get a view from above,4.0,,"Whether you want to go sailing, take a ferry ride up the river, or just want to walk the edges and people watch, this bay is gorgeous. You have to see it at least once on your trip. There are many high-rise buildings around the bay, several of which have viewing towers that you can get to for a small fee, and I highly recommend the view from above."
,,Clarke Quay to Merlion.....a nice walk,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a perfect contrast to Singapore - its got a character, bold, unpretentious & free willed, unlike other public areas where people don't put down their guards.

We reached after 7.30 on a Friday night and first thing that caught our attention was brightly lit restaurants lined on one side of the river & the towering slings which takes their brave travelers screaming on a vertical or horizontal journey.

Like all other attractions the River cruise comes with a hefty fee of S$ 20, so we decided to take a long walk. Clarke Quay which is full of quirky characters and I have to write about this Turkish Ice Cream seller, next to River cruise booking booth. if you are willing to part with S$5 which includes free embarrassment he puts up a show which is most entertaining and you will remember it for some time. The bridge connecting the both sides of river and subway are platforms for amature singers, performers - don't know true or false but I heard they are issued license by the local authorities.

You can taken a good 40 minutes leisure walk from Clarke Quay via Boat Quay, Parliament, Asian Civilisations museum, Fullerton Hotel and then to the Merlion. This long walk in the evening in not very bright lights and slightly away from hustle bustle (if you walk from the quieter side of the river) is very refreshing. You will be able to see some office buildings and timeless beauties like Fullerton basking in their glory in the night.

From the merlion you can see the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore flyer at a distance.

You have many options of eating - but could be moderate to costly. Recommended for all, unless you have young children."
,,Beautiful scene is priceless,5.0,,"The best view in singapore. Always there every weekend as i live near the area. Always amaze with the view. It is connected to marina bay hotel, casino, shops and garden at the bay is within walking distance"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Went to the marina bay hotel to the reservation deck the views are amazing, we wished we had stayed there now because the rooftop pool is amazing and."
,,Modern Singapore for everyone,4.0,,"Make sure you have your walking shoes on, and go from the old former seafront right around the bay to the gardens - make a day of it. Locals as well as tourists do the same, but the development is spacious enough not to feel crowded. There's a range of cultural centres including a theatre and museum along the bay, which is also home to the F1 each year; this being Singapore there's also a shopping mall and a hawker centre (with surprisingly genuine and good food) But really, just enjoy people-watching along the esplanade and the Helix Bridge"
,,"A ""must visit""",4.0,,"You must visit this place just to see how over-the-top a hotel/ shopping complex can be. This coupled with the casino makes the visit a must, but once seen you'll probably never return, even if you re-visit Singapore. Singapore isn't cheap & is also sterile, so once there visit the major sites & leave the rest to the Singaporeans."
,,Futuristic,5.0,,"the view at night from d event plaza, outside the shoppers marina bay sands, is AMAZING!!! you will be opp. the Merlion n d financial district of s'pore with d sky scrappers n d lighting plus modern architecture . better stay for their WaterLight show, it's spectacular and a cut above water shows exhibited around d globe. Mind staying there for the whole night, and go to d helix bridge n hav a different view of marina bay."
,,Great sightseeing,4.0,,"Good to visit both in day and night. Light show at 8pm nightly worth seeing. Marina bay shops very expensive, both definitely worth a look around."
,,Futuristic and impressive,4.0,,"Impressive redevelopment of what was once the shore. Layers of history, and now being turned into a fresh water bay. Loved the juxtaposition of the new, colonial and the old. Would have loved to see inside the durian opera hall. Clarke Quay is worth a visit. Must be a humming place at night but is full of history. Take a tour at the Selangor Pewter shop. Fascinating."
,,Singapore in one place,5.0,,"There are dozens amazing places you can visit here: Merlion Park, theater durian, Singapore Flyer wheel,buildings Marina Bay Sands, Art Science Museum.

,,Breathtaking View,4.0,,"Great place to visit and enjoy the wonderful Singapore sights. i spent there, it is awesome. make sure you see the marina bay sands light show in the evening at 8:00 PM"
,,A new Singapore visitor focal point- and a MUST!,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Area is a new development in Singapore, involving significant land reclamation, then major development.

It's an ambitious project which appears to have been executed successfully: creating a new tourist focal point in Singapore, which means it should be added to the list of places to visit.

The area is readily accessible by MRT.

There are a wide variety of attractions, catering to a variety of tastes and budgets:

- the nightly free light show
- the Gardens by the Bay- an audacious botanical garden with two large indoor gardens
- the Sands casino, entertainment and shopping complex, as well as the SkyPark
- the ArtScience Museum
- the Helix Bridge
- the Waterfront Promenade
- Merlion
- Singapore Flyer

You could easily spend an entire day in this area!

Well worth a visit"
,,Singapore the amazing!,4.0,,"This city seems to reinvent itself every so often and the Marina Bay is the latest(?) example.

At night it is magical. I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and it is an architectural marvel.

Singapore Eye and other amazing buildings make this corner of Singapore a great place to visit, at least once."
,,Beautiful setting for an inner city,5.0,,"The Marina Bay area is stunning, particularly when you consider it is all reclaimed land and completely man made.

My suggestion - come evening, take a gentle walk around the boardwalk and a seat outside the centre of the Marina Bay Sands shopping Centre to view the twice nightly light show (free). Watch the magic unfold - pictures played on the fountains, fire and music make a great visual treat, then ignoring the food courts in the shopping centre gently walk back to the link mall and have supper at Din Tai Fung. Great dim sum at a reasonable price."
,,Sophisticated view,4.0,,Marina Bay is a landmark that shows how Singapore becomes a great city. It's just so stunning to see big and high building around. Walking around keeps me wonder how do they build this? It's just so worth to see it.
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Marian Bay is an area in Singapore with the great Hotels, easy access via subaway and some good shopping malls. One of my best attractions is the restauraunt on the top floor of the Pan Pacific Hotel with stunning views of the city while enjoying luxurious dinners."

,,Nice way to relax and stroll around Marina Bay,4.0,,Its a nice area to just walk around and spend some time. Its normally a little cooler down there so nice to hang out and have a drink. Good views of the skyscrappers and just arounx the corner is the bars and cafes of Clarke Quay.
,,Great at night,5.0,,Marina Bay is just beautiful! So much to see and really enjoy. We walked for a while and loved the views and all the city buildings and lights against the water. Not too far from Sentosa and really worth the visit at night if you like city lights like me!
,,Breathtaking views of modern Singapore,4.0,,"A walk around the area is a must do for a visit to Singapore.

The view from the bridge of the Marina Bay Sands, Merlion Park with the old Fullerton Hotel against a backdrop of skyscrapers is lovely.

At the other end you have the stage where concerts are held in the evening, a hawker style food area and the Flyer.

Lots of things to see, do and experience."
,,Perfect!,5.0,,The view was amazing! We could see the city all around us. There was plenty place for everyone up there!
,,"Shopping, museum, casino, fabulous!!",4.0,,"Great to hang around for those who like shopping malls but beware backpackers, it's expensive here, even the food in food court. There are garden, casino, museum nearby and free laser show at certain time everyday. You can even say that this is the new Singapore symbol replacing Merlion!"
,,A Exceptional Place to visit,5.0,,A design and inspirational marvel and a credit to Singapore to construct such a complex. Environmentally sustainable. Visual wonder. You can spend days here as there are many things to see and do. The overhead walkway is well worth a visit . Climb through the tree structures to obtain a panoramic view of the complex. Highly Recommended
,,an architectural achievement,5.0,,"Must see! An exceptional architectural achievement. To visit also inside. A lot of exhibition spaces, recreation, shopping, restaurants, bars and ... mandatory pool floor 57. You can't bathe (unless you are staying at the hotel), but take the elevator to see."
,,Great destination,5.0,,This is fabulous area to spend a good half day. From fullerton hotel visit merlion and walk over the bridge and along to the eye. Second bridge to the Marina Bay Sands complex.
,,"""Breath-taking view""",5.0,,"The moment I saw the place, I was mesmerized. I just love to sit there and see the view, chat with friends, walk around, take photos and dine in the food stalls when I feel like eating. It's an amazing place to relax and unwind. I loved it!"
,,Amazing location,5.0,,"A locale which offers all the activities you can think of - amazing riverfront, great location to talk an evening walk, walking distance to places like Gardens by the Bay and lots more.

,,Pleasant walk at any time of the day,5.0,,"Very relaxing and spotless clean. Do not miss the water and light show at the marina at 9pm, truly superb. The shopping centre by marina is great, clean and so quiet compare to Hong Kong. Grab an ice cream and enjoy ride on the gondola inside the shopping centre."
,,Time to walk!!,5.0,,"A very good place to take a walk in the evening beside the tallest buildings, early visit in the evening is advised for photography"
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"This place is a fantastic picture of modern Singapore. The architecture is amazing. For me this is the best place in Singapore. It is also close to the gardens of the Bay, so you can make a perfect one day walk around."
,,"Place for people from all walks of life to explore,exchange & entertain",5.0,,"Located at the Southern tip of Singapore, Marina Bay has a mix of uses including commercial, residential, hotel and entertainment. It is a place for people from all walks of life to explore, exchange and entertain. There are apartments set amidst lush greenery near Singapore 's waterfront. The local community and visitors alike can enjoy the parks, waterfront promenade and attend the events and celebrations held at the Bay.

,,Nice little walk,4.0,,"If you can deal with the heat, this is a nice little walk - about 5k in all. Perfect for photo opportunities, seeing some of the f1 track or getting some respite in the mall or one of the many restaurants on site."
,,WOW,5.0,,"This is amazing to see also shopping is really good in complex. There is a lot to see around area can spend the whole day there. Also there is a casino, food, hotels, gardens. Great had fun."
,,Put On Your Walking Shoes,4.0,,"Take the MRT to Raffles Square. From here you can walk to the Merlion and view the Marina Bay Sands Hotel across the Bay. You can then walk in either direction around the Bay to visit the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Singapore Flyer or the Gardens by the Bay. To walk around the full circuit would take about 3 to 4 hours or more including time for taking photos and a drink or two. It would be a pleasant way to spend either a half or whole day. Also take the opportunity to visit the Fullerton Hotel which is near the Merlion and the beautiful Fullerton Bay Hotel - this is what all hotels should be like. It is near the Fullerton Hotel and I have had the pleasure of staying there several times."
,,Marina Bay with Chilli Crab,4.0,,pricey area to eat and drink but well worth it for the views. We went for Chilli Crab at Palm Beach at Marina bay - Pricey but an experience. You are paying for the rent of the property as well as the food and drinks but with views of Merlion and the Singapore flyer it was worth the spend.
,,Unbelievable View,5.0,,"this place i visit in october 2013 and i can't forget the moments i spent there, it is awesome. make sure you see the marina bay sands light show in the evening at 8:00 PM and take some shots from Helix bridge."
,,Wonderful view of the harbor and city,5.0,,Great place to visit and enjoy the wonderful Singapore sights. Easy to get to with numerous other attractions nearby. Recommend for a family.
,,What a place to just take in,4.0,,"We didnt stay at this hotel but we thought we take the mrt to this hotel that everyone talks about, on arriving we couldnt believe how massive this building is and how beautiful. We walked through this hotel and its so stunning to look at we went at around 6.00pm, the children we so impressed by the size of this hotel and the glamour as we had seen it many times before on a program called mega constructions, even the shopping mall was impressive but very pricey, we where told that they was a laser and firework show happen at 8.00pm so we stayed there and watched the show which was great to see, the children enjoyed it, but if you are in singapore this hotel is a must just to either stay or just visit like we did as its amazing just to look at"
,,Not bad,3.0,,Very crowded place. Shopping feel more expensive compare to other location. But good to do window shopping.
,,"Overrated, nothing more than a new shopping mall",3.0,,"Nice location, good view of Singapore skyline. But nothing spectacular to do other than shop around in the mall. Promenade is more exciting on the other side in Clarke Quay. If you are pressed on time during your Singapore visit, you can skip this for lots more exciting places."
,,Marine Lines of India... This one is a superior one,4.0,,"A big stretch of 6 km around the Singapore river
More pleasant in the evening
Covers a lot of places such as the Merlion, the light and sound show, Marina Sands hotel, garden by the bay, clarqe Quay and a lot of malls and buildings
Can also be seen through the River cruise which can be done for 20 Sing dollars"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Brilliantly located and constructed I have studied in singapore for more than a year and the this was the best place to visit perfect for proposal birthday hangout mischief
,,Wow what a view,5.0,,"Headed to the marina bay for dinner, lots of choice restaurants good atmosphere with bars music and good food. You are in prime position for a fantastic light show across the bay. We had a fabulous night."
,,Not to miss in Singapore!,5.0,,"One does not need to spend when you roam around this area. Don't forget to bring your camera and extra battery of course! Surely a site that will feast your eyes both in architecture, culture and the scenic view of this tiny island. Singapore is clean and advance. It grows harmoniously with nature as well. You will just get this feeling that you are really in a wonderland!

There is also a great place to eat nearby the Marina Bay as the mall really is a high end one, so make sure to bring more money if you are a shopaholic :) Also wait for the free water-light show at night! IT'S A MUST SEE! <3

I have to agree that it should really be called Uniquely Singapore!

Want to know more? send me a tweet at nathan11sison :)"
,,Really More For the Upper Crust...,3.0,,It's pretty and nice to look at but the stores inside are definitely not wallet friendly. Also my mom mentioned that the Marina Bay Sands Casino had old machines! I can't say as I don't gamble but that's what she mentioned.
,,Beautiful both day and night - great sights and architecture - don't forget your camera,5.0,,Beautiful both day and night - great sights and architecture - don't forget your camera - grab a tasty chilli crab at Jumbo's near the MRT. Walk down by the Marina to the strip of restaurants and bars and take the corner to the street behind parallel to it and you will find great local places for a fraction of the Marina Bay prices - you will see the real local Singapore and will not regret the experience.
,,Awsome,5.0,,The place was awesome and clean. There were so many sights to see just around the area and just walking along the bay was a pleasure
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Great to wander around the fantastic buildings that are here. The whole area is amazing with lots to see & do.
,,The Fullerton and the Marina Bay Sands ...,4.0,,If you take the magnificent boat ride try to get the 21:10 or 21:15 boat as this will take you to the M B S by 21:30 when the laser show starts on your way you can see the flyer the parliament and the tall bank buildings al illuminated with the Clarke quay .. just worth watching ..
,,beautiful bay scenery,5.0,,"Love the way they beautify the area ... almost perfect ! the clean water , the Merlion park , the art museum , the Marina Bay Sands , flyer and Garden by the bay"
,,"marina bay sands hotel , casino and bay",5.0,,"marina bay sands hotel is lovely ,we walked around the artistic gardens and the foyer to the shops , it was too expensive for us to go up the marina bay sky park observation tower 3 as we did the Singapore flyer and saw more from what our friends saw, so we just walked around the bay and visited the casino .. make sure you have your passport for entry , the tower 1&2 with the pool, bar ,restaurant is for guest only with a key , the bay is lovely all round shops, restaurants free entertainment on the river"
,,Marina on the Bay,5.0,,As with Singapore everything is huge!! I went to the roof top which overlooks Singapore and is breathtaking. Would have like to have spent more time there.
,,Roof Views Galore,5.0,,"When in Singapore, visit the roof top deck at the Marina Sands Hotel. It is well worth the $20 to see a unique view of the city and the harbor."
,,Must see at night,4.0,,Perfect area for a night stroll. Many restaurants in the area. Be sure to watch the light show at top of the hour. Get a close up view from the marina bay hotel area or from water
,,Amazing Skyline!,4.0,,The high rise buildings are beautifully designed and maintained. It's definitely worth a visit. A cheeky tip is that if you want the best view of the Marina Bay you should visit the Level 33 bar in one of the skyscrapers and you get a view over Marina Sands and the rest of the Marina - perfect for pictures.
,,Marina Bay Singapore. worth a visit,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, definitely you need to visit this place. Well maintained, lots to do, see, shop, and eat of course. If possible, visit during the weekday. The place will be less crowded with locals."
,,What a view!,5.0,,The Marina bay area is definitely stunning. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is especially breathtaking. The building in itself is surreal and the view from the platform is even more fantastic. At night there is a 3D water and lights show which is absolutely worthwhile.
,,Amazing hotel!,5.0,,"after having a tour to the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel to check out the amazing views, we watched a laser light show on the waterfront! This was beautiful! an amazing show not to be missed!"
,,Great Location!,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed walking around this area! Didnt get a chance to go to the top of MBS hotel. next time hopefully
,,amazing water front,5.0,,nice to take photos from water front. nice amazing view of the Singapore city. you can walk around. sleep all night in marina bay area. really safety zone. and no one will annoy you
,,Brilliant Place for all,5.0,,Simply like all the available that is on this beautiful spot in Singapore. For families with or without Children....
,,Luxury at its finest,4.0,,Great place for shopping and dining if your budget permits. The fountain & light show at the deck is a must-see!
,,Check out the views,5.0,,Im not great with heights and I admit I was a little scared when on the observation deck. By its totally worth it. A visit to Singapore shouldn't omit this attraction. Great views & photo opportunities. Not crowded when I was there.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We visited Marina Bay both during the day and night. Its better at night with all the tall buildings surrounding the area beautifully lit up. The merlion, flyer, gardens by the bay are all very beautiful. Also there is a light and sound show which can be seen from the merlion park. Its all just so beautiful."
,,clean man made marvel,4.0,,Nice architecture but bring your own water. no need to walk very far. Pleasant weather in October. Good if you like clean and man made marvel
,,Awesome night view! Must watch the light show,5.0,,"Marina bay is a must-visit in the night light. The Merlion, Marina bay sands park, the flyer and all other tall buildings are lit up just wonderfully fell. the light show that happens in Gardens by the bay can be watched from the other side as well. It is simply breathtaking in the night. Our first visit was in the day time. My husband insisted we visit again in the night. we went there around 5:30pm spend time strolling around the bay waiting for the sunset and watched the area light up. the wait was just worth it!Don't miss the Marina bay with the night lights."
,,"Beautiful and over-the-top, Singapore style",5.0,,"Beautiful views of the bay and the city from the walkways. Inside, the shopping arcade and facilities are top notched and air conditioned. The view from above is dizzying, especially for those with altitude challenges. Very memorable."
,,Marina Bay worth a visit.,5.0,,We boarded the Singapore River tour boat at Clarke Quay and cruised to the Marina Bay complex. Relaxing way to get there rather than taking a taxi and learned a bit of history along the way. We toured the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome and I recommend both but we enjoyed the Cloud Dome best. Then we walked around the gardens for a while and adjourned to the Ku De Ta Lounge on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for cocktails. Fabulous 360 views of the city and the bay.
,,walking excercise,5.0,,fresh air. and all the choices of restaurants almost all offering chili crab in their menu. casino is also nearby and nice to observe the activities here if you dont play
,,Cool spot to relax,4.0,,"Marina Bay obviously attracts the tourists for it 'newness', great views, waterfront location and general vibe. But it also attracts a lot of locals, so it's certainly not just a 'tourist stop'. Whether you're on your way to or from the Marina Bay shopping complex, hotel or casino, dining in the area, enjoying a cool beer or just an evening stroll or a morning jog if you're really keen, this is definitely a spot not to miss. Hang out on the Marina Bay Sands side and enjoy the cityscape, or dine on the other side of the river at one of the many (overpriced) waterfront locations and enjoy the view of the amazing MBS hotel as well as their laser show."
,,Great Location,5.0,,Excellent views all around. Be sure to bring camera as you will want to capture the sights in and around the Marina Bay
,,Great vibe and environment,4.0,,"Spent a couple nights over here with new friends, stayed at a couple bars and it was pretty laid back. Definitely go out of a night, the cityscape by the water is great."
,,Unbelievable creation,5.0,,"The place at first looked normal to me, just like a big pond. But after learning some “feng sui”, I had my salute on Singaporean architects. It might hard to believe, but I think this giant feng sui set has brought fortune to the country. Way to go Singapore!"
,,What a Complex!,5.0,,"really is worth a visit we did not stay in the hotel but had a cocktail on the roof top. The view of Singapore spectacular especially at night with all of the lights. The shopping centre is fantastic with a great choice of stores and as is everywhere in Singapore very clean. Give yourself lots of
time because there is so much to see and do. Architecture is amazing."
,,It's Well Worth the Visit,5.0,,"We visited in May and it was hot, we decided to travel from town by train to this location. We found our way to Marina Bay and saw many more things by travelling on the train it was well worth while. We arrived in what seemed to be the middle of a park, but looking around the sights were staggering. The size of the buildings with what appears to be a boat on the top soon got the camera clicking. Night time lighting is very well done and the buildings take on another perspective.

Take your time, use a map and drink lots of fluids in the heat. Will visit again."
,,Stroll the Promenade,5.0,,Great outdoor area which gives a tired tourists feet a chance to recover! Plenty of seating so that you can sit & enjoy an uninterrupted view of the City & admire the architecture! Grab a ferry trip up the river - fabulous!
,,Awesome place!!,5.0,,"Beautiful place to be.. Really recommended for anyone who is in Singapore.. Easily reachable by MRT.. Suggest to watch the water light show from 2 different places, as both give different effects, of course the view from Marina Bay Sands Hotel is nicer.. =)"
,,Take the walk steady,5.0,,"Don't rush it! A stroll around the bay is very rewarding, but it might be best done in stages. Get a map which highlights the various attractions and stop for refreshments."
,,New landmark,4.0,,This building dominates the skyline and you can't be impressed with the size and design of it. High class shopping centre is underneath and worth a look even if you can't afford to buy. Very impressive.Include with a visit to Bay of Trees as each are close together and share a walkway.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"As you come out of the Marina Bay Shopping mall, there it is! And luckily enough for us, it was being set up for the Grand Prix. Plus, each night is a laser light show with music that will blow your mind."
,,great,5.0,,the best and most unusual hotel in the world. three towers and infinity pool on top of them water is crystal clear and ares around pool is amasing great restaurants
,,Go around dusk.,5.0,,"Quite stunning at early evening onwards,the Singapore skyline just gets better as darkness approaches.

Marina Bay Sands,The Fullerton,city skyline,the lights & laser show,The shoppes at MBS, & many others,stunning place to be,& all set by the riverside,there were many people there,probably thousands,but never felt to busy,I will be honest,ive never seen anything like it before,in away,its Singapore."
,,Great,5.0,,"If you take a 2 day ""hop on - hop off"" bus ticket, you get the boat ride for free - well worth it. Boat staff were great and the tour commentary was very informitative"
,,Disgusting!,1.0,,"So over-rated and over the top, it's not funny. Definitely not for me but perhaps others might enjoy it."
,,Relax,5.0,,"Liked: The place there i go with my family or Business (CLIENT). They will bring us there to view the sea, the seafood is fresh. And very relaxing when come to the evening view..."
,,F1 Race at the Marina Bay,3.0,,"Good atmosphere, but you obviously get to see much more action on the TV in the bar or at home.
Zones, where they are and what they offer:
Zone 1 & 2 - Start finish straight and walk about offering some good turn 1 and 2 viewing plus more, also has off track entertainment (concerts etc...)
Zone 3 & 4 - Marina Bay view grandstand and walk about with off track entertainment (concerts etc....).
Zone 4 Walkabout only and off track entertainment (concerts etc…).
Note some entertainment acts perform only in Zone 1.

I got two Zone 3 and Zone 4 tickets and to be honest.... the Zone 3 Bay View Grandstand is rubbish, (unless you are into the end of race fireworks), otherwise you get about 8 seconds of the cars going past from a faraway distance and it really is not worth the money, (I am not alone in this view point as my wife and I were in a large group of 8 and everyone had the same opinion). There are a few Special ticket entry only grandstands around zone 4 which offer slightly better viewing, but unless you are of a disability whereby you need to sit all day, then I would not bother. The best value by far are the Zone 4 walkabout only tickets, but if you are an avid fan who must know which driver is in which position (after about 10 laps you won’t have a clue), then you can buy radio headsets from one of the merchandise stands. This will give you commentary everywhere you go. Oh by the way you most definitely WILL need hearing protection, at minimum ear plugs.
If value for money is no restriction, then 2 out of our group bought tickets for Zones 1 and 2 off a tout outside the venue for race day and said that the viewing was far superior, however he said he would not do it again (he is not really an F1 fan anyway and just wanted to see Tom Jones perform).
In summary, I would not do a street circuit again, in fact I doubt I would do an F1 venue again (Touring cars or MotoGP is far more exciting in my opinion). But if you want to do the Singapore F1 experience I would recommend you get the Zone 4 walkabout tickets but be warned the viewing spots get very crowded, we wandered around during the Porsche cup race and selected our best spot. Got our food and drink stash before the end of the Porsche cup race and moved in for a place on our selected spot whilst everyone was away getting their food and drinks at the end of the Porsche cup race. We got a prime spot and waited there for 2 hours before the F1 start. It soon became crowded around us as start time approached, but we had some great viewing thereafter for the time we stayed, after leaving our spot there was little chance of getting in anywhere else for a decent view. Tickets for 2014 are on sale now, but leave it any later than a month before the race weekend starts and Zone 4 will be all sold out.
Hotels….. I cannot really comment as I was lucky to time this with a work visit so my hotel was corporate booked, but I am aware nearly all hotel rates rocket for the F1 weekend, blatant rip off in my opinion, which sadly is what the vast majority of Singapore is becoming."
,,best time to visit is just at the beginning of the night,4.0,,when in singapore you have to visit Marina Bay very nice view at sunset you can see the different high buildings with their lights reflected on the bay s water while relaxing and having a drink in any restaurant or coffee shop around
,,awesome place for day n night!!,5.0,,its a fantastic place to see...superb skyline..very tall and modern buildings with beautiful architecture..all major landmarks within walkable distance.
,,Best View,4.0,,"Fantastic view, higher than the wheel. Dont expect to see anything cheap so come prepared. magnificent in both the daytime and at night. Definitely worth the visit for the experience."
,,Beautiful Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"Singapore is built like a model city, clean well organised and sleek. Had a great time at Marina Bay Sands and travelled to see the Marina Bay Gallery. Was interesting how this place evolved over the years. There is a laser light water show in front of the Marina Bay Sands- if you happen to be there catch it."
,,Breathtaking view!,4.0,,"Like all Singaporeans, we hardly take time off to relax and soak in the many beautiful views in and around Singapore. We are always working late and trying to meet deadlines! However, if not for the occasional moments of respites, we would not have realized we have such lovely spots in our very own home- a spectacular view of Marina Bay and our city skyline! Marina Bay has much to offer - plenty of F&B outlets, shopping, entertainment, space, sun and water. Evenings around 6-7 pm are better to enjoy the simply stunning view with glistening golden sun rays filling the sky, people jogging or walking or idly watching the sunset across the bay! Breathtaking indeed!"
,,"Nice atmosphere, a must see",4.0,,"If you are in Singapore visiting the Marina Bay is a must do. There are several spots (The Fullerton area, Merlion, Esplanade, Helix, Sands Hotel) to disover. Preferred time to visit is at/after dawn when there is special atmosphere surrounding you."
,,"Its free, why would you not go there?",4.0,,"No doubt being in Singapore you will at some point be down in Marina Bay and with good reason, free views, good food choices, shops nearby, nice cars around. Just what you want for a baking afternoon walk around some of the city!"
,,A great place to visit,5.0,,"Marina Bay offers something for everyone. A relaxing place to sit and have a coffee, lots of shopping, some good restaurants and great scenery. Also a pretty place to visit at night to see the lights of all the city buildings."

,,Great place day or night!,5.0,,"This is a fabulous place to see & is really the heart of the new Singapore. Day or night this place is buzzing with things to do. Whether it be the massive designer shopping centre or the sights around the bay, such as the magnificent structures of the Art & Science Museum, the Helix bridge, or the Marina Bay Hotel it is a must when travelling to Singapore."
,,business hub in singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a bay near Central Area in the southern part of Singapore, and lies to the east of the Downtown Core. Marina Bay is set to be a 24/7 destination with endless opportunities for people to “explore new living and lifestyle options, exchange new ideas and information for business, and be entertained by rich leisure and cultural experiences.Singapore is the second Asian country after Japan to implement a comprehensive Common Services Tunnel system to distribute various utility services to all developments in Marina Bay. The network of purpose-built tunnels houses water pipes, electrical and telecommunication cables and other utility services underground. CST not only improves reliability of services supplies and allows easy maintenance and new installations, it also has 100% emergency backup services and the capacity for expansion to meet changing utility needs"
,,"Amazing, area, wow.",5.0,,"Reclaimed sea, clean well designed structures and buildings, great architecture, visually a feast , amazing skyline. Great for an evening walk in the cool.so many amazing engineering feats, credit to the designers! Cost to go in to some areas, largely can do a walking loop.
Fantastic way to view the city."
,,Busy!,4.0,,Bust there due to the Singapore F1 racing at the time we were there. Enjoyed the architecture and Museum
,,A maze of shopping options,4.0,,"Typically Singaporean set up, shopping till you drops, more shops after you drops literally. Remember to visit the Botanical park"
,,A funtastic river cruise experience.,5.0,,Me & with my family did a great time in exploring SG river adventure. The sights & historic meaning of SG economy humble beginnings is truly impressive. We have a glimpse of Singapore's dynamic commerce & trade. The river is clean. Its worth of our penny.

,,Very nice,5.0,,"A pleasure to watch the show. Great music. You feel welcomed to Singapore. Inspite of repeats, remains a must watch for all."
,,Superb development,5.0,,This area has been developed not too long ago and it really is a great addon for the city of Singapore. Be sure you also visit during the night to make those superb pictures.
,,Perfect for an Evening Stroll,4.0,,We took an enjoyable stroll in the futuristic bridge while we were met with a number of locals jogging in the area. Then we sat by the benches facing the bay and just enjoyed the view before heading to the Arts and Science Museum to visit the Mummy exhibit. It's a good place to just relax and take a leisurely stroll.
,,Nothing Extra-Ordinary,3.0,,"The marina bay itself is an attractive place for the shoppers with all the Brand shops and exclusive mall. But they are too expensive for common people.
Before going to Singapore I read many reviews about the 'Light and Sound Show' with high recommendations. We caught the show at 8:30 at the evening after a long wait (I guess there is no specific schedule). But to me it was totally a disappointment. It was pretty ordinary a show with excessive sound and spending $20 for the sky roof was not worthy. Nothing to die for. The lights of the skyscrapers might attract some of the visitors.
From the Marina Bay the 'Merlion' looks too small. If you take a boat-trip, you might enjoy a little bit. On return there was a long que for the taxi.
Overall it was not what I read about, so I was disappointed to spend an evening for it."
,,Fantastic few during night,5.0,,Stroll around and enjoy the skyline of Singapore. Walk over the futuristic bridge and watch the nightly laser and sound show.
,,Best Bay in the world,5.0,,Marina Bay makes me feel convenient with many things I need . First there is Malls there . You can spend all day visiting . Second Im so inetersted in Esplanade Theatres so modern . When you r tired you wanna relax your mind you can walk on the bridge . It leads you to Art Science Museum a nice place for people who love art . In addtion it have nice view especially at night it s so bright with highlight and water show . it seems sleepless place for who dont want to miss anything in Singapore
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Singapore is a fantastic country to visit. Generally very clean and safe environment. Marina Bay is upmarket but certainly worth a visit to appreciate their way of marketing themselves. They do it well.
,,Appealing,5.0,,"Lined with restaurants and CBD on one side and the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel on the other, Marina Bay is a real delight. Great place for dinner and to watch the 8pm light show from MBSH."
,,Great Vista,4.0,,Just stand and look round. The whole vista of the Singapore harbour front displayed. The Marina Bay Sands hotel dominates and is worth a visit to the roof. Did not do the gardens - next trip.
,,An Amazing Marina.,5.0,,"Spend some hours down here by walking the full circle of the Marina. Start at the Esplanade Theatres on the Bay, walk over the bridge towards the Art Science Museum then into the Marina Bay Sands Hotel- go to the top deck .From there check out the shopping mall which is close to the hotel and finally walk around to the Fullerton Bay Hotel - you must go inside and discover this beautiful old building .Finally visit the Merlion a must when in Singapore."
,,A man made bay,4.0,,"Marina Bay is man made and surrounded by hotels, offices and the Marina Bay shopping centre. We had a river cruise around the bay and stopped for a sundowner on the quay side. Nice place and would go again but a bit lacking in atmosphere."
,,A beautiful area to stay or visit.,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Hotel is amazing. The Gardens by the Bay are beautiful, the Helix Bridge is really cool and the Marina Shoppes are fabulous!! A must visit location!"
,,eye-catching,4.0,,"Perfect view of the most unique sky scrapers of Singapore. Highly recommended place to get your mind off. You can be here walking around and spend at the minimum cost by having an ice-cream SGD1.

If you are a shopper who delights in shopping branded stuff, this is the right place for you. This ""eye-catching"" place has everything from a restaurant, convenient store, hotel and several levels of shopping to die for. Boat trip on the river is available too, but expensive.

The most enjoyable moment was light show during night time!"
,,Harbor,5.0,,My favorite place. Unique architecture which is impressive when looking at it but as well when looking on Singapore from the 57th floor. Beautiful mall although very expensive.
,,So much to do,5.0,,"We spent so much time in the Marina Bay area during our visit to Singapore, because there are so much to see. On the one side you have One Fullerton with the Merlion statue and various restaurants, on the other side you have the Shoppes at Marina Bay mall and in between is the Theatre at the Bay. The sights at night is beautiful with the highlight being the Marina Bay light and water show. We first watched the light show from the Merlion statue side and then went around the bay to see the water show in front of the Shoppes at Marina Bay. You can also get the River Cruise from various spots at Marina Bay."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"This area is spectacular! I visited in the evening, and I could not stop finding wonderful and beautiful structures, art and views."
,,"Explore, exchange and be entertained.",5.0,,"This huge bay provides mainly land based activity 24/7 that is truly exciting, but also unique compared to the typical ""Marina"" in other countries. When compared to these other places, Marina Bay's boating activity is hardly noticeable but the areas surrounding this beautiful waterfront has amazing options on offer.
The local community and visitors alike can enjoy the parks, waterfront promenade and attend the events and celebrations held at the Bay. State-of-the-art office space and transport infrastructure provide seamless connectivity for companies and professionals to grow and exchange business ideas. It is a place with a necklace of attractions and round-the-clock energy that continues during and outside office hours.
Tourists would not be bored visiting here every day if they wanted. It is a place that offers pleasant shopping experiences, a variety of eating venues, regular events or the pleasant scenery.
Deserves to be in the top 5 attractions: Highly recommended."
,,Wonderful human creation !,5.0,,"Must visit and saw a little show of Marina Bay Sands on esplanade site which have a small food court besides the bay, you can have a dinner here --watch spectacular show of marina and merlion city view at the same time --- later on do a little walk to see multi culture performances on the harbour stage which is circulated all year. Romantic dating ! Unforgettable !"
,,"Marina Bay,a must visit in Singapore",4.0,,"stunning view, wonderful place to roam around. on the bay side you can check out local foods too.Marina Bay is set to be 24/7 destination. Better viewed at night. It is always safe in Singapore."
,,Nice view,5.0,,"This is such a nice place to have afternoon stroll, jogging or ride a bike. Or you can just sit here and enjoy the wind breeze while viewing nice skyscrapper landscapes. You can see fullerton hotel and Merlion statue from here."
,,Cool,5.0,,A very cool and uniqe place that I really liked. Many cool Buildings. Come in the evening when there is a light and sound play.

,,Great shopping area,5.0,,"Great place to spend a day shopping, all the brand names are here and more , very easy to get to, we enjoyed our time there"
,,Get this on your bucket list,5.0,,"Everyone in the world should make sure that they come and visit Singapore when given the chance. The iconic Marina Bay is simply stunning and a place where you will almost certainly fill your day and see some spectacular sight and views. The Shopping mall has everything, you name it, its got it, and the adjoining Marina Bay Sands hotel is a work of genius for the architects and engineers who built this amazing hotel.
You can arrive by MRT (Tube), taxi, on foot and by car and the shear size of the bay will blow you away.
For the shopaholics, its like sending a kid to a sweetie shop, and im sure that the plastic takes a battering. Next to the Shopping Mall and adjoined by underground entrance is the worlds only Louis Vuitton Island store.
This is a photographers paradise. Great shots to be had across the bay into the city.
Its a must see and I'm sure you'll agree when you see it for yourself.

Enjoy."
,,"Excellent place to go to at night to view the lights, gardens and Marina Bay Sands Hotel",5.0,,"During the day this area is lush and green with plenty to do however it really is a fabulous place to wander around at night. The gardens, helix bridge and Marina Bay Sands hotel all look spectacular when lit up at night. The area is very safe for families and tourists even at night. We took some excellent photos of the Marina Bay Sands at night where you get the take in the huge scale of this building. Don't forget to take mosquito repellent as there were some parts of the bay area where there were a few mosquito's about. All in all it's a great place to wander around especially at night when the weather is a bit cooler."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,Marina Bay has a very exciting view of Singapore. National Performances are usually held there. It will be a very exciting trip for all visitors!
,,Nice for a walk,5.0,,Nice to take a walk around the bay. Nice views from all four corners of the bay a few nice restaurants also surround the area offering nice views and good food at some reasonable prices.
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,"We first visited Raffles Hotel and then walked to the Bay via the underground theatre area in order to keep cool! The Bay area is clean and right beside the CBD. Views across to Marina Sands which we caught a taxi to. This is a must go if you like shopping at European fashion houses, visiting the Casino, or spending a minimum of S$80/head for dinner. You do not get into Ku De Ta restaurant on the top of the ""boat"" building unless you agree downstairs on the ground floor. But worth a wander around if you like looking at opulence."
,,Good boat trip,5.0,,"Do yourself a favour do a boat trip on the river. It is inexpensive and very informative you see heaps including the ""Bay"" and Mr Merlion. The water way is dammed fresh water and to reduce pollution the boats are electric...how cool and green is that."
,,the Singapore portcard!,4.0,,"This is the most famous cityscape of Singapore.

I was in Singapore just for a few hours between connections flights, but the sufficient time to visit the city center and this was the destination I have choosed.

This is like Big Ben in London, it´s a ""must see"", there´s always hundreds of people there thousands of pictures taken. The Lion, the big hotel and a lot of more attractions are around this area."
,,Strolling in the afternoon!,5.0,,"A nice place to get your mind off of things. We had a nice time strolling around Marina Bay, taking pictures and eating $1 ice cream :) best moments yet!!"
,,The Bay,4.0,,My girlfriend and I took a boat ride from the bay all around the Quay side. It was the perfect way to spend time and see this area.
,,Breath taking view of Singapore,4.0,,This is the place where you get that picture perfect view of the most beauitful skyline of Singapore. We went at evening time when the sun started to set. It was a magical moment. It was also within walking distance to marina bay sands where it houses a luxury shopping mall with many great restaurants.
,,stunning,4.0,,"It was well worth the visit , the whole area is stunning , really beautiful , great to stroll around , so much has been done , really nice choice of restaurants and photographic opportunities ."
,,A lovely stroll,4.0,,Sadly we were running out of time on our far too brief visit to Singapore and we walked back to out hotel via the bay. Some wonderful views across the water together with fascinating architecture such as the bridge. A nice end to a lovely few days.
,,Awesome,4.0,,It's a brilliant view in the night time. We went to see light show during night time and then during time. It is a tourist popular destination. One can go for stroll and enjoy the ambience during night time.

,,Great view,5.0,,"To think not so long ago much of this was all water. Clean, picturesque and impressive this area is a real credit to the people of Singapore."
,,What a view,4.0,,For a fantastic view of Singapore this is the place to go. Esp at night you get a sight that is worth the price of the ticket.
,,The place to be at night,5.0,,"We visited the marina at night and enjoyed the lights show: it is a amazing to see the modern architecture blending with the waters, both natural and artificial. There is plenty of action all around, so better to plan your dinner around the marina once you are there."
,,"clean and nice,",5.0,,the way they located the ship on the top of 3 shafts looks amazing.There is also a mermaid which is the symbol of Singapore
,,MUST GO,5.0,,"one of the highlights of Singapore, equally stunning both day and night, enjoy a walk around and see it from different angles. At night you can also watch the light show from MBS over the Marina Bay, if I'm not mistaken they play it twice a night, best place to see is probably from the Merlion Park."
,,A BAY WITH LIFE,5.0,,"I have never missed going to the Marina bay everytime I visited Singapore. It's a bay of life because whether it was during the new year or during F1 grand prix or this time during the national day, it was full of life and everytime it was a different experience."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Singapore is clean and nice people. Marina Bay Sands is a good place for tourist and very beautiful, especially Garden by the Bay look gorgeous and good foods. Casino are good for tourist too. Singapire always have good foods to enjoy. Bak Kut Teh is onr of the spare rib soup famous in singapore."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Comfortable shoes....a good camera, late afternoon then take in the night lights. Loved The Sands hotel as a backdrop for viewing and so convenient to move from one attraction to another.. Be prepared to walk, thus the comfortable shoes. Bring along water unless you want to cold beer...Tiger of cpurse"
,,Photo opportunities abound.,4.0,,"Never thought id enjoy a wander around a harbour or
Bay in this instance as much as the Rocks in Sydney. However the
modern buildings and walkways around Marina Bay provide a lot of photo op's in a lovely location. Probably more to do/read/history along the walk would be nice, but close to Marina Bay Sands mall or the flyer for a restaurant or various attractions. Improving."
,,For the Tourist,4.0,,"We walked to Marina Bay from China Town, we have been through the financial district on a number of ocassions and are always amazed at the development which seems to be on going. Following the underground malls/shopping centres from the financial district can be a bit of a challenge however we eventually made it. It appears Marine Bay is designed for the big spending gamblers who are staying at the MBS and want to go home with a rolex watch. Many of the shops are 'high end' and similar to what you see in many of the other worlds great cities. We did find the food centres reasonably priced and what is good value is the S$2 ride at the 'Gardens by the Bay' (from the entrance to the centre information centre). The whole development is well worth a look and very impressive, and the gardens are definatly a top attraction in Singapore"
,,Laser show at Marina Bay,4.0,,"Marina Bay is in front of the Marina Bay Sands. It is mostly a pedestrian area with plenty of life: nice crowd,fashionable caffe terrace, proximity to the luxurious mall... And there are regularly some shows or attractions going on : concert, fireworks to name a few.
One of these regular attraction is a laser show, very worth watching as it is very well down with a beautiful and moving life story as a background.
Highly recommended as the start of a nice evening in the trendy Singapore!"
,,"Very nice walk, great pictures",4.0,,"Very nice and clean area. Try to walk around and get pictures of the Marina, buildings etc from different ankles. There are a lot of big shopping malls for shopping, but nothing more than that. If you are not into that, spend one-two hours walking around and head towards more cultural activities."
,,Crazy place,4.0,,"I felt like I was in PS3s ""DC Universe"" but I didn't have super powers so getting around at this massive scale took some time. The place with it's crazy angles and escalators shooting off to massive altitudes tweeked with my fear of heights . Definitely worth checking out."
,,Great night life,5.0,,"If you get to Singapore and only have a limited amount of time, get to Marina Bay in the late afternoon and plan on spending several hours walking the area and riding the water taxies. You can find food from any part of the world to satisfy that hunger pain."
,,Cool place,4.0,,"Really amazing mall, Marina Sands Park Hotel worth going to see. The 360 Observation deck is amazing as well as the pool right on top."
,,Beautiful bay,5.0,,Great mall with all brand names.versatile goods with whole ranges of prices.nice restaurants inside and outside the mall.walking along the marina is great at night as it is hot and humid at day time
,,Nice place for morning or evening run/ stroll,4.0,,Walk or run from Marina Blvd or Central Blvd along the bay front to the marina barrage to enjoy the nice bay front. Stop by for a bite at the satay club. You can also continue across the barrage to Marina East and then to Kallang. The route is also bicycle friendly.
,,Great experience which makes you feel elsewhere,5.0,,"The experience at the bay was a very special one. I was with my wife and it was nice to explore, while still feeling safe. This creates a very nice atmosphere, especially at night when walking around."
,,What A place.. WoW,5.0,,"This place is a must visit in Singapore. its like a dream, from landscape to high tech buildings and towers to the Marina Bay Sands View to all."
,,"Don't get off at the tube station ""Marina Bay""",4.0,,"It spits you out on the wrong side of the motorway. A little misleading, I found. All good fun when you get there though."
,,Excellent at Night,4.0,,"This place was so well-lighted at night, it was really one of the most glimmering party of light I've ever seen. you can take pictures, ride a cruise (which we really would like to do, but we got no money left), some kids were riding a bicycle when we came here, some old-man just sitting, watching the lights, some teens are shopping around (there was a mall nearby), overall it was an excellent place, especially at night"
,,Water show at night,5.0,,"It was so awesome to watch the water show, which is free, a must do if you are in singapore, then we caught a boat across the harbour to the quay and ate at a lovey restaurant."

,,More ships than Troy,5.0,,You really get a sense of the size of world's shipping activity when you see all the container ships parked up outside the bay. The bay itself is a modern circle of incredible design architecture and glass - safe to wander around and a quiet spot away from the bustle. The conversion of older properties and the imagination brought to the new make this a breathtaking vista. We had sushi by the mall and wandered and admired the water lilies as well as the boats.
,,Romantic place,4.0,,"Beautiful skyline, vibrid place. Lots of people, bars, mall for shopping, foodcourt. Helix bridge was a special architecture design, pretty sight no matter in the morning or evening when lit up. Watershow was a free entertainment with bubbles floating around by the boulevard."
,,Great area to walk around and view the sights,4.0,,the shopping is expensive the at least the malls are airconditioned. from this area you can vied the great building and icons of Singapore. Plan on going several times if you are there a few days.
,,Nice walk,3.0,,"Take a walk around the bay, past the youth Olympic park, across the marina bay bridge, past the marina bay sands hotel and the art science museum, which looks like a giant lotus, all the way around to the crazy Merlion. Stop off for some well deserved air con in the marina bay sands mall where you can see little boats punting along the interior canal. It's like Venice but more humid. It's a good walk for photo ops of the famous marina bay sands hotel."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"It is the most beautiful place in the city. All the high-tech buildings are here, nice restaurants and hawker center are here as well. Marina Bay Sands, Merlion etc etc. It is a great place to spend the whole day if you wish to. And laser and sound shows at night are spectacular from each point of Marina Bay. It's best to watch the shows from different places each night, the experience is different then."
,,Night View,4.0,,"the night view thr is great ! its a must go place for traveller. Besides, there are a lot of restaurants at thr if you can afford expensive food. exotic !"
,,Adult's Disney,2.0,,"Some of the architecture is nice enough, looks nice, clean ( of course it is Singapore ) but has a soulless feel. Restaurants I at at were mediocre quality, top notch price tough! Level 33 may be an exception in the Standard Chartered Building. Good food for the money in house brewed beer, with a great view."
,,Great shopping mall & stunning hotel,4.0,,"Marina Bay is home to the amazing Marina Bay Sands, with it's viewing platform & SkyBar on top of this unique ""ship"" hotel. The panoramic view is unbeatable, overlooking the bay to Clark Quay, as well as the Botanical Gardens directly behind.

The Marina Bay mall is also world-class with all the top class brand names on offer - a shopping mecca for those with the cash to splash!"
,,Very enjoyable and well kept,5.0,,"Very nice area, well kept, rich in history, beautiful views, places to eat or just hang around. It makes for a nice evening stroll or a quick glimpse at the old heart of town. I will do it again."
,,Must see,5.0,,One cannot go to Singapore without seeing Marina Bay. A fantastic insight into the wealth of Singapore and a unique aspect of the city and what it can build. It reminded me a bit of Hong Kong
,,Great views,4.0,,"Marina bay's architecture is a must see. Whether is it from the garden by the bay or the merlion, this is a landmark of Singapore. I recommend going to the top for the view which is impressive - better to go at sunset. There is no point of paying the high entrance fee - just go to have a drink at Kudeta for the same view.
There is a gigantic shopping centre and casino inside the hotel"
,,Extremely awesome,5.0,,"It was my first time to come here to spend my block leave and even just a few hours visiting here it feels like a heaven in earth. It turns me like crazy by having a great moments here. We had a nice lunch, shopping, sight seeing and touring around. We played a few games in the casino as well and it was fun. Im looking forward to be here again this November or December 2013 to check in to try the sky swimming pool."
,,Beautiful at Night,4.0,,"We strolled around the area at night, sat at the waterfront and just looking at lights and laser lights at night. Lots of nice restaurants. There is also a big shopping centre with access to Casino."
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,"Brilliant place to see skyline of Singapore, lovely views! Light show was nice to see. I recommend standing right outside the centre. You will see all the people standing!

,,excellent,5.0,,"if we go singapore ,we have to take a photo with singapore national symbol lion.and 2nd photo we have to take the great structure behind me.marina bay hotel.these 2 r imp in our memorable life."
,,A classic area to visit,4.0,,The bay itself is offering great views on the financial district and teh new building which appeared in the past decade. Great architectural realizations. Take the canal boat tour. Good alternative way to city the city.
,,Very touristy.. but nice,3.0,,"As the title implies, most people will come here for a snap and then move on.. The merlion is a must if you are visiting Singapore for the first time..All in all, take a stroll, take some snapshots and leave."
,,Photographer's pleaure,4.0,,"It is surrounded by grand architect creations of Singapore,HDFC bank building looks like some minaret."

,,"Great view of the bay, where the Merlion sits",3.0,,"Marina Bay , was an iconic place, this is where the famous icon of Singapore , the Merlion statue sits.Altough the statue is quite small compared to the one in the Sentosa island.Come early in the morning or in the afternoon , because theres very little shelter from the sun here.From this bay you can see Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Art and Science museum , the Esplanade.Great view from this bay,bring hats or umbrellas , and wear comfortable clothing ,and shoes for strolling around.At night you can see amazing lights througout the bay ,and some laser shows."
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,"I visited Marina bay on national holiday. It was amazing! I saw many wonderful things, for example, a lot of fireworks, amazing water show, beautiful night view. In addition, the food of restaurant in marina bay was very delicious. ( But the food is a little bit expensive for me.) And this place is appropriate for shopping. Many shops ,like vuitton, gucci, exist there. Consequently, you can enjoy shopping also.
I think you'll be satisfide with this place. It is worth visiting. So, I recommend you to visit there !"
,,Nice to walk around,5.0,,"Many things to see and do. It's a must. Many restaurants, cafes and during evening hours, concerts and happenings"
,,"Hot, limited attractions",3.0,,"So this is where Singapore's famed Merlion lives and the Merlion is quite a sight, although the Sentosa Merlion is more than 5 times bigger. This one shoots water out of its mouth into the bay and it was crowded with tourists taking pictures. It was a very hot day and I was surprised there was little shelter from the sun, except in the stores lining the bay. I am a fit, 23 year old woman and I found myself with a nauseous migraine and needing to duck into the air-conditioned Starbucks to recover from the blazing heat for a few moments. I'd hate to think how young children or the elderly would cope with excessive sightseeing in the area, given there is nowhere to escape from the sun.

The jetty area is nice, you can see that alot of money has gone into the development of the boardwalk, but I found it to be a little lackluster (despite the strange golden square monument in the middle of nowhere). The biggest drawback for me was the water, it was visibly grimy and it really made you think twice about the water quality in general. Singapore may be tough on rubbish, but clearly that doesn't spill over to its river, as there were multiple bags, cans and other debris floating around and ruining the otherwise pleasant view.

Seeing as the Merlion is one of Singapore's most iconic landmarks, it is worth a visit, but make it one in passing and bring plenty of cold water and/or an umbrella to shield from the elements!"
,,grt sunset point,5.0,,great place to spend your evening time.. in marina bay you can visit to cloud and flower dome.. u can view lazer and fire work from there..
,,special icon of Singapore,4.0,,"Marina Bay where is the white Lion as a Singapore symbol has well-known in the world. Like Esplanade building in Singapore. Try to find this spot, because very nice sightseeing U can get from here."
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"Even if you are not staying there, give yourself a day to experience Marina Bay. We caught a taxi from Orchard road (cost approximately AUS$7. Visit the Museum, Marina, shops and the impressive hotel. Take a lift to the top level and enjoy a drink or two."
,,Picture Perfect,5.0,,An astounding visual feast of architecture mixed with huge areas to take in the sights. Take a boat tour to take in a different aspect and don't miss the night light show which was more than we had expected.
,,Great building,5.0,,Brilliant....a place where you can find beautiful buildings with different designs... A must visit place if you are in Singapore.
,,Awesome view,4.0,,Great shopping complex although mostly high end. Suggest you get a guest pass from the lobby at the end of the main hotel complex to go up to KuDeTa. It is a bar with the best city view I have ever experienced. ( the guest pass is for free all you have to do is ask). We bought a bottle of nice wine and some tapas for lunch and spent a couple of hours gazing at the view. Total cost was around S$80. Well worth it. Went up on the flyer the day before and it cost us S$99 for three of us with not half the adventure and view and over in half an hour.
,,Great Place for a Walk,5.0,,"Marina Bay is one of the centre's of Singapore. Many sights are located on or close to the bay such as the Singapore Eye, Marina Bay Sands, Boat Quay and the Opera House. An ideal location for people to walk, take in the sights and with ample places to eat and drink. We stayed at the Fullerton Bay Hotel which is located on Marina Bay which made an excellent base to explore the Bay."
,,What a Nice View..,4.0,,"This is the very good area of Singapore where you can spend hours.Dont miss it! It doesnt cost anything and is good fun.Lots of things to see, do and eat.All i can say that it is a nice place where we can relax ...Good time to visit this attraction is early Morning or during sun set."
,,Stunning view of Singapore's Skyline,5.0,,"It is quite nice to spend some time around that area. The bay offers great scenery to enjoy architectural finesse.

Having a walk along the waterfront during dawn can be romantic.

There is an open-air food court where people can enjoy Singapore’s international cuisine → Between Raffles Avenue and the waterfront, next to the Esplanade."
,,Nice place for a walk in the late evening,4.0,,I liked walking around the Marina Bay area towards the late evening when slowly the CBD area around start getting lit by the colorful lights and signboards. Then there is also the famous Singapore Merlion and the laser show by the Marina Bay Sands hotel which is a good watch in the night.
,,Love the atmoshere,5.0,,Love the atmosphere at Marina Bay. Its one of the attraction in Singapore especially the amazing Marina Bay Sands. I would say worth the visit.
,,Breathtaking skyline,5.0,,"For six months I have been privileged enough to live by the marina bay. I have woken up to the sight of the marina bay, gone jogging by the bay, walked by the bay, watched dozens of couples take their wedding pictures by the bay, gone for drinks overlooking the bay.. And I can honestly say you will never get tired of the view. The skyline is beautiful, the Bay Area is clean and safe. Lovely beyond compare!"
,,Great views,4.0,,Such a pleasant place to walk around. The views are great and we went on the flyer which was cool. The only issue I had was the heat which made it hard to be outdoors for long.

,,Lucky to watch the practice for the national day.,4.0,,We were lucky to watch the celebration practice for Singapore day. Very good views. It's very crowded in the evening. The food near merlion park is overpriced. The fire shows is very beautiful and worth to see.
,,Evening Laser Show at the Bay,5.0,,"We booked for a evening dinner at the Singapore flyer restaurant and a laser show on the marina bay with a tour company.

First disappointment was the restaurant I would call it a fast food outlet ....the ""dinner"" was a choice of cheeseburger!! and Spaghetti bolognaise I refused to eat fast food ..hubby had the spaghetti he commented tomatoes were tinned the manager came over and offered a salad ""Ceaser"" I accepted... the chicken was tasty but that is where it ended ....no bacon pieces or egg, just chicken and lots of lettuce!!
The laser show was spectacular and well worth the disappointment of the ""dinner""..... we then boarded a replica junk and toured down the river the sites of Singapore in the evening was just magnificent.
I would recommend the laser show but leave the ""dinner"" to some where at your own choosing."
,,Worth the Journey,5.0,,"Its a little further out from the main bustling areas of Singapore, but Marina Bay offers more than enough shopping, food and attractions to fill your day. Its worth a visit even if you plan on just sight-seeing.

Be advised, the food court is pricier than any food court in the city and the shops are generally up-market. Don't forget your credit card(s)."
,,lovely morning,5.0,,from big buildings to a place near nature you enjoy the garedens lush green grass attract you the most. lovely breeze
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Dont miss it! It doesnt cost anything and is good fun! We loved it as we havent seen anything like this.
,,Lovely view of the skyline,4.0,,This is the posh area of Singapore where you can spend hours at a stretch. Don't miss he free song and light show that happens at 8-8:30 pm everyday.. Truly a great experience!
,,Great view,4.0,,Good view in day light and awesome at night. Enjoy a wonderful evening followed by sound and light show (happens twice at 8 & 9:30 pm).
,,Marino by Night,5.0,,We did the cruise by the bay by night which is a must. The boat is battery powered which is amazing no noise. You see all the landscape buildings lit up.
,,Great building,4.0,,Spent several days in this area and never go tired of seeing that great building. Excellent shopping area also.
,,Take photos or go jogging...,4.0,,"Marina Bay is huge and free! I visited different parts of the bay over two nights. Lots of things to see, do and eat. I am interested in photography so I went down there at sunset on both days. Beautiful night time shots of the city skyline can be done from in front of the Marina Bay Shoppe. Also seems to be a hit with local joggers who can do a few different circuits in the area. Interesting architecture can be seen including the art science museum, the helix bridge, the Marina Bay Sands hotel and a Louis Vitton shop floating on the water. Watch the free Wonder Full show at 8pm and 9.30pm.

Easy to get to the city side (Raffles Place MRT station) or the Marina Bay Shoppe side (Bayfront MRT)"
,,once not enough,5.0,,the views are fantastic - do try the flyer in the evenigs - its amazing. loved the marina bay stretch for its little bistros and views.
,,Good at night!,5.0,,"(+) citylight, sightseeing, food, shopping, attraction (-) too crowded, outdoors (you need to carry umbrella wherever you go in SG since the weather is unpredictable)."
,,Cycled around the Marina Bay. Great Fun!!,5.0,,"I always wanted to walk around the Marina Bay area and all the way to the Marina Barrage but the distance turned me off quite a bit. With the new Satay By the Bay in mind I decided to try. I got off at City Hall mrt about 5pm with my girlfriend and by chance we stumbled upon a bicycle rental shop at the junction and entrance to Connaught Drive. Its called 'The Bicycle Hut'. This is really Cool as they're just 5 minutes away from City Hall mrt.

If you walk along and pass Singapore Recreation Club you'll see their signboard there. Rental iwas $16 for 3 hours though you may have to check if those rates are still available. I rented a Schwinn Cruiser bicycle while my girlfriend rented a stylish single speed bicycle that looks like a racing bike. My bicycle looks daunting very Harley - Davidson like. But was I surprised how smooth the bicycle was. Very little effort and the bicycle just rolls along.

Anyway back to the cycling. Interestingly enough the stretch of Connaught Drive covers several interesting memorials beginning with the Tan Kim Seng Fountain. This was built in memory of this very famous local philanthropist, businessman and prominent figure in the chinese community. It seems he donated $30,000 in the early 1900's to help contruct a pipeline channelling water to the city area. I made it a point to find out more about him. The trees along Connaught Drive on the 'Padang' side( padang is big field in malay by the way) are more than 100 years old. This we found out from the steward from Singapore Recreation Club.

Passing by two 'Cannonball trees' along the way, the Cenotaph War Memorial, Lim Bo Seng( another war hero) Memorial and Indian Army National Monument. Very interesting monuments with just enough information about the state of affairs during those war years.

We cycled along Queen Elizabeth Walk and down towards the Esplanade Bridge underpass. There's a nice slope there that allows you to pick up a bit of speed as you inhale the clean air from the Marina Bay. Cycling under the bridge brings you up to the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay. A host of eateries are on your left with some prominent names like Harry's and Siam Kitchen as well. You'll also pass the outdoor Concert theatre and your entire right side would be the coastline of the Marina Bay reservoir.

We decided to get some hot coffee before we cycled on so we stopped at Gluttons by the Bay. It was really nice just watching people eating/drinking/talking in this open air eating area. Makansutra or Gluttons by the Bay is located between Esplanade Theatre and the Marina Floating Platform which happens to be the largest stadium like gallery with a floating platform area. After about 20 minutes we grabbed our bicycles and cycled down pass the Marina Floating Platform. There we stopped to observe the Arts and Science Museum which resembles a lotus flower and the iconic Marina Bay Sands Casino and Resorts. The view from our side was truly wonderful with a wonderful breeze blowing across your face.

We wanted to cycle up along the Helix bridge which connects the Central area to Marina Bay Sands but decided to push the bicycles up along the helix bridge so as not to cycle into pedestrians although there is a side path that allows cyclists to cycle up alongside the helix bridge. On your right side across the Marina Bay the view is just wonderful. You can see the Merlion on the other end and crowds of tourists taking photos. We tool several photos on the helix bridge. We pushed the bicycles down to Marina Bay Sands and took a left under the Benjamin Sheares Bridge. We cycled on towards Marina Barrage passing by Gardens by the Bay, The Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Now we didnt stop there but cycled on towards Satay by the Bay another outdoor eatery nearby. There's a bicycle parking bay conveniently located just outside Satay by the Bay. We decided not to stop for dinner yet but cycled towards the Marina Barrage. I forgot to mention that as you cycle pass Gardens by the Bay you'll be able to take in a magnificent view of the Singapore Flyer on your left and the Formula 1 track area at the same time.

We reached Marina Barrage and decided to play in the water fountain areas to cool off for awhile all the while taking photos. We stopped short of crossing the Marina Barrage and spent a couple of minutes ogling at the pump house and the Crest gates that regulate the flow of rainwater in and out of the Marina Barrage. The Marina Barrage serves as a 3 in 1 facility. Its main function is to act as a Dam blocking out sea water from flowing into the Marina Bay areas and flooding low lying areas of Singapore, Its also a reservoir where water is collected for daily use, and lastly serves as a recreational hub for sea sports, kite flying, picnics and so on. The Marina bay is the 15th reservoir for Singapore which has a total of 17 reservoirs. Most of them are in the central and western areas of this island State.

So we cycled back to Satay by the Bay to have dinner. We had an assortment of Satay( meat pieces skewered onto a stick and grilled) served with spicy peanut sauce and some seafood. Al this downed with a big Cool glass of Blueberry juice. The food was alright and not expensive either. Infact before ordering we went online using our 4G phones to find which foodstalls served the best food here. After about 45 minutes and over full tummies we went to our bicycles again. The sun was setting at that point of time just around six plus in the evening and the whole surrounding was just one of utter serendipity.

We saw some people in small sailboats plying their way thru the waters of the Marina Bay. They seemed to be having a lot of fun just like us. We cycled slowly back down towards Marina Bay Sands. The lights from the nearby buildings that surround the Bay area was mesmerising. As we cycled pass Marina Bay Sands, pass along swaying palm trees, more alfresco eateries and large pavements built for the ease and comfort of walking and cycling we couldn't help but gaze into the blue waters of the bay and be twinkled by lights from across the bay and the string of hotels like One Fullerton, Fullerton Bay Hotel, Customs House and many more. It was getting dark and we were tempted to stay out longer but our cycling time of 3 hours for $16/- was almost up. As we skirted and cycled along the promontory and the Marina Bay Financial District we took one last stop infront of Customs House for some final photos.

From there we cycled pass Fullerton Bay Hotel and crossed the traffic lights onto the junction of Coleman Bridge. A brisk cycle back into Queen Elizabeth Walk and we reached Connaught Drive again before handing over the bicycles back to 'the bicycle hut'. We started off just slightly after 5pm and got back there 5 minutes to 8pm. We were informed by the guys at the bicycle hut that there were daily light shows from Marina Bay Sands which we must have missed and that the next show was at 8.30pm. Too bad but we will definitely come back again in the near future to cycle a slightly diffrent route. It was a really good ride and we got to really stretch our legs in the process. All in all was a truly different experience, not expensive but really good fun.

As we walked back to City Hall MRT station my girlfriend remarked how so much activity and revelling was taking place along Marina Bay. She aptly called it 'the bay of life'."
,,Amazing cityscape,4.0,,"Wonderful views all around as you enjoy a relaxing walk around the bay. Best to go at dusk or later, when all the buildings are lit. The weather is also more bearable in the evening."
,,New Attraction in Singapore,4.0,,Singapore is so vibrant that it is purely built on creativity! Marina Bay is an excellent example how human creativity can change the landscape - the combination of Sands Hotel and Gardens by the Bay is really amazing! They represents the state-of-art of a city construction. I really enjoy this area.
,,Great place to be for free,5.0,,"This is a part of Singapore that is completely free. From the Merloin through to the walk along the Esplanade.If you need to buy a coffee or have something to eat, there are plenty of options to choose from. Another positive is that if you are using a wheelchair, there are several access points to get down onto the Esplanade. Heaps of public bathrooms around to. You can access the Singapore River Cruise from here as well. At night there is a light show form the Marina Bay Sands Hotel at 8pm & 9.30pm that is also free."
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,"This is a very good place. Especially at night, its a good place to relax for and the most attractive places within the bay like Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, The Merlion Park , the nearby Hotel Fullerton and some clusters of restaurants and bars if you want to get hangout or bar hopping. And lastly, its very accessible to the shopping malls and transportations like the SMRT. This place is for all ages... :)"
,,Clean and extremely well used,4.0,,"Laser show and water show with bubbles and music was great and walking around during the day was easy and very accessible to Gardens by the Bay, marina Sands and the museum. A fantastic use of the area"
,,"Very modern, very expensive",4.0,,"This area is a must-visit when you are in Singapore, though expect the prices to be much higher than in most of the rest of the city. There is a lot to see; Marina Bay Sands, Helix Bridge, Gardens By The Bay, The Shoppes, The Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Grand Prix circuit (which you can walk along when the race isn't on) amongst others.

In short, definitely worth a visit, but unless you have money to burn, you probably won't want to spend too much time here"
,,Scenic place for photo taking,4.0,,"The view was awesome and great! From the ""Merlion Park"" area and overlooking Marina Bay Sands. I saw a few wedding couples having their photo shoot there, great choice. Nice cluster of restaurants with a view to kill. In short, i was tourist for the day, taking snippets of this beautiful place and one that i can bring my friends from abroad to take a look & of course take pictures:)"
,,Very beautiful night scenery,5.0,,"Marina Bay Areas has one of the best night scenery in the world, there are many restaurants around the area as well, the Merlion is also situated here, this place is good place to come to in the evening."
,,Stopping in Singapore? Come here,5.0,,"A nice spot for pictures of the city, and plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. If you're only in Singapore for a couple of days this is definitely one of the places to go."
,,Very Modern,4.0,,"This place has a lot of high rise buildings, merlion and a big body of water. It got laser light shows and you can just sit and relax and see people walk pass. Its a very touristy place as well.

all the important events are being held here like sg grand prix, national day, new year etc. fireworks is best displayed here."
,,"Great scenery, Great shopping, Great place for anybody who loves modern architecture",5.0,,"A perfect place for anybody who wants to be blown away by the beautiful view of the Singapore city. I recommend going to the skygarden of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

There is also a huge water platform outside the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes which there are shows screening every night. It's a great place to chill and to enjoy the nice view."
,,An absolute must see,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands is one of the main attractions in Singapore. If ur fortunate enough to stay there then u can go up to the skypark whenever u want and r free to use the facilities as well. The view from up there is absolutely beautiful. Can see most of Singapore from up there. They also have a regular night show that is free for anybody that would like to watch. It's a beautiful lights and water fountain feature that is a good way to relax after a days shopping and sightseeing at the Marina
,,Manificient skyline,5.0,,"On the bank near Fullerton Hotel, you have the awesome view of Marina Bay Sands (MBS Casino). Stroll across to the MBS, you will have the awesome view of the CBD skyline with the Merlion spewing water and the unique structure of Esplanade. A must visit."
,,Dinner at Sky 57,5.0,,"We visited the entire ""boat"" area at night. What a beautiful view no matter where we turned. Then we finished it by a fabulous dinner at Sky 57. A great day all around."
,,"If i'm a tourist in SG, this is one place i will visit!",5.0,,"Located just next to the Marina Bay Sands Casino & Hotel, this area is a one stop for multiple activities. There is good photography spots, nice cafes nearby to chillout, shopping centres nearby to satisfy shopperholics. (Or the ever desirable casino for gamblers, though i personally do not like casinos) Go there late in the night and it becomes a nice romantic spot for strolling and chit chat. And hey, did i mention that the singapore merlion statue is just around the corner? There u go. What more can you ask for in one place?"
,,Stress reliever,5.0,,"We made sure to see the Merlion and other attractions at Marina Bay both at day and night so we went there around 7pm. The place is really beautiful. We first saw the baby Merlion behind the real Merlion and then there's the majestic Marina Bay Sands, the Esplanade at your right as well as the Singapore Flyer. If you go there at the time same as ours, you'll see many tourists but if you visit it early in the morning you can own the place. The scene changes at night, with lots of colorful dancing lights."
,,Great Master Piece,4.0,,"What used to be the center of Singapore business/economic activities - the Singapore River, Telok Ayer Basin and Clifford Pier has now been transformed to the Marina Bay. Great achievement by the planners to dam up the mouth of the Singapore River to ' retain' rain waters that (wastefully) flow into the open sea and eventually to create a 'fresh water lake'. Taking a stroll around the Bay, one would catch glimpses of iconic structure like the Esplanade Theatre by the Bay, Merlion Park, Marina Bay Sands (MBS), Singapore Flyer etc and it would give photographic buffs a great time to capture the buildings, scenery (whatever) from any angle of choice. A great place to take a walk around the Bay for anyone (and family) to enjoy different sights at almost every turn. Stop by the MBS Shoppe and Food Court, enjoy the great varieties of food/drinks and venture on to the Helix Bridge for lights display/show (in the night only). Inspect the biggest floating platform and admire the achievement of our builders. A camera is must-bring, to capture all the sights."
,,Beautiful view of THE landmark of Singapore,4.0,,"It has been a year since I moved to Singapore as an expat. We have several friends visiting from Australia, UK and other neighbouring countries. Marina Bay is a must see place where I will take all my visitors to have photos taken outside the surrounding areas. Really pleasant to walk around in the evening when it is not too hot.

Inside Marina Bay Sands we have all the branded names boutiques and my favourite is the Louis Vuitton shop which is architecturally impressive and great view looking out from the bottom deck. There is the casino inside, a skating rink and a food court. I have been to the conference centres upstairs and they are also very impressive. No problem to sit down for a cuppa or have something to eat...a few choices of restaurants and cafes.

It is a nice place to take visitors to walk around at leisure, enjoying the window shopping and maybe a flutter or two at the casino. Very accessible by MRT and so convenient."
,,Amazing and even more amazing,4.0,,"This area is a must do when in Singapore, with restaurants and bars at dizzy heights with unbelievable views. A museum in the most interestingly designed building I have ever seen, shopping galore ... even gondola rides in the 'Shoppes' at Marina Bay ... it is very impressive and spectacular overlooking the business district's staggering sky scrappers and the Merlion. Marina Bay is amazing and a credit to Singaporean ingenuity."
,,Good for sight-seeing,4.0,,"This place is good for those who loves to take photos. Beautiful sights. If you are looking for some gambling action, you can visit the nearby Marina Bay Sands Casino. The Esplanade is visible and within walking distance from Marina Bay."
,,Concrete forest,3.0,,"Nothing special if u r from a big developed city.it's central business district of Singapore. A lot of high rise building, some museum also available, the sea view got plain view."
,,Fantastic area!,5.0,,Marina Bay Singapore is an awesome area with some of the most spectacular architecture you will ever see! I definitely recommend going for a walk around the bay and checking out what it has to offer! Believe me you will find yourself looking up a lot!
,,Night time visit,4.0,,"we came here for dinner, ended up downstairs at a Chinese restaurant which was great! Located just up from the food court area. Kids and adults loved the food!
There is a water and light show on twice a night, we saw the 8pm show which was really good, SO many people there to watch it."
,,wonder full show at wonderful bay,5.0,,"don't miss the evening sound , light & water show at the bay. city skyline seems to attract you from this place a good place to grab some good pics of city."
,,Spectacular views but expensive,4.0,,"There are some amazing things to see in this area but if you want to eat or drink anything, be prepared to pay. There is a light show from the Marina Bay Sands every evening around 8 which is worth a look"
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,"I live in Singapore for more than a year and everytime I go there or I took ECP, I cannot avoid to look at it.

It is my favourite zone in Singapore for going with friends, taking pictures or just wandering alone. First place where I go with the people that come to visit me."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"must go place in Singapore, get off at raffles place station and after a short walk you'll see this magnificent view! A great place at night for photographers of any kind."
,,Modern bay,4.0,,Just wear a hat if you visit it at day. But it was a very beautiful place to visit and make a photograph
,,The place to go,4.0,,Go see the Marina Bay to see the Sands and the other building around. I suggest taking the river boat taxi to have the best view
,,The future of Singapore,4.0,,The area is very well designed. Even on a saturday afternoon the area is not crowded. You use the faciliteis without delay. Still thousands must have walked around in the area.
,,Certainly worth a visit,5.0,,We wish we could have spent more time here! Loved the night-show too! The Casino is worth a look. A lovely reasonably-priced eating area on one of the basement levels. And easy-walking-distance to the Egyptian 3D exhibition at the lotus-shaped museum.
,,Plan for an evening walk and light show,5.0,,There is light and sound show at marina bay sands at 7.30 and 9.30 in the evening. It's a good free show which is worth a watch if you plan for Marina Bay.
,,Marina bay,4.0,,The place is so beautiful you can walk around and enjoy the light show in evening. The laser show is fantastic.
,,So much to see,5.0,,"So much to see and do and all easily reached by foot, the Mer Lion, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay the list goes on spent the best part of a day here and it was great."
,,Night Time,3.0,,Their night time entertain is great and must explore them. On the National Day massive fire works exercise and military parade is a marvel....
,,Go for a walk around the Marina,4.0,,"Everybody comes to the Marina, either to see the Merlion or to visit the new Marina Bay Sands.

For a good view, take a walk around the Marina. It's rather large, but you'll pass get to appreciate the view from all angles. One bridge is designed as a DNA double-helix, complete with DNA codes embedded in the ground lighting.

The Singapore River Cruise boats also stop in the Marina, offering a water-based view of Singapore."
,,Cool Area - Worth A Visit!,4.0,,"The Marina Bay is a great place, highly recommend it for a night out in Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful building as we were in awe of the building itself, it is quite an imposing building at first sight."
,,Wonderland at night,5.0,,Fireworks and water display plus views of the harbour or the Marine Garden was awesome. This place is a must on anyone's trip to Singapore. Have a Singapore Sling in the bar on the 57 floor for me.
,,LOVELY PLACE TO SPEND YOUR EVENINGS,4.0,,"Walking or jogging or simply soaking into the evening ambience of the Marina Bay. the thousands of lights illuminating the place alongwith the gorgeous view of the nearby places makes this place unique. With choice of restaurants and bars and live music playing at the bay, was a wonderful and chilled out experience with our friends.."
,,Enthralling,5.0,,Make sure you find the time to visit Marina Bay for the evening son et lumiere show. Music and lasers cut through the night sky to produce a magical experience.....and it's all free!
,,Most fabulous place in Singapore!,5.0,,I was happy deciding not to skip it in my last night in Singapore!! From here you can take in the most breathtaking view of the bay surrounded by skyscrapers. Come here at night and charge up your camera!
,,amazing,3.0,,"The Bay and alot of Singapore is dominated by the amazing hotel that has 3 tower blocks. Try and get to the bar and restaurant on the 57th floor for amazing views of singapore. Better stil try and book a table there. we tried and failed only because we left it too late. Something that we didnt see in any of the guide books is the laser / water show on the bay in the evenings. Try and catch it, it lasts about 20 minutes and its really goooooood"
,,"Impressive view, even better at night with the fantastic light show",5.0,,"Lovely to walk around the area and to be ""wow-ed"" by the view. Especially at night, it is truly amazing. Don't forget the light show at 8.00PM of 9.30PM. It is amazing!"
,,Lovely area to walk,5.0,,"Very pretty area to take a stroll. Lots of nice views. Best photo opportunity of the Merlion. Lots of cafes, restaurants and shopping mall."
,,Worth it to take a river cruise to Clarke Quay,3.0,,"Some coffee shops and restaurants here, good photo ops of the Merlion, the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, and the Bay in general. Worth it to take a river boat cruise to Clark Quay where there are exceptional options for night life, dining, and socializing!"
,,Impressive,4.0,,"We finally found The Merlion Park & our first view of Marina Bay. The Marina Bay Sands steals the horizon, but the area of Marina Bay is truly impressive. There seems to be something being built or altered wherever you look. This is not a bad thing though as tourists have so much to see & experience. A must is the Gardens by the Bay. Magnificent. The sky walk gives you a great panorama of Singapore & the bay area."
,,Nice area,5.0,,The marina bay area is lovely; enjoyable for taking walks and even jogging for exercise. Its a nice area to take in the different sights in Singapore. There are lots and I mean LOTS of shopping centres in the area. The lights show done by the Marina Bay Sands hotel at night is worth a look if you are in the area.
,,A lovely area,5.0,,"This is great place to visit. The way we did it was to walk right around the whole Bay starting near the Merlon statue. This is a really touristy place with all of the tour buses and droves of people. We then walked around past the concert hall and along the footpath, past the Olympic area, the Science Museum and through Marina bay Plaza. The food court inside was quite good (as food courts go) and there are nice clean toilets. We then walked through the Marina Bay Sands. If you want to go for the exclusive brands then go there. If you want cheap shopping then don’t bother. Further along outside you want walk past the old boat staging areas. It is a pleasant place to walk along and have your lunch outside and admire the scenery. Like most of Singapore it is very clean and well set out."
,,Perfect,5.0,,"This place has really stepped up its game in the last 10 years and was barely recognisable this time! I had 3 days in Singapore but could easily have spent much longer exploring. You can easily spend a whole day wandering around here and definitely stick around for the light shows in the evening.

Food etc can be purchased much cheaper away form the bay in areas such as Little India or at many other spots around Singapore so I would suggest to save money, eat first and then come and have fun."
,,The place for some excellent snaps.,4.0,,The area around marina bay is pretty awesome for pictures of Singapore. You cold probably spend a couple of hours wandering around here and taking in the sights.
,,View,4.0,,It has a good view to the river and you can see some nice traditional boats. The buildings around the Marina are impressive and the architecture is very futuristic. The night lights show is also nice to see although nothing special.
,,Beautiful place to roam about,5.0,,Marina Bay is a beautiful place to roam about! Breathtaking skylines in early morning and in late evening. A must-visit in Singapore.
,,A must,5.0,,This gave us a different perspective of the city. Learning the river was being turned into a fresh water source for the city in the future was very interesting. It was great to see how much care people take in their city.
,,Very scenic,5.0,,The view of Marina bay and the Merlion was picturesque. A music band was presenting a performance at Marina Bay.
,,Lunch at the marina,4.0,,Nice place for lunch with view of the bridge to Maylasia. Local and western fare is available. Very busy so get there early if you are on a time limit.
,,The place to sightsee in Singapore,5.0,,"Sands Hotel and the garden area, Nice parks around there too. If youre a runner this is where you want to go."
,,Marina bay,5.0,,"Very modern very clean , plenty of upmarket shops and cafes . Close to the casino and all the walking areas"
,,Nice area to enjoy harbour front activities,5.0,,"Lots to see, good food around, great atmosphere. Get on a boat ride to explore more for the Singapore river and the bay"
,,Too much to see and do,5.0,,"Having arrived in Singapore to emigrate 2 weeks ago, our visit to Marina Bay took place this weekend. All I can say is WOW - I though Dubai was good (in 2007) but this is something else, everything is out this world from the Shopping Centres to the Water Gardens and the Hotel itself. It will take us years to discover everything that it has. Looking froward to visiting again v v v soon."
,,Great view,5.0,,"Great place to hang around, eat and relax. The S. Flyer is within walking distance. The Wonder Full LIght show in the evening is very nice."
,,Pleasant day out on National day rehearsals,4.0,,"Fireworks, bands and entertainment all in rehearsal for National day later this year. Will be worth a visit if there on the day"
,,Awesome View at night,4.0,,A must when you visit Singapore. The scenery is gorgeous and magnificient. A good place to visit after dinner.
,,Merlion,4.0,,"This was one of the best parts. I was introducted to an ice-cream sandwich which i had like 4 off. it was brilliant. the Merlion is also here so be warned this is a busy place. the crossing to the merlion is via under the bridge, next to the water way"
,,An obvious MUST!,5.0,,"This area says: ""Singapore!""
There's no way you can visit Singapore and pass this one.
The view is definitely magnificent! Great for photos taking!
Easily reached by MRT. drop off at City Hall station from North South Line, the exit will lead straight up to inside of Esplanade theater. Take the lift and go up to ground floor of the theater. Walk out of the the main door and you'll see on your right a bridge connecting the theater with the Merlion, you should have a great look of all from that bridge. In general, it's very easy to get around this area because everything is in walking distance."
,,"Beautiful place with amazing performance of sea, light and music - must come",5.0,,"It is really nice place with amazing performance. The air is fresh and cool. Strongly recommend! Don't miss anything at this area and around: Fullerton, Esplanade, Merlion, Garden by the bay"

,,Beautiful,4.0,,"I walked to the marina from Clarke Quay along the river. It was amazing as the river twisted and turned and eventually gave way to the marina.

,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"The bay is a wonderful mix of the old and the very new. To see the spectacule of the Marina Sands Hotel and turn and see The Fullerton with Boat Quay peeking over its shoulder is to appreciate the mix of cultures and the blend of architecture to be found in Singapore.
Walk along the Esplanard with its two domes and outdoor theatres, cross the Helix Bridge and see the Splendour of TH Marina Sands, The Merlion on its little pier and go under the Bridge for the best Starbucks coffee in town. Then when you are finished take a Night river cruise in an old bum boat and see it all again at night and catch the light show in the Bay."
,,"The half lion and half fish statue, is the symbolic of the Singapore",5.0,,"Night time spending there brings a relief to the hearts. Not sure why..but that's the truth, mind get relax if you sit there and enjoy the scenery. Backgrouding the high rise building of all banks in Singapore, Marina Bay is a must visit place."
,,Iconic location,4.0,,"Yes, this is the view everyone sees and as you move around the sights are all there, Merlion, Singapore Wheel, the Marina Hotel and the city skyline. Lovely place to walk and relax - but food/drink prices can be high."

,,Marina Bay,4.0,,So much to see and the hotel was just so different to see and the gardens and settings fantastic. Easy to get around everything
,,See the light show!,5.0,,"best light showI've ever seen - really clever technology of images, lasers, sound and water - a must see!"

,,Nice view,4.0,,Great place to visit in evenings for the view of the bay and the light shows at night 8:30 and 9:30 PM
,,amazing architecture and average food court,3.0,,upmarket prices for less than upmarket food court fare. Check out the light show at 830 and have a wander through but better food can be had elsewhere
,,O M G,5.0,,The most spectacular place i have ever seen it was the basis to everything good in Singapore the Lazer show The Marina Bay Sands Hotel the Arts Science Museum the Merlion and i could go on just go and visit.
,,A must see,5.0,,"Whether you are into shopping, architecture or simply a great experience, this is one place you should visit."
,,Watershow is great,5.0,,The watershow on an evening on the hour after dark is excellent. Head over on the side of the Sands Hotel and you get a great view of the bay as well as a light show with water lasting 10 mins or so. Its a nice walk around the bay as well.
,,"Marina Bay: Visit it, so that you dont miss 'The Merlion' icon of Singapore",4.0,,"If you are in Singapore even for half a day... visit this otherwise you would feel your visit is incomplete (though it is not)... Go there for fresh air, view of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Merlion, view of the bay itself the river adjoining... the Singapore flyer view... etc....

And, don't miss to take a boat ride to and from Clark Quay, it takes 20 SGD for adult and 18 for kids (as much as I can remember).... When you stop at Clark Quay... there are numbers of very good restaurants and bars.... The restaurants though looks expensive but they actually are not... foods are good..! It is more of an international place than Singapore .... people from many cultures you will find...

And, do not miss the Turkish Ice cream there.... its fun... kids and adults love it....price SGD 5 for one ice cream..... there are few activity items around too....!

When finished.... get back to any boat show them your ticket and take a boat ride back to Marina Bay... near by Merlion..."
,,Cocktails at the top,4.0,,"There is a really impressive lights show in the evening, I think its on twice. We also visited the Sky Bar to have a cocktail, only one though as they are very expensive. The view from the top is worth the visit"
,,Elite and Classy,5.0,,"The look of this area will tell you that this isn't for a common walk, studded with one of the most luxurious hotels of Singapore i.e Marina bay sands this place has a lot more to offer. If you got money and would like to spend in style this is the place."
,,Great iconic views.,4.0,,"In terms of tourism this is a great place to start a visit, there is a Starbucks coffee across the bay from Marina Bay Sands with great views of the iconic building and the Merlion."
,,Get ready your tripod...,5.0,,Night view is excellent. I have uploaded some photos. There is also a light show but music quality is not great. The hour that it was being played was at 9pm Singapore time. Get ready with it. Enjoy....
,,Fascinating architecture in this over the top building,4.0,,"The building design is very usual and unique, the station is integrated into the development with access through an arcade of upmarket shops."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"We really like this place too.We did this after we went for our ride on the big wheel as it is not far to walk to . This is a great place on the lake and we had a lovely lunch here. This is a must to do and go up to the top roof deck were their is a fabulous pool and the best dinning places there especially Ku DE TAR it is the best veiw and we walked around the deck and kater we were entertained by some firer dances which added to the day.
Later that afternoon we court a oat and we went back up to Clark Key and walked around there and we had a few drinks sitting over the lake ."
,,Great night time illuminations,4.0,,"Get so good night photos of the bay, with the marina bay sands hotel/ casino and theater as the back drop. We had pre-booked a night time boat trip around the bay and up the river which was disappointing short trip nothing you cant see from the shore.

Lots of nice bars and restaurants line the bay and river get ready for the extremely expensive food and drink with a beer costing around 10 GBP."
,,"Amazing, epic and mindblowing structure s",5.0,,"I was simply taken back by the grandeur of Marina Bay Sands and it seems like the greatest man made structure on the planet.

i arrived at the mtr station and at first i saw many high end shops with polished marble floors, followed by the casino entrance where they charge for entry, so we skipped that. So far, no big deal. then we came up to one of the towers which was massive and the architecture started to impress. this led to the shopping arcade which was quite grand and had every high end brand under the sun. we saw a canal with small boats, then found the amazing food court with an ice skating rink and enjoyed great food. most parts of the center had free Wi-Fi too, so it's great to finally sit down and relax for an hour.

when we found our way up the escalator to the outdoor area, the view was exceptional. But the ultimate highlight was back inside, where we could see a huge escalator to the rooftop. this is the start of an epic 1 hour journey that is one of the greatest marvels you will ever see, across bridges under the grand towers, heading towards the gardens with views of futuristic sculptures.

take your camera and spend hours here?"
,,Worth a peak,4.0,,Really worth a visit and a spot of shopping in one of the nicest shopping malls ever. Great views and opportunities for some lovely photos.
,,modern,5.0,,"high-end shopping at its best, restaurants and excellent theater. A gondola ride inside and TWG to be see and be seen. Biggest LV store and other name brand products, name it, they have it.

excellent view of the Bay, very ideal to bring family and business associates.

modern and futuristic architecture"
,,Was thinking it will blow me away...,3.0,,"Hear so many people talking about it and when finally was there was quite disappointed. Hotel is huge, totally unpersonal service as well attitude in all aspects.
Shops are out of range about prices and the mall quite empty.
Well nothing to compare with malls in Bangkok. Even boring at the end..."
,,Stay at least once,3.0,,"This is a place you have to stay once to say you have been, and then every other time stay somewhere else. We had a great room and view, but it was too big and busy for us."
,,Just simply amazing!,5.0,,"The huge ""cricket pitch"" in Singapore is still amazing after seeing 3 years after first saw it just being completed in 2010. You must see it if you come here and experience the top!"
,,Make two visits,4.0,,We first went to the 8.30pm show by the shopping arcade and this was good with the whole crowd enjoying the experience. We went back for the same show but this time we were at the Merlion to see the lasers and this was very good
,,Great for the whole family,5.0,,"We visited in May 2013. My children, husband and I were blown away by the Lego exhibit and the Egyptian exhibit. The Center provided kids packs for the Egyptian exhibit, which were really great and kept my kids interested the whole time."
,,"wow,,,",5.0,,"its always great to walk around Marina Bay, its gigantic building with boat shape, great great light on night time, one of Icon of Singapore. worth to take a walk, great for photos and i never get enough to stare the light. amazing marina bay."
,,I love Singapore,5.0,,Visited Singapore for 6 days and I loved every minute. The city is so clean and structured and so much to do and see. The marina bay is a joy to walk around. Walked around it just enjoying the city view and enjoying the scenery around marina bay sands and the garden. Marina bay is a must do walk around for anyone
,,Gorgeous place!,5.0,,"It's the famous skyline of Singapore. It's so goodlooking you can't believe it! You have Marina Bay Sands Hotel and also the shopping centre right there. Every night you can enjoy a Sound, Water and Music show with the Singapore lights as a great scenery. Unforgettable experience!"
,,Nice place to visit day or night!,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a place not to miss when visit Singapore. It is beautiful in the day time or night time. I was there after 4pm with my two sisters, sipping ice cold fresh coconut juice and enjoying the breeze and the scenery. We were at the rooftop next to Esplanade-Theatres on the Bay and the view was fantastic. We walked to the bridge to which the structure looks like the DNA helix; there were beautiful sunset on that day. Sands hotel and casino is famous on its rooftop swimming pool and it is close to the bay. We didn't go in to the casino as I forgot my passport. We left for dinner and back again late in the night. It was totally different view and absolutely beautiful, the Merlion is more beautiful for the picture at the night time and not too many people as it was in the day time."
,,"""Marina Bay was fun too""",4.0,,"We touched Marina Bay few times during our Singapore visit and it was nice experience. During duck tour we started from Singapore flyer & the same vehicle got into Marina Bay passing through beautiful buildings, bridge, Marina Bay Sand & the Merlion & back to Singapore Flyer. During night tour also we ended out tour at Marina Bay, sat down & enjoyed beautiful colorful view of the bay & the buildings including Marina Bay Sands. It was good experience."
,,Wow,5.0,,This was great. Spending time at marina bay is a must. The buildings are amazing you also have nice view of the flyer
,,Take a bumboat,5.0,,"Go to Clarke Quay late afternoon, buy a ticket for the 18.30 boat tour, stroll around the dozens of restaurants and pick one out for dinner. Have a drink at a riverside bar. Get on your boat. And feel your jaw drop when you reach Marina Bay at the sight of Marina Bay Sands hotel."
,,Nice place to visit.,4.0,,we like coming down here to see the sights and the views.. its is a perfect place to sit and people watch as well… funny
,,Great Buidling,4.0,,"Absolutely stunning Singaporian style building, just like many other in the city, a show of marvelous engineering and technology, you really need to see it to realize the size of this structures, and how beautiful they look."
,,"Nice views, a good walk",5.0,,"I doubt I need to recommend this place to you as it seems that everyone who visits Singapore goes there. In case you're on the fence, just know that its a great, free path, with views of the bay and that crazy boat hotel (going to the top of the hotel has a price, though) and if you visit the enormous mall and other places you can make an entire day out of the Marina.

Also, make sure you get a picture with the Merlion!"
,,Pretty Place,4.0,,"Do the local river cruise in the evening and experience all the colour and viberance of Singapore, great value add on to any trip."
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,The whole area is so 'Singapore' with new extravagant buildings along the shore of what is now the dammed up Singapore river. The river is now a big reservoir for Singapore. Not sure what happened to the previous estuarine ecosystem. Is spectacular and free.
,,Up to the Top and have a Singapore Sling,5.0,,"I was told that if you asked to go to the restaurant on the top, you didn't have to pay. I went up and ordered a Singapore Sling. The view is Awesome. There is a observatory deck, but you can have lunch and drinks.
Take the time and visit. Across the street is the Casino, The taxi rides are really inexpensive. Plenty to see Up on Top!"
,,Just another mall,3.0,,"Lots of high end shops, with expensive merchandise, but good for window shopping. But really just another mall, very similar to any other."
,,Great Tour but be early,5.0,,"There are 3 tours a day to see the 57th floor of Marina Bay and they only allow 50 people per tour so be early or you will miss out. It is the only way to see the infinity pool unless you are staying in the hotel. If you can not go on a tour you can still go up to the 56th floor but the 57th floor is even more spectacular. The views are the best from there, looking down at the Marina Bay Garden ( man made ), the sea and much much more. My daughter took beautiful panoramic photos from the top."
,,spectacular,5.0,,"all i can say is i loved the architecture,beautiful place.You have everything in one place,if you are a tourist for example attending a conference all you need to do is stay in one of the hotels,then attend the conference in pretty much the same building,then afterwards go shopping in the same building.u could saty in that building your whole stay in Singapore if You arent into sightseeing and be totally satisfied.is that cool or what."
,,City,3.0,,"It is like just another city, with many buildings. I cannot find anything interesting. It is nice to look at and that's abt it for me. I believe Singapore is abt the neughbourhood and not the high rise buildings"
,,High End & Quality is here,5.0,,"For those shopaholic enthusiasts, this is shopping mecca for all ages and group. There is a casino at the venue. And you will love the swimming pool located at the top of the building."
,,Cigarette smokers delight,2.0,,"The casino is new, and of course neat and clean. It has two floor in an open circle style (atrium). The lower level is the floor where smoking is permitted, so the smoke odor inevitably drifts up the the upper level due to the open atrium style of architecture. Ugh."
,,A drink on the Top Bar is a must,5.0,,"The architecture of the Marina Bay is just special, to have a drink at sunset overlooking the City is breathtaking. Just very pleasant to spend some time there."
,,Great place for seafood!,5.0,,If you are a seafood lover than this is a must when visiting Singapore. The view and the food are both fantastic!
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,A great space to visit. The shpooing centre is full of designer lables if you want to shop. The Marina Bay Sands hotel dominates the skyline and is an amazing building to see
,,Marina Bay Cruise Centre,1.0,,"Recently we boarded ship at Marina Bay Cruise Terminal.
The cruise was with a larger ship of 2000 people and the congestion and queuing to get on board was terrible.
The situation at the disembarkation was a lot smoother, however a wait for taxis of 70 minutes was experienced.
Taxi drivers just are not aware this new terminal is operating and it is in a remote location.
Travellers with ongoing connections take note!!!!
Management needs to install the typical Singapore flashing light requirement for taxis and make it known to taxi companies when cruises are in town.
A very poor effort indeed."
,,Great architecture - profane interior,4.0,,"A wonderfulcombination of large halls and a stunning skyscraper on three pillars. Great to see both in bright daylight and by night.
what's in it? endless rows of shops, mainly the more expensive ones, a casino and a hotel. Fits well with the city's enterpreneurial nature."
,,Great place to see the sites on the bay and the city.,5.0,,We visited here on our first morning and our first exposure was on a river cruise. The breeze on the boat was cooling and we didn't get the effect until we emerged around the last corner into the bay. wow what a place. Modern on one side and old colonial on the other the 2 mix very well. The iconic view is the view of Singapore and it really lives up to the billing. The fountains were great as we're the who surrounding area clean parks and walk ways. A credit to Singapore a must visit even as a stop over.
,,Topdesign and green area,5.0,,"The Bay Area is very nicely designed and has for everyone a place to enjoy leisure time! Awesome trees, flowers and walkways! Easily reachable with public transport. A real pleasure, nice people and fun time!"
,,Overlooking the city ..,4.0,,"to visit a place like this...really amazing,relaxing. Kudos singapore!!! You have a wonderful and clean country...come and visit sky park ."
,,Wow!,4.0,,"We took a boat from Clark quay to visit this magnificent building. It looks amazing at sunset and the food court is also massive, offering food from different cuisines. Nice place to visit in Singapore."
,,Shopping at Marina Bay,5.0,,Great tourists space - casino on the ground floor with oodles of high end shops to spoil yourself in! Great browsing all the same!
,,Still awesome on the second visit,4.0,,"I have been here during the day and at night and would say that there is more to see during the night with the light display, even so daytime is still worth a visit"
,,Great views from the top,5.0,,This is a must see in Singapore. The views from the top are spectacular especially at night. The shopping is great and the food court is very large with great variety....something for everyone.
,,Amazing place,4.0,,Fantastic shopping centre and the view from the top has to be seen to be believed. This is truely an engineering feat.
,,The best modern city I have ever visited,5.0,,"Just amazing. Don't miss it if you have a chance to visit this very beatiful country !
If you can afford it, take the tourist boat from Clark Quay. It will enable you to visit the hidden side of the Bay and the mix of traditional and modern lifestyle of the Singaporians !"
,,Great walking tour,4.0,,"We started from Promenade MRT, walked to the Flyer and went for a ride, which was okay (and expensive) -- but once we started to walk around the bay, it was great -- first over to Marina Bay Sands (I guess we could've also gone to the nearby Gardens by the Bay but our kids weren't up for it), it's got a killer view of Singapore skyline -- you can also get on the riverboat cruise from here (we didn't do that), then over to the other side all the way to Merlion park for some lychee ice cream and get your pictures taken against the Lion fountain as well as the Marina bay sands hotel"
,,Good Time,4.0,,"Should definitely be marked on the list to at least pass through while in Singapore. Great place to people watch, and tons to do."
,,"good view, luxury",4.0,,"Beside the marina bay is singapore river, u can see the luxury building and hotel and the river there. and there are a lot of branded goods inside the marina shoppes.. and many other attraction like supertree just near by there."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Was an incredible place, soooo many shops, so many levels not enough time. Only down side not enough food shops"
,,Brilliant - Fantastic - Dont Forget Your Camera,5.0,,"The last time I was there was back in 2009 this time i booked myself on the free singapore coach trip . The bus stopped at Marina bay for 15 min . Anyway to cut a long story short myself and another coach tripper were left stranded and had to get a taxi back to the airport .
I took some photos which I will upload in a few days , any time day or night the views , sights and the city vibe in Marina bay is something special take all the photos you can so you can relive the memories when you get home .
Enjoy .."
,,Cool,4.0,,Very Large. The only good thing is the boat on the top and the building just has lots of shops and casino;s. not family friendly
,,Nice Mall and Casino,4.0,,We went to the Marina Bay Sands Mall and Casino while on our trip. Very upscale mall - every designer is there. We ate at the casino - don't remember name of the restaurant.
,,Very Impressive,5.0,,"When lights are on it is dazzling and a great experience , good place to spend some leisurely time with family wtc"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"This place is on all brochures. The Merlion with water fountain is not very great either in size or location. There is a bridge right next and hence, not a great view from this place also. You wouldn't miss anything if you do not visit."
,,Amazing Skyline,5.0,,"Magnificent building, countless angles to take photos. The laser lights and night is a sight to behold"
,,Take time to watch the light show,4.0,,"I have always watched the light show from the merlion side of the bay... But having popped to the food court at marina bay sands, we popped out to find that from this side the display, with movie clips on the spray of water was amazing. Well worth seeing and of course... It's free! Lots of food choices as well from $5 in the food hall to very very expensive!"
,,AMAZING VISUALS!,5.0,,"Although I did not stay here during my visit to Singapore, I CERTAINLY made a visit...not trip to Singapore would be complete without seeing this place. It TRULY is an impressive piece of architecture....must more visually appealing at night, though! A visit to the hotel could include a splash in the infinity pool on top (HOWEVER, be advised, you must make reservations!), a trip to the casino, and/or a walk to the Gardens by the Bay...a MUST SEE!"
,,Great at sunset!,5.0,,"Worth a visit to the sky deck at the hotel, especially if you can make it for sunset. Great views across Singapore, good for getting your bearings on where the sights are across the city."
,,Beautiful part of the city....,5.0,,"Marina Bay is the district/area that is found at the start of the Singapore River around Marina Bay (obviously). It is full of bars, restaurants, hotels, shopping, and attractions. You can go there in the day for a stroll or a jog or go in the evening for drinks/food. Great place to sit, relax, and read a book. It is spectacular at night. The latest addition is the Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino and the mall with a great theatre. There is a nightly light show that you should see (only about 15 minutes or so and show 2-3 times a night, depending on the night). You can easily reach Marina Bay via the MRT (City Hall station, Raffles Place station, Marina Bay Station, Promenade station, Esplanade Station). Parking can be expensive so better to use the MRT. You can walk up to the 'Gardens on the Bay' from Marina Bay as well. Bring your camera!!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I live at The Sail on the Marina Bay and I think the Marina Bay is one of the most beautiful places in the world. It is stunningly breath taking and serene - in the evenings, you will see people jogging, families with children strolling and even kite flyers at the Marina Barrage. A postcard worthy place!"
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Really enjoyed our stay. We had the afternoon tea, cocktails at night and found the staff caring and attentive.The kids loved the pool. A great time had by us all."
,,So much to see and do,4.0,,"This area is a must if you are visiting Singapore. The hotel and mall (across the road but connected with walkway) are worth seeing.Lots of shops, restaurants, bars (2-4-1 happy hours etc). The light show was also wonderful. Easy to get to by MRT and bus."
,,Use for joggig,4.0,,"Although rather meant as a shopping and entertainment area, go there for a jog. Very easy to find the way around. If you want to do the bigger trail, do include the garden behind the marina bay sands. The view is spectacular"
,,must visit,5.0,,"must visit,great place,briliant architecture,great views and its hosts some of the biggest names in fashion in the world"
,,Drastic Changes in Singapore Skyline,4.0,,"Dont miss the Laser and Light shows at 8 and 9 pm. Magnificent sight of the Sands Resort Complex. Best viewed from outside the Esplanade Theatres or the Merlion Park. Dont miss the helical bridge from promenade to sands hotel,"
,,Cool place to spend the evening,4.0,,"This place is pretty cool and packs multiple attractions under one roof that looks like a ship :)

1. MBS sky park observation deck
2. Very near to the Gardens by the bay
3. Shopping complex
4. International brands
5. Some fine dining restaurants
6. Rasapura masters - food court that fits anyone's budget
7. Light and laser show that is free and better than Songs of the sea
8. Majestic views of Singapore - Priceless"
,,Wow what a view,4.0,,We have traveled to Singapore many times over the past several years and to truly see the city you really need to go up on top and have lunch or just a glass of wine and sit. Whaling around the perimeter gives you a full city view. We love that they put a pool and beach complete with palm trees up there...lovely hotel
,,Fantastic !,5.0,,Marina Bay had not been completed when I last visited Singapore in 2008 but boy was it worth waiting for ! When Singapore does something it does it right. Congratulations.
,,Proud of Singapore,5.0,,Very beautiful place....don't miss the laser show... the show was very beautiful and entertaining. Amazing technologies used. Keep it up!
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"wow the Garden is very hard to describe, it is a series of large metal structures fashioned to look like trees with walkways connecting them, views to die for . Plus on certain days & times they have a laser light show. There is also a Flower Dome, a giant conservatory filled with some of the world's most exotic flower species, The Dragonfly Lake that is filled with various species of fish and plants and many other eco-friendly attractions. It is free to walk the o/side but about S$20 for entry. We caught a taxi there from our hotel and it cost about S$8 . If you use your Singapore Airline boarding pass you get a special entry discount...."
,,Very Impressive,5.0,,Marina Bay is a must see! The beautiful design of the boat is eye capturing for photographers & I love the Gondola ride through the shops. Aswell as the stunning light show off the boat at night is truly amazing!!!
,,Stunning place,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful bay in the world, the paradise for Photographers. You should try the singapore flyer if you have time, you have a fantastic view of marina bay"
,,Wow,5.0,,Marina Bay is impressive - this time in Singapore we only had a few hours to spare with a stopover. So pleased that we spent the time exploring Marina Bay. The lift to the top is expensive but worth it - particulary with the 25% discount for Amex cardholders.
,,Marina Bay view,4.0,,"We took the MRT Promenade (CC4) exit then interchanged to Platform B for Bayfront exit. Upon the MRT exit, just turn left where you can see the Gondola Ride from afar. Just pass through the mall which is more the convenient way.

I like the Marina Bay during gloomy and night time. Gloomy because it's not that warm and we enjoyed more of the view of the Bay. At 8PM, they have the lights show. Then dinner or bar hopping are also available along the Bay walks."
,,If you go to Singapore you have to visit Marina Bay.,5.0,,"The most imposing landmark in Singapore and a must visit attraction. You can spend a fortune in the flagship stores for every major designer, or just look around. We had a very expensive tiger beer and Bellini on the top of tower 3 where a rather fancy restaurant is located ($26 for a beer) as we wanted to say we'd been there and done it but you aren't obliged to buy a drink. You can pay for a tour around the hotel, including the infinity pool on the 56th floor, we didn't do this so can't advise if its worth the fee. There is a fairly reasonable hawker style food court for a more moderate budget, we found the food to be ok in there but nothing flash. Another thing to visit for is the free light show put on by the hotel each evening. Really good day spent in and around the Marina Bay."
,,marina bay evening,4.0,,"nice atmosphere, spoiled by the noise and light show from the Sands complex. quite lively, but one less expensive bar doing the best business"
,,must visit place,4.0,,"this is a must visit place in Singapore. There is universal studio, song of the sea, and many more attraction here. Visit the universal studio in the afternoon, and then finish your day with watching the song of the sea attraction in the evening"
,,"Pricey, Hyped & Tall - Photos are for free, thankfully!",3.0,,"I still don't understand what all the hoopla is about. The Marina Bay Sands hotel, I agree, is an architectural monster, resembling a cricket stump with the bails overgrown! But for that, unless you are the Gimme Versave/Armani types, the best to do would be to take a leisurely stroll through this area, maximise the photo ops and head to the nearest eat/drink joint at least 5 km away (unless again, you are the Gimmee types!). Sorry, that was a budget traveller's view/ opinion, and I know many out here would want to kick me for that one, but what the heck! For me, give me the Esplanade area, the water spouting Merlion and the lovely other sights, sounds and tastes of Singapore anyday, rather than the Marina Sands/Bay area. Probably a walk around at sunset may be a good idea, but we didn't want to return after a visit around noon. But if you do, don't miss the (free) laser and fountain show; especially if your Sentosa Sounds of the Sea had been washed away due to rain (like ours was!)."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"the view is just beautiful whether it is day or night. You have to know, that the swimming pool is not accessible if you don't have room in the hostel.
but you always have access to two points of view:
- first one, the sea
- And on the other side, the bay and the city of Singapore (for the latter, you need to go to the bar, but you do not really have to consume)"
,,Home of Merlion.,4.0,,It is nice especially in the night. Go check on the Merlion. There are some restaurants in that area but they all seemed pricy.
,,Overpriced Nonsense,1.0,,I can't imagine what sort of idiot would pay the prices they want at the shops here. All very overpriced. We gadly paid SGD $1800 for dinner at Restaurant Andre (excellent) but these proces are highway robbery). Don't bother.
,,"For shopping, brilliant",4.0,,The shops in Marina Bay sands are excellent. Huge variety in stunning surroundings. As the for the rest I thought it was all a bit tacky. The lobby of the hotel felt like a train station. We took the lift to the 57th floor where we had a very expensive coffee ($10 a cup)in a very tired bar/lounge. Without a doubt the view is amazing but the place at the top is not so great. Apparently at night the place is buzzing and so I guess no one would notice the holes in the seat covers.
,,Wow,4.0,,"Worth wandering around the area magnificent buildings, interesting water features in the main area of the Marina Bay Sands Complex"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,An easy MRT ride from Lavender once we worked out the end stations significance. Even when you get it wrong on the MRT it is easy to realise and correct without losing too much time. Great little restaraunts loads of shops and of course Marina Bay sands Hotel is incredible
,,Posh Mall,4.0,,The view of the bay is fabulous. Expensive lift ride to the top. But too many shopping outlets. Sadly nothing new in the merchandise from what is already available at Orchard road. They have a skating rink which my son loved.
,,A must place to visit during sun set,5.0,,"This is a must visit place in Singapore.
There are many places to see there such as: Marina Bay Sands Hotel with his amazing observatory and swing pool, the Singapore a flyer that is a nice way to see the city buildings from a different perspective, the F1 racing track, the lagoon with Singapore statue, etc.
If you go there near the sun set make sure to be on the Singapore Flyer or the Marina Garden by the Bay to take a nice photo."
,,Great Area,5.0,,Loads of shops and loads of food areas Views are great High end shops take your credit The shoppes is a great place if you want to get out of the afternoon heat
,,A must see,5.0,,"Get on a tour boat and rest your weary feet and enjoy the views - Clark Quay, the Merlion, amazing buildings, the list never stops. Worth seeing during the day, but even better at night."
,,good place for shopping and good food.,4.0,,plenty of good shops and eating houses with varying qualities and prices. Very competitive pricing for goods and services. Be aware of some sharp and pushy sales staff.
,,Good hotel and mall,3.0,,"If you love architecture, then you would want to visit this place. For shopping, it's not great. Plenty of famous brands with high price. Better off shopping at Changi Airport. Food option is okay."
,,Great views and entertainment!,5.0,,"Marina bay has great views of the financial district, and the ""blade-runner-like"" look that in my opinion displays Singapore at night. Laser shows, lots of restaurants and bars, shopping mall, eye-popping views... Definitely a great place to visit in Singapore!"
,,Iconic Singapore,5.0,,"This is the indelible mark left on your memory when you leave Singapore. A spectacular view right around, and plenty to see, eat and do."
,,NIce Tourist attraction,4.0,,This is one point in Singapore which no one wolud give a miss. The place is buzzing with foreigners taking their pics with the famous Merlion statue
,,Not value for money,3.0,,Views were great but it wasn't worth it's money cause u can't see the infinity pool until 9pm at night on a tour and they charge $30 for a photo n $6 for a magnet u can get in china town for $1. It is an amazing building however I would have preferred to spend my money on going into the gardens.
,,So beautiful and shiny!,5.0,,"After arriving in Singapore and feeling a little let down but the lack of glittery-ness and shiny buildings, this was the perfect antidote! Good in the day but the most stunning views at night. The pizza bar near the shopping complex doe amazing food too!"
,,Looking towards the Marina Sands Hotel and Casino,1.0,,Plenty of restaurants to choose from along side the waterfront. Pretty at night with lots of lights and reflections in the water. Very often there are live shows to stop and watch.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"This was an excellent start to our holiday, we went through the mall, pass the casino and up to the 152nd floor to view the amazing vista of Singapore. On a clear day you get a brilliant view."

,,Amazing place,4.0,,"We had a trip to Marina Bay.This place is amazing view,song and laser shows, a lot of brand shopping malls."
,,Tour by boat,5.0,,"Viewing architecture and city scenes from a small boat gave a sense of space in this densely populated vertical metropolis. The recorded audio information was helpful. Sitting outside enabled us to have a better view, but the extremely hot sun was uncomfortable. Take a bottle of water."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"This place is nice, specially Marina Bay Sands Hotel. From the Skypool, you can see the city.. The view is amazing.. Love it."
,,A must see,4.0,,"Gotta go up the tower at least once. The view is breathtaking and they do not restrict the time you can spend up there.
It moves in the wind - a bit scary at first.
We did thefree tour so that we could see the infinity pool but it was a bit zoo like being guided around the poolside watching people bathing. I would give that a miss."
,,Nice place for an evening walk,5.0,,"A leisurely trip around the bay at evening is a great way to spend your time for it offers all one might need - spectacular views, fire and laser shows, nice reflections in the water, shopping malls, delicious food in various dinning places, bunches of flowers, etc."

,,Marina bay,5.0,,One palace when you go to singapore you hav to see! it houses a shopping mall with boats cruising a grand canal along the rows of expensive shops on either side!
,,Lovel area,4.0,,Stunning background of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Take the time to visit the area in front of the hotel for the light show in the evening - well worth the 15 mins. Cross over the double helix bridge. Lovely walk.
,,A must see architectural wonder,4.0,,"Easily reached via the subway, this structure is worth a visit to marvel at the exterior and interior of the three connected hi-rise towers. Surrounded by nice grounds, it houses a shopping mall with boats cruising a grand canal along the rows of expensive shops on either side. Nearby Garden By The Sea offers beautiful walks in tropical flora."
,,LARGER THAN LIFE!,5.0,,the structure..is superbly larger than life..beautiful and totally aesthetic and grand!and the view from the sky park is just astounding!
,,A must do,5.0,,Fabulous sky line and the Merlion must not be missed. The Marina Bay Sky park is something else. Look out for the Palm Trees on the roof!
,,Champagne and chocolate!,5.0,,"I've not had the opportunity to spend much time in this attraction. However, I have been right to the top (in the boat) where there is a chocolate and champagne buffet! Pretty expensive and had to book in advance - but I've got to say, worth it!"
,,awe inspiring,5.0,,"Just go for a look if nothing else. The shops are amazing, chech out the F1 car in the Ferrari shop, the bargains in the Harley shop and the great food in the food court."
,,Iconic,5.0,,"Went at the Marina bay walk at 5 am and I must say it was a perfect place to watch the sunrise. A lot of joggers and photo enthusiasts were already there before us.

Its a nice view and would strongly suggest to take a stop, stand and look at this magnificent edifice of Singapore."
,,need a full day in this area,5.0,,"lovely day here, so much to see and do, take the lift up to the top of the twin towers, extraodinary, how the designers come up with fresh ideas all the time is amazing"
,,Architectural Wonder,5.0,,"We could see this building from our hotel and wanted to visit. Make sure you take a cab. The building itself is amazing. It is a hotel as well and very busy. The rooftop restaurant is no longer available to the public, only guests and this was disappointing, loved the shopping area, very ritzy ."
,,Expensive Shopping Here,5.0,,Had walkround and lunch which was good. Some really expensive shops here though including a Harley Davidson and Ferrari Shop.
,,Away from the shops,4.0,,A very pleasant place to have a stroll away from the shops and influenced by the cooler air from the sea.
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,Huge place great for conferences as it's vast. Rooms looked good and the mall was vast with an ice rink and a great street fair area for cheap eating which is good as the shops in here are expensive ones!
,,Impressive skyline,4.0,,"Just sit and watch around, marvel at the impressive skyline, shop at the Marina Bay shopping center, watch a light and sound show, have your picture taken by the Merlion and yes, go to the top of Marina Sands to see an outstanding view of the city."
,,Missable,3.0,,Congested and expensive. An amazing piece of ostentatious architecture. A good landmark for visitors to navigate by.
,,Night Spectacle,5.0,,"Second time visiting (last time was 2yrs ago) - Marina Bay is a really fantastic area and one of the most attractive places in Singapore - surroundings of huge buildings and malls . Just walk across the Helixbridge and take the views from the platforms or have spectacular views from the skybar of the fantastic Marina Bay Sands Hotel - Cocktails were not cheap, but we didn't expect them to be..... ;-)"
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,A brilliant experience. Well worth going to the top of the hotel as the views are spectacular. A brilliant shopping area with plenty of restaurants and cafes.
,,Shopperholics delight,5.0,,"Need anything - then its here.
The bay area is a maze of malls and shops for you to explore, stopping off at one of the many food outlets on the way.
The whole thing wanders under the roads above for miles providing safe shopping for al tastes.
Great bargains can be found here, just take plenty of cash.
Above ground you will find the historic Raffles Hotel which is well worth a visit, (note, don't go there wearing shorts, they will not let you in!) The long bar attached to the hotel is worth a visit and is steeped in romantic history.
The parks and gardens around the area are relaxing, ideal for a 'time out' session and a walk along the water front is well advised. Across the water via the new bridge is the Sands hotel and casino which is open to the public, there are Gondolas inside for you to take a ride on the Indore river and these are surrounded by designer shops.
All in all a great place to spend a day or too, whether it be shopping or sightseeing.
Unless you are dead against shopping, ther is nothing to dislike here"
,,Lovely!,4.0,,Fantastic area and view around the water. Perfect for an evening stroll. a must go place while visiting Singapore
,,Real nice,5.0,,"It's awesome and a must see for Singapore, shops and food is great here and surprisingly not bad priced."
,,great shopping,4.0,,"Everything............................shopping, casino, food court and the layout. train trip tomarina bay was quick and easy. Love the building, it's amazing. Took a few hours to see it all. went up on the observation deck, saw a beautiful view of singapore"
,,Just soak in the night atmosphere,5.0,,"Much like Sydney and Melbourne Quays, but on a grander scale and just jaw dropping backdrops of skyscrapers and historical buildings,"
,,Overated But Nice (Marina Bay Sands),4.0,,"It costs about $20 pp to go to the Sky Park 57 floors, great view, swimming pools, restaurants. Visitors are limited to one restaurant and you can't swim if you don't live in the resort. So, basically, all you can do is take pictures, eat and drink. They offer guided tours 10, 2, 9pm and a Rise Lunch package for about $60 dollars that features, sky park, buffet lunch and a pass to Art Science museum. This is a better deal."
,,Picturesque in the Heart of Town,5.0,,"We were very fortunate to stay at The Sails which overlooks Marina Bay. Trecking around on foot to see everything including the Marina Bay Sands building (utterly spectacular), the shopping centre below, the incredible art gallery, the flyer ferris wheel, stainless helical walk bridge, and restaurants, not forgetting of course the ferry trip and adjacent gardens.

It's a beautiful place during the day and marvellous at night. The Marina Bay Sands laser show is a must see.

Not to be missed."
,,Good way to spend and afternoon/evening!,5.0,,"The Marina Bay area of Singapore is fantastic. There is a lot to do and see in the precinct so make sure you dedicate at least a few hours for it. Bear in mind however it is quite 'touristy' with many outlets and stores reflecting this in it's price.

The laser light show down by the water in front of the Shoppes are NOT to be missed! It's free and lasts around 20 minutes. Be sure to arrive early (at least 30 minutes before the show commences) otherwise you could well be standing!

Walk through the shopping mall, have a flutter in the casino, take the lift up to the skypark, Singapore Flyer, Gardens By The Bay, light show by the water - it's all here! Walk across the Helix bridge and around the other side of the bay towards the Merlion statue! This walk will give you superb photo opportunities of the Marina Bay Resort and skyline! Grab a wafer ice cream while your at it! (sensational, for only a couple of $$).

Make sure you take your passport with you if you plan to visit the Casino. They will also not allow bulky bags, and containing food and drink you need to leave this at Concierge!

We really enjoyed our visit to the Marina Bay area. Easily accesible via MRT (alight at Bayside!)"
,,Singapore at its most modern,5.0,,"Great area around the water with lots of new buildings but also some beautifully preserved old ones too. Fantastic view of the new hotel with its ""ocean-going liner"" crossing its three towers."
,,Drinks and New Year Fireworks,4.0,,"We saw the fireworks here and wandered the huge megamall during the day. Topped it off with some coctails at Kudeta, a bar at the top of the 'ship' in the Maria Bay Sands Hotel. Impressive stuff."
,,"Sunday Morning, the road less travelled",4.0,,"This morning I did a circuit of Marina Bay and left the crowds behind. If you want something different here is an idea:
Start at the NUTC building (there's am exit from Raffles Place MRT very close) at the junction of Raffles Quay and Marina Blvd, stroll down Marina Blvd and head to the actual Bay which arrives in view 50 meters on your left and follow the edge of the bay on the Marina Blvd (there's a ""boardwalk"" all around the Bay ) to the diagonally opposite corner, at the Northern End of Marina Bay Sands. This is where most people turn back ... Keep going under the bridge .. and just keep walking ...
You soon reach the Gardens by the Bay - take a detour through these (but better saved for the way back) and keep walking to the Barrage. This is where Singapore Government have erected a massive flood barrier to keep the sea water out and the fresh water in... the idea is to create a massive reservoir where once the Singapore River flowed into the sea. Wonder at all of the ships moored at anchor (seems half of the world's shipping is parked in the Singapore Straits), and then turn around and stroll back.
Keep your eyes open for the cafe and Hawker stalls on your left .. these have been here for a very long time - they just built everything else around them. Stop for a snack and a drink (you deserve it) and then stroll through the Garden by The Bay, heading towards the Marina Bay Sands … back to the MRT at Bayfront or Marina Bay. Allow two hours and best done early morning when it is cool (I started at 0800). Happy walking."
,,wow what a view,4.0,,"The trip to the top of this new icon was fast and the wait was minimal. Not a lot to do when you are up there, but the view is not to be missed. I would recommend going to the bar for a drink instead of paying for tour. You get to go to the same place and get a drink for about the same $$$$"
,,Boring!!,3.0,,"Bad copy of Hong Kong and wants to resemble Miami as well. Singapore is a boring place with nothing authentic and quite expensive for what it is. I know you will want to go anywhere but be advise that marina bay hotel and roof top is a tourist trap, huge one! food quality is not good and a glass of wine cost you almost 25 US dollars ! And the staff will service you as if they are doing you a favor at the bar overlooking the bay. Avoid but if you still go, you've been advised. A piece of advise, if you plan to go to the casino take your passport with you, otherwise you won't get in"
,,"touristy, but still worth a visit!",4.0,,"In the two times that I have been to Singapore, I've been to Marina Bay both times. It's obviously a new, shining development area in Singapore, and it's worth a visit. There's a lot to do in Marina Bay besides just the tourists staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There's Gardens by the Bay, the various amphitheaters, the jogging track in that area, as well as the huge mall and food court located next to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. At the end of the day, the three-tower hotel is a fixture in the Singapore landscape, so you might as well see what it's all about. But at the same time, there's a bunch of other activities in the area as well."
,,Lovely Place to Visit - 1st Class,5.0,,"This place is first class. Everything is so well set out and a gorgeous shopping centre under Marina Bay Sands. Taxis are everywhere - infact 70,000 taxis in Singapore. Taxis are caught outside any of the hotels where you will find a taxi que. Taxis are relatively cheap and save a lot of time going from one attraction to another."
,,I love marina bay,5.0,,"one of my favourite places, when I just want to chill out I will take a long walk from esplanade all the way around past Marina bay sands its a fantastic way to see the city from different view points and along the way u can stop for food"
,,walking on the city roof!,4.0,,"3 high & modern towers invite you to watching the Singapore modern city from 65th floor of this amazing building. there are 3 unforgettable experience in this place which you could not find any places like that. The highest swimming pool in the world, The romantic open air restaurant and the special Bar & Dance club at the highest floor of 3th tower of Marina Bay. don't forget to go to this building before sunset and stay until late evening and enjoy the atmosphere, foods, wines and bar. if you want to have a dinner at this restaurant, you need to book before."
,,cool place to hang,5.0,,"One Fullerton is the place where you can enjoy anytime you go. The view of Merlion, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore Sky scrapers, and the must one is boat cruise. The best way to see singapore is by Boat cruise"
,,Love it,5.0,,"If you are travelling to Singapore you have to visit marina bay!! You can spend all day there looking at all the wonderful shops and the gardens and of course the merlion. It is very easy to get to by taxi, MRT or bus. This is a must do!!"
,,Awesome!!!!,5.0,,"a must see for any traveler going through Singapore, even if its just for the experience!!! the roof top park is absolutely amazing and if you have the time ....have a swim in the pool!!!!"
,,Impressive,4.0,,This building is really impressive and wherever you are in Singapore you can see the building (I exaggerate a little) If you travel to Singapore you can't miss it
,,Excellent View,5.0,,"This place is a must visit for someone who is traveling to Singapore for the first time. Very easy to reach if you are using the MRT. Nearest MRT station is Raffles Place. You can even sit and enjoy a nice glass of wine with your better half looking across at the Marina Bay Sands. You have lot of options to eat and party if you want, around this place."
,,Nice spot to walk around,3.0,,"Great to spend an hour or so walking around. We hopped on a 40 min bum boat cruise from here, very relaxing and good way to geta bit of history of the old colonial days."
,,"SF, Sydney, Vancouver - Meet Singapore's Marina Bay",5.0,,"Marina Bay continues to develop into a world-class waterfront area with much to do/see and experience in this area of Singapore. Ten years ago this was simply an open bay with the Merlion statue sitting at the mouth of the Singapore River, facing the endless sea and a patch of reclaimed land known as Marina South. What a different world the Marina Bay area is today.

The Marina Bay Sands (MBS) Hotel has taken over the Merlion's role as the iconic symbol of the Marina Bay area. This is a great collection of innovative and creatively designed buildings and attractions including the hotel, the excellent Skypark, 'out-of-this-world' infinity pool and the very good Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands make this a great place to visit.

The ArtScience Museum and Helix Bridge are worth experiencing and the recently opened Gardens by the Bay is nothing short of a world class attraction. You just have to love the Supertree Grove. Just outside the Shoppes at MBS, you can watch the Light and Water show, accompanied by laser lights shooting off the roof of the hotel.

Crossing the Helix Bridge, you can walk the Esplanade on the north side of Marina Bay, approaching the Colours by the Bay restaurant and bar area and the Theatres By the Bay ""Durian Building"". Also on this side of Marina Bay you are not far from the giant ferris wheel called Singapore Flyer.

Take the Esplanade Drive footbridge back over to the west side of the bay and you find the Fullerton Heritage, which includes the historic hotel and the One Fullerton, another nice dining, coffee shop and shopping stop at Marina Bay. Last but not least, this is also the location of the famous and iconic image of Singapore - The Merlion Statue.

While the Merlion used to face an open sea, this is certainly not the case anymore. Now the Marina Bay is more or less fully developed with an excellent collection of attractions and experiences for visitors to Singapore. You can spend much time in this area of the city now."
,,great experience!,5.0,,stunningly good for the family! very accessible with public transport and subway! cabs and very good international restaurants are a few steps away
,,Great well laid out part of Singapore. A must see.,5.0,,"I love this area with the Double Helix Bridge, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore Flyer, Durian inspired Arts precinct, Fullarton Hotel and the Merlion fountain. Very nice viewing at night as well."
,,Beautiful and relaxing,5.0,,"Lovely to go see, lots of restaurants. It a great spots for photos and there is a little ice cream stand that was lovely as it was a very hot day. The icecreams and drinks were 0.80 cents Australian each :)"
,,Fantastic environment,5.0,,- take a picture at Marlion park and MBS view - walk around at Marina shoppes - play in casino - order something to the top level of MBS to get the best view of Singapore
,,Nice to Visit,4.0,,Marina Bay is great place to visit. I think there is a bit too much focus on shopping. I do find Singapore a pretty expense place to shop.
,,Good show,3.0,,"Watching the free show about 9.30pm, its good and free of charge. After watch the show, can spare the time to see what look like sky part at the night, that is amazing building,,,,"
,,Great place to wander and shop!,4.0,,"Many options for eating, drinking, shopping. Nice views and a great vibe in the area. Lots of indoor and outdoor spaces to relax."
,,Just another extra big shopping mall really.,4.0,,"If you like to shop and enjoy high end shoes, bags and clothing then I guess this is the place for you although there are shops for those that refuse to spend $3,000 on a handbag. Marina Bay Sands still has that 'new' feel about it and for me it kind of lack any character."
,,Includes all the iconic Singapore images,4.0,,"Nice area with very convenience metro stop. Nice for a stroll along the water. You can walk around the entire bay in a bit over an hour at a medium pace. Of course this area includes some of the most iconic Singapore images including the Merlion, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the ArtScience museum, and the theater. The restaurants around the area, while overpriced, provide a great view of the laser light show at night."
,,Worth experiencing,3.0,,"Am not a gambler, but the casino is certainly luxurious. Went to Pangaea and was underwhelmed by the lack of variety of music (trance all night = headache). My friend's mojito for SGD 29 took forever to make and was all lime juice with no mint. I had an overpriced water. Shops have the usual luxury brands which are de rigueur in Singapore. Have not made it to infinity pool or observation deck yet..."
,,Great Place,5.0,,Breathtaking view at the top. Extraordinary place. But very expensive. Great architecture. Had a great time with my family.
,,Fantastic buildings,5.0,,"The 3 towers are a ver beautiful attraction for every tourist who is visiting Singapore. This buildings are comparible with Burj Arab architecturally speaking , they are an icon for Singapore . You can travel by taxi or MRT to this buildings."
,,Great view and amazing architecture surrounds!,5.0,,This is a must see in Singapore and the view from the rooftop is amazing. The area is still undergoing further development however it is an amazing transformation. would highly recommend every visitor to Singapore visit.
,,"You Just Can't Miss This Part, It's the best Singapore Has to Offer",5.0,,"It's a big site of a wonderful modern architectures that became for most of them very emblematic of the city. i encourage you to visit or try at least one night in the MBS hotel with its famous rooftop pool as well as its sky deck, the 1- Altitude Gallery to have the other side of the view of the bay, the Lion King, and last in my selection but certainly not least: Gardens by the Bay, by night if possible."
,,Theatre visit,5.0,,"What a night we had here! Even though it was above a normal daily budget for a night in Singapore, it was well worth the money. Fabulous food and the show ""Jersey Boys"" was magnificent."
,,Mall of America meets Las Vegas,3.0,,"Perhaps an unfair criticism, not having been to either. Extremely glitzy, but the A/c does provide relief fron the heat and humidity. If you want expensive name-brand shopping in an exotic location, this is the place for you."
,,Very Tasty,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed the food and service with a smile. I would highly recommend this restaurant!! The atmosphere was brilliant and very good value for money!
,,Bewildering Sound & Light Show,5.0,,We watched the show at the waterfront and it was really amazingly artistic and breathtaking. It was a good 30 minutes long and then we had a superb dinner at Mozza inside.
,,Fantastic Views!,5.0,,"Tip: Head up to the roof top bar for free and buy a drink - Don't make the mistake of being charged $20 SPD per person to visit the viewing observation deck - the bar entrance is free -just get a voucher (opposite concierge desk in tower 3) and order a drink on the same deck! Much cheaper and free crisps to nibble whilst overlooking the great view of the pool whilst relaxing on comfy sofas on the same floor (61st)! (Same deck as the observation deck) Duh!
Great shopping mall and a fantastic cheap food hall ($3-5 SPS) - Korean, Malay, American, Italian - it has it all! Go try something new - its cheap and an experience!
Enjoy!"
,,amazing !,5.0,,"Walked here from Clark Quay amazing ! Shopped, ate and went to see cirque du soleil ( la noir ) what a day ! and got the mrt back to the hotel."
,,Beautiful Place for a walk and some pictures,5.0,,Try the local food court if you fancy some nice sea food and other local dishes. Enjoy the views and the shopping.
,,"Depending on how you do it, it's a visual and/or cultural treat.",4.0,,"The Bay can be viewed from many spots (some are free): The Singapore Flyer, the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands, the Helix pedestrian bridge leading from the Promenade MRT stop to the ArtScience museum adjacent to the Marina Bay Mall, and for serious shoppers, the Mall (and Link Mall). Or you can stroll by the waterfront near the Esplanade (an attraction in itself). My favorite views are from the Barrage, the Gardens by the Bay, and the Benjamin Sheares bridge."
,,Excellent,5.0,,The Marina Bay has seen lots of development in recent years and remains one of the most significant harbours in the world. Do not miss it and try to catch the laser show in the evening.
,,City at night,5.0,,"Although you have to pay for entry, the views over the city at night were breathtaking. We saw the light show from the botanical gardens as well, worth a visit"
,,Beautiful scenery,5.0,,"Beautiful scenery! There was some kind of a classical concert with a huge lightshow in the middle of the week, just amazing! One of the most beautiful things ever."
,,"If you like Las Vegas, you will love Marina Bay Sands",4.0,,"If you've heard the phrase ""super size me"", then you will truly understand what this hotel complex is all about. From the high end shopping ( Chanel, Vuitton, etc) in the basement level, to the infinity pool on the 55 floor, to the viewing deck ($) on the 56 floor, this property is all about bling. It's not for the faint hearted though, so bring your walking shoes and get ready to explore. And if the hotel and casino isn't enough for you, exit the property and head for a boat ride on the singapore river, visit the science museum or take a stroll through the gardens."
,,Beautiful bu day and sparkling by night!,4.0,,"The Marina bay is just lovely and clean, at night time the lights from surrounding hotels and restaurants just sparkle of the water!"
,,pricey,3.0,,lovely to see but way overpriced. the marina bay hotel is very classy as you would expect for the cost of a night but didn't do it for me too cold and sterile. going up to the very top to see the views and pool what a waste of time and money costs $20 pp so we decided my husband would go up as he was interested in the building being an architect and my daughter and my self stayed down the bottom to wait. he was back in no time and wasn't allowed to go near the pool and couldn't get any good shots unless he leant over the railing....my daughter and i tried to find somewhere to sit but seats don't exist so had to buyt a very expensive flat white just so could sit. nice to see but take lots of cash.
,,"Excellent place to visit, very top end shopping",5.0,,Great shopping mall. Shops are really expensive except for food and eating experience. Definitely worth a visit. Has an ice skating rink and gondolier type experience.
,,Empty,1.0,,"Dead as a dodo; don't bother. Empty shops, brands you may never have herd of and noisy. Not worth the effort to get to."
,,"beautiful hotel, shopping center and casino",5.0,,"The Marina Bay is really a destination in and of itself. The three hotel towers are magnificant modern marvels. There is an MRT station at the basement of one tower and enough shopping to occupy days. The casino is gigantic, but note that foreigners must present a passport at entrance and exit. Really, quite an experience. BTW, you can catch the Singapore River cruise boats from the dock outside the Marina Bay Sands hotel"
,,MARINE BAY,4.0,,"There are more than one icon in the Marine Bay.The Helix Bridge is designed by one of the top Bridge Designers in Europe, and people interested in Bridges wlll hail it as a ""WONDER"". Some of European friends came to Singapore, just to admire it! The Sand Hotel needs no further words.
The view from top is wonderful, especially near evening, just when the sun is setting. Else visit it just at dusk, when the city lights are on, and the sky is not too dark. Try this, and you will never forget!!! many more ""WONDERS"". DO explore and enjoy Singapore!"
,,Marina bat hotel,5.0,,"The splendour of the hotel atrium, bars, public areas, trip up to platform area. Disappointing to be told no use of photographic tripods"
,,Lovely to walk around,4.0,,"Take in the sights of the skyscrapers, shopping centres and its close to the f1 track. Lots to see and take pictures of!"
,,Fantabulous!,5.0,,We were there for new years... and it was fantastic! Only I wasnt a fan of the fireworks I have seen a lot better! The hype was a little too much and it was impossible to get out of there once they were over!
,,Catch it at the right time!,4.0,,"MBS is a great complex with lots of shops. We had seen it from the city from a far which was great but when you're there it's equally impressive. We went up to Ku Da Te bar. If you say you're going for a drink in the bar you won't need to pay. We went up took some pics got to see the biggest infinity pool in the world then left. You will need to be dressed appropriately to go up. Mainly guys.. No shorts, flip flops, sleeveless shorts.

Catch the water and light show at 8pm or 9.30 and see the Hotel come to life with lights. Being a touristy place it's expensive but we ate at Pita Pan which was reasonable and very tasty!

The views from the top of the MBS sands are great!"
,,skyscrapers!,5.0,,"Marina bay sands is an amazing place filled with super high skyscrapers and stores and restaurants! They have almost everything there! If you are going to visit Singapore, you must visit this place."
,,One of my favorite spots in Singapore,5.0,,"You know you want to get a little bit closer to that set of buildings with the boat on top. So just do it, already. There's plenty to do.

If you like nature, hoof over to Gardens by the Bay. If you like gambling, the Marina Bay Sands has tables and slots. Want art? Like science? The ArtScience museum mashes disciplines like it does its name.

And there's a mall there, of course, because what block in Singapore doesn't have one of those?

The Marina Bay area is a feast for the eyes, from water, to skyscrapers, to a bridge that looks like it's part of a dynamic futurescape."
,,You've read the reviews,4.0,,$S20 is a lot if you are a budget backpacker. But as this is such an iconic landmark decided to have a look. Go up before sunset and then watch the city light up. The views are good. The little kiosk is very expensive so if you plan to spend a while take your own refreshments. There is a free water and light show in front that starts at about 8pm.
,,Faaaabulouse at night!,5.0,,"During the day the views around the bay are fantastic, but at night it is just stunning. Walk across the Helix bridge and take in the views from the viewing platforms that are built out from the bridge at various points, so you can get some great camera shots looking back at the city."
,,boring,3.0,,"all the buzz around those two buldings connected with a boat like roof made me travel there to see it, but it is quite boring and empty place. they charge entry fee just to get on the lift to the roof floor, which i refused to pay cause it migth be even more boring to see this boring city state from the top!!!"
,,Greatest architecture ur eyes can see,5.0,,I simply loved singapore specially this marina bay sands attraction..it stands so tall that u cn view it from most places...the observtion deck is open for public...just beside it u could go to gardens by the bay not far from there is the singapore flyer. and the art science museum...u dont need transport to travel these places its in walkng distance..whole family cn enjoy this beautiful place
,,View from a boat in the bay then go up and look down,4.0,,Supersized attraction and worth going up the 57 floors to the viewing deck although you will need a head for heights.
,,Marina Bay,3.0,,We just saw this place from a far. But it really looks beautiful and amazing. You'll also enjoy this.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Huge buildings and. Malls. I like the way that mall is designed. Easy commute using bayfront mrt. There are good restaurants that u can dine in.
,,marina bay sands light show.,5.0,,"the deck right outside the marina bay sands mall, overlooking the river and singapore skyline, a great man made wonder..it shows how advance they are...never miss the light show at night. magical. can move you to tears hahaha."
,,nice!,5.0,,"a lot of fancy shops! nice to walk around and easy to find halal food, there's a small halal food court called 'nanyang 1834' if i'm not mistaken."
,,Recommended by night,5.0,,"We visited Marina Bay area in september 2012 when the Singapore Grand Prix was taking place. Therefore there was a spectacular audiovisual-show at the Merlion aswell. Fireworks, glitter and glamour while the spotlights from Marina Bay Sands were blinding us. This was the 'Lion City' at her best. The day after we did a cruise on the river and were able to photograph the same show at the Merlion from the water.
The architectural masterpieces are a must for every visitor of Singapore!"
,,Can spend Hours here,4.0,,The whole area has developed in the last three to four areas and its expanding at a frentic pace still. You could spend hours here and still not be finished.
,,What a beautiful amazing sight,5.0,,"We approached Marina Bay from the ocean as we were on a cruise and the most impressive sight that first caught our eye were the three tall buildings joined together at the top - which we later learned was the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. This consists of three towers which house a convension and exhibition centre, many shops, bars and restaurants, gardens (walkways) that crossed over the roads leading in various directions, but in particular to the main four country gardens which are beautiful and have their own restauraunts.

Construction work has almost been completed - the hotel opened only two years ago and has a huge wow factor. Around Marina Bay we hopped onto a river boat that took us along the bay for 30 minutes explaining how the new cosmopolitan style architecture blends wonderfully with the much older buildings. There are many glass buildings, mainly the financial district office blocks which look spectactular - all being different shapes, even the glass used being different colours (some blocks in blue, others in grey, etc).

There are colourful blocks of seating for spectations, next to a floating grass ""pitch"" where games take place. Marina Bay offers stops for a ""hop on hop off"" bus to take you around other parts of Singapore and a ticket will also include your ride on the river.

This is certainly a place that I would revisit in the future."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Fantastic area, so much to see and do, the shopping mall is huge, there are also lots of places to eat, sit and watch the world go by. Will have to return as we saw just a fraction of the place"
,,NICE WALK AND DAY OUT,5.0,,REALLY COOL surroundings of HIGH buildings;) nice Walk around;) Bujo xxx We really like it SINGAPORE EYE;)
,,Lovely place to visit,4.0,,A stroll through this great water front area is a must. It is a shame that the merlion was not visible due to a refurbishment. Great spot for a bite to eat or drink.
,,Amazing wiew and skyline,5.0,,"Continuously evolving skyline, not to be missed. Walk around the bay to enjoy the views from Marina Bay sands and from the Fullerton"
,,Fascinating architecture,5.0,,"If you are up for some interesting architecture combine a walk through CBD with Marina Bay. If it's getting too hot you can easily dive into the underground network of Marina Link, connecting the MRT station with the buildings along Marina Bay."
,,Go there for the view,5.0,,"Going up to the jewel of Singapore is not free. U have to pay just for the view. Well, you pay for Eifel Tower in Paris... Consider that's the Eifel tower in Singapore but with a smaller queue to go up and a faster lift."
,,Very nice area,4.0,,"Our first trip to Singapore and we debated between Marina Bay and Orchard Road. As we were there for a cruise we stayed two days in Marina Bay and one on Orchard Road. For me Marina bay was the better location. Both are nice. If you are going to just shop or for the Botanic Gardens specifically then Orchard road but to see a bit of everything I suggest Marina Bay.

The local hotels are easy walks to the waterfront, Flyer, Esplanade, Raffles, and many nice dining options. Hop on hop off buses make all of Singapore easy."
,,"""Beautiful""",5.0,,"The whole place at night so beautiful colors....Don't miss to go this place once You're in Sg! been there with sisters and my brother...still keep coming back for a very excellent view, fresh air too facing the Merelion....We Love SG!"
,,Unique Architecture & Casino,5.0,,"New landmark of Singapore with access to casino and beautiful building of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (shaped like a yacht hold up by two tall buildings). Great view of Marina Bay, especially during the night. No issue with taxis as they are around the clock."
,,Quick stop,4.0,,Easy to get to Marina Bay via MTR. Not a big fan of shopping malls however the Marina Bay Mall is the main link to the Skypark and the Gardens by the bay.
,,AWESOME!,5.0,,"After coming here on vacation, this is a must see place in Singapore. There are tons of things to do here. You can shop, gamble, take a walk, see a light show (although it was disappointing), check out some great views, just endless things to do. It is definitely easily accessible as well. The best thing about Marina Bay is the sky tower. I think going up there, seeing the infinity pool and just having a drink for a little while was super fun to do. Overall, had a great time and would definitely recommend visiting here."
,,Panoramic view,4.0,,Marina bay is one of most attractive places in Singapore. Singapore visit is only completed if you have been there in the marina bay. Nice view in the morning and in the evening. The water stream adds color to the whole view.
,,Nice view worth to go,4.0,,"I suggest to go here, very nice place to spend time in evening and romantic for couples and for family and kids evening light show is very good. worth to go there :) I liked it we can get relax there peaceful."
,,Must go place in Singapore,5.0,,This is absolute a must place to go in Singapore. Even a short visit will do it but that is a must. The view is very beautiful and the Merlion is “the” symbol of Singapore. You can’t have been to Singapore and missed it.
,,Every relaxing walk through way.,5.0,,Beautiful scene. And very clean environment.Also including very much attraction. You can take a lot of wonderful pics.
,,Can spend hours here,5.0,,"You can enjoy this area for free or spend a fortune. You can just amble and take in the sights of which there are plenty- this is really a showcase of how amazing Singapore is. We walked from the Merlion around the bay to the gardens behind the Marina Bay hotel and shopping centre. At night there was a free water display in front of the shopping centre. There are solar operated fans on one part of the walkway - some art installations, people jogging and walking. Great architecture to admire all around you. You can walk around the deck in front of the Fullerton restaurants nowhere is inaccessible to the public."
,,The place to avoid,1.0,,"This is probably my least favourite place in Singapore. Its a horrible place. It's full of classy shops with no people buying anything. Bus loads of tourists walk through here stopping taking photos in the hotel and around the arcade.

It's so ridiculously full of people. By the bus load literally.

There is no reason to go here unless you specifically want to go to the casino.

If you want a restaurant in the hotel forget it, you'll wait in line for a long time and the level of service for a place like this is extremely poor and inexperienced.

Not my favourite place. May it a point to give it a miss while you are here."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Well, I guess it is well known and everybody should see it in their lifetime. Its very shocking place where you gonna realize you have not seen everything yet if there are such a places."
,,"Big, Busy and Expensive",5.0,,This place is very busy and a sight to see -- but would recommendstaying at more intimate hotel close by. Go to Skywalk (costs $20/pp) to see view and take pictures
,,Spectacular unique surroundings day and night !,5.0,,"Whatever you do when visiting Singapore, try to stay at a Hotel in the Marina Bay area. The views and surrounding buildings are truly spectacular both day and night. Visit the huge Ferris Wheel and bring your camera to get some amazing photos - and especially at night."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"Worth having a look at, but we went at night hoping to find somewhere quiet to check out the view and have a drink. All we found was a very noisy, very expensive bar and some less than helpful staff."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"great design very famous attraction in Singapore. I love it. must to visit. also suggest to have a look from top as you feel the sky experience. try river cruse boats. not very expensive 18 Singapore dollar for 40 min drive.
have fun casino and other clubs if you want but little bit expensive."
,,Love this place.,5.0,,"Just go and enjoy. Walk the perimeter from The Sands, past the floating soccer pitch to the Merlion. At 8 pm The Sands has a laser light show and water show. It's great from either side of Marina Bay. If you have never seen it, sit on The Sands side first."
,,Do visit in evening and see the light and laser Show,5.0,,"See all the attractions around Marina bay area, Mall, the financial centre, the Marina Bay sands and then in evening at 8 pm see the Laser and Light show there is another 2 shows also after that. Even Merlion is also near by."
,,Could be anywhere,3.0,,"A marina is a marina , this is just like any other , apart from the extortionate prices of everything , NOTHING special to say about it at all"
,,So different from anything else,5.0,,"This area definitely deserves exploring- and is a great way to escape the heat in the middle of the day.
Dominated by the Marina Bay Sands hotel everything around it feels shiny and new. The shopping areas are huge and intriguing- not affordable for everyone but still great to look around.
We were most excited by the fantastic food court we discovered in the basement floor! Much cheaper than the hawker markets, great selection and clean.
The outside areas are also stunning- from ponds full of lillies, to a walk way to the Botanic gardens and a spectacular light and water show at night, do check this area out."
,,Great for a Morning Walk,4.0,,Escape the built up environs and go for a morning jog or walk at Marina Bay. Catch the floating soccer pitch or stop for a coffee. Refreshing and clear.
,,Impressive area,4.0,,"Very nice area to wander around, take in an exhibition and see the Lion of Singapore. The shopaholics are also catered for as always in Singapore."
,,Loved the ambition and scope of this development,5.0,,"I've been lucky enough to visit Singapore annually for the last five years and have been able to watch the construction of Marina Sands and also the neighbouring botanical gardens . A visit is highly recommended , so much to see. The shops there are mostly top end designer outlets , beyond our budget in most cases. Don't let that put anyone off! It's good fun to window shop there and there are many very good restaurants some of which are very reasonable. Go up to the roof to look back across the bay to the older parts of Singapore , and in the other direction the linking bridge across to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the gardens beyond."
,,very interesting place in nighttime or daytime,5.0,,"First i visited this place at night time by boat, Wonderfull panorama with tollest buildings arounds and main attraction is performance of night show with lights, water fountain and music. Second my visit there day after at daytime and bring new suprise, because I saw all details which is in nighttime invisible. I think the one of the niecest place metropolitan´s architecture. I recommended the same procedure to all visitors of Singapore"
,,Must be here for the light and water show.,5.0,,We went here to eat and our friends planned it so we could see the light show on the bay. It is awesome. They do it twice a night. The first time is at 8 and the second is 9:30. Make sure you get a front seat.
,,lovely place for a walk in the evening,5.0,,"Loved the waterfront, the views of the city, the nice restaurants, the Merlion...Just generally liked the atmosphere! Will go back."
,,Modernity at its best,5.0,,"We found this whole area to be awe-inspiring and attempted to utilise every available viewpoint to enjoy it. If high rise is your thing, it doesn't come much better than this area."
,,Very nive place to eat seafood,4.0,,"This is a great place with a lot of animation, great seafood, but a bit expensive. Lots of bars around the river, a nice place to walk around enjoying the cool wind of the evening."
,,Has one of the best cityscapes in the world!,5.0,,A must captured spot for cityscape if you are on holiday in Singapore. Has an awesome view of the CBD.
,,marina bay,5.0,,"For the incredible views of Singapore, disappointing that the first 50 ticket holders on each session are permitted to view the infinity pool"
,,Excellent structure and atmosphere,5.0,,"We were there during Chinese New Year and the place was packed. You can go to the Singapore Eye, the Marina Bay Hotel and Casino by walking through the double helix bridge. You can see Fullerton Hotel at the distance. What a marvellous new development with excellent modern structure."
,,Architecturally Impressive,4.0,,"One does not need to shop or gamble to relish Moshe Safdie's architectural wonder...an impressive contribution to the city's ever changing skyline. One does not need to stay at the hotel to appreciate the edifice.
A visit to the bar on the top floor provides the best view of the city and you can see the swimming pool that has people talking !"
,,Must-see lightshow,5.0,,"Spent an afternoon wandering around all the high-end shops whilst the in-laws gambled at the huge casino, stopped for a bite to eat then sat out overlooking the bay & the skyscraper-packed horizon until the light show came on, which was incredible and free. Afterwards we wandered up for a look at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, which is the oddest hotel I've ever seen!"
,,Marina,5.0,,"Lovely area plenty of food to chose from. River cruise a great way to see things. Can hop of and on as you chose with on ticket, which is in alot of cases around Singapore."
,,shopping,4.0,,Top rate for shopping area and see how the other half lives in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Terrific views from the observation deck at the top but you have to pay to get up there.
,,Relaxation Bay,4.0,,"You'll love the view of the CBD at evening to night.

Walking distance to the Merlion, the Esplanade (about 15 mins - 30mins), as you probably will stop and take some photos or take some breath of the view, and at MBS itself there is a free water-show daily, first show at 8pm, and the next is at 9.30pm, so be sure not to be late!

Ku De Ta bar is great, best time to visit is about 5pm onwards, and wait for the sunset. The price for the drinks is about the same as anywhere else around Singapore, maybe some cost a bit more but the view is worth it all."
,,Wonderful,4.0,,Wonderful sights with marina sands hotel. Lovely walk all the way to the botanical gardens. Very good view of the Singapore skyline.
,,NIce walk around the Bay,4.0,,"It is nice to see the floating football field, near where also the F1 races begin. Have a walk trough gigantic shopping mall, or have a lunch in one of their food courts. Go uo the Marina Bay Hotel for the view, it is worth it and it is for free."
,,Towers in the Sky,5.0,,"Such modern style and sights, great views. Architecture is all out of this world. Boats around Harbour good choice to get views of river area too"
,,Great for taking pictures.,5.0,,"Great architecture, great area of the city. You will take a lot of pictures of the Marina Bay sands hôtel. Close to the cruise ship terminal, easy access by a few subway stations, shopping, dining. A must to visit when in Singapore. Light show around 9:30 PM"
,,Lovely at night,4.0,,"The Marina Bay area is lively and pretty at night. The lights reflecting in the bay are so iconic of Singapore, and there is much to see and do. Good places to eat and regular live music in the bay, it is definitely a great place to meander at night."
,,Catch the show,5.0,,If you go down to Marina Bay to see Merlion - go early evening - and eat down here. We went to a cafe that has lounges - unfortunately - can't remember the name. It is diretly in line with Marina Bay Sands. The staff were so friendly. There were no seats in non smoking so we went into smoking and they came and got us when a couch and table was available. They even told us two for one drinks about to run out and got us an ice bucket for next drinks. The food was great - and then at 8p.m. free laser light show across the Bay from Marina Bay Sands - which we had prime seats for.
,,very long waiting time to go to skyboat,4.0,,the line snaked arount the lobby and into the street and around the corner for a ticket to go to the skyboat. we decided not to bother. The area is very well organised and the gardens are right next to it
,,Stunning at night,4.0,,Suggest you to start walking in the early evening from Clark Quay and arrive here after sundown. Really relaxing atmosphere and very Singaporean!
,,A marvellous sight,4.0,,"You can see this quite incredible hotel from most places in central Singapore city. In fact, seeing it from a distance is probably better than being close up. We did not stay here, so my review is limited to the tour of the observation deck (front of the boat up top) for access to this there is a fee of 20 sing dollars each when we went there. 56 floors, with elevators that make your ears pop. Great views, and they put on a very good laser/light show - but don't bother trying to see this show from the top, the angles are wrong for any good viewing. Once on top and having seen the view you can go for a very expensive drink in the bar up there - or even take a very expensive meal. The menu is exquisite."
,,Tourist & Convention Hub/Circus,3.0,,"Like
- Great location with lots of choices for entertainment, shopping and dining
- One of its kind rooftop pool and multiple clubs
Dislike
- No focus on the individual, catering to the Group
- Buffet meals are like a circus, with a queue for everything"
,,Amazing place for a nice walk,4.0,,"The stores in the mall were well outside my budget, but it was still nice to go for a walk and see all they have. Check out the Arts+Science museum right there and the Louis Vuitton store, which is like their own island in the Bay."
,,Can take a boat around the harbour,4.0,,Nice when the rain has cooled the air at night . lots of bright lights from all the plush sky-scrapers around and across the harbour
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"See the Bay at night as well, it is a different City. Do the circular walk and go onto the Marina Shoppes, and see the Canal and boats on the ground floor, access here to the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Absolutely Gorgeous,4.0,,"The structures are truly amazing. I cannot describe
them perfectly here because you must see and be there when in
Singapore. You must see this place during daytime and come back at night time. They have lots of establishments and restaurants to satisfy your senses.

They even have a Casino staffed with people from many Asian
countries nearby Singapore."
,,"Awesome, But Get Directions First",5.0,,"Combination amusement park, ocean walk, restaurant row, disco, mall immersion, light show. You can do it all and spend a lot of money or you can do part of it and spend nothing. It is a very popular evening getaway for Singaporeans and tourists alike, and always busy, hence the very complicated routes and traffic controls that require advanced planning to thread through, no matter whether yoy arrive by car, subway, bus or taxi. My advice -- bring a picnic dinner, a blanket and children, you'll have a great time ."
,,Same-oh,3.0,,It looks like two towers with a cruise ship atop. It's no different than Las Vegas. The service is fair. We did enjoy dinner at db Bistro Moderne which was a diamond in the rough.
,,love the air and view spot!,5.0,,fresh air combine with sound of little wave of lake. view spot of high building tower. hmmm... reflecting a developed country!
,,icon of Singapore,4.0,,"Need to visit once at least of your life. An icon of Singapore, just take few pictures to show families, friends...etc. that you have been Singapore, otherwise, peoples will confuse whether it is K.L. or Singapore per the pictures of chicken rice, curry laksa and satay!"
,,Nice place,5.0,,"Marina bay is a nice place for you to hang around. It has many restaurant and cafe, and the with its amazing charm, im sure it would please any tourist to Singapore"
,,SO MUCH TO SEE,5.0,,"We spent at least 3 hours wandering around the bay,went on a boat trip the sights are amazing make sure your camera batteries are full you will take so many photos could have spent longer if we wanted,places to have drinks or snacks or meals.We also went to Clarkes Quay amazing skyline."
,,great view at night,5.0,,"We had amazing time once spending an hour here. Could get an opened and fresh atmosphere. Otherwise, Singapore skyline was one of the most skyline i loved the most"
,,Smooth Ride,5.0,,We went on a Cruise on the Marina Bay and down the Singapore River. It only cost $18 for a round trip - it had on board commentary in English which was very informative. During the the trip we even got off at Clarks Quay for lunch - which I think is the best place to eat in Singapore for selection.
,,Take a ride to the top!!!,5.0,,"Singapore is a beautiful, clean and vibrant Country and Singapore City is amazing!. On the list of things you must see and do is this.
At Marina Bay, there is a large hotel, I think it is called Marina Bay..not sure who owns it? You will notice this hotel right away from a distance as the top of the building is shaped likes a boat!!.

The boat is actually a large area divided into 2 sections. One section is reserved for the hotel guest, there is a swimming pool, lounge area, with bar service. The other side of the boat is an outdoor observation deck for the general public. It is work the journey in the elevator to the 60th floor!!. The view is fantastic, so be sure to pick a clear day if you decide to do this.

You will have plenty of time to take pictures and videos, they are employees of the Marina Bay Observation Deck who will offer to take your picture and then you can buy your picture and it is framed, this is an offer and you are never obliged to do this, a polite "" no thanks"" and you are never bothered again. I recommend this attraction as it is worth the small fee to take the elevator to the top. Enjoy!."
,,Marina Bay at night,5.0,,This is something very wonderful due to magnificant display of lights and laser show. Lion with spitting water is a good display at night time
,,Amazing place to be,5.0,,"This is an amazing place to visit. Its at the centre of the Marina Bay. Walking distance from the main shopping mall, several restaurants, the Arts & Science Museum, The Marina Sands hotel, the Gardens by The Bay. And offers many attractions and amazing views of the Bay. Visit at night and watch the water/light show on the bay!"
,,Marina Bay area,4.0,,"Reclaimed harbour area, designed for the locals to use and enjoy in their time off. Many eateries, and places to sit and contemplate."
,,Great view of the Singapore Skyline.,4.0,,"The only good thing about Marina Bay Sands (Casino.Resort) is that it contributes a nice building to the Singapore skyline. Anyway, come and have a look at the stunning result of 50 years of hard work, democracy/meritocracy SG style, and more than a bit of good fortune."
,,Singapore's New Icon,5.0,,"The Marina Bay is dominated by Singapore's new icon, the Marina Bay Sands with its unique, modern design not seen anywhere in the world. It's a great place to take a walk,admire the view & do people watching.The Singapore Flyer,the Merlion Park, the Gardens by the Bay & the Esplanade are all in this area and many locals & tourists congregate here. Hence, many restaurants & shops abound here,too. For high-end shopping, there's the Shoppes in the Marina Bay Sands,a super huge mall..."
,,good place,5.0,,"nice to shop and to walk around, seeing beautiful views along the bay while watching the 3D water fountain at night."
,,Great Fountain Show,5.0,,The area beside the Marina Bay Sands Mall and Hotel had incredible views of the skyline and a super nightly fountain show.
,,Marina bay,4.0,,"Nice location, no point doing sky deck walk and doing flyer, views the exact same. Amazing foyer in hotel, great for people watching !"
,,Place to chill,4.0,,"It was a great place to hang out. That is, if you're only up to killing time or bond with a friend without spending too much. If you do have budget, then you can also start from here. There are a lot of places nearby to eat or stroll."
,,Great.,4.0,,This is probably the most advance structure in South East Asia. I went here with my uncle and we were abe to watch a light and water fountain show whick was AMAZING.
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,"The hotel & gardens are stunning and we defy anyone not to take many photos. There is every shop you could need in the mall, but the weak pound takes away much of the temptation.
The food court on the lowest food provides huge choice and really cheap eating. It is spotlessly clean and always busy - we have eaten there several times and always left happy."
,,So much to see and do,5.0,,So much to see. Plenty of shopping and restaurants. The Casino and Marina Sands Hotel is also accessible and well worth the walk though the shopping malls
,,Absolutely amazing !,5.0,,"Ive never seen anything like this , well , Ive never seen anything as fabulous as Singapore ( although Ive been to Dubai , but that doesnt rate as high). Stopped off here on the HopOn/Off bus, then after here it was so easy to stroll around to Clarke Quay . Shopping mall amazing and it was all decorated with Chinese lanterns when I was there. Outside views just fantastic. Ive lots of pictures with this boat on the top of the building , just go and see it for yourself !! It a must."
,,You have to see it to believe it!,5.0,,"We were astonished at the size of the boat built and balance on these three buildings. The ticket up is a little pricey and you have to sign up for a tour just to buy a drink in the bar at the boat, but the Marina Bay complex is so worth the visit. Several levels of shopping on the bottom floors and a hotel to boot, what a great use of space! It was all decked out for Chinese New Year's so it was quite festive. And the laser show at night was spectacular!"
,,Simply Superb!,5.0,,"The location is awesome, an amazing place to spend some quality time with your beloved facing the sea. The water show which is aired for free is a great one. Also one can not miss the huge casino which is a huge attraction of Marina!"
,,Absolutely amazing!,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Development was one of the highlights of my trip to Singapore. The entire area is really breathtaking although you don't need to be an architect to appreciate the fantastic engineering in the most amazing mega structure I have ever seen. The shopping complex is great although you can't expect to pick up the bargains available ten or fifteen years ago in Singapore. The food hall is fantastic - immaculately clean and a wide variety of food on offer. There's a great ice skating rink in the middle of the shopping centre - great for the kids. All in all, this place is a must if you're visiting Singapore."
,,Top of the bill views,5.0,,"Singapore is not complete without visiting Marina Bay and Marina Bay Sands, nice vieuws to the financial dictrict and even better international shopping at the shoppes at Marina Bay Sands"
,,Must see,5.0,,"Great area to spend a day and top it up with fireworks and light show in the evening. Great shopping area, local food, museum, casinos.... you name it."
,,Heavenly suits,5.0,,Amenities in suits are fantastic. Free TGM Chinese tea is ausome. Free shuttle between the airports and the hotel. I like jogging all aound the Marina bay through the shopping building.
,,Must go place in singapore,4.0,,"Many things to see arouns this joint, from raffles landing, the cavanaugh bridge, fullerton hotel, merlion, esplanage, double helix bridge, marina bay sands shopping mall, singapore flyers... all is must see place in singapore. Love it. Simply love it"
,,good place to go in Singapore,5.0,,at Marina Bay you will find so many things to see and due. it is also the new port for cruise ships. the gardens behind Marina Bay Sands are fantastic
,,What is this ?,3.0,,"I wonder how this here can be rated so high. Yes it is a beautiful area to walk around from the Lion to the Sands building, but that must also be all. Inside there is nothing special, an dI can more interesting thing to visit"
,,Great in the day or night,4.0,,"Fantastic place for pictures...architecture of the marina bay sands (including light show in the evening), boats in the harbour, dramatic back drop of the cities skyscrapers, fantastic bars and restaurants.

We had fantastic seats over looking marina bay during the formula1 grand prix, being top off with a fireworks displayed on Sunday evening

If you buy a big bus tour ticket, make sure you pay the extra for a boat ride around the harbour..great to see the marina from a different perspective"
,,"Without it, Singapore visit is incomplete now.",5.0,,"Just go there, I do not see any reason why you wouldn't. Tip: be patient with the metro stations - study the scheme before - they are a bit complicated as long as it comes to get to Marina Bay - red line are orange line are tricky."
,,An amazing use of reclaimed land,5.0,,"As well as a huge shopping mal with a fantastic selection of shops, there is a boating canal, hotel and just a little further on, within easy walking distance is the Marina Bay garden complex. This latter is an absolute must, particularly the 'Rain Forest' section. Singapore never does things by half measure and Marina Bay is a prime example of a job outstandingly well done."
,,free laser show hourly,5.0,,"great food,yum cha,shopping,boats,water show,laser show,high end luxury goods, near gardens by the bay."
,,GOOD VALUE BOAT TRIP,5.0,,"Take a boat trip, it is the only way to see all the sites without extensive walking. You can also get on and off at various attractions/shops."
,,Simply Beautiful,4.0,,"Make sure u reach this place from the Mall side before 9:30 . They run a musical light show at this time ( not sure if they have multiple shows ) . Great Mall , lots of option to spend money ;)"
,,Nice place and good light show!,4.0,,"Go for a walk around 5 p.m. from raffels station to Merlion. Walk around the bay through Marina Sand (de building with the ship on top) take a look in the shopping mall, get a diner in the food court en return back on the front of the hotel around 7 p.m. Sit and wait till it gets darks, that's a really nice experience. There is a nice light show on 8 p.m. and 10 p.m.

If you have more time you can go for a dinner to Lau Pa Sat where you can eat everything what you want!"
,,Marina Bay is excellent place,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a lovely part of Singapore very pretty and new. Shops are resturants are not cheap but the scenery is lovely.
Casino is handy to have there but a pain as you have to have to show passport going in and out of the Casino. We had to leave our back pack in the storage room and when we returned they gave us someone else's bag so not so good with the security on you bags left."
,,An amazing FREE show,5.0,,"Marina Bay has a lot to offer the visitor. Stroll around the bay in the evening wax made all the more special by the amazing sound and light display in the evening.

I understand the display takes place every evening at dusk and it should not be missed.

,,Boring Place,1.0,,The Marina Bay is hyped to be the competitive Orchard Road - it is nowhere near that. It is a pretty dull and lousy place. On the other hand Orchard is where it is lively and fun.
,,Fly Kite on Weekend,3.0,,Went on a friday night and saw many people flying very large kites lighted with LED lights. Pretty impressive sight that is unique to singapore
,,gotta see it,5.0,,Has everything you want in a destination..Sky Walk..Casino and Mall..You could spend 2 days there and never leave the Marina
,,Water and Fire,4.0,,"I was very impressed by the technique of the show. All those lights, lasers, dancing water and fire pillows. Definitely worth to see. But I find the message quite boring and dull - just a collections of stereotypes. Would be nice to see something meaningful that can touch or entertain."

,,beautiful place,4.0,,"It is a very beautiful place. I was impressed by the scenery and the cleanliness. The newly open Garden by the Bay, it is very impressive. The giant trees are so beautiful especially during night time, when the lights are switched on."
,,Amazing view of singapore,4.0,,To go on top of marina bay is little bit expensive but worth an amazing view.You can have complete view of well organized singapore.There is no other activity on top.There are some excellent shopping mall and hotel inside.
,,must go in singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay represents singapore today. Its must go. I have enough money I would stay there. And If I don't stay I would visit. Go to the top to view singapore from 56th floor. They give some deals for view from top and dinner. A nice restaurant shop on skypark. Casino is also free entry for foreigners, and its amazing. Shopping complex in marina bays is huge and beautiful. There is museum. Many eating options in marina bay. Marina bay sands location is best in singapore, Gardens by the bay, esplande, helix bridge, and others are nearby."
,,Two laser shows every evening,4.0,,See the laser show from the casino side with the exquisite laser images on the water fountain....and then cross over to the other side (Fullerton hotel side) and experience the show from a distance. Though the laser images are not visible but the laser probes from the towers behing the casino is worthwhile to watch...which is not visible otherwise from the casino side.
,,Amazing at night,5.0,,Go at night. Everything is beautifully lit up. And see the water-laser show in front of the Sands every hour at I think any night.
,,marina bay,5.0,,"This bay is a men-created area. The hotel, stadium and all other buildings is planned and done. take a boat tour to watch the story of the bay. the main building here is the hotel which has a connecitng parts between two building. on this connecting part, there is a bar and swimming pool. The hotel has restaurants, casino etc. this area is also best are to wath NEW YEAR FIREWORKS. you have to go there before 22.00 because there are 3 stage on the water and they close the door, moreover once you enter and if they close the door until you come in, you could not enter again, your begging means nothing for them. so be careful not to drink so much. my advise go to the stadium paying 30S$, you can sit and wathc the amazing show easily. the area will be extremely crowded to reach any point around the bay 23.30 will take at least 30 minutes.there are some other options, you can go the bar which is at the top of the hotel or you can go the bar at the other side of the bay (price 400S$, rezervation must) do not reach there via taxi if you are late, always use metro. also you will see the famous lion statue here."

,,Huge Hotel,5.0,,Very big hotel. It could be tiring to walk all over but definately worth the time and memories.Liked the space. A little too crowded over the weekend we were told.
,,Unbelievable View,5.0,,It took 30 seconds to travel 56 floors to the top of the Marina bay building were the panoramic view was breathtaking. I am afraid of heights and stood well back from the edge of the building but could still see the amazing scene spanning almost 360 degrees. A highlight of our trip to Singapore.
,,Even more spectacular at night,5.0,,"It's a 'must' for every tourist visiting Singapore. Full of modern architecture, fountains and installations Marina Bay will definitely make your visit to the place worthwhile. If you are fond of shopping, don't miss the Marina Bay shopping center which is quite time consuming, so take your time beforehand. There are fringe events which you might come across with accidentally. I was lucky enough to be treated with a glass of champagne after a fashion show taking place nearby:) The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is indeed impressive with its size, shape and facilities. Getting to the top deck is worth its price because the view is fantastic and the skyline breathtaking. It's best to get there before the sun set and wait until after dusk. The city lights and the laser show are just magnificent."
,,Great walk with views,5.0,,"It's nice to walk the whole round in the evening, total length about 3 to 4 km. From every point you have good views and can take nice pictures."
,,Excellent visit,5.0,,"Marina Bay is the new attraction area to visit. Each night a laser light show is on on the harbour area outside the casino/shopping mall at Marina Bay. After that is finished walk across to the other side of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and watch the laser light show of the Gardens by the Bay - definitely worth seeing both. The Marina Bay promenade on the harbour has some trendy bars where the westerners who can afford the prices can pull up a stool, snack on great, expensive food, drink fabulous cocktails and watch the world go by..waiting for the light show to start. Don't miss it."
,,Best Views,5.0,,that's it.... awesome views of the skyline and the Marina Bay Sands hotel.... i recommend taking a water taxi to get some great photos for a non-tour price
,,Many happy hours shopping here!,5.0,,"As Marina Bay was literally across the road from our apartment, it was convenient and easy to get to.
The actual area around is amazing; clean, great vibe and unbelievable that only a few short years ago, it didn't exist!
Great bars, boat tours and restaurants to keep you occupied!
Plus shopping at Marina Bay Sands......... They've even got a plastic ice rink!"
,,Fabulous space age architecture.,5.0,,Loved the imagination of it all. The sound and light show here each evening at 9.30 and later is amazing. The river trip is also a good way to view the bay.

,,Great place to wind down!,5.0,,"It's a great place, relaxing with the view of Marina Sands bay, Singapore flyer and of course Merlion! There are plenty of places on the board walk to dine, or to just have some coffee, which we did! It's specially nice during early evening with the MSB's light show! After a heavy duty outing during the day, Marina Bay was our choice of place to wind down with our toddler, who also loved running around!"

,,Night view's beautiful,4.0,,"It's beautiful, especially at night! Take a stroll along the sea, enjoy the breeze and sometimes you'll get to see people flying kites with lights there!"
,,Good taste of snacks.,4.0,,We found good taste as vegetarian eaters. The preparation of bites and their style of service was very excellent and recommended for other vegetation eaters.
,,Lovely and Expensive,4.0,,"It was cool. And this was amazing. It is beautiful and well laid out. You can browse high end stores without the attitude that you usually get in these stores in most countries.

The ladies at Sephora were rather lethargic and I did not get the usual attention that I am used to from this store. The lovely Malay lady who assisted me with make up and was working on someone else when I entered was great.

Otherwise it is a mall. Not a hugely spectacular one but it is cool in here and this is very important in Singapore. Direct links to the subway"
,,Marina bay,4.0,,"We walked from the city side around the bay, through the marina shopping complex(amazing) then over to the flyer. It was a lovely walk even though it was hot. There could have been some seats along the way. We had lunch at the little hawker stalls at the base of the flyer, then caught a bus to the Bugis street markets."
,,Marina bay,4.0,,"nice view, must be come at night, not in the early.............................................................."
,,gr8 view,5.0,,i dont know if i was lucky or everyday at evening there is lazer show from marina bay sands..but check with the people there n there are particular times when u get the free tour so..contact n then have a gr8 time.
,,Stunning Architecture,5.0,,"Took an evening boat trip and from dusk til dark is turned quite magical. The architecture (although modern, which I don't normally appreciate) was stunning."
,,Marina Bay just grows year on year - including yet another shopping opportunity,4.0,,"If this wasn't in Singapore, then it might score more than average, but here the competition is so fierce :-)

Most of the bay development is new since we were last in Singapore (2007) and promises much more then just shopping. The Singapore Flyer is now complemented by museums. Gardens By The Bay and the Sands Skypark.

Easy access, whether by foot or metro - although the latter can be a little confusing when trying to get up to the Skypark itself. We ended up walking through the Sands hotel and discovering the Gardens By The Bay (so happy accident really)."
,,Filled with Entertainment,5.0,,There is a lot to do on the Marina Bay - so I'm going to keep this review to the area rather than the actual activities. Like most places in Singapore the landscaping is remarkable and there is not a drop of litter around. Everyone stays calm and there is a peaceful attitude amongst fellow patrons. I enjoyed a few hours sitting under a palm tree on the lawn working on my laptop and keeping out of the mid day heat. Perfect.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Great to see the Bay, especially at night, with amazing view for the high builings and amazing atmosphere. great for an hour"
,,Enchanting skyline,4.0,,The place has expanded and the skyline was so enchanting. The view by night was so beautiful. I went to Gardens by the bay and the things that they´ve developed there is worth visiting.
,,Must go to see,4.0,,"The Bay is one of the main attractions here in Singapore.

,,Fabulous atmosphere,5.0,,"Lots of trips leave from here. I went on an evening trip sightseeing and eating, very good. Also the river I took from here.. The shopping mall is good,and lot's of eateries."
,,Pretty,3.0,,"The Marina is a nice place to hang out. It is pretty, however a tremendous amount of construction taking place there takes away from the relaxed atmosphere that it should have. Beautiful high end hotels in this area."
,,"beatiful Bay, plenty of life in the night.",4.0,,"The Bay is one of the main attraction in Singapore. It is just beatiful and highly reccomended during the day to make a walk all around: it is 2 miles and an half or to visit the museum; during the night there is a mall, a disco, a theatre and a huge Louis Vitton shop. Without forgetting the most famous Marina Bay Hotel and its casino! In the night the play of lights, that is made all over the Bay, is something that can't be missed in Singapore."

,,Must visit Place,5.0,,"This is place to see the famous Merlion (A fish with Lion Head) and beautiful view of Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
Don't miss the view from the skypark tower of the Marina Bay sands Hotel. Also visit the Gardens by the bay.
You may also want to have a ferrari drive for $200 on the F1 track."
,,Sound & Light Show,4.0,,Have seen better (Hong Kong) but still well worth a look. There are shops on the opposite bank which afford a hood view and also places to eat as well.
,,Great to see the Bay,5.0,,"The Bay was surprisingly amazing and pure. the atmosphere here was great, great view of Marina Bay Sands, especially at night"
,,A great walk in air conditioning,4.0,,This is the place to go when the weather is wet and/or the humidity outside is getting you down. I found the shops varied and the window shopping great fun. there are also eating places aplenty.
,,Shopping Galore,4.0,,"Lots of branded names in the shopping malls here. Access is easy - by bus, train, cab or simply by walking from nearby Bugis area. We enjoyed the variety of stores and food outlets too. A further walk outside the mall would bring you to the Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Parks. Well worth a day's exploration."
,,A Must but Eat Somewhere Else,4.0,,"A lot of tourists end up eating near Marina Bay in one of the countless over-priced restaurants. The atmosphere is great, but there are other areas of the city where the food costs a third of what you pay here."
,,Great Place,4.0,,The whole Marina Bay area is well worth going to. The Convention Centre area is excellent. So are Marina Bay Gardens
,,Must visit,4.0,,Will back again to catch the noon's. Got the wrong mrt when we went there and little bit late to watch the lightshow but that's okay since there're so many other tourist spots nearby.
,,where the action is,5.0,,"fantastic place to hang around. Great food and they have the light shows with laser and fountanes, the last one starts at 21:30 and goes on for 15 min. after it is over, but the bars are still open. Very good place to hand around and a long walk around the whole bay!"
,,Everything-at-once-center,4.0,,"Nice Hotel, perfect pool, good shopping center and great foodcourt downstairs. With the museum nearby you can have everything at one stopp..."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,A brilliant complex with great dining & shopping choices. You could not wish for anything more! Worth paying every penny to stay here. So close to everything and the views from the balcony to the new gardens by the bay are just so beautiful.
,,Awesome Place,5.0,,"The observatory deck closes in bad weather, so do get a check on the weather prior to visiting the same."
,,Great Day Out,5.0,,Excellent venue for shopping or just sightseeing and the like. We spend the morning at Garden by the Bay and the headed to Marina Sands to eat and relax. Was excellently presented and the highlight of our recent trip.
,,A must see,5.0,,"A must see with its large air conditioned shopping mall, option to pay $20.00 each to go up in the lift to the top for what are spectacular views. We did this after having been across to the Marina Bay Sands Gardens which are also truly spectacular. We had a very full day as we also included a visit to the Science & Art Museum (Lotus Flower)."
,,Good seaview.,3.0,,Rather pricey place for me.....would recommend visitors to Clarke/Boat Quay for a better hotel and holiday stay....
,,Nice spot for photography,5.0,,"I've been there in August and is a rainy days, the win blows so fast and was a good experience. Stop by at the mall and just sign seeing because we doesn't plan anything for shopping. When we found the way to MBS roof, they told me that SGD20 for fee entrance and we skip for that :("
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Have to go on sky pool level of Marina Bay Sands, to enjoy the great view of Singapore skyline. Enjoy a beer, go shopping in the mall below, all in one stop."

,,A Must visit whilst in Singapore,5.0,,The whole MBS Precint is worth a visit from the foreshore to the Shoppes at Marina Bay and a visit to the tops of MB Sands Hotel which is well worth the $20 admission fee. Allow plenty of time a there is so much to see and so many places to eat and shop. Time your trip to top of Sands Hotel over sunset period but allow plenty of time before hand as the line for tickets gets very busy later afternoon. There is a lovely little bar just before the pool entrance which is rather hidden but gives you a great view out over Singapore and you get to see the Infinity pool also
,,Lovely Bay Water Views,5.0,,"The merlion, Fullerton hotel, Marina Float, Marina Bay Sands - good places to see close by. Rier walk with a row of restaurants very close by from Fullerton hotel. Many MRT's on the line close by and easy getting to here from many places."
,,Bad staff behavior,2.0,,"What went wrong are the staffs, theyre not very helpful and very unhospitable. Staff should be given a proper training if they will work in such really amazing place like this specially in the bar and restaurant. But no, Some staff are not smiling, not approachable and most of all, discriminating other people. Unfortunately we are not very happy of our stay here. Shame on this wonderful architectural building. We love the view from the top."
,,Great Veiws,5.0,,A must for travellers to go to the top of this building can see other countries from the top. Restuarnt at the top was amazing.
,,Immaculate,4.0,,"We walked around Marina Bay and took in the views and shopping. As you would expect the whole area was immaculate and maintained to the highest standard, it is just amazing how nice it is to walk, unhurried and unhassled around immaculately kept walkways, watching Yatchs etc and then to browse through some amazing shops and restaurants in The Shoppes at Marina Bay."
,,"I know it's a big building, but we liked it",4.0,,"We liked the Marina Bay and marveled at it's design. Although the shops were all high-end and they charged everywhere they could, you could still walk around and enjoy the space. There was also a neat (and free) water show out on the boardwalk in front of the restaurants."
,,Wonderful place with a lot of fun,5.0,,"It is greate time that I had with my colleagues tonight. This place is where you can get off on whatever the relationship or partnership you have with your company. Walk around the river and get small party along side river was amazing chance. However just remember to mind your attitude toward this perfect clean area, there are some people did not clean their place after party. Price is reasonable enought for this premier area."
,,fun,5.0,,nice place to hang out. plenty to keep you entertained. don't miss the waterfront light musical played twice every evening in front of the shoppes marina bay.
,,Great experience but expensive drinks,4.0,,"Fantastic view but pay for it through the drinks price, however cost $20 just to get up there so might as well have a drink for a few dollars more"

,,Expensive! 1000s needed to Gamble!,4.0,,"I am so embarrassed not to have any money for the Singapore part of this trip. I went to the casino and there were all these people gambling $1000s.....my mouth dropped on the floor as I was left to gamble on the cheap*** machines.

It did have the American brands that I like - but I couldn't afford anything."
,,Awesomeeee hotel,5.0,,"One of the best hotels to stay in ... best ever acc to me . In dining service is world class ... Sands skypark rocks ... breakfast needs to improve though , but casino and shopping mall is to die for ... The view from the top is OMG !!!!!!"
,,An Interesting and Pleasant Place to Stroll,5.0,,"Whilst most of the sights around Marina Bay are very modern, there are still a few examples of the original buildings from the time that Fullerton Quay was in operation. The views from the most points around Marina Bay are spectacular and it is good to see that the Mrrlion has been given a new home as the focal point for the Fullerton Quay area.

Tip - if you do not want to walk all tye way around tye bay, take the river boat from Merlion Park to Marina Bay Sands, the views from that side are well worth the effort."
,,Great but very expensive,4.0,,A must see for any tourist. Just wander around and look up! Some great bars along 'one fullerton' offer a cheaper alternative.
,,Very scenic,5.0,,"Love the boat ride around the bay. The mall at sands at the bay is great! Many high end stores, restaurants. The MRT is super clean. Easy transport around the city."

,,Picturesque and interesting,5.0,,"I live it that there is commerce there and that there is a huge selection of food you can by from the hawkers place. My friends and I had a great time going from food stall to food stall. Very reasonably price - in fact, cheap"

,,Great,5.0,,"I stayed at Rizt Carton Hotel and have a full view of Marina Bay view, so wonderful, the view is so beautiful"
,,The Greatest Architectural Structure I've Ever Seen,5.0,,"I came into Singapore in the evening, the next day I woke to the most unbelievable structure in Asia. It looks like a cruise ship stuck at the top of a building. This structure is the crown jewel of the Singapore skyline, However, it’s not just a ""pretty face"". Marina Bay is a destination in and of itself, Singapore has plenty to do, but if you had only one place to go, this is the place.
This structure is a mall with lots of upscale shopping options. It’s a Casino, The Sands, where you can play some of the popular games of Asia like Baccarat and “Singapore Poker”
There’s also a hotel, with lots of restaurant options. The next time in Singapore, I’d prefer to stay there, as opposed to the Peninsula Excelsior."
,,"Fantastic views, a must see!",5.0,,We did not read up about Marina Bay sp had no idea it was a hotel. We saw it on the skyline and headed in that direction thinking whatever it is we are going up there to see that view. We went up to the Kudeta bar for a drink and the views were amazing. The architecture definitely rivals that of the hotels in Las Vegas!
,,Jazz music on the boardwalk,4.0,,I was in Singapore last weekend and had a chance to experience listening to the jazz music on the boardwalk of Marina bay Sands..it was such a great experience...many people was there enjoy the night scene of Singapore and listen to the live beautiful music...it shows only weekend that's lucky me!!
,,Wow...,5.0,,"It's pretty impressive, certainly one of the most striking buildings in Singapore. The casino is fun, and I like the fact that they don't allow alcohol on the premise, as it tends to project a classier feel to the whole experience. The shops are great, the food is good, and being right by the amazing gardens is also a lot of fun. Great experience, will go back whenever I find myself in S'pore!"
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,"From Bargains to Designer Label and everything in between. Even has it's own Venice Style canal running through, complete with Gondolas."
,,OMG,5.0,,This [lace is amazing and just a short walk underground from raffles shopping centre. fantastic shops..unbelievable views from the observation deck and the foyer at the hotel just spectacular.
,,Snooty and rude,1.0,,"We went up to the bar to have a drink in this hotel and found the staff to be rude and self important.

The views are amazing but that doesn't give the staff the self import they appear to have. You could not pay me to go back."
,,The Water/light show is a must,5.0,,"Arrived at 7.45 p.m to get a seat on the steps which also act as seats for the show at 8.00 pm. Had no idea what to expect and was blown away by the best 15 minute show of this type I have ever seen. The effects used are something to behold. If you have a video camera or a camera with a video mode which can go for 15 minutes you will want to capture this! As the display covers are big area about 15 meters you will need a wide angle camera to get it all. if not, get what you can and you will not be disappointed. Shows are at 8.00 and 9.30 every night. Arrive early to get a seat. Do not miss this!"
,,One day is insufficient,5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for one night and enjoyed the spectacular Sky Park pool, dinned in the Shoppes and went to the Science/Art Museum the next morning. On our return a week later we went to the gardens - mind blowing"
,,"Amazing, surprising and tentalising Bay !",5.0,,"The shopping facilities are great and countless. Eateries galore ! And make your way to Gardens by the Bay - to gaze, wonder, and be amazed by how much to learn about nature - the plants, trees, etc - before climibng high up for a skywalk and head for the giant trees ( visit a restaurant high up in one giant tree)"
,,Excellent spot to see the city,4.0,,"This place has become one of the ""must do's"" in Singapore, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting. The architecture of the buildings in itself is very impressive, but above all the view (at night preferably) is great."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Awesome experience. Liked the space. Did not like the crowd. The view from the top was something we can't forget about Singapore. The shoppes was nice experience. Found some cheap buys compared to home.
,,National pride,5.0,,"Every time I visit the place, I take pictures of is spectacular building. The photos always turn out nice. There is quite a fair bit to do in the area. You probably need a day. I suggest taking at least half a day to explore the area. You can start walking from Esplanade. Smewhere around Gluttons Bay you can see a very nice view of MBS and the ore commercial building. Great photography opportunity.

Continue walking to MBS. You will pass The Youth Olympic Park and the Helix Bridge. You can visit e Artscience Museum and do some shopping. even if you are not a fan of Louis Vuitton, you can visit the very unique boutique at MBS. On top of that, there are plenty to shop at MBS if you like designer brands.

When you are hungry, there are many restaurants for you to choose from. The huge food court is always busy but I enjoy eating there. Usually, I order a few dishes from the barbecue seafood stall. Yummy."
,,Breathtaking development...,4.0,,"Expansive waterfront enhancement which is yet again transforming this city state, adding new dimension and opportunity. Encompassing fabulous new theatres, restaurants, shopping malls, sports facilities, business centres, arts and cultural platforms, the spectacle of Singapore rises to a Global level. The gardens are fabulous too.....!!!!"
,,Nice Walk around the bay,4.0,,"Although not our cup of tea as far as attractions go, Singapore does it in style. This is a bling city for those who are into to premium shopping and showy places. Not enough seats around the place for the those who want to rest and take in the view."
,,Pre New Year's Eve,4.0,,We had a wander around Marina Bay as the setup for the New Year celebrations were in preparation. Interesting. A coffee in The Shoppes was very welcome.
,,Great Views but very Pricey !,4.0,,Spent the morning here prior to fling home and just wandered around the shops. It is beautifully built with great shopping and plenty of great food places. A great place for the family to stay cool and wander around for a day.
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Marina bay is any must visit destination. The building is marvel by itself. Go to the tower 3 basement where you get tickets to the observation desk( top floor) which is $20 per person. The lift from their directly takes you to 56 th floor where you have large open observation desk and unlimited view of Singapore skyline.
If you don't wish to pay that amount head to ku te da bar at 57 th floor were entry is free but drinks are costly.

Also Marina bay sands has a fantastic casino ( carry your passport copiesmfor entry) and super costly mall just around the other side of road."
,,The place to be,5.0,,"The Singaporeans have developed a fantastic series of beutifully designed buildings in this area, especially when viewed from the Sky Park at the Marina Bay Sands"
,,The Best View,4.0,,"We visited the sky deck at Marina Bay at twilight, it gave the most amazing 360 degree views of Singapore and the coast. I'd looked at the reviews and thought that it didn't look great, but when we got there we decided it was a better bet than the Singapore Flyer. We weren't disappointed, it was really worth while. It is such an amazing building.
The only disappointment was that we couldn't go into the bar for drinks, there were soft drinks available on a stand on the deck."

,,A great place has everything!!,5.0,,"Marina Bay is the IT place of Singapore lately. It has a huge shopping area as well as many dining places. Most of the shops are branded items, so if those items are not your pocket's friend, then a must visit to stroll around is enough."
,,Hotel and restaurants,5.0,,This is a fabulous place to visit both for the shopping and the eating places. The atmosphere is fabulous and just walking around window shopping(if you like) is a joy

,,Luxury Area,4.0,,"Nice view and full of very expensive shops. But it is worth a visit for the environment and the architecture, maybe unique in Asia!"
,,Great & luxury,5.0,,"Such a beautiful place to stay for a day in the shopping centre, gardens, hotel. It was awesome!No mattere if you visit it during day or night! View to Merlion park, Esplanade from the top of the shopping center and it's connected to the Gardens of the bay. Probably you need a day to be here. Will definitely stay longer here next round."
,,Cool laser show,5.0,,Try not to miss the excellent laser show outside The Marina Bay shopping centre. I'm told this one is better than the Song of Sea Show in Sentosa Island and its one is free for all.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Such a beautiful place especially to snap a few photos. While we were there, we even saw the Light Show from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel at night. Better yet, spare 20 SGD to go up to the Observation Deck at the hotel to get a better view."
,,Marvellous Panorama.,5.0,,I think everyone visits Marina Bay when he comes to Singapore. The shape of the hotel is mind blowing. The panorama from its deck is also marvellous.We enjoyed our drinks while viewing from hundreds of meters. Definately must be seen.

Also short walk away you can see the KrisFlyer also Garden by The Bay."

,,Stunning!,4.0,,"Built almost entirely on reclaimed land this area is a exciting collection of modern buildings, each of which is an architectural delight in itself.

,,Top of city,5.0,,it is a modern art. to review all of attraction of city it is a nice place. you can see 360 degree and we had lunch it was nice
,,"""Singapore's crown jewel attraction"".",5.0,,"PRO: ~Good weather, very breezy, even with the afternoon sun, you will feel cooled by the strong winds. ~Ample parking. ~Good signage. CON: ~Limited areas which provide share, should there be a rain. Better to have a wet weather plan."
,,Marina Bay Sands !,5.0,,"Everything about the hotel and mainly the Sky Park....worth a visit ! Being December...Singapore was at its best. About the hotel....the way it is connected with The Shoppes underground was really super. The Promenade from where we watched the laser show, I mean just everything about it....."
,,fantastic,5.0,,Fantastic and well worth the paying of $20 to go to top. views really fantastic and it is a great city.The whole marine is excellent especially at night.
,,nice walk along the water body,4.0,,"it is nice walkway along the water body. you can either start with Marina Bay floating stadium and end it to Marina Bay Sands Hotel or vice versa but for sure water will not leave you ever though you enter the link mall, water body will be there for you in mall.

The link mall is nice and costly.

All in all its a good walk to spend with loved ones."
,,A very nice area,5.0,,"Nice views, nice walk to take, restaurants and shopping. Though the shops are expensive it's worth a visit."
,,Clarke Quay.,5.0,,A captivating waterway with frequent water taxis to other attractions. I loved the water show at night with the dancing fountains at The Ship. and the music was lovely
,,A Singapore Icon,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands quickly stamped itself as a Singapore icon, in much the same way the Sydney Opera House is an icon of Australia. Sure it's a casino, but it's also a top class hotel, theatres, a mall full of major brands, excellent restaurants (although locals will tell you they are on the expensive side), a museum and, on the Sky Park, bars, a club, an amazing infinity pool and awesome views of Singapore. No trip to Singapore would be complete without a visit to MBS (Singaporeans like to abbreviate everything)."
,,A fantastic and creative development from Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a “must see” for any visitor to Singapore. Here are my personal favourites, which you can either do in one circuit, or break up over a couple of visits.

Start with the Singapore Flyer (close to the Promenade MRT stop, or the hop-on/hop-off buses. The view is sensational - from the adjoining F1 racetrack and Fulllerton hotel, through to the thousands of ships anchoring off the coastline. The site itself felt a bit sterile (eg the restaurants and shops were quite empty) so move swiftly on to take a quick look at the lobby area of the newly refurbished Pan-Pacific. It looks absolutely stunning with what must be one of the longest bars in the world and the creative pod seating areas in the pools of water. Next, take a short walk to cross the new Helix bridge – no traffic – it is better at night due to creative lighting and makes for a fresh impression of footbridge design.

Then walk along to the spectacular Marina Place shopping mall. Comparisons have to be made to the Dubai Mall, not least because of the water show at 8 pm and 9.30 pm each evening (though check for exact times). The Dubai show stresses the fountains dancing in tune to the music, the Singapore one attempts to create lasered images on fine mists of water spray. It sounds ungrateful to say that I prefer the Dubai one – not least as this is one of the most fun and innovative “free” tourist options in Singapore and definitely not to be missed.

Continue your visit by going through the mall to see the iconic Marina Sands hotel. It will surely become one of the most photographed buildings in this city. You can go up to the top, either to a viewing deck or a bar. In any event, take the elevated walkway (accessed from the mall), across to the hotel, then on into the “Gardens at the Bay” (NB It is more impressive entering the Gardens from this walkway rather than directly from the Bayfront MRT station, where the link is underground). The Gardens are immaculate and the walk through them is delightful (they will doubtless give the Botanical Gardens a run for its money). The two cooled conservatories are also fantastic (entry price is steep for non-residents); with a key innovation being that they are much cooler inside, than the outside temperature, in a clever reversal of what greenhouses in cool northern European countries are generally associated with. It is no surprise these won “Building of the Year 2012” award. Probably the highlight has to be the amazing waterfall you see as you enter the Forrest conservatory. At 7.45 pm, there is a sound and light show in the Trees zone; it is OKish, basically a change in lighting set to some classical music.

After the gardens, keep going round the immaculate boardwalk, you will pass by the financial centre, then come to a wonderful hotel – the Fullerton Bay. It is extremely opulent. Keep going and you will pass by some lively bars/coffee shops/restaurants if you need refreshment/food as you get towards Merlion park/fountain. There is a great vibe in this section, with amazing views of the Marina Sands hotel, and generally a classier feel than Clarke Quay. You can then take the underpass to the Fullerton – a most majestic and iconic building, then pass out the other side of the hotel and stroll along the riverfront, again enjoying the restaurants and retail offerings. As an option, you can cross the river and go via the theatres on the Esplanade on the north side of the marina – and complete your circuit – or as an alternative walk along the riverside quay with more innumerable dining/shopping options up to Clarke. Both routes have MRT stations.

Singapore has done a fantastic job in Marina Bay ..... it will over time give Orchard Road a run for its money."
,,Marina Bay stroll,5.0,,"My Mum and I travelled to Singapore and stayed at Marina Bay Sands. We loved strolling around the bay near the Art and Science museum, and across the bridge. Fantastic views, wonderful light show every evening, lots of options for food although it is not inexpensive."
,,Great View,5.0,,"A must visit in Singapore. Dont take the normal tour route, as there is a 20$ charge, instead, tell them you would like to go to the bar, you can get a drink there and have the same view."
,,Possibly the only interesting view in Singapore...,4.0,,"Yes, the only thing there is to really do in Singapore is shop, and Marina Bay offers you even more of that, but at least it has the views!

You can't visit Singapore without stopping by in Marina Bay and take a picture of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the one that's included in like every picture of Singapore you'll ever see. The light show in the evenings is spectacular, as is the Helix Bridge leading to the hotel and the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. This area also has world-class dining."
,,Skip the tourist lift and have a drink at the bar for the same price,5.0,,"I hear the tour is nice but I'm not one to wait in lines. Opted for the la-te-da elevator on the main level. Had no line and the same views and no cover. I think a drink is mandatory, which lined up perfectly with my goals. Spectacular views while sipping a drink in the open air. A must in my opinion."
,,Super!,5.0,,"Good food, nice athmosphere, friendly staff, speaking chinese might be handy, be sure to make reservations !"
,,food quality,5.0,,"Although the prices are slightly higher than normal, The food quality made up for the price difference. The atmosphere and setting is comfortable and relaxing. I enjoyed my time spent."
,,Man made wonderment,3.0,,"Night time is the best time to enjoy the lights at the bay area. At 8pm every night, the Marina Bay Sands begins its nightly light display that can be seen for miles. The Singapore Flyer is nicely lit too, along with all the Christmas lights makes it all a great display."
,,you gotta do it at least once,5.0,,the marina bay mall is lovely and the pool on top of the hotel is a once in a life time event. Go early in the morning...6 am before everyone esle and enjy the sunrise and solitude...lovely
,,Great Views,4.0,,This should not be missed as the view from the sky park is great. There is an extra charge for access to the Sands Hotel roof top. Plenty of shopping and places to eat in the complex.
,,Best View in Singapore,5.0,,"The place that you have to visit in Singapore. So many a good spot here to take a photo. If it is possible, just book and stay at Marina Bay Sands Hotel"
,,Stunning Night View,4.0,,Make sure you'll be there at 8pm! Enjoy the light show directly opposite you with all the stunning night view of skyscrapers around you! Nice spot for photos too.
,,Unique Building worth staying or visiting,4.0,,Just a great place to go to either stay or just visit. The shopping centre is expensive. Compared price of Mulberry bag and it was 6 x more than in UK!
,,breathtaking place,5.0,,really a wonderfull hotel but the best place is on the roof looking at singapore from above. make sure you go after the sun goes down.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"My favorite spot in SG. I spent 3 evenings of 4 nights while in SG in Marina Bay and I never get tired of seeing the view!
wait for the sun to go down and you will see the beauty of the place. Love it there!"
,,Excellent at night,5.0,,"I love walking around the Marina Bay in the late evening, the lights are wonderful. This place is less crowded then Merlion Park. You can watch the Wonder Full light and water show twice an evening here."
,,Worth more than one visit,4.0,,"There is a lot to see and do in the Marina Bay area, so it's worth coming more than once. Lots of shops and dining experiences on offer, in addition to taking in the architecture both of Marina Bay Sands and the city. There is also a museum, theatres, ice skating rink, and a good walk from Marina Bay Sands around to the Merlion."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"See the singapore wheel, the garden, the casino go into the fog forest etc. etc
This is a really nice place to go to (and I'm not even a city person).
I thought this was a nice to visit in the daytime and even more impressive in the nighttime."
,,Away from the madding crowd,4.0,,"Our aim was to walk to the Marina Sands Resort from Raffles Place. Contrasting architectural styles and lots of open space. Loved the solar powered fans. Other than the restaurants at One Fullerton, the area lacks character but it was very calm compared with Orchard Road and the other busy areas of the city. Nice to sit and enjoy the sailboats and admire the buildings."
,,I love the changing drama of this new area,5.0,,"I used to live and work in Singapore in the 70s and my office was at Collyer Quay on the waterfront of downtown Singapore. My view was over the sea towards an elevated highway over some empty reclaimed land. Rather dull and bland. Today my view would be crowded by a collection of spectacular modern buildings that change every 2 years when I revisit. This is 'dynamic', 'materialistic' Singapore, which I deride, as its true self. Spectacular, active, flashy, glamourous, self-confident, money-talking Singapore. The ridiculous Sands Hotel (see the pictures) sum it up, with its a palm-lined swimming pool way up in the sky from where you oversee a scape of skyscrapers waving in the sky - kind of. Great!"
,,Nice area to stroll around especially at night,4.0,,"Marina Bay is surrounded by fancy hotels, shopping concourses and the Merlion. Best to start from one end and stroll to the other side. Enjoy the various perspectives of the Bay and at night watch the light show from the Sands Casino. Definitely a highlight in Singapore"
,,Lovely!,4.0,,Breath taking view. Really nice place to take photos esp at night. Dont miss it when you're in Singapore.
,,Nice Area,4.0,,Really enjoyed walking around Marina Bay. The Marina Bay Sands and surrounding shops are amazing. (Tip: don't pay the entrance fee to the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands. It's S$20 or so. Instead have a snack and drink at Ku De Ta and get to use the observation deck for free!)
,,Magnificent but.....,4.0,,"The Marina Bay area is amazing and a must see while in Singapore. The architecture is stunning and makes for great photos. The only down side is that you only get to go up to the observation deck on top of the Marina Bay Sands, if you want to see the infinity pool you need to book into a separate tour and these only go 3 times a day. It costs $20 and that's ok but you only get to go to a very small section, if you have been up the Flyer, I don't think I would bother with the MBS observation deck as well because the view is the same as on the Flyer. By the way, if you want an alcoholic drink or a meal at one of the restaurants at the top you have to go up via a different way."
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is a place to tick off your list and definitely visit the top pool area. It's so unique with a dramatic setting and amazing views and you could stay in the hotel for days and not be bored. A drink at night on the top floor is very impressive
,,Mixed experience,2.0,,"The place is overly crowded and the bars and restaurants very impersonal. The saving grace are tehe bars at the top which are spectacular, the staff first rate"
,,Truly amazing,5.0,,"The whole Marina Bay area is truly amazing, definately not to be missed. Easy to get to from all parts of Singapore"
,,what a view,4.0,,"super slick hotel and shopping centre, upmarket with all the international brands represented. take the lift to the top and have a drink at the bar to take in the great view of the city. Not cheap, expect to pay about £15.00 for a beer"
,,Why would you want to go here . . .,3.0,,"Guess if you like to gamble it's worth it . . . and, the sights are terrific. The shopping is ridiculously over priced and the hotel is a drag. The Ku Da Te restaurant on top is very good."
,,Better at night,4.0,,"I had my visit here at late afternoon, the lights are more splendid if the dark is coming. Could be better if it will be free, but an hour for visiting this place was enough for me"
,,Modern Singapore at its best,5.0,,"What can I say about Marina Bay? For me, it is the best of modern Singapore. Imaginative architecture, pedestrian friendly because of the boardwalk, some nice, casual restaurants along the way and a relaxed atmosphere away from the hustle of the city. Take some time to walk round, do some shopping if you really must, and fit in the walk across the helix bridge to the Esplanade side."
,,Jersey Boys show,4.0,,Went to see Jersey Boys show at Marina Bay. Great buzz around the place. Very expensive.....charge of about 39SGD to go to top of building .
,,Do the Sky Garden Tour.,5.0,,"Definitely visit the Sky Garden and get there early in the day to sign up for the free guided tour (you sign up separately, but at the same ticket counter, and the slots fill up fast early in the day). The guided tour is the only way to get to see the fantastic roof top infinity pool if you are not a hotel guest. Otherwise all you see is the walled off observation deck on a lower level. I guess you could also make a restaurant reservation for the chocolate cafe or the night club but those don't have direct access to the pool either (note, that they keep you roped off, so you can't swim either)."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Cool place, architecture is unbelievable, nice shops but some quite pricy. Also nice shows and you can eat at the hotel or at the shopping mall"
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"The views from the top are awesome. We did enjoy the whole experience. Its cooler in December , but it did rain."
,,Free family entertainment,5.0,,Had a nice after dinner stroll around the Bay before stopping at the MBS promenade to watch the Wonderful light show. The view of the Singapore skyline was breathtaking. The day we were there a band of musicians from the MBS were providing entertainment with some oldies jazz standards at the foyer of The Shoppe. Great family outing and entertainment to be had without burning a hole in the pocket.
,,The Sands Hotel is unbelievable.,5.0,,"When you visit Singapore, you must spend some time at the Sands Hotel -- at least for drinks on the top floor that offers the most spectactual view of Singapore."
,,Hot Pick Hotel!,4.0,,I am here practically every month to meet and pick up up friends from overseas or dinning/shopping at the Mall. Hotel is famous for it's Sky Pool/Garden and Restaurant. The entrance/car drop off area is really small for the size of this place so please be careful if you have children.
,,Special Place,5.0,,"The first is feeling overwhelmed. followed by the large and luxurious inside. seems everything is here as entertainment, shopping and relax ......."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,A lovely walk around this place. Many fabulous shops and plenty of places to sit down and rest as well as lots of food outlets. We really enjoyed it ...expecially the gondola ride.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Food courts are good, the mall is worth visiting. Shops are quite expensive be carefull, check before buying"
,,Attended for a trade show... its BIGGGG,3.0,,"This place is a multi-functional venue. I attended it for a trade show exhibition for a week long period. The shopping mall is huge, with lots of upmarket dining options (celebrity restaurants et al). The problem is if you just want to grab a quick sandwich or light lunch and run, there few to no options. Nestled in a very remote and hard to reach corner of the shopping plaza (having walked from convention hall to the remote corner took over 30 minutes!) I found it to have very limited offerings, and most of which are unrecognizable to anyone except the local chinese.

If they want broad section of middle class ala for shopping which they are targetting, they need to have a broader food option choice, and more distributed throughout the large complex.

Beyond the limited food options which I consider unacceptable for a multi-functional place the venue isexcellent, the mall and shopping is good, and the atmosphere is good. A definitive lack of seating throughout the complex for tired walkers is an issue which is not unique to this place, virtually every place I go in SE Asia seems to avoid putting out any seats for customers to relax for 10 minutes."
,,Open and comfortable,4.0,,"Just was nice view from Marina Bay, worth for visiting and value. You could get some nice places nearby with drinking, i suggest coming at night is better"
,,An extraordinary garden - must see,5.0,,Overwhelmed by the number of species of flowers and plants. It is air-conditioned so making walking there so comfortable and relaxing
,,Nice calm walk,4.0,,The Singapore Merlyon is good one. My 9 years old son is enthusiastic for seeing that one. We liked the cool walk around. Nice cool experience.
,,Impressive structure. Fantastic panorama,5.0,,"You must pay a visit here if you pass by Singapore. From an architectural point of view this is a masterpiece. In the roof garden you can find many bars, restaurants and breathtaking panoramic pools. Within the premise you can find an hotel, a mall and a casino.
The Metro arrive directly inside it, in the basement.
AMAZING !!!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,Huge building and clean that the first time I saw. I would recommend to come to visit. And I will come back again next time.
,,Policy change,2.0,,"It seems that the policy has changed! $20 used to allow visitors, who were not hotel guests to experience the views and the pool area of the sky-park. As of this time, you can no longer access the infinity pool as a visitor unless you are a guest. We did get a better view from the lounge area, but after spending $150 on two appetizers, two glasses of wine and two beers, we were hoping to get a view from the infinity pool. I wish I would have known, I would not have wasted my time. The view that you pay for was nice, but not worth $20. In writing this, I just want other readers to be informed of what they are getting for the money: I nice view, but barely even a peek at the infinity pool. Saying that, I would consider this an improvement if I were actually a guest at the hotel. We chose to stay at the Swissotel, which I am not disappointed at all!"
,,amazing,5.0,,"Went there by MRT, stop at Marina Bay, need one more stop to MBS by CCE line just top up 10 cents at the MBS stop. Amazing building with lots of branded shops, food court is fantastic with variety of foods and the price is average like most food court in Singapore. You can sit in the lower ground next to the food court or in the hotel lobby with the giant amazing atmosphere."
,,"Amazing area, with the architectural wonder of the Marina Bay Sands",5.0,,"Loved taking pictures at the Merlion Fountain for a frontal view photo of the Marina Bay Sands with it's ship on top of the three buildings. Amazing architecture! Go to the skydeck there, it's worth it."
,,Signature Skyline,4.0,,"One of the defining architectures in Singapore. This is worth going to to just see the building even if you don't stay there, gamble, or take in the shops."
,,The Sands,5.0,,It is so fantastic a landmark. Singapore is worth the visit . I will be going back soon. It is a food heaven and the people are gracious and friendly. I felt safe all the time..
,,Great Place for a leisurely stroll,5.0,,"Enjoyed our visit to the Marina Area,great place for a stroll around, fabulous views of the Sands Hotel and casino also the Merlion is a great place to sit and relax"
,,towering buildings,4.0,,"Worth a ""look see"" up close as a building. As a shopping center it is pricey but prestigious. As a gambling center, one can see the big spenders in their wanton abandon. Lots of pretty people and granduer. Be sure to go to the top to see all the sights -- and/or go on the ""EYE"" to see it all."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Amazing gardens are superb and a beautiful back drop to the stunning architecture. Great shopping for those cashed up but still good for the window shoppers!
,,Blingapore-on-sea,4.0,,"Head over here late on sunday afternoon with the camera - amazing buildings, views quirky features and a light shows. And shops. Oh, and a whirlpool that is like something out of Pirates of the Caribean"
,,Good experience at MBS,4.0,,"the waiters can dance well, the service is Very Good and service crews are very responsive and helpful"
,,Progress,4.0,,We saw this area being developed about 3 years ago and wow haven't they done well. Worth the visit just to see what can be done. They even have a river running through the shopping area with small boats on it if you fancy a ride. Lots of shops and places to eat. We ate in the foodhall at lunchtime which was good value for money.
,,Amazing,4.0,,This is an incredible place. The mall is great with a lot of shops for the big wallets. The architecture of the whole center is amazing.
,,Hyped ad nauseam,3.0,,"Yes it is big and spectacular architecturally but it is also impersonal,overpriced,poor service and overcrowded with sight seers"
,,Incredible,5.0,,"What an achievment the Marina Bay Sands is. The building is incredible from all angles, inside and out. Inside the main lobby, which is several stories high and the very heart of the building, is a collection of places to eat, drink or rest. Skilled musicians play oriental music on traditional instruments and the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. The SGS20 price to the top level is probably worth it, but a bit steep for those poor back-backpackers! Note, you do not get much access up there and are kept well away from the real guests - you cannot go in or near the pool and are basically confined to one small area. There is a restaurant/bar up there, with prices to match the altitude. If it rains within an hour of paying, you can claim a refund. The rest of the complex is given over to shopping, shopping and more shopping, plus a wide range of entertainment from theatre to casinos. It really has everything, and even for a country boy who hates shopping, I could easily pass a weekend in here. Just keep a close watch on your wife if she has the credit card.

All in all, an exellent experience and a must see in Singapore."
,,What a view,5.0,,A great place to stop and admire the views with lots of places to eat and drink. The Lion fountain is amazing as is the 3 tower block hotel with gardens in the shape of a ship on the top
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,Pls visit this place in night for nice view. Do some photography for lifetime Memory. A must visit place in singapore
,,this is a once only,3.0,,"too expensive to see only one small end of the complex at top of marina bay, the view is good but u dont get to see the hotel complex at top pool ect. , worth a look , was going to stay there but 600 a night way over the top $$$$$$ GREEDY."
,,Acres of concert,3.0,,Walked around here looking for something interesting but failed to find anything. Acres and acres of concrete and construction cranes all over the place. Never did find a marina!
,,Wow experience,4.0,,"Whether you see this captivating sight from the top of Marina Bay Sands or your in a boat / on a boat cruise. This will completely blow your mind.

I took a boat in day time, and despite all the asian tourists with their 20 kg camera's shoving to get the best picture, i had some amazing views.
Seeing it from the boat and on the top of MBS it is beautifull. There is a light show around 10 o clock pm which you should stick around to watch..

The Bay gives you an idea of some of the stuff you can see in downtown Singapore.. take a boat you wont regret it..

Restaurents, museums with outdoor live entertainment, concerts, sports events, bars etc."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I've been in Singapore for so long already but I never really got tired of going to Marina Bay. There's just no point of getting tired with it when there's always something to discover everytime you pay it a visit.

Marina Bay is an icon that epitomizes the luxury of Singapore. It is basically Singapore within Singapore. It's a must visit, especially when we consider all the amenities it gives home to. There are 5star hotels, dining venues, malls, event venues, tourist attractions, etc. It has everything!!!!"
,,Stunning architecture in the horizon,5.0,,"Marina Bay offers a great view of the most iconic structures in Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands, Gardens at the Bay, Singapore Flyer and Helix Bridge are all within walking distance. Spectacular lights show at night and also a great venue to take photos, no matter what time of day it is."
,,Great Experien,4.0,,"I thought the place was great for day spent exploring what it has to offer. The scale of the place is awesome and the casino has to be seen to be believed. I'm told that that two Singapore casino's alone take more money than the whole of Las Vegas and seeing the action on the tables and slots I can easily believe it. Though I would advise against using the hotel restaurant which I personally found to be noisy expensive and with poor food quality.

The shopping centre part of the complex is great and if you look hard enough you'll find restaurants with lunchtime specials which seem to be aimed at the workers and staff members and are most affordable. The hotel lobby is a real eye opener and a trip to the rooftop garden and pool is a must, though the cost is about $20 per head. A taxi driver told me that if you informed the elevator staff that you just wanted to visit the rooftop to enjoy a drink at the bar, then they would allow you to ride to the top without buying a ticket.

The down side is that you'll have to pay $20 for a beer at the bar, but you do get a little more bank for your buck :)"
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"It's one of the most fantastic places in Singapore, This beautiful building has a huge casino inside, the hotel and very good restaurants. Prices are high but service is 5 stars"
,,beautiful,4.0,,"We were amazed with the big buildings. It was very nice to see and what a view when you go on a boat. There is so much to see and the kids loved it. My husband, 2 kids and I went...we saw many families even with small babies. The captain of the boat was really nice to our kids."
,,Corporate and pricey,2.0,,Had intended to go the top of this new and very impressive building . But at S$20 just to look we deemed it OTT. Hotel is far too big to have any character. Shoppes are interesting but all designer brands and very expensive of course.
,,EXCELLENT,5.0,,"With over 40 years traveling, staying in many hotels from 5 stars to - stars I can say with no hesatation that the Marina Bay Sands is by far, one of the best we ever stayed in.
The accomodation is not cheap but as for value for money its rated very highly in our opinion.
The hotel is of uniqe design, the rooms and the amenities are excellent. One of the best breakfast
we expiriance and with out mantion the swimingpool
The whole complex is beutifull.
However, the restorunts in the shoping mole attached, are VERY expensive.
Just to name one, its the DB Bistro that charged a very HIGH price for a VERY small portion.
It was a joke. A large Plate, a small portion and a big cheque.
We stayed in the hotel 5 times before and are amazed every time."
,,Interesting building with amazing pool & outstanding views.,4.0,,Had a great lunch in French brasserie with lovely wine & fabulous desert. It was in one of the arcades linked to the marina sands.
,,Totally awed!,5.0,,One one the most unique building design i've ever seen. I am just totally awed by the magnificent buidling. Too bad i didnt have the chance to climb up its top. From what i heard the views are just breathtaking and good for picture-taking. I will most definitely come again!
,,"WOW, OMG and WOW again",4.0,,You really need to allow your a few hours to walk the length of this amazing Shopping Precinct. Also you need to see the Light show. The hotel is out of this world. Definitely a place to see.
,,Fantastic urban view,5.0,,"The marina Bay Area is surrounded with some of the most impressive architecture forms I have ever seen. Take a nice afternoon walk around it, get to the observation in the hotel and see how the sunset colors the buildings windows. By night, the reflection from the water will give you fantastic photo- ops!"
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Marina Bay, as an area, and the hotel, in a way represents Singapore for what it is - immaculate, scenic and breathtaking. According to me, besides the obvious visit to the hotel terrace on the 58th floor, the laser show on the promenade should not be missed."
,,The new Singapore,4.0,,"We took the MRT to the Promenade station and walked from there over the Helix bridge to Marina Bay. The complex is full of fancy brand name stores, a waterway reminiscent of the Venetian in Las Vegas ( maybe because the Marina Bay Sands is an arm of their Vegas operation ) and many restaurants. There is an ice skate ring, the casino can be accessed from there as well. One thing to note that foreigners have free access to the casino, locals have to pay to get inside. It's a very spacious, airy complex and one can spend hours inside. Of course for a fee you can take the elevator to the roof and enjoy the view from the futuristic observation deck. I figured we fly into Singapore so often, that we have seen the aerial view enough times. After spending the afternoon in the mall we walked to the Bayfront MRT station which is part of the complex and took the subway back to the Intercontinental."
,,Must visit Place in SG,4.0,,Following is what I liked there... - Casino - Ambiance - Surroundings - Shops - Roads - Lighting Dislikes- - Long queue for taxi - Vegetarian food availability
,,out of this world,5.0,,"the space ,the views, the food, the shopping, What a magnificent building!Loved the Italian theme, the gondolas & bridges,& the views"
,,"Beautiful light show, nice river cruise",5.0,,"Had some 8 hours to fill between flights, I took a train (MRT) from Changi Airport to City Hall, a windows shopping stroll to Esplanade, then got out at Marina Bay. The information booth is very helpful, got a unlimited riverboat ticket for S$23, which took me to Clarke Quay, a nice place for diner no matter who you are and what you like :) I took another boat with live traditional Chinese music, included in the ticket, then another ride to come back to Marina Bay for the beautiful light show. It's best to view the light show from Esplanade, as the light source is from the Marina Bay Sands."
,,Take the Hippo to see it from the bay,4.0,,"The best way to appreciate the architectural madness of the ""new"" Singapore is by boat tour of the bay."
,,Wonderful panoramic views,3.0,,Stunning views of Singapore but less than friendly staff/security. Many places are for high paying guests only! bit of a disapointment really. Food at Restaurant was overrated and overpriced.
,,an original structure,5.0,,A definitely must be seen area: the unique structures are impressive. Day time view and night view are both worthy to see.
,,Very nice,4.0,,"I loved the Singapore flyer, the Merlion and the view. Wonderful. Singapore is so green, clean and safe city! Loved it. Of course there were lots of tourists, so it was hard to get a cleand shot."
,,What a Place !!!!,5.0,,"Amazing shops, almost all high-end brands are there, name it !!! You can walk along the river, do not miss the light show at night, it's free anyway. There are several restaurants to choose from. It's worth a visit."
,,Has all the best of what ASEAN has to offer,5.0,,"Other ASEAN countries are trembling in their boots as SG can build, and possibly even improve on, what the others naturally posses for their tourism industry. Also, the Universal Studios right beside it just made all contenders give up."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"What an amazing place! We went just as the shopping mall was open for business so not all shops had opened yet, it was over the top and amazing. A great change from bumming around the usual backpacker haunts!"
,,Marina Bay Boat ride,5.0,,We took the package deal of Marina Bay boat and Bus Tour. Worth the price since can get on and off the bus all day long and different stops. With these two rides you can see all of Singapore in one day.
,,Wonderful city,5.0,,"Marina Bay - where to start! This city is full of amazing places and people but Marina Bay is just awesome. Walk along the Singapore River from around Clarke Quay area, past the Raffles landing site and the Asian Civilisation Museum, over the Cavanagh Bridge, through the gardens of the giant Fullerton Hotel and through the underpass to the Merlions. Get some snapshots by these famous Singaporean landmarks and take in the breathtaking vista of Marina Bay in all its glory. Surrounded by towering banking giants and the amazing Skypark with it's hotel complex, casino and shopping heaven. Pay the twenty dollars entry fee and take the ear-popping lift ride to the viewing deck at the top of the hotel and Spend all day in wonder!"
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"One of the best places I've ever visited. Lots of shops and a great 7-star hotel. If you want to taste what a deluxe lifestyle is, don' skip this area of Singapore."
,,Nice walk,4.0,,nice area to relax after a long day at work or sightseeing - try the restaurants with terraces facing the bay
,,Marina Bay Rooftop,5.0,,"It cost $20.00 but was well worth it. Take the Metro to get there. The view when you reach the top of the Sands is stunning. Singapore 360 degrees lays below you. If I only didi one thing in Singapore, I believe this would have to be it. You are able to look on all the highlights of the city. Iwould do it early in a trip - it gives you a good perspective for your trip. PS; the lighting show at night on the bay is not worth the time. It is dull and you can not hear the audio across the bay."
,,Great time !,5.0,,"It was really a great moment in my life ! Difficult to describe this visit, just do it !! Several times during the day, it is possible to have a ""sand sky park tour"" for the same price. In the morning, it was at 10 ... I don't remember the others possibilities... The tour permits us to enter in the ""garden"" of the hotel, and it is possible to see the swimming pool. It was a special time in my life..."
,,Where futuristic design meets a hint of older world charm,4.0,,"There is something almost out of this world (especially for a photographer) about this place. Once you cross the bridge and walk towards the park, there are singularly futuristic buildings cohabiting with water features and, in the summertime, beautiful flowers. (And naturally, that boat on top of tall buildings).

This is a great vantage point to see Singapore differently. Walk to the left and you'll get sights on the merry-go-round and hints of skyline. An interesting walk in a world where futuristic design meets a hint of romance in the form of the Ferris wheel spotted behind a horizon line decorated by flowers, reminders of an older-world charm."
,,a must in singapore,4.0,,"take a picture with merlion, the durian fruit that is a coliseum and museum, and end up in the marina bay sands, have lunch and a drink at the food court and i guess a lot of window shopping since everything is expensive there."
,,A bit scary at the top,5.0,,"We struggled to find the entrance which is downstairs in the third tower of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, but the experience on the whole was very good. It's quite scary thinking about the fact that you are overhanging from such a height but the views are spectacular on a night with Singapore all lit up for you. Quite beautiful with plenty of time to take photos etc and you can even have a drink and something to eat if you want. Well worth it."
,,Feast for the eyes,3.0,,"What a marvel of architecture and lots of things to see, but really only a feast for the eye and nothing more. Good spot for photos."
,,A view from the top,4.0,,The best to see more of Singapore city is from the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The view is breathtaking! I enjoyed strolling inside the Marina Bay Sands Mall & seeing a canoe inside reminds me of Venice. Must see!
,,fantastic,5.0,,"beautiful reclamation of sea, with wonderful restaurants, and a bum boat ride is a must, 40 minutes at SGD18"
,,So much to see and do just walking around,4.0,,"The development of the Marina Bay area is amazing and if you have time, take the MRT train and then walk and enjoy the gardens, the shops, the food. Its all there and it is so clean and spacious."
,,"Pure Decadence, amazing design and art work.",5.0,,"There is debate about wether this building has ruined the Singapore skyline as it is separated from the rest of Singapore. In my opinion it is a fantastically designed building. I have managed to go to the theatre, which for views and acoustics was spot on. I managed to walk around on the art work tour spotting the amazing sculptures by artists such as Anthony Gormley. I have eaten drank and shopped and felt like a man living the high life. It is truly a phenomenal place."
,,A lot to do,5.0,,"They build so fast! Last year this area had nothing now there is a lot to do and see. The Gardens by the Sea is very interesting and make sure you stop off at the Marina Bay City Gallery (an information centre) to get the history - very informative.
Could spend the day cruising around here."
,,Unique location,4.0,,Breathtaking views from the Marina Sands Bay up till old post office currently being Fullerton Hotel. Full of families during day and night life in the evenings.
,,Just Spectacular,5.0,,"This is place was beautiful beyond my imagination. The Building, monuments, stadium like structure built across the bay line is breath-taking.
The is the place every visitor- tourist to Singapore should visit. In the evening the views are hundred time better. The Bay area has many things to visit starting from art museum, Singapore Flyer, Huge mall, lion sculpture and many more things.
Boating is also the option, laser light show etc is also their. So it full fun place for family.
It is just fantastic."
,,"Very lively place, amazing architecture, execellent place for idle walk & taste Singapore alive",4.0,,"Very busy, amazing structures around the area, many things to keep one busy & take long walks. Casino keeps the place buzzing. but lot of things to do outdoor with the kids. food court inside the mall offers a range of cheap but tasty food, including Indian vegetarian. the designer shops are very pricey, for shopping go to Orchard road or Vivo city. excellent place to hangout in the eveng. laser light show free of charge on friday nite was amazing. art & science museum can be a good place to explore for art lovers. costly but worth it."
,,Awesome piece of architecture,4.0,,"The place is humunguous, huge but very luxurious.

We paid S$20 to get to the viewing podium at 51/Floor and was lucky that we went in time with the guided tour to the pool area.... we really regret not staying in the hotel as looking at the guests indulging in the infinity pool turned us green with envy. We really promised ourselves to stay next time we visit.

Really awesome."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Nice shopping mall but came there not for the mall but just for the water show. I don't know how does it call but the projector image on the water? Ahhh.. whichever, whatever... What I know and from what I saw that show was excellent. Short time but really amazing. It is like watching a movie in an open-air cinema under the moon and the stars. Sweet...!"
,,Just another Mall,3.0,,"A huge shopping mall, beautifully done, but still just a mall - a male view!
There seemed to be a huge amount of area given over to public space rather than shops which gave it an airy feel.
Includes a skating rink to keep the kids busy and also rivers within the building offering gondola trips (out to the harbour, I think)."
,,Looks great,4.0,,"Walked around Marina Bay and the architecture of the entire area looks fantastic; plenty of posh boutiques, fancy restaurants and big hotels, very hoity toity if that's your cuppa tea. Hang around 7ish-8pm for the light show"
,,pwoerful B burger,5.0,,"the foie gras in the middle is a piece of heaven in your mouth, the parmesan bun is perfect and the meat flavorful and juicy"
,,Architectural marvel!,4.0,,"This is one of the WOW places to visit in Singapore,the top floor is breathtaking and offer the view of the city especially unique at night,this is also a place you only want to see once"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"With its great views of the city skyline, the Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay is great place to visit during the day but even better at night when the light show starts.

There are lots of good places to eat outside. Queue up at a busy stall and you won't go wrong."
,,unique place to be with...,4.0,,"It is a new Shopping complex with all the famous brand name, restaurants, casino & a 5 star Hotel. all are situated in one place including a big convention hall and a nice small stream in the middle of the complex and more convenient for you because you can reach their by MRT BayFront Line."
,,Spectacular Night-lights,5.0,,"Wow Marina Bay Night-lights on the hour (7-12pm) is really something to see! Musical fountains paired with dazzling lights in the air and onto buildings, makes this a MUST SEE!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Marina bay is a great location, worth a walk around, take in the atmosphere and the interesting things happening in the bay, just to sit and enjoy the location"
,,Could use some shaded areas,4.0,,"It is all a bit ""Singapore"". You know, man made. But worth a look or take a water taxi tour to stay out of the heat. The rail network is still a bit lacking in this area but it will extend further in the future."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Amazing architecture. Liked it from distance and even more when walking through the complex. Did not go up for the view. The gardens are gorgeous and well organized into areas like Chinese gdn, Indian, etc. all well described. Incredibly free admission and well worth the visit."
,,Best Light Show,5.0,,"What a fantastic show, using light and water it is out of this world. A real spectacle it is worth going to Singapore just for this show, don't miss it 7.45pm and 9.30pm every night."
,,Casino,3.0,,"Walking there we got to see different singapore highlights such as the Singapore flyer, and the skyline, but I did not get to go inside as we failed to bring our passport although we had a copy they did not accept. Our originals were in our hotel safe!"
,,"Super building, super views!",5.0,,Must visit in Singapore! It takes your breath even from outside! Being on the top - one of the best experiences!
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"I stayed at the MBS so naturally explored the Maina Bay area. I recommend to try Clark Quay in the evening for a good variety of music, food and fun."
,,great scenery,5.0,,"awesome architectural work. This is one of the most attractive places to see in Singapore. I wonder how many years has the building been built. Anyway, it looks really awesome."
,,So much to see,5.0,,This area could easily take up a few days of a trip with the sightseeing alone. Some of the best spots including Raffles and Fullerton hotel for tradition then Merlion park onto the Flyer and Marina Bay Sands hotel and shopping centre which has a roller-rink inside. Word of warning do not take a rickshaw ride. They are a rip-off. They fix a price then at the destination tell you it is per person and double it. This was the only down-side of the whole trip.
,,ITB Asia 2012,5.0,,"I came here attending ITB Asia 2012 in Marina Bay Sands. I also visited The Shoppes In Marina Bay and its casino, a big one."
,,Nice hotel,4.0,,"Large shopping mall right next to the hotel, Casino in the hotel, and right next to Gardens by the Bay, but go early or late when the sun is low in the sky and bring a hat. It was really hot at 1pm."
,,Good Day shopping,5.0,,We went to see Nutcracker on ice - and spent the day at marina Bay and at the shopping centre - super and well worth it if you are there to shop - which we were - as we live in Saigon and the shopping in Saigon is not great. So its a good place to spend the day...*s*
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"This bay is just simply gorgeous, so much to do and see. If you get too hot outside, you can duck into the shopping complex to cool off. There is even an ice skating rink in the shopping complex.
It is a very relaxing place to be."
,,Interesting architecture,4.0,,A walk around the Marina Bay area has to be a must-do in Singapore. We got to the Merlion at One Fullerton around 6pm on a Saturday and started a leisurely walk towards Marina Bay Sands stopping at the interesting Esplanade Theaters on the Bay. The rooftop access at Theaters on the Bay is free and affords pretty good views of the bay but I believe that most people don't know about it because it was quite empty when we visited whereas the Merlion park was full of people crowding to get photos of Marina Bay Sands. We walked through the helix bridge towards the interesting Art Science Museum building and then on to Event Plaza in front of Marina Bay Sands which is supposed to be the best vantage point for the free laser light show at 8pm. The light show was quite good and we just couldn't believe that they do such a spectacular show every day.
,,Breakfast in the lobby,5.0,,"Brilliant breakfast - everything you could possibly imagine. Attentive staff, great coffee, highly recommended."
,,Marina Bay Singapore,5.0,,The lush garden along the sea front and the mall at the Marina Sands Hotel which has great restaurants and shops
,,Beautiful by Night,5.0,,"The light show at Marina Bay was amazing, bubbles and everything. Very clean and pretty place by night."
,,Very good to take pics and pass time,4.0,,"Very good to take pics and pass time, but when it rains, you may get disapointed, so btter have alternative plans"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Encapsulates Singapore. Calming but striking. Definitely worth a stop on the metro line to gaze at the towering building and mer-lion
,,The view that everyone wants to soak in these days...,5.0,,The marina bay area has changed quite a fair bit over the past 5 years and now offers many a view to soak in over drinks or a meal or just trigger happy photographers. It has become pretty much a must-visit for tourists nowadays.
,,The Place To Be,5.0,,I visited Marina Bay several times during my stay. The nightly laser show is spectacular and should be viewed from both near (for the water spray images) and from afar for the lasers. There are several good places to dine and the complex is a wonderful way to access the Gardens by the Bay.
,,Awesome building,5.0,,"It's an awesome and incredible building, It would be an exciting experience to go to the roof to enjoy the wonderful view, but the downside is ticket is a bit expensive. The hotel has the impressive roof-top swimming pool in Singapore."
,,Laser Show,5.0,,Go for laser show 8:00 P.M. Singapore has perefected the art laser show on water. Good sound effects aswell. So after a hectic day of shopping chill out while getting wonderful view aswell
,,Just like the pictures,5.0,,"This is quite the complex. The building is awsome and the grounds around it, the bridge leading around to it are fabulous. Buy the ticket and go to the top area that is open to the public. The view is extraordinary and the bar has spot for you to enjoy a beverage."
,,Usual tourist attraction..,5.0,,kind of a must do when in singapore. nothing spectacular but the restaurants in the area have very good views of the marina (and the Merlion).
,,Marina Bay is excellent place to hangout at night..the Casino is just amazing.,5.0,,Marina Bay is excellent place to hangout at night..the Casino is just amazing..................................................
,,What a view,5.0,,Was a bit concerned due to hight but once up and walking around not a concern.Just worth the trip to view all of Singapore from this hight.
,,Expensive yet worth it,4.0,,"Although the entry ticket is expensive, yet with the excellent city skyline views and Singapore flyer views just next to it, it was worth spending the money.
High speed lift takes you to 56th floor in a blink of an eye.
Roof Top bar is good, ample provisions for photography, only thing I did not like was the security guy did not allow me to use the Tripod for camera, sighting security reasons (Security breach with a Tripod !!!)
Any hows still worth a visit !!"
,,Super Modern World,5.0,,"Dazzling, lively,Vibrant, exquisite, entertaining and fun. These are the words came to my mind when I went to Marina Bay. People were free and relaxing with all the time in hand. Relaxing in the garden or enjoying shopping in the expensive well decorated malls, devouring in the well known restaurants. I loved the 'Laser Beam' show on the river. What a spectacular performance. The Marina Bay pulled me there twice to see the spectacle show, the lightnings at night, the giant hotels, the ship on top of building and the decor. It is full of fun place."
,,Awesome Place,5.0,,I visited Marina Bay and wat n amazing place this is. I really love this place. Me and my friends enjoyed a lot there. The casino's are very nice. we enjoyed a lot.
,,Must-see place,4.0,,"Just some minutes for a walk to come here , take some photos and look the beautiful lights at night was so amazing. Don't forget to drink and cheers!!!"
,,Take a stroll and soak in the sights.,4.0,,"Stroll along the promenade late in the afternoon and you will find tourist, office workers and shoppers mingling in the bars and restaurants. Centrally located, this is a great spot to spend your late afternoon after a day of sightseeing and shopping. Take a few snaps along the promenade just as the sunsets, and then stroll along to the shopping centre to check out some souvenirs。Stop for a bite at the food market which features some of Singapore’s famous dishes. After the meal you'll find the office workers have all changed out of their suits and into their jogging gear. If you follow their path, you'll eventually make it to the famous Marina Bay Sands! Worth the visit if you’re on a budget, plenty to see and do without costing too much."
,,Best Night View,5.0,,You will get to see the Best night view of Singapore at Marina Bay. There are also very nice restaurant around the area. A very good place for couples to hangout together.
,,Must do,4.0,,It dominates the singapore skyline at every angle and something we had to do on visiting singapore. Visit was expensive for family of 5 but sipping a drink in sky bar very memorable!!
,,Wonderful first day experience in Singapore!,4.0,,"Took a ride on the river cruise in the evening, so instead of a guide's commentary, we had a lady playing music and were taken around the Marina Bay area where slowly the lights came on and you are in the midst of a most spectacular setting with high, gleaming buildings, cafes, music and a general good vibe. Great to do on your first evening in Singapore!"
,,very exciting,5.0,,"The area is spectacular. I suggest yo go there late afternoon and walk around in daylight, grab a meal and re-walk it at night when it is all lit up. Beautiful architechture and lots to see."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,Great place to people watch and have a bite to eat. Also great for watcvhing the laser show from Marina Bay Sands Hotel at night at either 8:00pm or 9:15pm each night
,,Incredible buildings,4.0,,If you get a bum boat ride around the Bay and up the canals you can see the incredible architecture around Marina Bay.
,,Lotus at Museum Art Science,5.0,,"A nice place to eat, shop and walking by. Very easy to be visited by bus, taxi and MRT. Stop at Bay Front MRT Station. Also the Casino is a very big Casino and cosy."
,,Very impressive,4.0,,"You can't fail to be impressed by the interesting modern architecture here. The area is obviously meant to showcase Singapore, and we did enjoy walking around. However, it is by no means all Singapore has to offer, and we felt that there is more colour, life and character to be found elsewhere on the island."
,,Strolling,4.0,,Wonderful views and delightful at night. Just walk round the area and soak uop the sights. The skyline is terrific and one feels the heart of Singapore beating around one.
,,excellect view on a stunning building,5.0,,"staff explained the ticket system and cost, drinks at the top were great too. if planned well you can go to the pool section to look but at 9am,2pm and 9pm limited to the first 50 people first come first serve. lunch or dinner to really treat your self"
,,Night scenery is good,4.0,,"They have casinos there, as well as tourist spots like garden by the bay, singapore flyer are all nearby"
,,Wow! Engineering Marvel,5.0,,You have to see this magnificent hotel - it is amazing. Even better are the Gardens by the Bay you can walk to.
,,Breathtaking water show and view,4.0,,"We went there on our second night in Singapore for the Water Show. The seating area was very clean and organised. People were already seated when we arrived (the show start at 8pm and we arrived around that time). And once the show started, everyone was taking it in with smiles on their face and in awe. It surely relaxed your mind after a day of walking and exploring Singapore.

We took the river cruise the next day and the view of Marina Bay is just awesome. Will surely come back. =)"
,,Singapore does Sydney,5.0,,"It's really a massive lagoon to close it to shipping, so it has a floating football pitch/ venue for performing arts, a carnival atmoshere pervades even on a ewt September day"
,,A Nice Free Show,4.0,,"I read this show from the internet.
I tried to imagine what kind of show this was.
We rushed there, no very difficult to find after asking direction to some people.
The show only showed 2 times a day.
We waited, then I have to say this was nice to great.
The high tech state of the art combining the computer controlled water spray, laser and music made this show worthed watching.

Tips for the one who would like to see the show.
Make sure that the weather was allowing, otherwise they could cancel this show.
Be there earlier so you could get a better view seat, since this was a free show.

Even this was a good show, maybe for some people they would not come there to see again, since the second visit would be too ordinary."
,,Well worth the taxi fare there,5.0,,"The gardens and the resort are magical - well worth the expense to get into the sky garden, the rainforest dome and the flower dome - do it!"
,,Take a ride,4.0,,"When you are in Singapore you must see Marina Bay on the River Taxi.The night time trip was specially good because the riverbanks are alive with people enjoying the attractions.The Merlion is spectacular all lit up, as is the Marina Bay Hotel complex.If you time it right you can enjoy watching the free laser show at Marina Bay Sands from the water as we did.It was magical."
,,Breathtaking views and architecture,4.0,,Great architecture. High end shopping. The nightly light & water show is all right compared to Disney's Adventureland show. But it's free so no complaint.
,,Over hyped,3.0,,"Marina Bay is quite pleasant and nice- the night view of the structure (hotel) itself is amazing however inside Marina Bay ( Casino, mall etc) it is not so impressive.

I would not be able to distinguish it from any other metropolis mall in Asia. The food court though varied and vast, was over priced and average quality.

The ""canal"" and ""gondola"" ride was atrocious, I am glad i did not take it, the route it very short easily done in less than 10 minutes and simply goes up the mall and back down.

The mall itself would be great for any designer lovers, but again nothing you cant get anywhere else.

The casino is okay, foreigners must bring Passport ID to gain free entry, no cameras are allowed. The casino is mostly high stake starting from $50 minimum bets. The design overall is not impressive especially if one has been to Macau before.

Overall I love the night view of Marina bay but i feel like it has been overrated- maybe this is why I was disappointed as I arrived with too much expectations.

I did not, however go to the Gardens, though this I have heard is beautiful."
,,Breath Taking,5.0,,"Great view for the landscape. Its only SDG20.00 to enjoy the magnificent view.
I found the souvenirs selection is few and outdated. Key chains/magnets/pens as such is everywhere. Sizes on T-Shirts are far too small (asian size I assumed) for foreigners.
Have something small in consideration of weight for tourists."
,,Bum Boats,4.0,,Marina Bay is a nice boat ride and gives you a good look at the variation iin the traditional and alsot he ultra tech such as the 'floating ship' building. Get to see the Merlion and the Singapore Flyer to decide if you want to try it!
,,what's there not to like,5.0,,"casino, shops, food, there's everything here. there's also a laser show at night! Would recommend for all to just come by to take a look"
,,marina bay wandering,5.0,,"marina bay has great views of the sands bay hotel and of the river and city skyline, big high end shopping centre and food court"
,,Exciting,4.0,,Check out the gardens brilliant!They are quite close but go has early has possible gets hot.The shopping malls are plentful.
,,Need more shelter,3.0,,was nice walking around the bay and there was the marina bay sands. But lots of expensive food places and there's no shelter lining the bay so be prepared to brave the Singapore heat
,,walk and view,5.0,,Marina Bay was great for walking and seeing the city Skyline. Lots of shops and restaurants. We did the full walking loop which is 2mi or 3.5km at night. It was beautiful and safe.
,,"At night time, the best view in Singapore!",5.0,,"Marina Bay is just gorgeous. The view from the bandstand is wonderful, as is the one from the Fullerton Bay Hotel's rooftop bar - The Lantern. For me, this really is Singapore at its best. Lots of places to eat and drink too."
,,A must see!,5.0,,This is an absolutly must see for Singapore! If you have the luck to find a relativly low priced room then book it! The pool is awesome! Even if you can't afford one night then just go up to plattform and have a view on Singapore!
,,First time to be in Marina Bay,5.0,,The entire bay area is one of the best sights I've seen in Singapore. Solo backpacking was fun! Try to visit the area in the morning and come back in the evening for the Light and Water show!
,,Outstanding,5.0,,The Marina Bay is a lovely place and the Marina Bay hotel is something that is a must see. The total area is breathtaking and a visit is necessary
,,Great light show,4.0,,"We spent one evening at the Marina Bay Sands, enjoying the sights, the atmosphere and the harbor. The light show on the water was interesting and different to anything we've seen before. We had dinner at the food court under the MBS, it was great too."
,,Great views of Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing Hotel, very grand, clean and modern. The bar at the observation deck on the top floor was very expensive but well worth it."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"We were only able to go to the casino at Marina Bay Sands because that night we were there, it was raining extra hard. but looking at the place as we passed by in a taxi, it's the place to be and the place to go back to."
,,Amazing,4.0,,AN interesting building however to head up to the observation platform for non-guests costs $20. Shopping arcade is great for a look around however it is all luxury brand shops so make sure you have plenty of cash.
,,exciting,5.0,,"Many places to visit in the area, the flyer, art gallery, large shopping mall with ice rink inside, restaurants and just places to sit and admire the views from skyscrapers to green areas, a must to visit"
,,One of the best night views on Earth!,5.0,,"The architecture of Marina Bay Sands, Helix Bridge, Esplanade and Fullerton Hotel are amazing. At night, when the lights are lit, the whole place turns to an eye-candy."
,,Nice Time,4.0,,"We spent a nice afternoon experiencing the sights of this large complex. We had lunch at the food court which was surprisingly very reasonable for such an upscale facility. Although many of the shops were very upscale brands, we never felt out of place. We enjoyed a relaxing couple of hours taking in the sights."
,,Futuristic,5.0,,"The whole Marina Bay area from the Flyer to the Helix to Marina Bay Sands to the Gardens by the Bay loomed very futuristic and modern. It felt like I was in some movie depicting a ""future"" city!"
,,A must see!,5.0,,"Stopped through the marina on an evening free tour through the airport. It's so lovely and at night when the lights are lit the buildings are so spectacular! So clean so beautiful, highly recommended!"
,,Too expensive to get to the top,4.0,,"Ok, so the views are impressive, but $20 to get to the top for a look is a little pricey. Do it once and then save your money for the Singapore Flyer because the views are better ffrom there."
,,lovely walking area,4.0,,"always lots going on, i love the area to walk around with the water close by, happy couples strolling around, lots of nice cafes."
,,Ultimate time,5.0,,"We had a great time near the Marina bay area...All the things like, Marina Bay sands sly park, the laser show, the river cruise in the evening, the evening views were just breathtaking..."
,,Great area! Lots to see & great views,4.0,,We just walked around people watching and catching the feel of the area. The architecture is amazing -- the helix bridge was interesting -- the bay is beautiful - the ice skating rink in the mall was a hoot! But it is indeed HOT. Be sure you have plenty of water.
,,Magical Bay,5.0,,"What a fantastic sight! OK, man made but see the Bay at night and be astounded! Lights galore, boats traversing the Bay and lovely places to wine and dine. Great!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"A very nice place, with an amezing view and you have to go on the terrace of the boat-shaped hotel because you will see all Singapore I am sure you will enjoy this and if you want to be more romantic you can go at the sunset."
,,Great way to spend a day,4.0,,"Put Marina Bay on your must do in Singapore list! Spent a great couple of hours at the gardens and then discovered KuDeTa bar a top of the Marina Sands, the view is sensational the staff were great fun and the sangrias we didn't stop at one lets just say."
,,Beautiful gardens and view of the bay,5.0,,We walked around the Singapore Flyer area and then over the foot bridge to the shopping mall on the river. Paid and took elevator to the Skypark ($20 each) atop the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Beautiful views day and night. Food is available but VERY pricey so take sandwiches. $148 each for dinner at KU-DE-TA at the Skypark.
,,A signature skyline over the Bay......,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a walker’s paradise with a signature skyline that encompasses bold, modern, unique and heritage architecture with some stunning public sculptural art. This area has a new identity and is continuing to grow without containment – but that’s Singapore right now!

As we strolled along the promenade it loops around many attractions, museums and the beautiful Bay. It’s not a hard ‘stroll’ but in the heat we had sensible walking shoes on. In the area are several Malls – City Link, Esplanade, Marina Bay Link, Marina Square Suntec City, Raffles City and the affluent retail outlets at Marina Bay Sands.

It took us the better part of the day and night and it was helped with a few ‘quiet' times eating at the many restaurant and cafes. There are some lovely alfresco establishments along the esplanade and would be so beautiful by night.

High on any visitor’s agenda at the Bay is the quintessential Merlion or simply a great photo shot of ‘that' iconic hotel - Marina Bay Sands! The area is open for everyone to see it from this vantage point and to get an unobstructed shot of this set of ‘cricket stumps’ However, what a building and we could see people wandering across the top of the hotel looking back at the crowds looking at them!

Enjoy your experience!"
,,Beautiful night time view,5.0,,walk about the harbour on the promenade. Eat at any number of local eateries. Watch the lights of the harbour. An enjoyable visit for the senses.
,,Good Food court,4.0,,There is a food court there with a variety of food and it is cheap for the budget traveller. Not everything is expensive at Marina Bay. There are expensive shops at Marina Bay but then there is the cheap food court.
,,Great at night time,4.0,,"An abundance of seafood restaurants, sit outside and watch the nighttime laser show. Easy stroll around the esplanade."
,,Marina Bay Laser Light Show,5.0,,words cant describe the light show. 20 mins of unbelievable. a must see on as many nights as possible in singapore. ate in the food court beforehand. best meal i have had in forever and it was SGD8. 10 out of 10
,,Worth the price! Be there at 8,4.0,,"The admission ticket for the rooftop cost SGD 20, I will not say it's cheap but with comparing with the view I think it's worth every penny. I went there at night, right after the laser show ended. So it's too bad that we missed the laser show, I bet it would be amazing. The staff said that the show started at 8, but we're there at 8.20 so MAYBE the show was just 10 - 15 minutes. After all, we really glad that we went to the rooftop."
,,Better to visit at night,5.0,,"Started our trip early in the afternoon, the weather was too hot to enjoy enough. So walked around until nightfall and found the place to be magical and romantic near the water. mazing that you can be so close to the water, walk along to Clark Key for dinner, but careful if ordering crab or lobster upon weight as we nearly ended up paying £300 without doing the calculations beforehand."
,,amazing at night with lights on,5.0,,"It's very nice both day and night, but we found it to be simply spectacular at night with all the lights on. For those how likes modern architecture - good place, many interesting buildings."
,,Active Marina Bay,5.0,,We traveled by water taxi many time while in Singapore. We found the trips relaxing and beatuful(especially at night). We went to restaurants and lots sight seeing. There is a sailing school which is always practicing on the bay and makes for a very active area.
,,Beautiful sightseeing.,5.0,,"It's worth for S$20/pax for visiting. But one thing I don't like is they take picture for free, but ask you to pay $45 for taking it. it includes a white leather frame and a CD. It's crazy to pay $45 for it!"
,,Good little shoping trip/check out the bus to KL,4.0,,"Lots to do and see, lots to buy and a good choice of everything: if you want to visit Kuala Lumpar from here then this is the place to book the best coach company EVER, being Aero Line: the coaches are amazing, the attendants are brilliant, it is like flying first class (the seats recline right down, there is food on board, videos in all the seats with an amazing choice of films) and even a lounge area downstairs!!...I cannot sing their praises enough!! Around £15 to get to KL and well worth it with this company!"
,,A spectacular sight,4.0,,I don't believe it's possible to tire of looking at Marina Bay Sands. The key is to mix up the locations you view it from and the Bay itself has an array of places to choose from. A good selection of after work drinking spots and always impresses visitors travelling over.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Went in during our stopover in Singapore this place was filled with restaurants the view from the top is amazing didn't go into the pool but did see it im planning my next visit already
,,Lots of walking and it's hot,4.0,,"The places to eat and shop around the bay are fantastic. If you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands, make sure you go to the other side of the bay to watch the light shows MBS puts on at night."
,,Fantastic piece of architecture,5.0,,"Great place to wander around, shopping, eating - even better if we could have stayed there. Theres high end shopping on higher levels, and general shopping on lower levels, museum and entertainment complex all around ie skating arena, casino. Well worth the look."
,,Amazing Buildings,5.0,,"you can't come to Singapore without visiting this complex. The buildings are amazing- great view of the CBD across the bay, free laser shows every night. High-end shopping and the food is not cheap but you've got to come and see it all ."
,,Lunch in the Chinatown,5.0,,Great area to have lunch to experience great variety of food after exploring of the beautiful city. Many attractions to explore by walking around. Easy access by metro.
,,Must not be missed,5.0,,If possible try and walk around the mariana and / or take a boat trip to get a different perspective. A trip to the top of the hotel is a must - Spectacular views.
,,Great View!,4.0,,"A great view of the bay area, the Marina Bay Sands and the sky line of Singapore! Merlion Park, Marina Square shopping mall are all within walking distance. Further walks will lead you to Fort Canning hills."
,,Definitely good place to hangaround,4.0,,"Nice view, weather, clean, many restaurants by the bay. Good to chill out, having a nice walk along the bay or just sitting outside watching the light show."
,,"Fantastic building, great views",5.0,,"What a beautiful amazing building. We loved it, both inside and outside. Had a wonderful lunch on the top floor. The food was fantastic, price quite reasonable considering the quality of the food and the views from our table. Singapore at its very best."
,,This place oozes money….,5.0,,"The shopping Centre is so high end that most human beings would not be able to afford any of it unless you won big bucks at the casino. The Casino can not be entered by aliens unless you have your passport on hand, (take note!). There will be no money laundering or shenanigans in Singapore Casinos trust me….great venue.."
,,Choose time and place carefully,4.0,,"No question the view is great and if you're here for a few days you should do it. Here's how.

The way up to Kudeta (the bar) is through the back of the hotel lobby (you're going up the middle of the three towers). Best thing to do is go around 6 to 6:30pm. That way you avoid the cover charge. Buy yourself one drink and sip it slowly: you watch the sun go down and the view change to the nighttime one. Singapore has a striking modern skyline even though the CBD is small compared to (say) New York, so you'll get some good pictures.

Once the sun has set, get yourself around the other side of the bay by the Fullerton Bay Hotel and the quay where the riverboats depart. From here you can watch the 8pm (or 9pm) light show: you won't see it if you try to watch from Kudeta."
,,awesome,4.0,,Nice place but marina bay gardens entrance fees is costly. Went to gardens by the bay instead. It located opposite marina bay sands and it is very nice. I managed to walk around for 2 hours due to time contraint and the weather.
,,Skypark at Night,3.0,,i think we should have gone earlier in the day to really enjoy the view and to take better pictures of the view. we signed up for the 9pm tour. the advantage is they let you in the infinity pool area so you can take pictures:)
,,Lovely place to visit,5.0,,"We spent a couple of hours wandering around here, it was so peaceful even though there were quite a lot of people wandering around as well. Looking out over the bay at the Merlion, watching the whirlpool fountain and seeing all the beautiful buildings was certainly and experience not to be missed."
,,Love it!,4.0,,"so much to do down there and it's all so handy. From the great shopping at the Marina Bay Mall, to the wonderful entertainment areas, and ease of access to the waterfront area generally. This is one of my favourite areas in Singapore."
,,"Nice shops, good restaurants....",4.0,,"I think Marina Bay is worth to see and also with the celebrity chef restaurants (Puck, Batalli, Bouloud) İ think it woul be a nice day to walk around the shops and have lunch there."
,,"Superb attraction, worth seeing",5.0,,"The Marina Bay area in Singapore is superb, the views are excellent in the morning and even better at night. Make sure to visit the hotel itself, and the mall area which features several high-end shops."
,,Light show,5.0,,It was worth watching it was fantastic great for any age A must see in singapore they were on at 8pm and 9.30pm
,,It is a very relaxing and beautiful place - heart of the city,5.0,,"I stayed 5 days in Singapore. Almost every day I have visited Marina Bay and sorrounding neighborhood. We, 2 couples, like it very much due to its amazing places: you are captive trough very tall buildings, belonging to various corporations. Many local and expats are making jogging near you, some of tourist are walking, some of the sitting o the terraces, etc.
It's for sure, the part for Singapore, which will kept in our mindes."
,,Dinning experiences,5.0,,"I loved the variety of food available, but be warned all places we dined at served rather large servings."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed a ""Singapore Duck Tour"" of Marina Bay, also a walk around the area and during one of the evenings the laser light show. this area is spectacular and well worth a wander around"
,,Superb,5.0,,The multimedia show at the Esplanade is a not to be missed! Worth waiting and watching. The sound system and the fountain blends to give the multimedia presentation a nice touch. Like the bubbles at the end of the show.
,,Nice part of the city - great skyline!,4.0,,This is a nice part of the city with great views of the Skyline both day and night - and you can sea the Merlion too.
,,47th Floor,5.0,,Spent the whole morning walking around the area and visited the Marina Sands Mall. Went up to the 47th storey and views of Singapore well worthwhile. Fully recommend.
,,Eye-catching skyline,4.0,,"Plenty of places to look at (Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer, Merlion), great places to eat nearby."
,,Best site in Singapore!,5.0,,"This is the best site for everyone. Not mentioning the casino, though! Everybody including tourists, local, seniors, & especially family members have to come to enjoy the scenery of Singapore river side view.
-Afternoon time is the best time for us for taking family pictures or videos with boats passing by & the best time to chill and chat with loved ones.
-Night time, even better! Romantic scene to cover the couples love spirit & to enjoy the environment or relieving atmosphere on top of the boat!
- If we have time, we could walk on the ""DNA"" bridge to look & feel that how wonderful Singapore artistic views are: Durian opera house, a sky-high buidings everywhere, the legendary old singapore post office, riverside view, and on the Marina ""Boat"" itself.

All in all, this is the best site in Singapore for chilling & chatting or even having small and simple family picnic by sitting on the tropical pond.

Shoulda come!"
,,A great area,5.0,,"A great place to spend an entire day. Great shopping, viewing the city from the Sands hotel observation deck and many great restaurants. Definitely visit Lau Pa Sat (great hawker center) and the night show in from of the Sand hotel."
,,Light and water show,5.0,,Fantastic shops in marina Bay albeit a bit expensive. lovely sitting on water front having a meal watching light and water show! Never seen anything quite as spectacular.
,,Stumped,5.0,,"For a cricketer this structure looks like 3 wickets with extended bells on the top. Its a masterpiece of modern architecture which has blended feng shui & modern art beautifully. For a tourist visiting the top level where there is infinity pool should be money's worth (there is admission fee), however if you are the hotel guest then literally you will be 'on top of the world (singapore, at least)'"
,,Must see,5.0,,"A nice place, remembered me to Sidney harbour... restaurants, bars... too expensive, indeed. Good contrast with chinese or indian or arabic areas."
,,Lots to do and see,4.0,,"Clean, lots of walks and vegetation. give your self couple of hours here as there is quite a bit to see. Need more directional signs."
,,"Major landmark of Singapore, must see, walk around the bay",4.0,,"It is the heart of the country. Start your walk from the Parliament, then the Merlion Park, walk direction theater, next to the floating football fields. Cross the nice fency bridge and go directly in the Marina Sands shopping mall. Exiting on the other side you will be in the Olympic park. Continue your walk direction financial district. In the park just before that there is some cooling fans that are operated with solar energy :)."
,,Marina Bay Sands & Singapore Flyer,4.0,,"Did both of these and was glad that we did. Went up to the Sky Park at Marina Bay Sands and it is a great view. Had we come back at 2:00pm, we could have gone to the level with the pool but that didn't fit our plans. You can still see the pool from the level we were at. Only guests can use it.

Singapore Flyer was done at night and that complemented the view from the Sky Park that we did during the day."
,,Bay View,5.0,,"Exceptional views, wonderful walks, Lots and lots of restaurants to choose from .Boat trips available, we enjoyed ours. If you time your visit you will see the most amazing dragon boat racing."
,,The absolute must see attractions.,5.0,,"). The absolute must see attractions are the Sands SkyPark, hotel and casino, and the Flowers by the bay area. Both are new and, are as far as I know, unique to Singapore. There are other great attractions but are generally me-tos found in other cities all over the world."
,,Oppulence at its best,4.0,,"The Marina Bay area is full with what I call Singapore life. Malls, tall buildings, crowds and good mood."
,,Don't Miss this..!,5.0,,Definately worth the visit. If you are visiting Singapore you cannot give this place a miss. Lots of amazing pubs and restaurants in the area.
,,Enjoyed it here,4.0,,"Great place to spend time - shopping, eating or walk around the marina bay itself or just marel at the monstrous malls!"
,,Smart but a factory,3.0,,"Not a place to stay if you want a personal experience. Masses of people moving around this colossal building, you are herded to lifts, restaurants, bars etc.

Restaurants are extremely difficult to get reservations, even if you're a guest of the hotel. It's a shopping mall, a casino and a hotel. Staff try and are certainly slick but that simply doesn't make this a pleasant place and not in the least bit relaxing in any shape or form. Even the rooftop pool is a tourist attraction so expect to ""enjoy"" it with 100's of sightseers."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The entire Huge marina bay area is amazing to visit! Being on the Waterfront is a start. Then add a multitude of shops, places to eat, a Casino, a museum AND the astounding Marina Bay Sands hotel area...with its UNMISSABLE Skypark (that costs to visit...but the Views are Marvellous!) Plus, the new botanic gardens are just on the other side of the hotel. So much to see and do in the entire area! Definitely an area to Visit!!"
,,Great range of shops and restaurants,4.0,,"With a broad range of designer shops and trendy restaurants, Marina Bay is definitely a location worth checking out. Some celebrity chef restaurants in there as well and seems like there'd be something for everyone. The thing that puzzled me a bit was how Clarks got a shop in there next to Gucci and Salvatore Ferrogamo!! Also on 20th September 2012, the Ferrari F1 drivers are going to be at the Ferrari store so an opportunity to meet Massa and Alonso, although I guess that'll be pretty busy!!"
,,Flashy,5.0,,The shopping centre is well set out and the food court was excellent. The gondola is a bit much and the casino tacky.
,,The entire area is nice!,5.0,,Road construction made it a bit tricky to navigate by foot through the area but fun to see especially at night!
,,Great walk,4.0,,The walk from the old town towards the Marina Bay is great value. The Marina Bay is posh but nice to walk and sit on a couch and watching people passing by. The information center is really interesting to visit.
,,Excellent to walk around,5.0,,"Car park rate is reasonable at $0.06 per minute. Nice view once you walk out from the open car park. For ladies, enjoy shopping for the whole afternoon, night music fountain at 8pm and 9:30pm."
,,Great visit,4.0,,Good experience for my twins. Very neat and clean. Great atmosphere at restaurant It can get pretty busy though.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Great light show every evening at 8pm. Wonderful, must see!! Fantastic shopping area if you like all the brands and also a ice skating rink and a boat ride within shopping centre"
,,Superb view!,4.0,,"Have a walk at the evening, you will see a great view! All the skyscrapers ( the financial districts) also the architecture of Marina Bay Sands and the surrounding of Marina Bay. That would be a great experience!"
,,Impressive display of man power,4.0,,"The whole area being on reclaimed land, it's amazing to see how the buildings around the bay dominates Singapore skyline when most of it wasn't even in existence 10 years ago."
,,High flyers,4.0,,"Very extensive area of shopping malls, events areas, casino, hotels etc etc the list seems endless.
As a combined destination this is a must. Being under cover will also help during those inclement periods. Should be something to cover most peoples tastes. The views from Skypark are amazing and are definitely a 'must do'"
,,Plesant place to be,4.0,,"Marina bay was a nice area and being able to look over the water added to the atmosphere.
It had the buzz that I found throughout Singapore and was as clean as the rest of the country also.
I did not find anything spectacular about Marina Bay more so than anywhere else, but the light show added something a little extra to see although nothing to rave about again."
,,Great place to dine and be entertained,5.0,,"Marina Bay has the Clarke Quay (great bars, music, dining, atmosphere), Boat Quay (dining, atmosphere), Marina Bay Sands Hotel (super casino, bar and garden on roof a must), Bay Garden (under two domes has 183 hectares of great sights). Getting home by cab between 10 pm and midnight (anywhere in Singapore) is difficult. Don't know where they all go but there are never enough cabs to go around"
,,refreshing area,4.0,,"Wow, wow, wow, amazed at the veiw. standing in the middle of the bridge and felt the connection to every single building around."
,,Excellent area and buildings,5.0,,"The buildings, the docks, the atmosphere and the restaurants along the river near Marina Bay. A good day to spend there."
,,"Dining, Shopping and City Viewing",4.0,,"NIce place to dine in and shop around. Best city vista is from the deck of KUDETA restaurant. THe cost of food is pricey though - around S$120 to S$150 per person (around US$100 per pax).

Nice water show around 9pm and 11pm. You have to see it."
,,Singapore's Newest Icon,5.0,,"Everything in this area was made to be a perfect experience. And it should be.

Marina Bay is one of Singapore's newest proud structures. An interesting one in fact. Just newly built in the previous decade, Marina Bay is now among the country's most visited destination. From afar, the view is just as marvelous. Nearby, there are numerous restaurants, well-designed walkways, structures with modern architectural designs, and lights, lights, lights. Relaxing to visit during the day but more fabulous at night, when everything bursts into life.

One can spend hours here and still not feel bored. Nice place to watch people or to just spend the time away.

Definitely a highly recommended place!"
,,Great views from the top.,5.0,,"The viewing platform was excellent, giving fabulous views over the CBD and bay areas. We could see right over the new botanic gardens layout. Cant wait till its opened. It has a drinks and snacks area with a great view. We stayed and got good photos of the dusk and sunset. It gave us a good appreciation of the size of Singapore, and were impressed by the never ending high rise buildings covering the entire area. The infinity pool at the top looked great. At 8pm there is a laser light show tying in with lighting with the casino and other ground buildings, and music over the bay. The 3 hotels making up the structure were ultra modern and included a casino. Dont miss it."
,,Best place in Singapore,5.0,,"5 Day and night, the best place for a photo shoot in Singapore. Приехав в Сингапур, сразу сюда, то визитная карточка."
,,Feels like a airport terminal.,1.0,,"Horrific. Service at the place is worse than a bus terminal. Save your money andgo elsewhere. If you must go, check out the view then leave. Onlything going for the entire place. What a disapointment considering the enginering marvel that it is."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"it has been wonderfull seek around marina bay sand .it is awesome ,but we do not have that money to stay in the hotel .infinity pool is stunning and largest pools in the world."
,,Modern architecture at its best,5.0,,"I am living in Singapore, and the Marina Bay area is one area I never tire of: You can walk all the way around the Bay, using the helix pedestrian bridge to cross the river.

The Marina Bay Shoppes mall is a refreshing stop if you need to cool down. Recently some more low budget restaurants opened on the lower floors, so you are no longer depending on the overcrowded food court alone if you want to eat budget food.

The exhibitions in the ArtScience museum are very good, and the exterior of the building is very pretty.

There are a few cool gadgets on your trip around the bay like some umbrella constructions with fans that will start working when you move under them, a mist walk and the glass bowl in front of the mall that allows you to whisper to someone who is at the other side and be perfectly understandable. The helix bridge has viewing platforms, and from there you have a very good view over the area's skyline.

There is a Starbuck with a large outside terrace on the walking board near the Fullerton hotel: from there you have a perfect view over the iconic casino and the ArtScience museum. At that side of the bay there are also free concerts on weekend nights.

There is a light show around 8 pm that is worth seeing. There are some specially build stairs in front of the shopping mall that allow you to sit down and enjoy the show.

An alternative to visiting the casino roof is having a drink at 'Level 33' in tower one of the Marina Bay Financial Centre. This is a bar (on the 33th level) with a large outdoor terrace overlooking the bay. Drinks are not cheap, but the view is spectacular."
,,Have a drink in Marina Bay Sands Bar,5.0,,Have a drink in the bar upstairs for a stunning view. Dress up in something a little nicer (ie not sandals) and they will let you upstairs for free.
,,place to chill and relax,5.0,,"we always go to this place whenever we go to spore, its a great place to hang out and sit around at 7pm just to relax after a long walkabout in singapore. too bad the food court always jam packed and never bother to eat there."
,,World Class Urban Space,5.0,,"This reclaimed part of Singapore has not only added a new, beautiful skyline to the Island but also features Marina Bay Sands which is a development worth a visit. The retail, casino, restaurents and the gardens, every part of the project merit a visit."
,,I was there,3.0,,"You can easily reach here by MRT. There are many many shops . But F1 Store Harley davidson etc open late. We had to wait nearly half an hour to visit these shops. F1 items are cheaper if you buy online.
Officials are very friendly.
But going to the Roof top garden paying sing $20 is a crime. A photo can be taken as u enter the garden at a cost of sing$30 . Not worth at all. By bad luck if u go on a cloudy day u see nothing. No Indonesia No Malaysia

If and When you visit Singapore make it a point to visit Marina Sands. But dont repeat. Not worth he trouble and money"
,,Singapore river cruise interesting!,4.0,,"We took the Singapore river cruise. The audio on the cruise gave us lot of information about the city river side high rise structures, and land marks! The crew seemed to organise people quite well and ensured that people got a good seat and view of the marina- this was excellent.
Overall - great!! Unique experience!!!"
,,What a View!,5.0,,"Go at night. Have a drink on the top floor and examine the view. Its quite a testament to what the Singaporean government has achieved, albeit with a significant dictatorial style! What a contrast to Mayalsia which despite its rich natural resources looks like a developing country, weighed down by religion and waste.

The architecture is also pretty impressive. It is bold, new, tasteful, and expressive. The upscale restaurants are a little pretentious, so if you want to have real Singaporean food take a cab to Lau Pa Sat nearby or one of the many night markets."
,,A must visit place,5.0,,This place has many attractions/places to see. If visit around 4 pm you may avoid the hot and humid time and make your visit so pleasant. Need atleast 2 days to see all the places around Marina bay including the Garden by the bay.
,,Very Scenic,5.0,,"Marina bay is one the best places in singapore for sight seeing. It provides some amazing views. From gardens by the bay to marina bay sands, marina bay area is an ideal tourist destination. There is some pretty good shopping in the area as well as some good restaurants."
,,A visit to Harry Potter's,4.0,,We visited the Arts & Science Museum as there were having a Harry Potter exhibition. Very nice and educational as well.
,,have a good look round,4.0,,Remarkably changed in 2 years. Have a look around. Must go up on top of the marina bay sands (cost_) but well worth it. Wonder around the whole area.Leave a day to just walk around and you can look at most places. its well worth it.
,,Should stay for one. Night to say you have done it!,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands (MBS) has become a Singapore icon. You can go to the top as a visitor but not swim in the pool, so it's worth staying just for that.
Pros: it's a unique experience, it's soooo massive, and you do feel it right from check in, I must say we had very little problems checking In or out, which was a bit of a surprise. The rooms are really lovely and modern with luxurious bathrooms. The pool is a must, even just for the photos, but at times it gets really busy, so it's almost like site seeing in the pool. Room service is fast. The connecting mall is massive with all the designer labels and a fantastic food court that is really inexpensive. The staff are really helpful although you don't really get to meet many.
Cons: it's really massive, so you do somewhat get the feel that you are a tiny cog in a huge service wheel. It's very expensive and was a bit out of our league to stay for any great length.
As I said earlier it's really worth staying for even one night, y can feel the luxury of the place so it was certainly worth it for us!"
,,Interesting Area BUT Still Growing Up,4.0,,"This review in all encompassing of Marina Bay Area. This area is not quite mature yet but boy when it is a tenager watch out. The gardens are very good but not even 50% done. The Sands is done but looking around from the Skypark you can see all th construction going on. They are giving Orchad Street a run for its money and high end stores. There are no bargains to be found though; way upscale for me BUT the place was crowded and people were buying a lot fo expensive stuff.

Want to come back in 2 yrs and see what level it has gone to."
,,good place to shoot foto but so far from central city,4.0,,"far away from central city you must walking very far from MRT but it is nice place to have foto because the place very interesting,"
,,DRums Tao at Marina Sands,5.0,,Drums Tao at Marina Sands was brilliant. Pesto Fettucine at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf sucked. Terribly crowded on a Saturday.
,,A must see place,4.0,,"Marina Bay is where all the activity is. There are lots of Quays where you can take a walk and see all of the amazing structures (bridges, hotels, museums, malls etc) that this city has to offer. Lots of choices for coffee, food, or just hanging out."
,,Not my thing,1.0,,"A disclaimer. I don't like this kind of thing. I don't understand why I would want to fly half way across the world to have the same experience I can in any western country but with some slightly more stupid buildings around me. There are plenty of interesting things to see in Singapore, why you would choose to go to this area is beyond me. However, plenty of people seem to enjoy it."
,,Very Cool,4.0,,"The views were really nice and we got some really good pictures, especially at night. I recommend coming for the night view; you won't be disappointed. We went to the Arts & Science Museum for the Harry Potter Exhibit which was alright. Shopping in the area is too expensive but the food court was really nice!"
,,Look at it once.,3.0,,"Lookout on top: Nice but too pricy. No shadow, no possibility to sit down. So if you're really interested in the view from up there: Book a night at the hotel and hang around in the pool. The casino is impressing."
,,Beautiful Modern Gardens,5.0,,Make sure you take a walk around Gardens at the Bay. Very quirky and peaceful not far from the hustle and bustle of Singapore City life. Take the time to go into the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome. But remember to take a jacket as the Singaporeans LOVE the aircon!
,,This is an amazing place to see around,4.0,,I am always in awe when I visit Marina Bay. There are lots of nice scenery around to see and take photos. I simply love it and my niece and nephew enjoyed their time at Marina Bay too.
,,Enchanting,5.0,,Just the perfect place for everyone to see and have a nice dinner with a beautiful view of Singapore.
,,Awesome,4.0,,An amazing piece of architecture and town planning. There's certainly lots of interesting things to see around that area.
,,Keeps you occupied...,4.0,,"The upmarket shopping complex. Liked ...Harley Davidson, Ferrari, LV shops for window shopping. View of the bay area that is lit up at night."
,,Marina bay at night,3.0,,Boat ride to Marina bay was lovely especially at night. Lovely walk around the bay and there was band playing just outside the light and sound area.
,,A very nice place,4.0,,"The Marina Bay is a very nice shopping centre with all kinds of brand inside such as Miu Miu, LV, Jimmy Choo, etc.

There is a place in Marina Bay Sands where you can sit beside the river and enjoy the view.

A must go!

However, the casino is polluted which the smell of smoking which I hate a lot."
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,Very scenic place. Can spend the whole day around the area but a lot of walking needed and was very hot.
,,"Visiting Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Shops Etc...",5.0,,The place is very welcome for all! We love the jazz band performers right before at the entrance! after them is a photo booth where you can claim your hard copy of images and soft copy also delivered directly to your email!. Many more things to say about this wonderful place. This is also very accessible for commuters and because MRT is connected to the place and taxi are lined up waiting for you. We will come back again
,,The 2012 icon of Singapore,5.0,,"This is the latest addition to the Singapore city skyline. From high end shopping to casinos, this pace is designed for entertainment. Location near the Singapore flyer, Esplanade and Merlion, do make sure you get your taxi fare worthwhile by visiting all the others."
,,Great views,5.0,,"My husband and I enjoyed this area a lot. You can see the Financial District, the Merlion, Theatres on the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore Flyer etc.
We were lucky enough to see the last rehearsal for the National Day Parade, which ended with a magnificent firework display in the evening.
I recommend you visit this area in the evening, when everything lights up."
,,Our time in Singapore,5.0,,"We loved the cleanliness of the city - it was beautiful. And of course, the weather, which as amaziing. The shopping was out of this world and we loved Universal Studios, Sentosa Island, the Singapore Flier and Marina Bay Sands."
,,Truly iconic,5.0,,"This place has shops, restaurants, food courts, a casino, coffee shops and a daily free light and sound shows.
Anyone visiting Singapore simply MUST visit here. You can pay a small fee of 20 SGD and go to the sky deck at 60th floor for a wonderful panoramical view of Sinapore skyline.
There are a couple of bars/restaurants at the sky deck as well, and Ku De Ta offers stunning view while you sip on your drink.
Expect to spend upto 2 hours if you're just visiting for the view and walk around. Suggested timings are towards evening so you can see the brightly lit Singapore skyline, and have a couple of drinks.From there on you can proceed to the casino in the basement. Just remember to carry your passport (and your ATM card :) if planning on casino!

,,Shops and Musuems,5.0,,"Very large and huge variety of shops, great rasapura masters food court, very accessible, relaxing place"
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,The view was amazing. I managed to sneak up to the top of the 57th floor without paying the required fee. Although you cannot gain access to the pool area.
,,Wow... What a view!,4.0,,"The MBS is a large retail, residential, casino and hotel complex but the one thing you must do is the Skypark. Located on the 56th and 57th floors is the terrace that over looks Singapore. It cost $5 billion to build this architectural one-off and you can see why.

The unique design incorporates a ship structure on the top of three skyscrapers... Completely unnatural but kinda works. The cost is S$20 to visit the viewing platform which also includes a bar and restaurant. you cannot get access to the infinity pool, gardens etc unless part of complementary tour guide. Beware, these book up early so worth booking in advance. We didn't so didn't have the opportunity to see these features.

The views from the top are fantastic and there also includes a light show which is worth waiting for. A must for any tourist in Singapore!"
,,lovely scenery,5.0,,"good but very expensive restaurants,you do not need tourist guide for the city,it is very easy to explore"
,,beautiful,4.0,,"the atmosphere is very beautiful at night; building, light and river. including shopping center with many international brands"
,,Great for a look around.,5.0,,The shops are fantastic and the number of places to eat is almost overwhelming. The view over the harbour back toward the Sky Scrapers is worth the trip on it's own.
,,Integrated resort at its very best!,5.0,,MBS is not just a casino and hotel complex. Yes the casino is huge and the hotel is a great piece of architecture. The Shoppes at MBS have a huge range of designer stores and celebrity restaurants and make for a great day out. There is also a great food court if you're not quite up to a Daniel Boulud signature burger. There are also great views of Singapore if you venture outside and walk around the complex. The ArtScience Museum is also a must see. Easy to get to via MRT or bus.
,,A must see,5.0,,"Singapore is a marvelous town and the marina is a must-see. A mix of traditional/colonial/modern buildings, a nice place to spend time (top restaurants & bars), I love that area!"
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Shopping mall, with designer brands and a canal at the ground floor which you could hire a punt. Musicians playing classical music at points around the mall. The light and sound show at nightime directly outside the mall , its near to MRT station and museum and waterfront."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Catch the sound and light show! 9.30 pm is the best show time! The place is very clean with great photo opperyunities
,,brilliant modern architecture,4.0,,"Great place to take beautiful photos! I spent whole day there, enjoy the walk around the Marina Bay. Free live entertainment @ Esplanade theater by the bay, ""Giant tree"" & light & water performance at night."
,,A view over tomorrow,5.0,,"Very impressive marina, close on four sides, with only the river entering and exiting from one end to the other. Walking around it will take about an hour and you will take in some of the futuristic architecture that is destined to be copied in the rest of Asia and the world, like the inimitable Marina Bay Sands Resort - both ugly and attractive,and the skyline of the Financial District. Don't miss it."
,,A real eye opener,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands complex is a must for tourists visiting Singapore. The shopping complex is truly worth a visit along with all the eateries, restaurants and of course the Skypark. There is lots to see and do. Everything is so new and clean and well appointed. The Singapore Flyer in this same area is also worth the money - especially on a bright and sunny day. You can see for miles."
,,Wowed!!,4.0,,"Great place to be especially if you like architecture, food and shopping. Take a trip up to the sky deck but for the price it is better to have a meal up there then it is free. Had a meal at Ku De Ta-interesting though I would not rave about the food.
Food at Daniel Boulud's restaurant was much much better"
,,Spectacular neighborhood,5.0,,"MBS is the most popular part of the Marina Bay. But the neighborhood is more than just the hotel, e.g. the Science Museum, the Marina Bay shopping mall or a fantastic light and water show called Wonder Full."
,,Great views!,5.0,,"I'm not sure if I am writing this review in the right place or not as I am a little confused as to what the Sky Park is and if there is any difference betweent this and the top floors of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. I read before we left for Singapore that you had to pay an admission to get to the top of the hotel. However, we just told one of the staff that we wanted a drink in the bar at the top. we were given a ticket, guided to a elevator and up we went. At the top, we just handed the ticket in, sat down at the bar and enjoyed the stunning views whilst having a cocktail. Admittedly, the drink prices are not cheap, but I'd rather have a drink than have to pay to get to the top and have no drink for the same money! You also get to see the infinity swimming pool from one of the bars at the top (there are two bars to choose from). Well worth th views. I believe that if you go after 6pm, there is a dress code for the bars (maybe info on the hotel website)"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"You can easily spend a whole day here - lots to see and do. Waterfront views, Art & Science museum, Sands complex. Great!"
,,Singapore is clean,5.0,,Stunning and very modern. There's a lot of restaurants and bars around. I enjoyed walking around and took a lot of photos. You have not been to Singapore if you have not seen Marina Bay
,,A brand new site to see.,5.0,,Lots to see and views to tickle your fancy. Worth the money. Hot and humid but what do you expect? You just got to see to believe it
,,"Several features, probably of average interest",3.0,,Recently visited some of the new developments in the area - such as the gardens and the new barrage across the Singapore River. It's interesting to see the developments - but I'd place the area low on a list for short-term visitors compared to more interesting features of Singapore.
,,Magnificent view,5.0,,You can take an elevator up to the roof top bar of the Marina Bay hotel and enjoy the fantastic view of Singapore. Cocktails are awesome as well.
,,Nice!!,4.0,,If you want to gamble then nothing beats Macau but the hotel is beautiful and the pool on the top floor is brilliant.
,,Beautiful scenery both night and day.,5.0,,"The admission to the SkyPark is a must for anyone touring aroung the sunny island of Singapore. It has the best view of Singapore's skyscrapers and an overview of the Garden's By the Bay. During the night, there are a wonderful water jet show being put up at the Bayfront which is a must for all to see( free of charge). It boast spectacular laser,water,fire and foam performance which has 2 shows every night. Thoroughly enjoyed my night in Singapore."
,,One visit is worth it,3.0,,The area has been newly developed with the Marina Sand as the Jewel of the area. A visit to Marina Sand is worthwile if you have never visited before
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,"Went to hotel/casino/shopping complex.great shopping,also interesting/quality restaurants.Take a 'Duck & Hippo'boat to get there."
,,"RE: modern, clean...",5.0,,"spacious walkways...nice shops, lots of things to see and just window shopping, great restaurants, pleasant staff that makes the trip there worthwhile"
,,A must see in Singapore,4.0,,"Go during the evenings to appreciate the lights, buildings and the surrounding waters.There are many restaurants in the area.We took a walk around the area and it was lovely."
,,Most fantastic place!!!,5.0,,"Visited this area of Singapore and it is overwhelming. The shopping center with its many restaurants and exclusive shops is absolutely beautiful, not to be missed. Not cheap"
,,Great view of the city,5.0,,"What a great light show, worth hanging around for. Better then Hong Kong's light show. I would almost be happy to pay to see it."
,,Good laser light show,5.0,,"Think it starts 8pm and then again at 9, really very good. Must be one of the only things that are free in Singapore! A must do, when there, you will not regret it."
,,Just go up for the stunning views but don't stay there,3.0,,"Very touristy place, the pool is reserved for hotel guets but I would not want to swim in there with so many people staring at taking photos of the infinity pool. Check in/out had (many) separate lines that looked like a supermarket cashier point. You will need a cab to get out of the area, into civilization."
,,You should visit Marina Bay,4.0,,"There are a lot of site attractions there, can't tell it just visit it, and you will like it and recommend it :)"
,,Loved this area,5.0,,"Marina Bay is such a vibrant area for shopping, dining, entertainment. Especially enjoyed the walk around the lake with spectacular view of Marina Sands. Be sure not to miss the night laser light show."
,,Wow,4.0,,Marina bay is the best place where you can spend some hour on a hot night in Singapore. Great sight. You can enjoy a walk on the bridge and visit Marina Bay Casinò or enjoy some sea food on along the bay.
,,Evening walk,4.0,,"Very nice place for a leisurely stroll in the evening, with the sights and sounds of Singapore, away from the crazy bustle of Orchard and the MRTs. The fountain show is really nice and well thought out. The mall is typical fare but has some good, though high end, restaurants."
,,great vibe at night!,4.0,,"I and my friend had Mexican food, so many tourist in this area at night, cos it is the time! Go get yourself into the crowd and enjoy it! Sitting down by the bay is also nice, looking at the big buildings with the lights on. It is just beatiuful:)"
,,Check it out if you are in the area,4.0,,"This review is for the skypark on MBS. You have to view the city from the top and at night. There are a few options - skypark, flyer, 1-altitude or some other bars. I used an international AmEx offer that gave 25% off for additional tix. Just like any other tourist attraction, they take pix of you/your group before riding the elevator. Take the elevator, go up, spend as much time as you can. If you want to take clear pix of the skyline, then you need tripod. They say that they do not allow tripod but nobody checks. I did not take mine but there were a few who had tripod. Otherwise, it is OK to spend time out there. Better to take the tour to see the infinity pool. Nice views definitely."
,,Ducktour to cover Marina Bay,5.0,,"Ducktour was quite good to cover the places around Marina Bay such as Singapore Flyer, Art and Science Museum, Opera House, Conservatory...etc"
,,Incredible Architecture,5.0,,"These architects had a vision, its incredible. I enjoyed my Singapore Sling in the roof bar. Just beside me a swimming pool you can feel as an sky diver. Don`t miss!"
,,Love it!,5.0,,"My family and I always love going to Marina Bay. Great shops, theatre, views, restaurants and much more. A must see if you are in town visiting!"
,,"You can have the privilege of seeing various contemporary structures of Singapore city skyline, making this park a visua",5.0,,"Marina Bay is exceptional you can , walk troungth 3.5 km promenade around the bay.
There is also the amazing must see Gardens by the Bay.
Walk along the Bayfront is a pleasant experience with flowering shrubs and shade trees feeling the breeze in the equatorial heat.
You can have the privilege of seeing various contemporary structures of Singapore city skyline, making this park a visual treat to visit."
,,spectacular hotel,5.0,,I attended this hotel and stayed in TOWER 2 with a city view. I also traveled with my two babies 2 and 11months old... I cant fault the space in the room and the service. Any time staff could help they would. Rooms very clean and its the hotel to stay out in SINGAPORE... I think the buffet breakfeast is a little expensive. For mums with kids the park up on the roof and the pool area there is plenty of room for the kids to run while you can still have a drink... I will return...amazing.
,,Great Window Shopping Experience,4.0,,"Lots of high-end luxury brands in the shopping complex. I couldn't afford much, but it's worth a visit if you've got the time. Very Singapore in a way, because it looks great, it's modern, and it will cost you a fortune. Great view of the skyline. Do catch the free water-light show that is on nightly; be sure to sit in the bleachers/steps or you won't get the full experience! There's also a whirlpool-type water featue outside the entrance, other artsy atrium designs inside, and what looked like a canal ride even though I didn't see anyone taking it. Foreigners can enter the casino for free but must show a passport."
,,Great views for $20,4.0,,"We all went up to the top and although it cost $20 it was worth it. The whole complex is huge and lots of shopping before getting there.
Personally, glad we only visited as the location is a little out of the heart of town.
The whole ship on the top is a little cheesy but enjoyed it."
,,Bring your credit cards!!,5.0,,Brilliant. Buildings magnificent. Took one of the river trips which was very interesting and it was good to see Singapore from the water.
,,New and new,3.0,,"Another impressive architecture building from outside, felt lonely tho, kinda empty inside the mall, and it was just another mall."
,,"Fantastic view, ridicules Singapore Flyer",4.0,,"Absolutely amazing views which put Singapore flyer to shame. Only S$20 per head instead of S$28 for the flyer, which is a bargain in comparison."
,,Light show was spectacular,5.0,,A free light show at about 20:00 hours - there is another one a bit later as well - Monday to Friday. This is a must see for all. Truly amazing.
,,Like most thing in Singapore - Impressive but Expensive!!,4.0,,"My husband son and I just wanted to head to the top and check out the views but the price was ridicuous, so instead we bought the lunch package which was a little more expensive but included a beautiful lunch in the Japanese restuarant on the roof top.
The views are absolutely stunning from the top, it's so impressive.
Singapore is a really beautiful place and you can see from the view how well this place is set out and designed. Worth a trip to the top!"
,,"Great Place, Pricey though",4.0,,"The architecture is unique. I ate at the Jiang Chinese restaurant at the Ground floor. Good food, but expensive. Great ambiance overall"
,,Marina Bay Sands' unforgettable borderless pool,5.0,,"Many travelers may not enjoy Marine Bay Sands so much. It is huge, not cozy, but if you want one word to describe it, I woud try cosmopolitan! It's so busy, so full of life, people, nationalities, different languages, life ... I got amazed and I really enjoyed staying there. And do not forget the borderless pool, breathtaking ... A 360º complete view of Singapore, absolutely unforgettable!"
,,A Fabulous One Day Experience,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a hotel, casino, shopping centre, museum and garden facility all in location. There is an MRT station underneath which means you can get there in no time. The hotel is three towers on top of which sits a giant surfboard like roof top about 56 floors up. Spend the outrageous S$20 just for the once in a lifetime view and see if your knees don't go go all wobbly with the height. You can see the amazing gardens from here and tehse are worth a walk through if you are even remotely inclined. The museum currently features a warhol exhibition which is very good. The ticket included a Harry Potter exhibition which I skipped. But this must be great for kids. I recommend wandering around the shopping area as well. There is a little shop that does small bottles of whiskys, cognac and other spirits which is a hoot. You can sample before buying from oak casks. A good restaurant is Daniel Bouloud's DB which is a chance to try authentic Lyonnaise food. Spend the day there!"
,,"Plastic, not fantastic",2.0,,"Just an expensive shopping centre. Fake ice skating rink - made of plastic, like everything else. Disappointed. They seem to rip out the real stuff and replace it with a man-made alternative."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,The view from the top of the Marina Sands Hotel is worth the cost of the ticket. Not a great deal to do whilst you are up there other than buy a fairlty pricey drink. However overall were we glad we did it. Allow say 1 hour max
,,Sky Park is Magnificent,5.0,,We went to the sky park and the view from sky park was magnificent. Can see the whole Songapore city and as far away as some of the indonesian islands.
,,Great location to experience the new Singapore,5.0,,Both Sands Hotel ArtScience Museum and Garden by the Ba are new additions to the Marina Bay. The government has changed the landscape of the city dramatically. This is a nice location to experience the facelift of this city. Make sure to visit the rooftop swimming pool at Sands and walk along the Skyway at the Garden by the Bay to view the new skyline.
,,Nice Evening Stroll,4.0,,This is a great place for a stroll in the cooler evening with all the pubs and restaurants. It is also a good vantage point for the laser light show from the Marina Sands.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This area is beautiful. My wife and I walked around it several nights and watched fireworks on Saturday night. More cities should have attractions like Marina Bay!
,,Visiting,5.0,,Very modern and unusual. Designer shops and shops selling branded goods. For those who can afford there are famous chefs who will satisfy one with their culinary skills.
,,Learning about Singapore,4.0,,"The overall experience at Marina Bay was fascinating......there is the barrage (to learn about the water use in Singapore) and the model of Singapore that lights up and tells you about the growth and changes of the skyline and then there was Marina Bay Sands (hotel and shopping center) with an interesting water display, fancy shops and the ability to watch local's at lunch.......
Overall an interesting mix of things to do and see!"
,,amazing architecture,5.0,,"A fantastic addition to Singapore's already amazing architecture... walking distance from Clarke Quay area, and beautifully designed. The hotel that looks like a ship on top of 3 pillars is incredible, as is the lotus flower design art and science museum. The new gardens will be amazing when they are finished. Really worth a visit."
,,"Good for a look, and relax",4.0,,"The shopping centre is a bit pricey for my tastes, but I sat along the water under a tree for a while in the middle of the day and it was the perfect chillout spot away from the crowds and heat. Amazing architecture and the view from the top can't be beat."
,,Spectacular show at night!,5.0,,"The hotel and shops are beautiful, but the laser/water show is where it is at! The show lasts about 15 minutes and includes dancing fountains, lasers and fire. The best part was the view of the skyline. It was incredibly beautiful and an experience I will not soon forget. Oh, and it is free! Here is a link to the days and times: http://www.marinabaysands.com/Singapore-Entertainment/WonderFull/"
,,What a view!,5.0,,This hotel is amazing from afar as well as up close. It costs $20 to go to the top M-Th and $50 F-Sun.
,,A must to visit in sg,5.0,,"It's a nice place for the whole family,nice building,parks,resto etc. Better try the big flyer to see the whole city. I live in europe but i prefer to live in sg you'll never get bored."
,,Nice place to enjoy some breeze,5.0,,"There's usually something going on to entertain the crowds. If you enjoy walking, then its a great place to do so, just don't forget your trainers."
,,amazing,5.0,,amazing idea for building three tall towers with a huge park at the end to almost touch the sky really i was empressed with marina bay
,,The most awesome place I have ever experienced!,5.0,,I wish I had the time to have stayed a few nights here. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was the most unbelievable experience!
,,Spectacular from far,3.0,,I think the sky park and the main areas are beautiful. But the rooms are not really super luxurious or anything like that unless you are a 'whale'.
,,Was a good experience,4.0,,"Was nice to see the famous MBS building and my friend and I paid $20 to go all the way up to the skydeck where we have a view of the whole Singapore. Those I would prefer the price of the ticket to be slightly lesser, or even if the price is set they should provide a complimentary dri k at the top or a souvenir . But it was a good experience."
,,Not as safe as you think,2.0,,"The day we were there, someone fell off, so be on your guard if you have kids. Staff can be a bit hostile to sight seers. Good views, but nothing you havent seen before if you`ve been up an observatory tower, such as Menara or Petronas towers in K.L. before."
,,...,3.0,,"A place to see but not the first pick in Singapore. The SkyParks offers a perfect vue of Singapore and the gardens are nice, but too much hostels and mall for me."
,,Get some Great Food at Mozza,5.0,,"The food at Mozza (a celebrity resto by Mario Batali) are perfect especially with wine. We tried the baked cauliflower as appetizer, grilled ribs, meatballs, small pizza with sparkling tonic water and rasperry iced tea."
,,Stand to see the beautiful view,3.0,,"View: Perfect. It offers the best view of the Singapore skyline. Won't argue with that.

Service: Fail. Seriously, the view is all they offer. There were no benches at the observation deck. Even the Singapore Flyer has benches inside its cabins. So when you're someone who wants to wait for the sun to set, make sure you're wearing comfortable shoes because you will be standing all throughout."
,,Very nice place to walk around,5.0,,"It is a clean place, with a nice view of Opera and big buildings, safe and pleasant to walk and relax"
,,Best View Ever!!!,5.0,,Checking the view of Singapore and get a Cocktail during sunset. Including in the high Beverage prices is the view and location.but its worth it

,,Wow - swimming on the 57 th floor of this hotel,5.0,,"Incredible infinity swimming pool on the fifty seventh floor constructed in the shape of a banana and supported by three towers.
The room was spacious and sumptuous with walk in shower (wet) room.
This is a 5 star plus hotel with all it's techno gadgets in the room to assist the weary traveller have a pleasant stay. Most of the staff speak with an American accent andare helpful without being intrusive.
The million dollar waiting seating arrangement in the lobby is awesome and one hs to see them to believe that they are stylised in a form of a wave otter made of green glass and surrounded by marble."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Take a walk right around the Marina Bay. Enjoy the Helix Bridge, the sculpture in the parks, the Olympic walkway with its beautiful palms and plaques and above all the magnificent architecture and fabulous shops. The food court wont disappoint nor will the indoor canal complete with gondoliers.
The Marina Bay connects to the newly opened Gardens At The Bay and these are marvellous - must see modern miracles."
,,environment,5.0,,"MBS as they call it is excellent with a whole lot of places and things to visit. Shopping, the Garden by the Bay have to be seen to be believed. Restaurants are excellent and if you visit them on the opposite side of the bay at night you can see the light show after dark"
,,Expensive tour for a view into smoke haze,2.0,,Three of my family joined me for a ride to the top of the MBS for a view of a lifetime. First thing we are stung for $20 each for the ride up. At the top tourists are roped off into few areas. With burning in nearby Indonesia it was difficult to make anything out. Tip: Before you pay ask about the smoke warnings for the area.
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,I was in Singapore for three days and Marina Bay was the best thing to do. Simply walking around the bay is the best way to experience Singapore.
,,Happening Place,5.0,,Lovely quay-side eateries with passaby-decent food. The laser light show from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel can be enjoyed at night from a vantage point here. Its got a romantic feel to it in the evening and the merlion here is an interesting photo-op as well.
,,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,4.0,,"We stayed there for a night to celebrate my husband's birthday. the checking in took a super long time but the good thing was they allowed us to bring the kids up to the swimming pool. that was another wonderful experience due to the view. but be prepared for the crowd !! Wil be visiting there soon. They even upgraded us to a suite,because we asked for a queen size bed and they didnt have one we were really blessed !! Dont think that will happen to many often ..sorry !!"
,,lovely atmosphere,5.0,,"Found that the air i was breathing at Marina Bay was so pure and crisp, loved it!"
,,Nice place for afternoon walk,5.0,,Nice place for afternoon walk and spent time for chit chat
,,Perfect for Night Stroll,4.0,,"Approaching the Marina Bay on foot via the walkway from the Kallang Water Park is an experience and an exercise. This must be a 2 km walk to Marina Bay and is a pleasant one at night. At a spot along the trail, one is treated to a beautiful view of the lighted Singapore Flyer and Ronchor Bridge and the reflection on the water is dramatic, a perfect subject for night photography."
,,must go and see,4.0,,"Marina bay .. white statue of merlion, throwing water from its mouth, a touristic place. Place to relax and see around...."
,,great spot !,5.0,,"walk around. take your time, enjoy every bit , best at dusk"
,,Nice view,5.0,,"Very relaxing place, there's a mini concert every weekend just outside the esplanade beside the river. Try to take the river cruise, you'll get a better view. Worth going, good to take picture."
,,Shopping in Marina Bay,5.0,,Top branded shops under one roof. Fine dining restaurants are there too. A recommended place for all tourists coming to Singapore. Don't miss the swimming pool at the roof top of the hotel. Garden at the Bay (Marina Bay) is nearby too.
,,Typical Vegas-Style resort/shopping,4.0,,"Very nice...high end shopping with prices to match. The atmosphere is lovely and nice to walk through, however, if you are from the US, browsing-only is highly recommended. The pricing of designer products is higher than in the US. The evening fountain/fireworks/video shows are nice, overlooking the Singapore Bay. Don't make a special trip, but if you are in the area, it's a nice couple of hours."
,,Great place,4.0,,"When you come to Marina bay you have plenty of options for things to do - you can go to the Marina Bay Sands hotel, marvel at its architecture, go to Sands Skypark which is an observation deck, enjoy luxury shopping at Shoppes @ Marina Bay Sands, go to the Harry Potter exhibition (till September 2012) in the Arts and Science museum, walk the helix bridge, or visit the nearby Gardens by the bay or Singapore Flyer. Whatever it is that you choose to do, you will never be short of fun activities.

However, Marina Bay Sands being a luxury hotel is expensive."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Nice tourist attraction, with various attractive buildings around the bay."
,,LAS VEGAS,5.0,,"it is a nice complex, hotel, casino, shops VERY GOOD THE FREE night show everyday at 8 pm and 930 pm, just in ccase ask the concierge in the shopping areas"
,,Busy spot,4.0,,"I like this place,cause of the casino,many eatery and shops.Now can cross over to the bay garden easily"
,,Magical Harry Porter,4.0,,"The Harry Porter exhibition is there now. The little twit is good with his magic. Be careful, your children will be spellbound and you will be forced to part with SGD75 for a chopstick they call 'wand' and you can't even use to eat your noodles with unless you bought a pair. But overall good experience if you have kids and lots of dough."
,,Such an amazing view !,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands offers such an amazing view of the city ! Especially at night, it is really beautiful, breathtaking and it offers a 360° panorama view of Singapore ! Really worth the stop. The only think I would complain about is the price of the pictures. SGD 30 minimum, depending the size etc. Moreover, there were fireworks rehearsals for the National Day which made the experience even more stunning ! I must way we were so lucky to come up on that day as we didn't know there were those rehearsals."
,,Great place!,5.0,,"Its a must for any Singapore trip. Shopping, the harbor, and the cityscape is spectacular! Enjoy!"
,,Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"We made our way to the top and had a drink at the bar looking over Singapore city. That was amazing you could see for miles, what an engineering task it would have been to get this right."
,,"""Wow""",4.0,,Just amazing! A must do in Singapore. Evening is the best time to go there. One of the best place to enjoy Singapore skyline.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Marina Bay offers fantastic city views. It is hugeeeeeeeee. It has nice restaurants and many shops too. The building architecture is unique and exceptional.
,,Panoramic View from the top of MBS Hotel,4.0,,You get beautiful views of Gardens By The Bay especially during the evening.
,,"Marina bay Casino, hotel and Mall",4.0,,"Very nice facilities, and quite impressive. However I did not like it there, it was too big and too in-personal. I would rather visit smaller places not as huge."
,,Good place to see and be seen,5.0,,"Enjoy a great walk at night, beautiful views, nice restaurants, good shopping."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Everything is very impressive-do not miss the daily lightshow
,,Check out the Singapore skyline at night!,5.0,,Great location to stay with plenty of top end shops...have a drink in the Marina Bay Pacific Sands 'Sky Bar' and watch the sunset...
,,Must see - new Singapore Icon!,5.0,,"The sight is simply stunning. If you can, go up to the top of Marina Bay Sands for the breath-taking views of the financial district but is is very pricey. Otherwise, simply come to see the building, walk around the area, enjoy the shopping mall with huge variety of shops. Large wooden deck for kids to run, scoot, roller-blading... even just walking on Helix bridge is a pleasure. Especially, if you can, come for free water and light show during weekend at Marina Bay Sands - it is just simply spectacular!"
,,Surreal Experience,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Complex is an amazing architectural feat! Just wonder around and take it all in. Window shopping is the thing to do as everything costs an arm and a leg. Get across to the new Gardens on the Bay, will be stunning once completed."
,,swimming pool very fantastic...........,5.0,,"Ranny sleep in Marina about October 2010,. I think Marina bay sand about 6 months, bcos staff n reseptionise said,. first time I see casino here,. and if you like coffee, tea, mineral water free you must go here,.. he he he,.. then I see big shoping mall, big expo hall,. of course i get sovenire when I see oil n gas expo maybe,. then number 1 very important in the top 57th sky park very wonderful swimming pool. you can see the sea, big ship, Singapore by your eyes NOT glass,.. i don't like glass... then my Darling Arne C n me meet his friends Merit n Elder from Norwegia in MBS( Marina Bay Sand) Monday 9 July 2012,.. and there is first time I see table timer ( every 1 hour waitress said "" sorry madam new costumer have book this table). then we are lucky bcooooooos we can see sunset in MBS,.. and take photos,... so wonderful............................if you like enjoy in swimming pool so come here............. Marina bay Sand very fantastice and romantice,... have a great swimming pool, right...???"
,,Interesting,4.0,,Beautiful location very posh area loved the views and how relaxing the bay was! Must visit.
,,A city in itself,5.0,,"You can do everything you want at this one location, 300 shop mall with luxury to normal shops, a large 24 hour food court, gondola boat transport in the canal through the indoor mall for your tired feet, many many restaurants and cafes, theaters, casino, banks, travel agent, spa, hotel, hmmmm...what did I forget...has it all."
,,Great Singapore signature view,5.0,,Make this place ur end journey after exploring singapore city. The view is beautiful
,,Its worth a visit but it is expensive!!,4.0,,"We recently took a day trip to Marina Bay during our 5 days in Singapore. It is architectualy beautiful and its grandure is breathtaking - but so is the bill if you go to level 52 for lunch. We visited the club lounge for lunch (4 adults and 2 children) sharing some fries, small burgers (4 bite size burgers to a serve) and a club sandwich, 2 diet cokes and 6 beers was over $300. You pay for the view and it is spectacular. The pool area looks everything like the pictures you will see on any advert for the hotel and there is security at every passage to stop those not staying in the hotel from intruding on the hotel guests - which is good to see. The lobby level is beautiful with towering ceilings and picture perfect shops, mostly all the labels of fashion. But the building really is all about the architecture. If you are not eating in the restaurants, as a visitor to the complex, there is a fee of $20 per person to go to the top viewing platform. I would suggest it is better value booking into the club lounge (free of charge) and ordering a coke for $8. You will save yourself $12 per person and you get a beverage. :) You can easily book in to the club lounge on arrival at tower 3, no reservation is necessary."
,,All of Lifes pleasures,4.0,,"I am not into the casino but the views of Singaporefrom Marina Bay are worth a visit. The shopping mall at Marina Bay Sands is very high quality and can occupy the visitor for several pleasurable hours. Especially the Hermes store which can be entered from the bay ot from the mall and is architectually unique. It houses a gallery as well as retail. The food offerings are the very best in temptation especially motta Pizza.As one wanders you eventually encounter a canel with boat rides in the mall and a gushing vortex which is an art work by the American artist Ned Kahn. This is a mesmerrising experience so tke a break with a cup of coffee but prepared to be splashed. Keep walking and you will get to the MBS Hotel. There is a wall painting by Sol Le Witt the Internationally acclaimed artist and usually a liveclassical music welcome. If possible make a reservation at the roof top restaurant so you can enjoy the cusine of this famous local chef, look out at all of Singapore and see the infinity pool that floats above Singapore. Only guests of the hotel can use the pool."
,,Branded place,5.0,,"Spend lots of money but still have hope nearby, casino."
,,Unique experience!,5.0,,To be visited as all is in the vicinity and there is no need to get out of this area. A place not to be missed!
,,excellent,5.0,,"shopping galore, beautiful and great art gallery. We visited the casino ( you need your passport to get in), there is a fake ice skating rink at the food court"
,,"amazing building, amazing view but pricey!",5.0,,"an amazing building from afar and amazing inside too, but the view from the ku de ta bar upstairs is worth the expensive (even for singapore standards) drinks ($28sgd cocktails). the casino on other side is also worth a visit, with great well priced personalised drink service, you just have to ask when they come past!"
,,great food,4.0,,"Excellent food, great and really fast service. Must have dinner at least once, when you are around."
,,Fabulous views - Sky Park,4.0,,"Situated on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort, it offers unparalleled breathtaking views of the whole of Singapore from the Observation Deck.

The Infinity Pool is a must-see as are the trees and plants surrounding the SkyPark.

Souvenir hunters might want to purchase some items for remembrance."
,,restaurant choice,4.0,,First class range over restaurants - food reasonable and good value - lovely setting at night time
,,Probably better if you stay,3.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is a very, very large hotel with a huge shopping mall underneath. The mall has most of the very upmarket stores one would expect in a very upmarket location. I found it all a bit impersonal but very pretty and impressive. The reverse fountain is well worth seeing. A trip to the top of the Marina Bay Sands is $20/per person. This is just to the viewing deck and you cannot see the fantastic infinity pool from there. To see and use that you need to have a room. We decided on other ways to spend the $80 so I can't comment on the view."
,,The pool was awesome,5.0,,"Stayed here for nights, its not a cheap place to stay but was a good and worth stay, enjoyed the pool twice a day."
,,Cycling in Marina Bay of Singapore,4.0,,"We visited Singapore in July 2012 and joined a evening cycling trip arranged by a local bike shop. We lived in Lavender and routed thro the nearby Kallang Park to Marina Bay. The trail is nice and safe along the waterfront, save and except that we needed to dismount and pushed our bikes on the Helix Bridge. The free show outside the Sands Hotel is really really awesome. The night view of the Sands Hotel and the nearby ferris wheel is very impressive. We then cycled to the Koon Tat Street (which closed to give way for an open air hawkers in the evening) and enjoyed a late-evening supper (with delicious Indian cuisine, including the spicy and yummy mutton soup)! We came from HK where there is laser and firework display over the Victoria Park in the evening but it is not comparable to what we saw in this Marina Bay trip."
,,"merlion, fullerton, laser&light show",4.0,,"The Singapore trademark ""Merlion"" is locate here.. At 8.15pm and 9.15 you can see the laser & light show from Marina Bay Sands side and closing by fireworks.. impressive show. The show only 15mins and it's free."
,,not ready for tourists,1.0,,"We went to the Mariana Gardens and were disappointed. The greens and flowers are not quite ready so there were lots of exposed concrete and and vine nets.

The Mariana bay sands hotel is a big let down. their service is terrible. And the hotel staff treat you like an outsider for wanting to eat at their sky view restaurants and the sky park. For example, you seat your self at the sky park restaurant which has very few tables."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Amazing food court, hundreds of shops, observation deck better than the Sky wheel"
,,sky deck is a must do.,5.0,,I skipped visiting the sky deck at first. Its not free. But once your up there you will never forget it. You have to see Singapore from this angle. Go in the evening and time the sunset. If you have time and more money take in a meal there and for sure take your camera. The wealthy get to enjoy a stay there and swim to the pools edge. I found it to be worth the time and money to just go up there and take in the view. Especially now that it is a world icon.
,,must visit,5.0,,must visit place....having casino inside....and also nice place to take pics
,,"Very stylish, luxurious shops and a great place to go window shopping",5.0,,I was surprised to find some totally free wi-fi spots inside the shopping mall. The shops are super luxurious and it really is a nice place where you can burn a lot of calories walking and not getting bored. Everything is world class and there is even easy access by train to the rest of the city.
,,"Good food ,great atmosphere",4.0,,"Good food ,very much affordable prices,Had only soup and noodles.very good service"
,,lovely view!,5.0,,"we went there just before sunset to see singapore by night as well. we loved the view and the sky bar, very pricey but since you're on the top of marina... it's ok :) definitely worth seeing"
,,Interesting if you like a Las Vegas style hotel in Singapore,3.0,,Interesting to visit if you like visiting Las Vegas style hotels and the shops are excellent. The casino is also good although it comes far short of the casino's in the states that it is copied from.
,,Excellent Entertainment and Shopping Mall,4.0,,"An excellent range of shops, food stores and court. I wish they had major airlines officess on the site. Also having lived in country where smiling face and polite and friendly gestures are part and parcel of good services I wish they would see more of that pleasing gestures within the hotel."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Wow this area is just fantastic. The buildings are works of art and the shopping center is incredible. All the designer outlets you can imagine. Be sure to spend a day and evening in this area. The shopping center has an ice skating rink on the bottom level near the food court, a gondola ride on the canal leads to the fountain that pours a vortex of water down the funnel at certain times of the day. Be sure to check when this is due to happen and have a look at the spectacle. You can go through from the casino into the marina bay sands hotel which is like being in another world. The skypark on the roof is worth a visit and why not just sit in the cafe in the atrium and enjoy a cuppa. As night falls go up to the garden above the shopping mall and look at the city lights and then try a bumboat ride to Clarke Quay"
,,Roof top dining,5.0,,A must see hotel and casino. This is an iconic building for Singapore. For the Louis Vuitton shoppers the crystal palace by the water and 3 levels of merchandise amazing.
,,Pure Fantasy,5.0,,Space Age Malls and Hotels...The Marina Bay Hotel is well worth a visit
,,A walk with great views,5.0,,"We highly recommend taking a stroll around Marina Bay - you will pass architectural gems such as the famous Helix Bridge the Esplanade Theater, the incredible Marina Bay Sands building, the Arts & Science Museum, the Singapore icon 'Merlion', and plenty of nice bars, cafes and restaurant on Collier Quay / Clifford Pier. We recommend planning in two to three hours for a walk around the Bay, with photo stops and maybe a peek inside Marina Bay Sands or the Esplanade."
,,awesome,5.0,,"i really like this place..INFINITY POOL,garden on the bay:) its nice to go here early in the morning because its not so crowded"
,,Complicated directions,3.0,,Awesome structure. Great photos. We wanted to eat dinner at the top and the directions from the dragon bridge were really complicated so we ate somewhere else instead
,,Euro 2012,5.0,,The ambience was generally very cool and pleasant for diners and fabs as well. The place is lean and well maintain and the many restaurants and bars was a good mix of choice.
,,Take a boat trip,4.0,,We had a wonderful view of the bay from the Swissotel Stamford Hotel where we stayed. We also took a Bum Boat down the river and in to the bay at night - it was magnificent (and not so hot as the day temperature).
,,new happening place in singapore!,4.0,,Orchard road is history. Marina Bay is now equal to Clark Quey and much better place to stay.
,,Great Views!,5.0,,Make sure men wear trousers to get into the pool bar at the top.
,,Night Light Show...,4.0,,is worth waiting for. Quite an interesting show they've out together. Shopping at Marina Bay Sands is pretty steep!
,,Marina Bay Garden,5.0,,"A must visit place for tourists who visiting Singapore. This bay garden just recently open to the public after years of construction. The main attraction is the capsule that house many exotics plants and trees. I feel that the best time to visit is around 5 pm . You will see the magical transformation of lights when night time fall. It certainly remind you of a movie ' avatar' when walking the bridge at the height of 7 storey with surrounding plants and flowers hanging down next to you.
Bring a small snack like chocolate bar for quick bites as you need to explore the magical mist forrest until 8pm.

Adult ticket - $28"
,,Expensive but a lovely location,5.0,,"Bars and restaurants are nice and there is a great atmosphere in this area. A nice place to spend an evening, however if you're on a budget beware that most places here are very expensive!"
,,"Trip to Singapore not complete, if you dont come here...",5.0,,"This are is one of the best in Singapore, you have to pay a visit around the Marina Bay area, the Esplanade and Marina Sands magamall.,It's simply amazing out here...It looks spectacular at night as well."
,,wow,5.0,,"Nice to see a state of the are structure... full of fun.... ecxcellant laser show.... staff was friendly and cooperative staff, convenient to for shopping.... all major brands under one roof... swimming pool at top floor was amaizing.... overall very good experience."
,,A trip to the top is a must,4.0,,"Head up to the top of Marina Bay and go right outside of the lift - you get to go to a bar with a viewing platform (you don't necessarily have to buy drinks there either). There is a restaurant also. Forget about heading left, you end up at a no entry sign (to the infinity pool) and a bar which is over expensive and always packed, so you can't get to see the view.

The view from the viewing platform, however, is a highlight of a visit to Singapore!"
,,A must to visit,5.0,,The area of the Marina Bay is a must to visit everything from Flyer to the restaurants will have you salivating.
,,Marina Bay Sands is fantastic,5.0,,No visit to Singapore is complete without at least a few hours wander around the Esplanade and Marina Sands magamall. very impresssive.Take the lift to the 57th floor of Tower 1 of the hotel to the restaurant for cocktails and a mind-boggling sunset view over the city. Walk back over the bridge for a late night dinner under the Singapore Flyer.
,,Perfect Place,4.0,,"Since my high school friend is staying at this hotel, we have the privilege to go at the top of the hotel and its just so fabulous and breath taking. We Love the place. We will definitely be back to this place"
,,good mall and attraction,5.0,,"good mall and attraction from shop, eat and show laser"
,,amazing swimming pool,4.0,,"The amazing thing about is the swimming pool in the 58th floor, it is a little cold but worth the try, my kids enjoy it a lot , and the variety of restaurants in the ground floor"
,,Great View from top level.,5.0,,I went to top of Marina Bay. Excellent view. One of the best views in world.
,,Awesome View,5.0,,The Skypark is so awesome and must not be missed! The breath-taking view Singapore can be seen from the SkyPark (Marina Bay Sands)
,,Good shopping mall,4.0,,One of the more trendy malls of Singapore (now it compares well with ION in orchard). I like it because of it's location. Any one from east coast or staying in hotels around Suntec can now look for a good shopping experience and the food court is also great.
,,Great,5.0,,"There ar lots of wonderful restaurants to choose from, try to get a table overlooking the Marina, facing the Marina Bay Sands hotel (the hotel which looks like it has a boat on the top) at 8pm there is a wonderful light show from this hotel, a must to see"
,,Best views from the 57th floor!,5.0,,"Marina Bay SandS was magnificient, very interesting architecture. We found the shopping area huge,but expensive.."
,,Its Big with all the big brands,4.0,,"The shopping area, good food courts at each end and throughout the centre...focus on the northern end where you won't be disappointed with the variety.Its still new and only gets a little bit crowded on the weekends. Don't miss walking across the gardens on the other side of the Marina Bay Sands."
,,Nice area for a stroll,4.0,,"The area (as opposed to the hotel, Marina Bay Sands) is very pleasant to walk around - pretty waterlily pond by the Waterlily shaped Art & Science Museum, attractive waterfront - cross the river using the Helix bridge. Can't wait to visit the Gardens by the Bay which opened yesterday - watch this space....

When you start feeling the heat pop inside the mall - however if you suffer from vertigo keep away from the sides and don;t look over when you ride the escalator!"
,,A Singapore walk,4.0,,A nice area for a walk with lovely views as you go round
,,Spectacle!,4.0,,"If for no other reason visit this hotel to take in its architectural spectacle. Three massive 57-storey towers topped by what looks like a flattened banana but is in fact an amazing park featuring incredible views and the world's longest (and highest) infinity pool. The pool is for guests only, but splurge."
,,Heaven on Earth,5.0,,What can you say. Possibly the best hotel in Singapore. Have to stay there to try their Infinity pool. Pure Luxury with staff that give excellent service. Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!
,,Go to the Skybridge in the day and at night,4.0,,"Great views of central Singapore. We had dinner at Ku De Ta, it was good but not unexpectedly expensive.You can go up there for a drink only which could cost less than the $20 sightseeing fee the Skybridge charges."
,,rip-off,2.0,,"the view from Marina Baywas worth the lift ride, but the bar/resaurant is a disappointment, expensive, mediocre and the staff all think the are legends of the hospitality industry"
,,Marina Bay Glitz,4.0,,"Wow! What a shopping center, especially if you can't get to NY or another large US city. All the Gucci, Rolex, Burberry, Zegna, Ferragamo stores you find on 5th Avenue with prices to match or even exceed. Not for the budget traveler. But the food court on the bottom level is unmatched anywhere and the prices are moderate. You can have just about any Asian ethnic fare from Korean BBQ to Cantonese, Sechuan to Malaysian to Thai to Vietnamese. I had big problems making a choice. All prepared on the spot by professional chefs. Definitely worth spending some time there if you love to eat."
,,Awesome architecture and news,5.0,,This is an amazing feat of architecture and allows amazing views. The attached shopping centre is also a wonderful shopping experience with every label you could wish for.
,,Marina Bay: Lights and Water Show,5.0,,"It's best to view the Marina Bay around late afternoon so the heat won't drain your energy. Personally, I think the best pictures can be taken at nigh time when the skycrapers surrounding the bay light up. The free lights and water show starts at 8pm. The one in Hongkong is nothing compared to this.

TIP: bring a tripod. =)"
,,wow,4.0,,worth a look even if you cant afford gucci etc. the concept ( ice rink light show ) in one centre is great. ii know it has been done before but its impressive. food court good and reasonably priced too. go in the evening and watch laser light show. mrt to harbourfront.
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"The Marina Bay is offering a marvellous new shopping centre and very interesting buildings e.g. the LV store at Marina Bay. I have not been to SG for 6 yrs. so this site was really impressing me. The Shopping center is offering many high priced designer label shops, so if you are looking for posh shopping, this is the place to be."
,,Maximum city now a scenic gambling heaven,4.0,,"One of the recent addition and most sought after destination in Singapore these days. It's where you can walk, jog, unwind, play, eat and above all gamble (just in case you are in the mood)."
,,Plenty to see and do,4.0,,"We enjoyed the great views from the SkyPark but were also amazed at the mall underneath the Marina Bay Sands. Ice skating rink, canal with sanpans (gondolas), Casino, Theatre, shops and foodcourt. We had a pleasant dinner here one night before heading out to the promenade to view the ""Wonderful"" light show at 8.00pm - that was amazing and well worth a viewing, our children were speachless at the images projected on the waterspray."
,,One for the gamblers or for those who want a view,4.0,,"Great view from the Skypark (cheaper to pay the S$20 entrance than stay). I'm not a gambler but I'm sure the casino would impress many. Lots of shops and restaurants to choose from. Definately worth checking out, even if only once."
,,A treat for your feet... and your wallet,4.0,,"Marina Bay is a must in Singapore, beautifully laid out and the best the city can offer. Especially astonishing is the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in terms of architecture (including connection to a large shopping mall and a casino), but I was not too impressed with the slightly touristy layout of going up to the top. You get to see a small platform (which does feature very lovely views) for quite a steep fee, and it is very hot during daytime without offering any shadow. Also, don't even dream of swimming in the pool up there, it is strictly for hotel guests and you cannot buy a day ticket."
,,More striking outside than in,3.0,,Spectacular from afar.....but within was basically a giant shopping mall with a high end Casino attached. The view from the roof is excellent but up to the individual to decide if worth an additional fee for the ride up in the elevator
,,Great Scenic View,5.0,,"Excellent view from the sky park of marina bay sands.
its better option rather then to go for Singapore flyer.
They have made swimming pool on the top (on57th floor)
And view from the top by doing swimming was very very good
They charged 25 $ per person for spending time there.
View from there was very good you can see all the skyline of the Singapore.
ONe must have to go there for excellent view of Singapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Song of the sea, it's a nice show. Sentosa Island , The Island offering multiple choices attractive to your family."
,,pricey,5.0,,all the good stores in one place. nothing to dislike except not being with my kids for the harry potter exhibit.
,,Another Huge Shopping Complex,3.0,,I found the gondolas and internal canal of the shopping centre a little ott but fascinating. The centre is extremely busy with thousands of tourists and locals pouring in constantly. I didn't visit there to shop but to look at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and you have to walk thrugh the shopping centre to access the hotel.
,,visit in Chinese New Year,4.0,,This is where all happens in Chinese New Year (the Eve). Local people gather there for concerts and fireworks. Singapore was not our favorite in Asia but is worth to see in Chinese New Year.
,,This development is astonishing,5.0,,I didn't believe they had actually built The Marina Bay Sands Hotel & complex until I'd seen it for myself. My Goodness! It's extraordinary! You have to go & explore for yourself to understand the sheer extravagance & size of the place to get an idea of the scale of it all! I loved just sitting at night on the Esplanade watching the Laser show from the Hotel roof. Amazing.
,,Nice view,5.0,,The place has a nice view. We can see the fancy buildings of the city...
,,must try river cruise,5.0,,Took the cruise that starts from the Esplanade just around 7 pm - best time for variety of shots as the sun is setting. Then take a seat by the water and enjoy the laser show from the Marina Bay Sands...Makansutra is also highly recommended
,,Must vist attraction but expensive for sure,4.0,,its a very nice place and a great architectural build and i would suggest that one atleast goes there to have a meal at on of the the top floor restaurants !!!
,,Good Mall,5.0,,"You can buy there all you wish, from Gucci till Ferrari, very modern and expansive."
,,Fantastic view with no entrance fee,4.0,,"If you visit Singapore, this is a place I will definately recommend, as it represent the 'today' of Singapore progress, yoy can get to see the skyline of MBS hotel, Merlion, Esplanade, Helix bridge, Fullerton Hotel (which used to be a post office). Take a stroll along the walkway. Yes, no entrance fee required, as compare to those attractions you would go in other countries.
Just take a bus, MRT. You can go any time of the day, sunrise, morning, late aftrenoon, sunset, night, this place got difference characters(noon is not recomended due to the heat), just remember to bring your camera.
Take your meals at Food court at Marina Square shopping centre, or the one under the Flyer, for a more economical meals.
Bring own water if want to save an extra bucks or two."
,,The best area in S'pore!!!,5.0,,"Don't miss the Marina bay area when you are in S'pore!!! Simply unforgettable, have a pic with the Merlion and take a pic of the Bay Sands!!"
,,More impressive from the bottom than from the top,3.0,,Went to the top. It is expensive and the view did not stricke me as I expected. Maybe because wheather was grey and we could not sit at the bar :(
,,Fantastic view from the pool!,4.0,,"Imagine swimming in an infinite pool on top of this enormous structure! I'd say it's very romantic esp. during night time, when the lights are all lit up... the view of the lighted city at night is just amazing!"
,,Wonderful time there,4.0,,Shopping was good place was clean with restaurants around.
,,Its just a bay,3.0,,"I didnt find the Bay that interesting. The Merlion was cool, the flyer was cool, but the bay itself didnt impress me."
,,Mind boggling,4.0,,"We had not been to Singapore for 30 years and the changes were phenomenal. Marina Bay did not exist last visit. The land has been reclaimed, and the area has beautiful new buildings, art centre, HUGE shopping area, restaurants and bars. Interesting walking tour. Well worht a visit and easy to get to on the underground."
,,The best way to view Singapore.,4.0,,"I did saw the commencement of this landmark's construction when I worked in Singapore, back in 2005.
Upon returning back to Singapore in 2011, I was really amazed by the beauty and marvelous architecture of the building. But what makes it interesting is the deck on the top floor which is utilized for sightseeing spot.

From the top of the building, you could see almost all of Singapore. And I believe, if there is a Grand Prix race, you could see everything from there."
,,Great views but too much clicky clicky!,4.0,,"Part with $20 SG, have a photo taken, take the lift to the top, have another photo taken, see the spectacular views....have another photo taken.

Everywhere you turn the staff are taking your photo so they can sell it to you when you are waiting for the lift - this was the bad part and made me feel like I was at an amusement park (maybe I was???).

In any case this is a must do in Singapore. The views are spectacular, but certainly go at night for the lights - there is also a laser and video show, which while best viewed at water level is still good from up high.

Caution that there are no seats, and should you sit on the ground to admire the lights you'll be swiftly moved on - my wife and I joked about it and thought we'd see how long before security swooped (about 2 minutes)."
,,The new Marina Bay Development,5.0,,"As we stayed in the very smart and pleasant Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Marina Bay was pivotal to our daily moves. It comprises a very modern shopping centre, an art gallery, an MRT station and various pedestrian walks. Do not miss the light and sound show in the evening."
,,A truly remarkable architectural icon,5.0,,"Marvel at the genius architecture of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and casino, but the views from the skypark is like no other in Singapore. Plus, there is the highest infinite pool in the world"
,,Great nighttime atmosphere,4.0,,We enjoyed strolling Marina bay at night with all the lights and the place was 'a buzz'. We had a difficult time finding a place to enjoy a drink that was not packed after 7pm.
,,amazing,5.0,,"looks amazing in daylight, then go too the top of the marina bay sands and visit the cocktail bar too watch the sunset and see singapore in all its night glory"
,,Stunning from the outside,4.0,,The building is stunning from the outside. Inside is a huge shopping mall full of luxury designer shops. The mall was very empty of shoppers when I visited. Views from the top of the buildings are great.
,,intheclouds,5.0,,"liked it all was so fasinating and the view outstanding well worth going to the top on the boat, So unique."
,,Fabulous architecture!,5.0,,One of the best architecture of the current times. The Marina Bay has everything a city would like to see. Modernity in the midst of a beautiful landscape. A must for Singapore visitors. Everywhere is a nice sight to see.
,,Perfect place,5.0,,This was a piece of heaven in Singapore. The view and the atmosphere was the best Singaporean experience. But the name of its MRT is confusing as we must get down at the rafles place MRT station.
,,Fantastic range of choice,4.0,,"There are just so many good restaurants here - Sky on 57, Imperial treasures, Waku Ghin, Kudeta, DB Bistro to name just a few. the bar at Kudeta is great for gatherings also."
,,Great walk with lots to see.,3.0,,"Very clean, nice shops and places to get a cool drink and something to eat."
,,Fantastic sight,5.0,,The most fascinating part of Singapore with a dedicated part to the Art...night and day
,,Tourists be aware..Forum Seafood boat quay,4.0,,The area was very nice and enjoyed the light show...however we decided to have dinner by the canal on our last night.There is about 15 restaurants overlooking the water all next to each other.. owners were touting for business and the guy at Forum Seafood offered us a free drink with our meal. We were given a small saucer of peanuts which we thought were complimentary with our drinks. Our mains arrived before our apertiser and had to be sent back. They forgot to bring rice with our main so we had to ask for it. When it came to the bill we had been charged for the peanuts and also the serviette/towlettes which were with our cutlery. The manager was called and my husband explained why he had crossed off the extra charges including the 10% service charge..the manager said ok and we left. It seems that Forum Seafood has 6 restaurants on Boat Quay...they advertise up to 60% off seafood but still very expensive as the price is for 100grams....so we didnt end up having seafood. Our meals were nice although very small for the price.Would not recommend.
,,Sands skypark? Just that.,3.0,,"if you are a first timer going to Singapore or first timer go to the height, it is a great experience. But if already your second or third visit to Singapore, everything just like that."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Myself and 11 year old daughter visited sky park and had such a good time up there, the views were amazing!"
,,Great Complex,5.0,,"The relatively new Marina Bay complex includes a large 3-tower hotel with the pool area stretched across the top of all three towers 57 stories up, and a large shopping/conference/entertainment complex across the street.

I have not stayed at the hotel, thgough several colleagues did and said it was quite busy with families. The complex across the street was an excellent venue for a large conference, and the shops go on and on."
,,lovely place to chill,4.0,,":ove the view, especially in the night. the skyline is breathtaking. Atmosphere is ...very nice!"
,,Impressive centre,4.0,,Many very expensive shops but some nice restaurants & a great laser / water/ music show - we caught it at 8pm overlooking the Bay.
,,The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands are tacky,3.0,,I found the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands pretty tacky and I don't think they will age well.
,,Lovely casino and shopping,5.0,,Great idea with the hotel on one side and the shopping and Casino on the other side. An amazing building. The only thing I didn't like was the smoking in the casino.
,,Mind blowing !,5.0,,A masterpiece of engineering ! The view from the top is exceptional and the facilities within the complex are extremely varied
,,Great,5.0,,Great for shops and all things modern. The shopping mall here is something not to be missed
,,"Great Daytime, Fantastic Nighttime",5.0,,We visited Singapore several times... Everytime we were there it was just awesome. The feelings of visiting places between daytime and night time were so different. You may try both. I posted some photos you can see.
,,Definitely a must try for overnight next time!,4.0,,great place to watch the sunset while enjoying the pool!
,,Worth it?,3.0,,"The Marina bay is a complex with a commercial center and a hotel. The commercial center is fine, surprising (with an ice rink, and boating station) with a food court (good way to have fair and cheap food). The main interest of the marina bay is the roof top, offering a great view of Singapore. I was disappointed by the fact that only a small part of the roof top is accessible, not the whole part of it (with the pool reserved for the hotel guest), especially given the price of 20 SG$."
,,must do,5.0,,they have successfully converted hotel in to tourist place.
,,The High Living Place,4.0,,"Been there to watch the night show, was very nice and its free, few things tt are in Singapore. Big brand names in the shopping mall."
,,Super Place with one of the best views of the city!,5.0,,Its a must see place in Singapore. The sound and light they have for free every evening is awesome and is a must watch. This is one of the most talked about places in Singapore and is both super posh and super awe inspiring.
,,good place to eat,4.0,,lovely area with nice little shops and eating joints
,,"Nice sites, not good quality food",4.0,,very special views but lacked a quality restaurante open in the day
,,nice view,4.0,,"many spot to take pic, river cruise but none cheap meal"
,,futuristic view...,5.0,,"The view of the city, the architecture, marina bay sands..."
,,great area and very modern.,5.0,,Walking is easy around this area but getting there can be a bit tricky following the map. Once there it is very worthwhile.
,,Magnificent water show,5.0,,"The nightly water show on the bay is absolutely amazing. It tells a story with water and projected images and video, as well as music, lighting and bubbles in the air. Definitely worth watching. Brought a tear to my eyes.
Plays a few times each night, and more on weekends."
,,The bay,5.0,,Amazing view. Photographs -Go there. Thinkers- Go there.
,,light and water show,5.0,,I went in the evening to the light and water show. I went to the last show at 9.30 and it was really beautiful. So was also the view in the evening from Marina Bay. Get out at tram station bayfront for the good view and the water/light show.
,,The magic Singapore,5.0,,"Fabulos place , new architecture not yet Hong Konk but no doubt it will be better later. Couls be a symbol of the cities in the future."
,,Huge property with huge casino,4.0,,"The Marina Bay casino has all the games. There are two levels, the upper one is non-smoking. I tried a card game called Pontoon. Its like blackjack with some special rules."
,,Too commercialised,3.0,,It is a typical Singapore overstatement and over development. However Sinagporeans seem to enjoy it.
,,back to the future,5.0,,"space age architecture and stunning sky-top views plants Singapore firmly in tomorrow's world. They haven't got time for today here, let alone yesterday, even though its colonial past is never far away. The experience at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is memorable but the view from the taller Swissotel is better AND free. Of all the cities I visited in SE Asia I gained the greatest sense of being in a melting pot of cultures and culinary experiences"
,,Nice 360 deg view at the top,5.0,,If you want to get a glimpse of the Sgp city and coast in a birds-eye view .... this is the place.
,,Engineering Marvel!,5.0,,An engineering marvel not to be missed in singapore.
,,Interesting,4.0,,Only visited the shopping mall but enjoyed the visit and the sights. Canal boats were a surprise and the coffee shop offered delicious cuisine. Should try to visit the hotel next time
,,Good casino,4.0,,"Interesting casino with good entertainment avenues. One can enjoy the roulette wheel, poker on individual gaming screens"
,,Amazing City,4.0,,"Fantastic view, a village by itself. The hotel is impressive and the shopping malls is a must to see. Beautiful both during the day and night time to visit."
,,Is Singapore turning into Las Vegas,4.0,,"Although I like the Marina Bay area with its Casino, shopping mall, Sky Park hotel & laser light show, I did feel as if I was in Las Vegas. I'm not sure why Singapore has decided to go down this route but I assume with the influx of Chinese tourists, it's one way to beat the financial crisis. Although the casino was on par with Vegas, it was not as friendly as the Vegas casinos - maybe it was the fact that the slots were not very loose for me! Overall, it's worth a trip to this new part of Singapore to take in the razzamataz"
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"This was my thrid trip to Singapore over the last 3 years so I was really excited to see the hotel fully complete as both times it was in a transition stage of being built. At first sight I was blown away as it looks stunning, both at day and at night. I didn't stay here but visited the Sky Park which afforded me, in my opinion, the best view of Singapore. I went up at twilight so I saw the transition from day to night and it wasn't too busy. At the top there is a nice breeze which comes as a welcome releif from the heat and humidity on ground level. As I was walking past the esplanade on my way to my hotel there was a light show with laser beams etc which reminded me of the spectacular light show they have every evening in Hong Kong. Definitely worth a visit."
,,A people place,4.0,,"This area was great to walk and people watch. It is the center of activities in Singapore. Attractions, views and restaurants are all around. i will hit this area again on my next trip to Singapore."
,,Modern but with some traditional touches,5.0,,"It is huge! But very easy to get around. There during the sales, so some bargains to be had, but not in the big names though. Loved the cleanliness, and the classiness. The nice touch is the food court with great local food and really good & surprising high value meals."
,,innovative building,3.0,,"the view is pretty much the same as the singapore flyer but you are outside on the roof ,so different experience. the day I went up it was freezing and blowing a gale . The lift up was so fast I couldnt believe it !"
,,Gem of Singapore,5.0,,Hotel was really beautiful. Laser show in the night was really un-forgetful.
,,Casino!!!,5.0,,"Went to the Marina Bay Casino, really big Casino!! they even separated the entrance for residence and foreigner :) I guess it's because their government policy due to gambling. But it worth to visit for the entertainment and just try your luck there :)"
,,Great area to vist,5.0,,"So much to do and see here. Something here for everyone. Shopping, food and cleanliness very impressive."
,,Must See,5.0,,A visit to Marina Bay is a must in Singapore - we stayed at the Marina Mandarin and our room overlooked the Marina - spectacular views. Boat-trip up the river is a must too.
,,Beautiful city Landscape,5.0,,"Having a meal or just chill at any of the outdoor cafes is nice, relaxed and superb view of the river and offices / hotels around"
,,State of the Art,5.0,,"The place is so unique, perfectly designed and so accessible"
,,Simply Excellent,5.0,,"Well expensive of course but Worth the money, the roof top restaurant is very nice and windy.
With view of the Singapore Flyer that looks pretty small from here. one of the best scenic beauty.
hence i call it a combination of two EX's - Expensive & EXcellent.
If you can afford , pl go to the pool and look at the city view."
,,A good experience just walking down the promenade,5.0,,I loved the entire experience but could not get a taxi from there. There are good bars and the shopping experience is great. The walk down the promenade in the evening was very pleasant. the laser show afterwards was a real surprise. All of Singapore was there to watch it and it seemed very festive.
,,WOW,5.0,,"It was just amazing, make sure you visit. The lift was an experience, 56 floors in 45 seconds and the view spectacular."
,,Romantic nite by the Bay,5.0,,start from Helix Bridge around 6pm and make your way through to Merlion. Stop and dine at MakanSutra Glutton Bays and watch the Laser show from the Marina Bay Sands every have and hour
,,Scenic View from The Top,4.0,,"You will be taken by high-speed elevator to take you to the top level of the building, just in 1 minute. From here, you can see the view of entire Singapore (Batam island can be seen in distance), but basically you got the same view when you try Singapore Flyer."
,,Brilliant shopping - Watch out Orchard Rd,5.0,,This location has it all in air conditioned comfort. No need to sweat it out down Orchard Rd. All the names are here
,,it's good way enjoy singapore city view here!,5.0,,Like enjoy coffee while sitting in front of the shoppe
,,The latest attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Glamorous Casinos, vast variety of good restaurants, chic shopping, fantastic view of the bay (especially from the rooftop bar / pool), right in the heart of action ...."
,,Nice views across the city,4.0,,The hotel is just to big and it's to easy to become lost and insignificant in this Las Vegas style resort hotel. The restaurant in the lobby had a nice atmosphere but was pricey. The location means you can't really walk anywhere and need to take a taxi. There are much nicer hotels in Singapore than this I have stayed in
,,Nice scenery,4.0,,"Wow, impressive scenery you will see here, with the Marina Bay Sands as the main backdrop. Check out Esplanade too"
,,Great.,5.0,,Excellent well worth a visit. Great shopping too. Did the Singapore Flyer well worth it even though it was overcast.

,,One of the best places to relax,5.0,,"Marina Bay houses the actual bay, the Singapore Flyer which is a giant ferris wheel, and malls, hotels, etc.

A great place to visit, take in the sights of Singapore on the Singapore flyer, take a walk along the bay or cool down in the malls. Whatever you do, you will love it!"
,,amazing structure,5.0,,"Seeing the newest building was great. Fantastic to be able to shop in all the shops downstairs in the towers, and then ascend to the top of the 'boat' for spectacular views of the bay."
,,Lazer Show @ Night - Best seen so far,5.0,,"It is difficult to explain the Marina Bay in terms of visiting possibilities.
There is so much happening early in the morning, at noon, in the evening ; and at Night.
However please do not miss the Lazer show in the late evening at 8.30 & again after an hour."
,,Nice scenery in the evening,4.0,,"A view of the Sands hotel was just amazing. If you don't have anything to do on a Week-end evening, this is one place to go. It shows a good light-work display accompanied with great music. If you are watching it across the hotel, the view of the night sky line is also an added attraction"
,,It is a good place that you can stay a day and night there,4.0,,"When you are there you can visit Merlion park, Merina hotel, Flyer. If you go to the top of the hotel,When you are buy the thicket, tell them, you are interesting to visit the swimming pool at top. the time is about 8 PM, and it is limmited for about 40 person (no charge). You can see Laser dancing from the top this hotel and flyer too."
,,No Halal food,3.0,,"So many restaurants and cafes and not one serve Halal food. We came all the way with a baby stroller, looking for a nice dinner and wound up eating toast. The lights show is overrated. Just OK for me. But you get a nice view of the waterfront."
,,Little Orchard,5.0,,"Found so many good shops in all the different shopping centres. great hotels. How amazing is that there is a soccer field in the bay. Worth the visit, the air conditioned shops are a necessaryretreat"
,,marina bay,5.0,,"loved this area , the views atop the marina bay sands are spectacular. definetly a must to do"
,,Immposible to flag down taxi,2.0,,It's very difficult to get a taxi in this area n need to get the hotel to call one (extra charges) n there seems to be a lot of extra charges on top of meter fare
,,"Ah, the view!",4.0,,"The view is a must see. The nightclub, Kudeta, gives a proper club feel. If you are a guest with the hotel you have access to the infinity pool. Go for some lunch and a swim! Do not order a Mojito, but a Daquiry! :)"
,,"Kudeta Restaurant, Marina Bay Sands",5.0,,"It's very classy, I love the place! Food is good. It's really the best place i've ever been!! Suits my lifestyle and taste. Very nice view. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. It's a wonderful experience to be treated like a queen."
,,a very very nice hotel,5.0,,"i stayed at MBS for only a day. it is a very very nice hotel and if i go to singapore again,i will stay at this hotel. the room is not great but it is marvelous!!!! the staff is very friendly and helpful... but the only problem is the price,hehehe."
,,Peter K. Adelaide. Australia,5.0,,"Your not paying for the rooms but the view,the room is what you'd expect from a 4 star to 5 star hotel,and that's about it,unfortunately,its priced as a 6 star.Fashion design and a wonderful sky pool.Highly recommend the breakfast at Sky Bar 57.Night view from the sky pool offers Singapore beautiful sky line and lighting,nex to hotel one can find the Marina Bay shoppes,a whole array of luxury brands,restaurants and a food court,and casino."
,,Breath-taking views of Singapore,5.0,,"So much to do and see. Marina Bay Shoppes has every brand under the sun, casino and theatre, while boasting a river running through the mall. At night you can see the light show. And at sunset be sure to go to the observation deck at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel where you'll get a 360 degree view of Singapore. Bring your camera!"
,,Nice but a little pricey,4.0,,Worth it just for the pool but the rooms are just ok. A little small and nothing special.
,,2 nights max here,4.0,,"nodoubt that this hotel is an experience. the pool is a must swim at any price. but if you are on a vacation, the hotel gives you a very business feel. the hotel is full of people and makes you feel as if one is in a mega convention. the minibar is sensor based. you get billed even if you look at a product. after 2 days, there is nothing to enjoy in this hotel. but rooms are nice and the hotel has 2500 rooms. after sometime, you would like to go to a quite place."
,,Great walk to walk around and tour,5.0,,"Take a duck tour and walk around and see the area. Main thing is go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands. One of the best views in the world. Brian Efird Winston Salem, NC 27101"
,,Amazing building and view,4.0,,Lunch was expensive ($171 with only one beer) - but the view was terrific. I would stay there just to try the infinity pool.
,,Fun and laughs,4.0,,A must see at least once. Great architecture! Roof top pool is splendid. What a feat to design and build. Appreciated it for all it is and enjoy a dip!
,,Best view & shopping experience,4.0,,It's easy to get here with the MRT or taxi. The mall is full of upscale shops and the Sky Park on top of Marina Bay Sands resort offer breath taking view of the city. A Must if you go to Singapore.

,,"Watch out for a free water, lights and sound show to fascinate ur night",4.0,,"A free 15mins show that shows about using water , lights and sound to amaze you. Worth a visit if you are in that area. Shows depends on the day, I went on a sat night for the 9:30pm, there is also another 11pm on sat. Bring kids along for catching some bubbles as they release into the air and blow towards the sky. Look for seats early before the show slightly 10mins before."
,,have to go,5.0,,beautiful place and many things to do!! go to the marina bay sands hotel up top for a drink and you will never want to leave!
,,Flashy and expensive,3.0,,"This is a beautiful mall with many high end designer stores as well as a theater, ice rink, celebrity restaurants, casino, etc. you can end up spending a lot of money here. Walk over on the helix bridge. The skyline is amazing at night."
,,Limited to high end brands,4.0,,"Marina Bay mall is a classy mall with all the possible high end brands under one roof. It's got a food court filled with every cousine from each corner of the world. Try the restaurants on level one which are great. One is celebrity chef Jiggs Kalras Punjab Grill, which offers Indian cuisine which absolutely does justice to the food. The mall has its coffee bean located at the Whirlpool Water Fountain art which is a beautiful display of water in an arty form by a world famous artist and you are sipping coffee by a pool of water through which canoes keep passing by. Another must see part of the mall is the Wonderful sound and laser light water show (free) which happens in the evening at around 7 pm. It tells you about the importance of our natural resource specially water. The show ends with water bubbles flying all over the horizon. Just outside of the mall where the show takes place is the coolest Louis Vuitton showroom made from glass on the waters. Worth the trip to see the show and the mall which is quite a trip if you travel by metro. Taking a cab is faster and more scenic."
,,Amazing architecture & shops,4.0,,"Fantastic shops, good places to eat. Parking expensive at weekends"
,,Stunning area,5.0,,"A beautiful area that has a backdrop of singapores best buildings, watching the wonderfull light show is a must"

,,Amazing views!!,4.0,,"Well worth the trip to check out the views from the observation deck! We also had a cocktail in the hotel bar called Fuse, excellent service!"
,,Looks an architectural marvel !,5.0,,We saw it from the Duck tour which we had taken. Its a marvel and heard that it has 18 rooms designed for your choice of preference. There is a good shopping complex at the base. You could take a ticket and visit the hotel. Its about 20 $
,,Alweays something going on,4.0,,"Marina Bay is picturesque, clean, lots of good eats, often live music on weekends, good shopping."
,,Wonderful free light show,4.0,,Could not get directions to the metro and was left feeling abandoned in a dark place afterwards. Singapore should think things through a bit more - visitors do not know where things are and better communication would be most welcome.
,,Good experience,3.0,,"Great views, but the observation deck is not that huge. There's only 1 restaurant and no view from it."
,,Great place to be,5.0,,"if I need to pick one place to visit in Singapore would be here. The atmosphere it's amazing and you can find every little thing in here: local culture, world culture, shopping, theatre, food, amazing view where ever you look, safety, live! Just love here!"

,,Super Singapore,5.0,,Just about everything - the longer I was in Singapore the more I liked it
,,Huge shopping mall,3.0,,"On one side of the bay you have the CFD on the other one the Marina Bay Sands Mall, which is a huge (I mean really huge) luxury shopping mall. OK all top brands are under one roof, but they are not cheaper than elsewhere so what is the fuss. Plus the F1 showcar in the Ferrari shop is four years old and you are not allowed to take pics of it from within the shop"
,,Great hang around place,5.0,,"I often stroll around at Marina Bay. The place is just out of this world and i dont mean the view from the top of the boat but in the general the ambience. Every evening there are 2 light and sound shows outside at the bay and even without the shows the view of the other side, Fullerton and the financial center is rewarding. Such a unique combination of the old and the new.
Inside there are a few top notch restaurants, including french, italian, indian and nouvelle cuisine and even a respectable hawker center all the way at the end of the basement. But my favorite is the Marina Bay Sands buffet ! Really one of the best buffets i ever had. ( I have been around.. ) For the late nighters the lobby cafe is open 24 hours.
If thats not enough you also have the casino trying to lure you in... nice spacious casino but bye bye to ones money too...
The shopping is abundant and down between the casino and the hotel you have some of the most expensive jewelry shops in the world... worth walking this little alley, that will get you to the entrance of the mrt ( circle line ) another convenience of the Marina Bay."
,,Everything you need under one roof,4.0,,"Architecture, food and shops are great. Spend a few hours walking around."
,,Show me the money!,4.0,,"We went to the mall here and spent heaps. All your regular European designer stores and much more. The food court is great, but note that it is much more expensive here to eat than Orchard Road."
,,Great at night,5.0,,It's gorgeouse at night and you can just walk on top to see everything - for free!
,,"Artificial, but fun, with lots to do",4.0,,"A floating soccer field, an arts and science museum, and extensive shopping and places to eat in the shops at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Light shows at night were lovely."
,,UNBELIEVABLE!,5.0,,Words can't describe how beautiful this hotel\resort is.
,,Finally a great place to stroll in Singapore,4.0,,"There is a pedestrian walkway that circles the entire bay, with fabulous architecture (the Fullerton, concert hall, Marina Bay Sands), fun eating/coffee/drink spots (The Esplanade, One Fullerton, the Mall at Marina Bay Sands), and great strolling. It really makes staying in that area a lot of fun and visually, the views are spectacular."
,,A very rewarding afternoon walk by the bay,4.0,,"I did not mind the heat of the afternoon sun and the long walk to the Merlion Park to find Singapore's emblem...on the way I got more..Marina Sands, Esplanade, Singapore Flyer, Helix Bridge..no wonder the crowd gets bigger towards dusk when the Marina Bay puts on its light show...the sights at the Bay were more than enough to soothe my aching feet"
,,"Marina Bay, High Class, High Prices",3.0,,"All branded shops you could really be in any global up-market shopping mall, Nothing really Singaporean about it. Nice for a walk around the waterfront. Casino attached. Passport Required"
,,soooo beautiful,5.0,,"just walk around and have fun looikng Merlion,the Olimpic park,the museum,the marina bay sands!"
,,"Plain adventures, not much to do..just only the view from the telescope. The restaurant is very expensive.. Only plain",3.0,,"The view is good, but nothing to do....Plain...Not good for children who loves to play"
,,RE: Branded Goods,4.0,,This is where you would probably find your favourite branded goods.
,,A shopping centre worth the visit,5.0,,If you enjoy spending time in shopping centres then Marina Bay is excellent. Seems to have everything for everybody. Well worth a visit.
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,nothing much to say though except it has somewhat become the it place to take pictures and to mesmerize over the Marina bay sands hotel and its' shopping and entertainment facilities.
,,Top of the world,4.0,,"Singapore seems to keep re-inventing bigger and better.

The very efficient and reliable underground system will deliver you to one of several ways into the hotel/ shopping/ casino/ food metropolis.

You don't really get a feel for how big the hotel complex really is from the inside. Its only when you get up to the rooftop area via the super highspeed lifts that you suddenly realise how immense this is.

As a visitor you can get tickets for about $20SD to go to roof viewing area and Ku De Ta bar and restaurant, or for a little extra you can use the rooftop infinity swimming and leisure area.

We only went to the bar and viewing area but well worth the trip. 73 floors up in the sky with a 360 degree view that takes in the whole of Singapore and the seemingly endless flotilla of tankers and freighters filling the sea from end to end.

As with all things in Singapore, its very clean, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the concept is immense.

Strolling round the outer edge of the viewing area with its transparent plexi-glass walls is at the same time very daunting and very inspiring. The view is fantastic but getting so close to the edges was a bit scary. We did partake of a drink in the bar to celebrate what we thought of as being very brave and enjoyed the view in comfort.

Coming back down in the express lifts took us to the huge shopping complex underneath the hotel, which was another mind blowing experience in its own right.

As we came into the mall there was a whole gallery dedicated to some of the biggest names in jewelley and watches with the likes of Patek Phillipe, Cartier and Bulgari taking up a lot of space. Coming further into the shopping mall brought us more to brands that we could afford rather than just drool at and 3 hours later we were still walking round working out how we could remortgage the house to buy everything we had liked.

The complex also houses a massive casino and theatre setting.

There is just so much to see and experience here and so well laid out.

If you only have a short amount of time make sure you go to the rooftop bar if nothing else."
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"This was and experience, we had seen a tv show on the making of the building, never dreaming to see it for real. Absolutely brilliant views, and beautiful shopping area. The lift was so quick, we took lots of photos, a must do in Singapore"
,,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,4.0,,"Go to the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel for $20 and enjoy the view of Singapore. You can also have an (expensive) photo taken of yourself taken inf ront of a green screen, as if you were standing in front of the hotel at night with its laser show."
,,Spectacular experience to overstimulate everyone,5.0,,"Marina Bay area offers so many options for everyone. We travelled to Marina Bay by river from our hotel, which I would highly reccomend. This place is a cultural, architectural, site seeing, and shopping mecca with something for everyone. Beware there are a lot of people in the area. You must visit the top of the hotel to see the city and stick around for the light show. SPECTACULAR"
,,amazing,5.0,,fantastic view from the top a must do. Go at 7pm so get the best of day and night.
,,Nice area for a bout trip to see the huge buildings. Nice in day and night time.,5.0,,I liked the boat trip in the Marina bay. You get a nice view on Singapore's skyscrapers!
,,Marina Bay I love so much,5.0,,if you need fresh air then you will go there & see how look to night how look to life
,,Truly Phenominal Experience,5.0,,"Three of this phenominal city-state country's fabulous icons are situated around Marina Bay. From their historic giant Merlion that guards the waterfront to the world's largest ferris wheel (the Singapore Flyer) to the astounding 55-story tri-tower topped by an apparent giant long boat that comprises the world's most expensive free-standing casino/resort/dining/shopping and entertainment complex (the Marina Bay Sands), this place has more than can ever be expected. Astounding luxuries abound and amaze. Cultures from all corners of Asia and the world meld here, but astonishingly, are easily discovered and understood (by Western hemisphere visitors) because the signage and spoken language are primarily English! Don't pass on an opportunity to visit this wonderland in general, or this particular city location specifically."
,,Marina bay sands hotel.,5.0,,Well worth visit to this amazing hotel complex and casino and shops galore. Many different dinng options to suit all pockets. Shops have increased dramatically since marina bay sands first opened. Free night light show. Visited science museum to see titanic exhibition whch was great. Pleasant marina front and water taxis available over to Fullerton area and meriton park area.
,,Take the tour to the top!,5.0,,We typically do not do touristy things but our clients hosted us on the tour to the top of the building. Fascinating views and a phenomenal story behind the building of the towers and the parks below. A MUST SEE (and listen to the guided tours.)
,,WORTHY,5.0,,Marina bay is well worth the effort with a host of views to enjoy
,,See the future,4.0,,The ArtScience Museum designed in the shape of a water lotus and Marina Sands with its skypark are stunning
,,Great for the Singapore skyline!!!,4.0,,"The building is striking, but the interior foyer leaves a lot to be desired. It looks very industrial and I am sure that it could have been done in much better taste. The Casino across the road is worth a visit and has reasonable value eating place. Did not go up to the roof of the hotel, but I am sure that the view would be worth every cent."
,,Huge Shopping Complex,4.0,,Great scenery at night and very huge complex. Couldn't finish walking around in 1 day. Great selection of celebrity chef restaurant.
,,Favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,For me this is the no. place in the world especially in the evening view.I enjoyed this place because the view so nice the building the store the resto like shininng stars .
,,great scenery,5.0,,"the place is a historic place in itself, we find it very breathtaking with its unique structures of buildings seen around the bay. Experience is superb.."
,,Great views,4.0,,Great views of the downtown area from the top of the hotel in Marina Bay. Well worth a trip. The light show is free with a band on the esplanade. Cannot beat that for free.
,,A Singapore highlight and feature,5.0,,"This is a visual treat with a modern shopping complex. Additionally, the developing gardens all around, connecting to the barrage with a demonstration of this engineering marvel, make this a worthwhile adventure to mark a Singapore visit."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Did not stay at the hotel, but did go up to the top for the views. Fantastic concept and the infinity pool at the top is mind boggling--looks like people are ready to go over the edge, yet they are perfectly safe. And for more great views, go across the water and go during sun down. Views of the building and how the sun reflects off of it are amazing. Don't leave Singapore without getting a few views of this."
,,"Nice to look at, but expensive",3.0,,"Great area to wander around and look at but be prepared to pay big $$ for anything - food, drinks or shopping."
,,Cool Shopping Mall and Hotel!,5.0,,"Huge shopping mall and amazing hotel, especially the park on top. It's a must see for first timers in Singapore!"
,,Marina Bay Sands.....,4.0,,Have to visit the Sky Deck of the Bay sands. A great view of all of Singapore !!
,,Marina Bay visit,4.0,,"It is convenient to get to Marina Bay by trains from almost anywhere in Singapore. Singapore is very well served by its public transport and it is cheap. The view is good. The shops are OK, however prices are a bit dearer than other shopping centres. The food court is good. A lot of choices and reasonably priced."
,,"View from Marina Bay Sands, absolutely beautiful",5.0,,"if you have to choose bet. Singapore Flyer or view from top of the Sands, go with the later one: same price and higher!"
,,Fantastic Laser Show,4.0,,"The laser show was fantastic, great story line - the technology was amazing."
,,beautiful landscape,5.0,,it's busy modern places marina bay is the new icon of singapore and visit marina bay in the night and get to marina observation decks is a must !
,,Impressive,5.0,,To anyone interested in the modern side of singapore this is the place for you! Well worth a look and the views over singapores waterfront are nice!
,,Wow!,5.0,,Six billion dollars worth of dazzle! And the slot machines were user-friendly!
,,Views from KuDeTa are outstanding,5.0,,"Marina Bay with the Marina Sands Hotel, casino, flower-shaped museum and shopping is the new ""in"" place on Singapore harbor."
,,dramatic setting and architecture,5.0,,"most of new Singapore is built around the bay..Beautiful horels, shopping centers, view points, etc. Make sure you see it at night as well"
,,"Poor service, understaffed",2.0,,"The hotel is really a convention hotel. The crowd is mixed and you end up getting lost in the myriad of signs. Check in starts at 3pm and the line was longer than a busy supermarket. Guests had no idea whether to queue in front of each agent or follow one line. In the end, guests starting fighting with each other and the staff did nothing. Even when we reached the check in agent, it took at least 15 minutes for them to key in whatever info they needed at their computer and you just stand and wait. Total disappointment and inefficiency.
Elevator banks were very confusing and you are left alone to navigate the directions. There is a line at the concierge desk too just to pick up a map or ask general questions.
Rooms were fine but the sliding door of the bathroom did not block sound if more than one person is staying in the room. It is not worth the price at all.
Hotel guests have free access to the rooftop pool but you must pass through security like entrance to a disco. Even after entry, you realize there is no lounge chairs and the place is a mix of Hard Rock cafe plus amusement park. It was very hectic and not relaxing at all.
Breakfast was the worst out of all the hotels in the world. Even IHOP or McDonalds offered better food and service. There was a 10-15 long line to get seated, and once there, no service was available to bring coffee nor napkins. I wish the food quality or taste could compensate for the lack of service, but it was poor as well.
Check out took 15 minutes as well and there were billing errors such as breakfast charges when our stay included free breakfast. Even the manager knew their service was lacking but could not offer any goodwill or response.
Total disappointment considering the construction and setting. Too bad."
,,Marvelous view – no queue – no cost,5.0,,"Maybe we were just lucky that day, but we were able to go to the top floor, without any queuing nor paying any access. Is is a real recommendation to go up and enjoy the view.

We took the elevator around 11 in the morning in Tower 1 up to floor 57. There you have the top roof restaurant and the access to the swimming pool, but it is possible to appreciate the view over the bay and Singapore at both sides of the building, without paying any access."
,,beautiful,5.0,,the place was beautiful and really peace place. i use to go there to just sit down and drinking.
,,Interesting architecture and Merlion,4.0,,"We visited the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Sky Deck and enjoyed the awsome views especially with a large thunderstorm approaching. The infinite swimming pool is something to see also. On another morning we walked along the Bay on the opposite side and walked past interesting architecture, odd seats, the Merlion, the ""durian"" building etc."
,,"Great Building,Great Gambling",4.0,,"I went to this place for 1 reason, GAMBLE!!

I'm not a gambler, but my friend is
The worst part is he couldnt speak English and he came alone, I have to accompany him everywhere.

I came to the Casino at 7 or 8 AM, It is hard to get there by public transportation from Marine Parade.
The hotel is awesome, the shopping mall is full of branded store and the casino is very big.
Anyway I get in the casino, whoah..the casino is huge..the room is nicer than the one in Sentosa Island, and it is more quiet than Sentosa Island, maybe it is because I came there at 7-8 Am in the morning.

We have a good time in there except when we lost our money in gambling in 30 minutes.

I can say, it is a great place to gambling, an elegant casino.
Next visit I will check the mall"
,,excellent!,5.0,,splendid view and laser show!!! felt like being in a different world here....the aura around is so refreshing
,,Boat tour,4.0,,"Loved it boat tour in the evening gave great opportunity to take some great photos, loads to places to eat and drink, def worth a visit"
,,Singapore April 2012,5.0,,"One could spend all day at Marina Bay - apart from the shopping arcades (so many shops - wow) the ArtScience Museum is right outside - we visited the Andy Warhol & Titanic Exhibitions for a total cost of only S$23. The views from this location are terrific, especially at night."
,,Nice restaurant selection on level 1 and 57,4.0,,Marina Bay has to be seen in person. It's an awesome destination...
,,a must see very impressive mega structure !,5.0,,We were turned away from the bar on the boat deck floor as we were told we were not dressed appropriately (smart casual and before 7pm) so we just milled around the top deck to take in the views its a must see and very impressive
,,"You've got to go here, a little expensive but the view is fantastic",5.0,,This iconic building almost wills you to get up close and see it and then go to the top. The view is magnificent and this makes it all worth it
,,WOW !!!,5.0,,The shopping is five star in air conditioning :) ALL the top brands are there. The views on this side of the bay are picturesque. Great places to eat. There is an ice rink and a theatre for live shows with AMAZING sound facitilities. Certainly did justice for 'Wicked' Easy to get to with a walkway or via a boat cruise. The view on the top is unbelievable but there were ALOT of people there
,,Plan on spending hours just queueing and getting around the place,2.0,,I heard that you could go and use the hotel infinity pool for $20 per person. Turned out you can only look at the pool for $20 per person. The place is vast and cavernous and it takes forever to find anything. Queues (a la Singapore) abound. On the outside the building is ugliness personified. Inside its quite an architectural marvel. But the cost and effort to get here - definitely not worth it. Unless you're into gambling or want to spend a large fortune at Ku De Ta.
,,Do your shopping here,5.0,,"We went to Marina Bay for the Theatre to see ""Wicked"" (which we loved) and wished we had had more time to spend here. Amazing selection of shops, huge food court, fine dining restaurants (very expensive), ice rink for the kids, gondola rides and then the fabulous light show in the evening. We ran out of time for the museum and the line was too long to get up to the Sky Park (and really expensive: would have been $68 for our family of 4). Impressive place. Would go back for another show in the future."
,,Everything at your fingertips,5.0,,Great area in Singapore for good wining and dining and excellent shopping...a must visit
,,See the Top but for a drink only.,3.0,,"It's a must visit because of the architecture, but don't eat at one of the restaurants on the top. The one we ate at had a fab view and poor food. Go for a drink and dine elsewhere. However, the food court where we had lunch has a choice of multinationals and I would recommend a stop there."
,,A shopping and dining haven near the bay,4.0,,"I remember Marina bay more as my shopping and dining destination in that part of Singapore. Suntec housed a lot of shopping outlets like Tommy Hilfiger, Zara, Nine West,British India, Promod etc. even my husband's favorite brand T M Lewin. For dining, we have variety of choices from Japanese, Italian, Indian, Malay cuisine."
,,Totally Awesome!,5.0,,"I love this place! Excellent service, rooms are of awesome standard and the atmosphere is very enriching! You gotta stay at this place!"
,,The Bay,5.0,,We did spend one afternoon walking up and down Singapore River down to the bay. Perfect walk for shooting nice photographs.
,,Caters to the night life,5.0,,"The place has different areas for enjying your night life, whether its just a drink or a little shake!!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Building,5.0,,"Wow, if you go to Singapore take the time to stop off at this building and catch the lift to the boat sitting on the top. Priced around $20 per person, but very worth it. You cannot enter the swimming pool at the top as that is for the Hotel patrons only, but you just don't need it. The view of Singapore and it's harbour is magnificent. Also walk through the malls at the bottom of the 3 towers, in the food court there is an Ice Skating Rink for the kids to use (not real ice) and also a river running throughout with Gondolars going up and down. Even the floor tiles are beautiful. This building is a must for visit in Singapore."
,,Best in the early morning or night,5.0,,"For just walking around the bay, taking in the architecture and sights, the early morning or night time are the best, when its not too hot. Day is good for shopping if you like that sort of thing, but an evening stroll around the bay, taking in the Light and Water show outside the Shoppes, is a nice thing to do."
,,Disappointed although incredible architecture,3.0,,It is a strange Mall. Shops seem very empty and has a cold atmosphere. Nice tea shops and restaurants. Building from the outside is worth taking a look for it's architectural uniqueness.
,,Great Location,5.0,,The location of the Marina Bay is just wonderful and great shopping malls too.
,,Subway,3.0,,The subway is complicated and direction signs posted are ambiguous. The person who wrote it is the audience of his/her publication.
,,great setting as tourist spot,4.0,,"Look a bit like the quay in Sydney. Clean and tidy. Love the environment there, with bars and restaurants by the side. which people can sit down and enjoy views in an evening."
,,Sprawling metropolis,4.0,,"I am a shopper, and Marina Bay has a lot of shops, and more. On a wet or humid day it would be worth a trip and the LV store is amazing."
,,Don't miss the Esplanade arts and entertainment,4.0,,"Go to the Esplanade at Marina Bay every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings for free music on the outdoor stage."
,,walking area,5.0,,"Nice and safe area to stroll around, have a drink or meal and just enjoy the city life. Light show/exhibition in April was thrilling."
,,Very high,4.0,,I have some drink at the bar over the top of building it was nice experience and it very high too
,,A very impressive sight,5.0,,"The first time you see Marina Bay you just don't know where to look. Everything is incredible. The buildings, the Sands, The Artscience museum, the Fullerton Bay hotel, the amazing floating football ground and of course last but not least the big and small Merlions, symbols of Singapore.

A must see in Singapore"
,,Beautiful location and view.,3.0,,"It was not very great experience as expected in this hotel's top resturant.The vegeterain items are so less to choose and that is problem with almost all the resturant in singapore.The location is so good and view is beautiful from 57th floor,there is should be some more attraction in the resturant to enjoy."
,,Marina Bay at Night,4.0,,"While we were visiting there was an evening light and sound show that was magnificent. Also another display which is seen from outside Marina Bay - tells a story via pictures onto water spray and lazer lights, bubbles etc. 8pm and 9.30pm nightly. Check first though as not sure if it is daily or only during warmer months."
,,"Excellent for the Marina Bay ,stay one day to there,must going this viewpoint",5.0,,"Marina Bay is a bay near Central Area in the southern part of Singapore, and lies to the east of the Downtown Core."

,,Modern,4.0,,The evening laser show is excellent. They know how to look after visitors/tourists. Shopping is for the well healed
,,Marina Sands,5.0,,Has to be seen to be believed. Views from the 57th floor at night are amazing.
,,wonderful view,4.0,,"sea breeze,out of the world feeling.green areas,good eating places.Just walk around with no worry on earth."
,,lots to see here,5.0,,This area is a short walk from the Mandarin Oriental. We walked entirely around the marina. Many photo spots.
,,Go here at night,5.0,,"We visited in the evening. Go up to the bar on the 57th floor and watch the sunset. Take pictures of the city at night. Great views. The bar is free, the drinks are expensive, but it's worth it. After the visit to the top, go down to the underground mall. Amazing. Then walk around outside. There is so much going on. Laser light & fountain show, performers, etc. One thing we found amazing was the huge whirlpool in about the middle of the outside concourse. Fascinating to watch. We left the Marina Sands by bum boat and went to Clarke Quay. Fun times."
,,Great View and Very Relaxing in the evening!,5.0,,"Great view of the Singapore and its charming city. We have spent about 2 hours walking from Bugis MRT to Marina Bay Sand, spent about 30 mins on the 65th floor to enjoy the night view of the city and finish at the Merlion Park. We came to Singapore almost solely for this great evening. We really enjoyed it."
,,Magnificent views!,5.0,,Magnificent views! Great place to visit both day time & night time.
,,Wonderful area,5.0,,"We enjoyed the views from KuDeTa around a glass of wine, has a walk on the esplanade and a nice dinner downstairs in the foodcourt - there you can find delicious food at affordable prices from all over Asia. I love Singapore and this spot is one of the most spectacular ones."
,,"Stopover in Singapore, make the most of it!",5.0,,"Limited time in Singapore? If you arrive at noon in Singapore. Check-in at your hotel. Take a taxi to the Botanical Garden and visit the National Orchid Garden. Continu with a taxi to the nightsafari in the Zoo. Young or old? you will like it! Then to Marina Bay Sands hotel for a party on the rooftop or try your luck at the Casino (don't forget to bring your international passport). Next day, take a boat trip on the Singapore River. Photostop at Merlion statue is a Singapore must... Then visit a museum: The Asian Civilisations Museum is a 'stroll' away from Merlion. I did like MINT museum (for toy lovers). Nice architecture. Lunch at the Quays. Shopping in Chinatown or Suntec City Mall and if some money left...a Singapore Sling cocktail in Long Bar at The Raffles Hotel (26 Sin$ ++) then on to catch your next flight. Have fun!"
,,Must visit the sky tower once,4.0,,"Marina bay sands had the best shopping brands and the best casino I had ever seen. The visit to sky tower costs 20 US$ per person but it is a must see if you are in Singapore. You can have the best view of the city and feel on top of the world :)
Pray to have a good weather if you are on the sky tower, otherwise the sun can kill you."

,,Magnificent architecture,4.0,,"The marina bay sands is one of the most plush shopping & dinning destinations in Singapore with world famous brands, international cuisine, very expensive and the beautiful river view.

,,Nice location,3.0,,Have access to the mall and casino. Middle of the city of your going to Jurong bird park and sentosa or orchard road for some shopping. Try the food court at the basement of the mall lots of choices. Be sure to make an early check out as the line tends to be long in the morning.
,,Best View!,4.0,,"Best night view in Singapore! Able to see Lazer lightings, Singapore Flyer and Shenton Way!"
,,An Afternoon to Evening of Activity.,4.0,,"This complex is anchored by the Marina Sands Hotel and Casino. Its sky walk is visible from most of the city and offers great views. The casino is new and if you enjoy gaming most of your time can be spent here.

The bay is really a big lake. The Mall attached to the casino is very modern with upscale brand names and some independent shops. Many places to eat and snack are here as well as some dental and spa options. There is a faux skating ring on the bottom level of the mall. There is also the large whirlpool next to the mall that starts at specific times.
A light show at night with colours, lights, and fountains to display mostly for children to enjoy.

There are a few places by the ArtScience museum that offer outdoor seating to enjoy the bay.

Around the bay is the ArtScience museum, a football stadium, the Fullerton hotel, and the nightclub Avalon.

,,Everything under one roof,4.0,,I visit the Marina Bay Sands once a year for a business conference. The restaurants and shops across the street are a welcome break from work.
,,Ku De Ta dinner,5.0,,"Had dinner at Ku DeTa - it was a wonderful experience, it is not cheap but as a special treat it was great"
,,Posh shopping in marvellous architecture,5.0,,Every designer label is represented with all the latest fashions but we enjoyed the pricey drink in the observation deck the most. Quite a spectacular view!
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,Loved the architecture and the atmosphere. The 4D experience of the laser show made me feel very young again.
,,Impressive but Expensive,4.0,,A great place for an early evening stroll. Good places to eat but rather pricey. Great views of the Singapore Skyline. Accessible by MRT.

,,The place you not have to miss,5.0,,"Marvelous, fantastic viuw from the top of the hotel Marina Bay Sand"
,,the boardwalk and light show at night,5.0,,"if you can get there a bit early they have a light, water and laser show with music starting at i think 7 or 8pm. there is the water taxi and a club at the water and of course the really big LV store. and for arts the science museum."

,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The Marina Bay experience is one not t be missed. Especially the Light and Water show. Take in the show, stroll through the incredible shopping center, go to the top and check out the views. A MUST DO!"
,,Awesomely Wicked!!!,5.0,,"Saw the Broadway show Wicked at the Marina Bay Sands Grand Theater last 3/31 with my sister and her friend. We got seats at row AA for $165, which is by the stalls so we got a really good view of the stage, if a bit to the side.

I've been a fan of Wicked since a friend introduced me to its songs and I was just so excited to see it with my sister. The songs were exquisitely sung and the roles were marvelously portrayed by the Australian cast headed by Suzie Mathers as Glinda and Jemma Rix as Elphaba. I probably was the first to laugh and clap in that theater, so taken was I by Glinda's playful character and Elphaba's plight.

I was excited for Fiyero to come out because I loved the song ""Dancing Through Life"". The beginning was good but the latter part kind of exposed the limits of David Harris' vocal range. Nevertheless, he was convincing as Fiyero (except for some of the singing).

I was on the edge of my seat by the time Defying Gravity came on. And oh my, Jemma Rix, what powerful and touching rendition! That song was worth the entire ticket alone. Suzie Mather's Popular was hilarious. I think it drew the most laughs from the crowd. Then of course I was ready to cry by the time they sang For Good.

What a beautiful performance by the Australian cast! The stage lighting and sound effects were also perfect. Not a single dead air and technical glitch. I heard every word and note. There were several ushers and signage so there was little chance of getting lost.

We got copies of the programme (SGD20) and the CD (SGD30)and got them autographed by David Harris, Elisa Colla, James D. Smith and Ryan Sheppard.
Too bad we weren't there when Suzie and Jemma were signing, though. Also bought a shirt at SGD55. The souvenirs were a bit pricey, but I guess I really didn't mind after the magnificent performances. My pockets only hurt the next day. :)"
,,"WOW....HUGE, CLEAN, UPSCALE MALL WITH THINGS TO DO",5.0,,"We hopped off the HIPPO to visit Marina Bat. We had no idea that it would be so clean and luxurious. If you like name designer brands in a multi-level air-conditioned place, this is it. Lots of places to eat even ""famous celebrity"" places as DB Bistro Moderne (Chef Daniel Bouchard). We had eaten at his original location near the theatre district in NYC before a show. There is an ice skating rink in the mall, theaters, huge casino, even gondola rides on an interior canal. The mall is across the street from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The Singapore Flyer is just across the pedestrian bridge. You get fantastic views of the city skyline, the multi colored soccer stadium. It was a treat to visit the place. We also walked along the river to Esplanade and caught the Water Taxi back to Clarke Quay."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Nice place to walk, you can walk for hours here, there are good restaurant"
,,nice area,4.0,,"Great area to walk around, and just a stone's throw away from the Art and Science Museum!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Nice to walk around the lake front - beautiful scenery. The hotel is gorgeous. Didn't go to the top because it was quite pricey. A guide on my tour boat gave us a tip that if you go up to the restaurant - all you have to do is buy a drink and it's much cheaper to get up there. Wish I had time to go back!
,,brilliant atmosphere,5.0,,"We loves walking around the marina from the Singapore Flyer to the merlion, where we took a boat trip. Such a mix of people all enjoying the amazing scenery."
,,From the bay up the river.,4.0,,"Tucker returned to the classroom and left Alex with the head tour guide job which she performed magnificently. After all the years of dad being the tour director, the tide had shifted and now the daughter is showing me a new world, and loving it! After our walk past the local residents of Tanglin Halt with the stares, waves, and smiles, we found ourselves at an Indian breakfast hawker. Because of my meat and potatoes upbringing, I have always been scared of Indian food; well the Far East will change that misperception quickly. The breakfast consisted of egg and cheese Pratas, a fried dough with an eggs embedded washed down with a very sweet coffee and about $5 for the three of us. After the breakfast, we were ready to travel so off to the local Green Line we went.

Alex had planned the river front tour for today. The MRT exit at Raffles Place placed us in the heart of the financial district which is quite impressive since Singapore is the financial capital of the Far East. It seems most international banks have a presence here and most have skyscrapers. This working area provided the largest sighting of Caucasians I seen since leaving Detroit. The financial district is adjacent to the famous Merlion statue and the not so famous Merkitty statue. The lion is of particular significance to Singapore since the explorer and Sumatran Price San Nila Utama who first named the island Singapora believed he saw a lion upon landing on the island although no lions have ever been documented inhabitants. The tail of the Merlion is that of a fish and since it is an island it makes sense to me! There were some great photo opportunities from this area, not only of the Merlion but also of the city architecture. Marina Bay Sands is located across the bay and has to be one of the world’s most impressive structures, built by I. M. Pei, it is a 60-story constructed of three separate buildings crowned with something that can only be described as a surf board. More on the Marina Bay Sands later.

Crazy as it seems, during my daughter’s tour guiding, we saw Ms. Ong providing guide services to a group of Thai college men. It’s certainly a small city state!

As we departed the harbor area, we travelled up the river as many generations before have done. This river, as in most other successful cities, was the main point of commerce for the first traders, and clearly the British understood the value of controlling the waterways. Our first inside stop was the world-famous Fullerton Hotel. This was a landmark many years before it became 4-star hotel. The original purpose of this building situated at the mouth of the river and protecting the harbor was as a British fort. Later, the structure was used as a post office, and a hospital during the Japanese invasion at which point the Japanese military took control of the property for their three-year occupation of Singapore. If you have the opportunity to visit or reside at the Fullerton, make sure to visit the historical picture collection in the lobby as it provides some interesting views of the property’s uses.

After we left the Fullerton, we walked up the river to visit the different ‘Quays’. The quays are areas that were originally built for commerce and where merchants had warehousing space to accept goods off the boats and to ship product out of the country. Since Singapore has no natural resources but is located on a major shipping route between India and Australia, it provides the opportunity for much commerce. The older buildings of one or two story residences which served as storage for the merchants and located at the river’s edge have now become boutiques and eateries such as Hooters! This architecture is interesting when comparing to the modern skyscrapers one block behind the old merchant houses thus proving that Singapore is still involved in international trade but of a more financial nature. Modern ships now use the port of Singapore instead of the old harbor.

We had lunch in one of the skyscrapers at an air con hawker. This was a chaotic hawker since many workers were having their lunch and the selection of vendors was close to 30. Trying to decide which hawker to eat at is always a dilemma but following Anthony Bourdain advice again “go to the one with the longest line”, I ended up with the meat lover special. Although I’m not real clear on what the two meats were, they sure tasted good with rice, curry sauce and some prawn and veggies. The meal cost $9 Sing plus a cool limeade for $2 Sing brought the total to $7.70 US and helped bring my overheated body temperature down to reasonable level before we ventured out into the 90 degree heat with 90 percent humidity. Our next stop was the Singapore Historical Museum.

We made pleasant walk in the Marina area past several large building and across the front of some waterfront dinning and cocktailing to find the boat launch next to the Merlion. The Marina area during the evening, with all of the large structures, provides some form of light entertainment and with the Marina Bay Sands complex entertaining the crowd with a laser show; it was surreal after cocktailing from the other end of the show the night before. We found pictures from this area even better than from the harbor view from 60 stories up.

The Bumboat tour started off rather challenging for me with a full stomach, several beverages and no nap being relegated to the interior of the boat with the slow pitch of the motor and I started to nod off to the displeasure of my daughter. At one point, I asked the captain if we could sit outside while pointing at the dozen persons on the stern enjoying the breeze and a view of the skyscrapers unblocked by the roof of the boat cabin.

Unfortunately, this was first come, first serve seating accommodations and that are was already full. I was truly disappointed and almost wrote off this trip until, at one of the quays, the large group sitting outside departed which gave the four of us access to an unrestricted view of a magnificent waterway with skyscrapers reaching from above us into the night. This became the most enjoyable evening activity of our Singapore nights out all because we were able to change our seating. I assume the boat operators need the roofs for the frequent rains in this part of the world but if the opportunity presents itself, please sit outside. After many pictures and video of the river and the light show, we decided to take a cab home in order to get to bed quickly since would flying the next day.

Exiting the financial district Anna steered us up the river along the same path Alex had taken us days before. Anna explained the human bronze statuary to us. Even though we walked by it previously without much of a thought, we realized what a lifelong resident can share with you. The first statue was of ‘Coolies’ earlier laborers for the merchant class, and Anna’s quiz was can you tell the ethnicity of the two different coolies? Mindy was able to nail the answer after an Anna hint, headwear, the Malay was wearing his hair braid tied around his scalp while the Indian had on the classic turban.

The next bronze we came to ,a group of business persons together on the ground, was the Indian loan shark with his Chinese Accountant holding an abacus while two Malay business persons made offers. On the outset of this group was a modern day English banker (perhaps the modern day loan shark?). This is also interactive art which presents the opportunity to sit and be photographed in the vignette. We also noticed a bronze of 3 cats by the bridge and it is always good to have cats by the water in order to keep the rodent population at bay, we just didn’t want to feed these cats and get fined. The last bronze of interest was the ‘naked boys’. We had seen this from the river tour the night before but Anna provided a much better story than the preprogrammed one on the boat. These boys are replicating life many (50?) years ago when children would swim on the banks of the river."
,,Go to the top at night to view the city,4.0,,"Visit the 'que da taht bar' on the top floor, expensive but worth it !"
,,A unique place...Go there,5.0,,"With the Marina Bay Sands a visually interesting engineering marvel, this is a place you have to see and experience. Many worlds biggest feats on display here. Longest double helix bridge in the world. Longest cantilever object suspended in the air (57 stories up). Worlds biggest floating stage outside to watch the laser show at night (very cool)."
,,Gorgeous place to wander through.,4.0,,One of the places near Singapore CBD where the Malls are more or less hidden from sight. There is a ton of gorgeous architecture and sights (fountains in the bay and around it). Definitely worth taking a walk through.
,,Las Vegas without the class,4.0,,A good place to hang out for a few hours - same shops as anywhere else with the pretentious Marina Bay Hotel worth avoiding
,,fantastic,5.0,,"wow thats a place where I never thought I will visit someday and yet I didn't believe I'll go there on my own. The architecture, the buildings around, the shopping mall and the attraction was awesome. Will be back someday"
,,The Area is Flawless,5.0,,"The buildings, lights and feel of this area is always absolutely perfect. Come in the day for great photos and come in the night for a terrific night out. Absolutely loved it!."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Marina Bay is - in one word - astounding. The cliche ""words can't describe it"" really applies here.
The best approach, maybe, is to arrive in the late evening, on a fine day, just before sunset (around 7pm), arm oneself with a bottle of water, and set off at a leisurely pace. I like to start at the Esplanade, and head right - this brings one past the Esplanade Park, the historic Fullerton Hotel and the Fullerton Bay Hotel (incorporating the old Customs House), the new clutch of financial skyscrapers miraculously raised upon reclaimed land, and a stunning lead-on to the architectural absurdity/ marvel that is Marina Bay Sands. The elegant but strangely mesmerizing ArtScience Museum will be by the river as one heads onto the Helix Bridge back towards the Esplanade.
Correctly timed, sunset would bring on amazing colour changes and the sight of the Bay lighting up is pretty spectacular. Cafes and restaurants are in abundance along the entire circumnavigation (although many are high-end, the Esplanade has some reasonably-priced options; the food court in the basement of Marina Bay Sands is also moderately priced). Photo opportunities are limitless.
Another extremely pleasant walk is from Clarke Quay to Robertson Quay - but perhaps this is more for long-term residents and locals. Tourists should head first to Marina Bay - in fact should make it a top priority (unless it were rainy - but there are other attractions on days like that!)."
,,great night out place,5.0,,"has a lot to offer within a short distance: bars, restaurants, museums, little parks, malls, etc.."
,,Artscene Museum,4.0,,"At Marina Bay Sands we had probably the most amazing experience ever it was the Titanic Artifact Exhibition
so good will take my partner to see it in Sydney it was like being on the Titanic the props were amazing we followed passengers on their trip learning all about them very interesting"
,,Walk & walk,5.0,,Signage was limited but the area is relatively small so no loss. Pristine environmnet makes it enjoyable without being clinical.
,,Lights,5.0,,The whole Singapore is very well planned and very clean. Go here at night and you will love it.
,,WOW,5.0,,"We were completely taken back by the Marina. What a stunning bay to have as the focal point of the city. Whether you visit at night or during the day, the Marina oozes sophistication, with classy shopping mall and also has some stunning architecture in the form of the Art and Science Museum - all set against the back drop of Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer.

Highly recommend!"
,,"a magical place, esspecially at night",5.0,,I have been nowhere else in the world that gave me a tingle like Marina Bay at night. To me it always be a very special place. See the water and light show from the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Merlion parl lit up.
,,Relax by the Bay,5.0,,After a long day of meetings it was very nice to beable to stroll around and relax on benches and watch people and see the laser show
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"You just have to go there. There's so much going on, especially at night, with all the lights. You can just sit and enjoy the atmosphere, or wander around, go shopping ... Great place."
,,Fab views for free!,5.0,,Take your camera and click! It feels like you are in the future. Every time I go there or take visitors I am amazed at the feeling. I am so happy to be a part of this amazing city and what it offers. My guests are awestruck by the beauty it offers and what the city has done to create such magnificent skyline.
,,Stunning View of Singapore...,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a marvelous piece of engineering.....A beautiful long ship resting over 3 tall n huge towers....Wow!!!
It is best enjoyed around sunset where one enjoys a stunning view of the City and its surroundings..

A must visit if going to Singapore...

Cheers!!
RichAmit"
,,What a view,5.0,,"Saw the Marina Bay only at night and it was totally worth it. The fountains the lights, the projections...don't miss it when visiting Singapore!"
,,Wonderful at night,5.0,,I recommend visiting marina bay twice (during day and night). You get two different experiences. During the day the whole area is buzzing with cafes and the amazing scenery on offer. Then at night we were treated to an orchestra playing at the entrance to marina bay shoppes and a magical vibe strolling around the waterfront. best part and highlight is the nightly lazer and light shows which light up and showcase the whole area. a true gem of Singapore.
,,"Fantastic View, Ridiculous Price",3.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands SkyPark was definintely on my list of ""to-do's"" however, paying $20 to get up there was a little ridiculous. But the view was FANTASTIC!"
,,Singapore transforms here.,4.0,,Where else do you go to see the transformation of Singapore from being a sleep colonial village to a thriving metropolis? A visitor from 50 years ago would never recognise the once bustling Collyer Quay and bay area had entirely been transformed to a fresh-water reservoir complete with ducktours and light entertainment at night. It is also a place to see the Singapore skyline as well as the marina bay entertainment areas in one sitting.
,,Good walk,5.0,,Plenty to see and plenty of walking. Good to wonder for a few hours
,,Mall is SOOOO Posh - Light display SOOOO great!,4.0,,"The shops in the mall are over the top expensive (e.g. watches costing S$225,000).....a good place to visit but make sure you leave your credit card safely back at your hotel! It does have some fun activities for the kids including skating (on plastic, not ice), which cost $9 per child for an hour, including skate hire (socks are a must) and an indoor canal that flows through the middle of the mall (boat rides costing $10 per person).

The water and light show (which is FREE) was worth going to. It took us about 3 trains to get there, but the 12 minute show (with music) was well worth the trip."
,,Singapore Art and Science Centre - Marina Bay,4.0,,"I took 5 children to the Titanic and Andy Warhol exhibition which was a fabulous morning for everyone. The afternoon was spent around the Marina Bay area which provided more entertainment for the kids amongst the shops, Skypark viewing area and harbourside walkways. With Singapore's erratic weather this place offers a good option for days where the sun isn't shining."
,,Lunch at Ku Da Ta,5.0,,"Highly recommended, with views of Singapore and superb food an drinks."
,,Engineering Marvel,5.0,,The Hotel/Casino was a challenging walk from the subway station but once you arrive this is an engineering marvel. Laarge shopping center is attached to hotel/casino.
,,Pleasant environment to walk and enjoy the ambiance,4.0,,Walk around the marina bay and get great views of the marina bay complex. The mall is worth a visit and aim to be at the 'whirlpool' outside at 3pm
,,Food and entertainment !,5.0,,"We travelled to the bay of an evening ...combined a great dinner at Overeasy with a super light show...just a perfect setting, couldn't ask for more....Try the doughnut balls with chocolate sauce...divine!"
,,The most amazing place in Singapore.,5.0,,"Loved every bit of this place. Light and water show in the evening was the highlight of this place. The 15-20 minutes show is co-ordinated beautifully. it has to be seen to be believed. Beautiful man-made water bodies, excellent restaurants, casino. Spent hours and hours roaming around the marina bay area."
,,Alluring Night attraction,5.0,,"Marina Bay offers beautiful, surreal city nights view on the norm. Do visit the new shopping haven, shoppes and indulge in manificent view of marina bay from their viewing platform right on top of their water fountain feature.

With the addition of iLight Marina bay Festival which ends on 1 April 2012 featuring 31 art light installations locally and internationally makes for an memorable expedition"
,,marina bay,4.0,,nice for sight seeing and taking pictures... will definitely visit it when I go back to Singapore
,,GREAT VIEWS,4.0,,Did not stay here but paid to go up the super fast lift to the bar for drinks. You have to pay for tickets but the views are amazing.
,,A stunning view of Singapore,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands is a highly modern building consisting of 3 towers connected by a roof where one enjoys a stunning view of the City and its surroundings. The architecture is fantastic although every person who wishes to go to the top has to pay SGD 20.00
,,Marina the Magnificent,5.0,,"So over the top. So big could spend all day there. Surprisingly the prices in the designer shops were good value; cheaper than in country of origin. Lovely to wander and people watch. Ate at Mario Batelli,s restaurant Mozza; delicious and good value. Definitiely go again next time I am in Singapore."
,,Amazing place!,5.0,,"This place is amazing! Interesting art work along the bay, laser show at night, plenty of good places to eat."

,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"I never get the chance to actually go inside the buidling since we had a tight schedule. I've seen a lot of pictures online about Marina Bay. What can I say - It was beautiful, but when I saw it in person, it was breathtaking. I cannot absolutely think that some would think to put a ship-like structure on top of 3 towers in front of the bay. It describes a man's potential and imagination can go the limitless with determination.
It's just across the Merlion Park."
,,'Bumboat' trip.,4.0,,We took a bumboat from Clarke Quay out into Marina Bay. I think this is the best way to see it. The buildings are amazing and you can learn about them from the commentary.
,,breathtaking experience,5.0,,"We sat on the top of Furerton hotel in their pool lounge, listening to great music, drinking margarita and eating club sandwich. The evening light show at the Marina Bay was amazing - can strongly recommend that."
,,very nice,5.0,,"very impressive and nice view, but expesive with food etc."
,,WOW!,5.0,,How amazing is this place! A must see! Head right to the top and check out the view... just excellent!!
,,An alternative shopping district to Orchard Road.,3.0,,"With a Marina Bays Sands, Raffles City, Marina Centre and Suntec City shopping centre in this area, you have a viable alternative to Orchard road."
,,"spectacular view, free show",5.0,,"just walking around marina bay gives you the feel on modernity and nature combined. start at the raffles area, then go to the iconic merlion, then go to the Durian for a free show. by 7 pm, start walking through the bridge and end up in front of marina bay. at 8 pm, there is a free light and water show! people just sit in front of the bay. the skyline also looks amazing with lighted sillouettes of skycrapers. truly a must if you are in Singapore!"
,,Tourist object photo,4.0,,"Beautiful scenery with some Singapore icon there, i enjoyed the architecture."
,,great experience,5.0,,fantastic viewing platform. Very unusual shape hotel. Quite pricy to enter biy worth the view over Singapore. Thoroughly enjoyed
,,Beautiful path to walk,5.0,,"Marina Bay gives you a beautiful of the city and the way you walk is really nice with flowers and with the usual cleanness of Singapore. If you go there in the summer, get a nice ice cream nearby the Merlion"
,,5 stars are for the views,5.0,,"We went up to the Skydeck at night and the views and the laser show (only on for a month) are magnificent. We walked over the spiral bridge which sported not just tourists but many joggers, photographers and what we assume was a fashion wedding shoot.
I've seen similar malls in Dubai but by husband hasn't and he was amazed at the size, beauty and the inclusion of a roller skating ring.
It costs $S20 just to see the view - but we considered it worthwhile. Go to tower 3 to get to the elevator to the skydeck on the top."
,,beautiful marina bay,5.0,,"We stated in the Mandarin Oriental, which is just opposite the bay and when we were there there was a light show and lazer show on,, absolutely wonderful!!"
,,Marina Views,4.0,,The walk around the Merlion is fantastic and sights to take pictures of the attractions opposite
,,Very Unique Area,5.0,,The Marina Bay area is a great place for shopping and dining. Would recommend spending the $20SGD and go to the top of the hotel. Spectacular view- especially at night.
,,Site 2,4.0,,"Good area to see on foot. I did not get to go on the Flyer this time, but maybe next visit. Love the Merlion."
,,Early bird,5.0,,"Be there early to get in line for the free tour of the Skydeck at 10am. It costs $20 but is worth it. There is another tour at 2pm. A bottle of water is included. Of course you can go up at any time, same price."
,,neat hotel and area,5.0,,the two towers are connected on top by what appears to be the hull of a ship. it is actually a huge swimming pool with bars/restaurants on either end; great views a walk around the bay is delightful
,,So Pretty at Night,5.0,,"Marina Bay is gorgeous when it's all lit up at night. There's also a light show that happens in the evening on the Lotus flower which currently has Andy Warhole displaying. There's lots of bars, shopping centres and restaurants. You can walk around the water to get shots from every angle of the city. It's v easily accessible via the bus and underground."
,,Great Place!,5.0,,"it's a bit far but yet worth it. enjoy the big malls at Marina Bay Sands and go outside afterwards and enjoy the view, nice place indeed."
,,A Great Place for a Walk,5.0,,"Beautiful architecture, great shopping and a popular evening water show make this a worthwhile destination while you are in Singapore."
,,Fanstatic View and Design,4.0,,"We went in the evening. The view was amazing especially ArtScience Museum and Sands Hotel. You could view Merloin at the oppsite site of the river bank. River was clean and no odour smell. The design of the Marina Shopping mall was fascinating. There was a river (look like manmade to me) cut cross the mall and you could take a sampan ride. However, most of the stores were international chain stores - nothing special to buy. And, the food was very expensive."
,,marina bay,5.0,,"a must see for the wonderful Architecture and the atmosphere is amazing, very relaxing."
,,Very Unusual Architecture,4.0,,"They did a great job in building this area up. The Marina Sands building is the most bizarre thing but you can't help looking at it. Also has a great light show at night which you can see from the bars along the One Fullerton area (across the bay). Also the site of the Merlion and the baby one too. The Merlion also has it's own light show.

Had dinner one night on a patio and it was great fun."
,,Love the casino,4.0,,"(+) Good place to take pictures, love the casino (-) Nothing"
,,Singapore initiative,5.0,,This has got to be the most complicated and visually interesting resevoir on earth
,,Iconic and Extraordinary,5.0,,"Dont miss visiting Marina Bay Sands whilst in Singapore. From the cavernous shopping mall to the wondrous architecture of the hotel lobby a one cannot help but to be dazzled and amazed at the sheer technical and architectural wonder. Dont forget to visit the 'floating' YSL shop and adjoining underground historical and artistic design exhibition that joins the YSL shop to the Marina Bay Sands Mall. Also of interest is the beautiful and captivating moving walls opposite the casino that oscillate gently in the wind.
The whole development is a feast for the eyes and senses and must not be missed during your stay."

,,Massive Hotel,5.0,,"Free wi-fi, loved the tea and snacks in the lobby. Will definitely stay in the hotel the next time I visit Singapore. Connected to the Mall, Casino etc. Disliked the fact that it was way too crowded all the time, in the lobby and the pool."

,,Nice walk around the bay,4.0,,Nice walk with lots of photo opportunities and places to stop for a cool drink.
,,Visit this Singapore Icon,5.0,,"The Sky park can be expensive, but for photography, it is one of the best places to view the sunset over Marina Bay. Stay and watch the city light up in the evening. It provides a very wide, unobstructed view. If you can go when the National Day rehearsals and pre-shows happen, you can see F-15 fly-overs and enjoy the fireworks. Though the infinity pool is only for hotel guest, do sneak a view of this pool with must have the best view of any pool in the world."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,s$20 a ticket a bit expensive but to say you have been up there is worth while. shopping experience below also very good
,,"Great experience, but the viewing area is too small",4.0,,"$20 to stand in a tiny, crowded area was a little overboard. I did love the view, though, and the overall experience was very fun and memorable."
,,The views are sky high but so are the prices,3.0,,"Incredible views, but with a pint of Stella's going for $18 and a Laphroaig double costing $78, it was a little too rich for my blood."
,,Bling,4.0,,Lots of high end shops. The ArtScience museum is worth a look. Plenty to do.
,,Expensive,4.0,,If you want to mix with the rich and aimless then Marina Bay has the most exclusive shops.
,,Fantastic Views,4.0,,"It is well worth the entrance fee to see the amazing panorama covering Singapore, its waterway entrance and the vast number of ships moored awaiting entrance to the dock areaa. A great photo opportunity !"
,,Truly relaxing,5.0,,Walk around the Marina perimeter must be done at night. It is brilliant ---- and safe !!
,,Splendid!,4.0,,"Marina Bay has a lot of sights to offer.

The Merlion Park, museums, the famous Sands Hotel, the Marina huge huge huge shopping mall, the river.....

It's one of the best places to have those souvenir pics! Click click click!

Do visit this area at daytime and at night time. Try to catch the Sands Hotel light show. at night. Spectacular!"
,,Nice leisure spot!,5.0,,"Besides the SPECTACULAR hotel (Marina Sands Bay), all the complex offers you a wide of dining and shopping options. We had an informal dinner over the food court and we TRULLY enjoyed it. A visit to the deck view over the hotel is a must. you get magnificent views of the entire city by night.
In general, just a visit to the complex of Marina bay is a MUST!.
Enjoy BEAUTIFUL SINGAPORE!."
,,One-stop shopping,5.0,,"This is a place where all major upmarket brands are located (LV, Chanel, Gucci, Burberry, even a Ferrari Store), as well as the Casino and Sky Park. It's a must-see attraction in Singapore today and also popular hotel, judging from the number of lights switched on at night!"
,,Excellent Place,4.0,,Overall Singapore is a very small place. Marina Bay is in the center of Singapore. I assure that if you are in Singapore you can avoid going to Marina Bay Area. You will definitely See Marina Bay once you are on the main Road. One can easily spot the Merilion once you are near the attraction. Nothing very exciting till the time you see a Motor Boat Race in the lake.
,,nice for the evening,5.0,,It's a nice and relaxing place to stay at night. There are many places to have dinner and see the lights shows of Marina Bay
,,The most beautiful place in Singapore,5.0,,Everything is beautiful in the Marina Bay.The most famous Singapore attractions are there.

,,Life worth living---,4.0,,"We felt like we were on ""top of the world"" - breezy, airy, and the drinks, while extremely expensive, was worth the experience!"
,,Go for the free walking tour,5.0,,The free walking tour is held everyday at 10:30-11:00 and in the afternoon. You will be showed all the marina and will get all the information of how it was buit.
,,shoppers dream,4.0,,so many shops and lots of people especially on sunday afernoon
,,Worth the trip,5.0,,"What an amazing place. It has it all. Food, fun, hotel, casino"
,,Must see!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"It is £10 to go up to the top and the drinks are quite expensive when you get to the top. However, when you get to the top you would have paid double. The view is all of Singapore and to sit in the most glorious surroundings having a drink at that height is quite special. The experience is amazing and to see the swimming pool at the top is very impressive. This is a must!!!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,The technology and the dediction put in by the govt of singapore is awesome. The Marina bay looks spectacular during the night. Recommended all travellers to visit the marina bay without fail otherwise your visit to singapore is not complete.
,,An expensive place to eat,3.0,,WE wandered around the various restraunts along the waterfront and eventually found one but althought the food was nice we were unable to get a table on the water
,,Walk it,5.0,,"I walked the 4km stretch of Marina Bay. It was a fantastic experience. There is the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Merlion statue, the Helix bridge, the National Museum and the like. Do not miss it."
,,"Theater, Shop, Dine, Casino... Whatever you like!",5.0,,"I usually go to Marina Bay Sands for musical plays at theater. As I walk through the mall and hotel, I have to say I'm impressed with the architecture, and the fact they have casino and a very qualified stage in the same building. Sadly I did not have time to dine there (although I have to say the restaurants look intriguing and overpriced; haven't checked them out though)."
,,Wow,5.0,,Wow this is an amazing buffet of designer stores all in the one spot. Quite an amazing display of the enormous wealth and riches some people must have. Very impressive. Made my wallet feel rather pathetic.
,,Cool areA,4.0,,Great spot for taking pix. Well worth a trip up the Marina Bay Sands hotel too!
,,Out of this world,5.0,,"We walked all around the Marina, with the old hotels one side and new on the other and edging the tall building of the businesses. There is one Hotel with a boat like structure at the head and a four floor under ground shopping mall attached. One side has mushroom like structures with a fans under it to keep you cool. Floating platforms colourfully decorated."
,,"Combination of LIVE, WORK, PLAY!",5.0,,"great place to spend the morning, afternoon or evening, Beautiful pedestrian friendly area, with shops and cafeteria. Worth while seeing the Marina BAy Gallery to see how it all started and the concept of the whole investment. Beautiful at night, with all the lightings. Lovely and romantic."
,,So much to see and do!,5.0,,"This was a really amazing area with so much to see, however if you are on a budget I would just take some time to check it out but plan to eat and shop elsewhere. I spent a few hours just walking around and taking some pictures but I ate in Chinatown, Geylong, Lavendar and other places where the sights were just as interesting but much more affordable."
,,Boat cruise is nice,4.0,,The boat cruise around the bay is fun but expensive. You get a good look at the disney-land like harbour and the amazing architecture of the building plus the day pass allows you to get on and off along the way.
,,The best Singapore has got to offer,4.0,,Singapore's N:o 1 attraction with the best luxury mall and the waterfront promenade. Nothing in compared to Dubai for example though but nevertheless pretty nice. Don't count on buying something from the shops since the prices are more than in other good shopping cities around the world. Also don't bother visiting the night club at Marina Sands hotel: nice views but nothing nice about the experience otherwise since we didn't bother to book a cabana at the club.
,,What a view,5.0,,Something out of the world and definitely a must see if you are new to the place!
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Riik a ride in the Singapore flyer. Absolutely gorgeous view. a little scary so far up but safe,"
,,One of the world's great city locations,5.0,,"If you love the buzz of the city, you'll love Marina Bay. It is an iconic location, bounded by the central business district and its skscrapers, the amazing Sands Hotel and the brilliant Esplanade Cultural centre. You can stroll, eat, drink, shop, gamble and gawp.

When I was there there was a nightly light and sound show every couple of hours which added to the fun of the location.

To see it in all its majesty head to the top of the Sands Hotel and treat yourself to a cocktail."
,,a must do when in Bali,5.0,,"Marina bay is the new establishment that everyone refers to as a surfboard in Bali, full of amazing shops and restaurants, go late afternoon and do a trip to the observation deck where you can also opt for a tour that will take you over to the pool area of the hotels for spectacular views ... or why not sip a cocktail at the top at ku de ta ... yummmyyyy"
,,Wow!,5.0,,"This is a magnificent building! There is a boat on top of the 3 buildings making up the hotel. There is also a pool on the boat, which overlooks the Singapore skyscrapers. It makes for a beautiful scene while your chilling in the pool. Plenty of upscale shopping to be done on the lower floors, and an underground tunnel that connects to the Marina Bay Casino across the street. This is a must visit if you are in Singapore."
,,wonder of the world,5.0,,"great to see and visit in evening but can enjoy at any time a day.
marina bay resort biggest attraction and hotel also wonder of world.
on the top of hotel rofftop swimming pool must visit , u will never see the swimming pool like this kind in world any where.
racing tarck on marina bay nice one..."
,,Water and Light show,5.0,,Go see the free water and light show at Marina Bay on the side facing the city. There is a show at 8pm and again at 930pm. If you watch it from across the bay then you will miss out on the images that are projected into the spraying water
,,The Changing Face of Singapore,5.0,,"The last time I visted Singapore the Marina Bay development hadn't even started, so the new skyline came as quite a shock to me. I found the whole River Front / Bay Area had changed tremendously.

Unfortunately I damaged my back (I suffered a Prolapsed Disc in my Lower Back about 20 years ago) on just the second day of our holiday, which forced us to cancel many of our planned trips and visits. One new sight my injury did allow me to see was the inside of Raffles Hospital ! hehe And I have to say that maybe it should be on the list of Singapore's Places To Visit, as it is quite the Nicest and Poshest Hospital I've ever been treated in !"
,,Wonderful Architecture,5.0,,The architecture in Singapore is astounding and one of the best ways to see it is from the river.
,,Great by day and night...,4.0,,"... if it's not raining, that is. Because Singapore is very, very organised, it only seems to rain for a one hour burst in the morning or afternoon, but when it does rain, you get soaked.

Precipitation aside (and maybe you like rain, although I doubt many waterfowl or amphibians are reading this) this is a very nice area of Singapore. You can take a walk at ground level, all the way from the Fullerton, past Marina Bay Sands and back towards Raffles Place, and be far away from the noisy traffic that accompanies you in the rest of Singapore. Thus if you're in the centre of town and need a quick break, this is a convenient place to go.

In the evenings, you can see the light show being broadcast from Marina Bay Sands. In the daytime, when it's not raining, there's usually fairly harsh sunshine blazing down on you, so don't forget a hat, sunglasses, etc."
,,Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"Better then going to Singapore flyer is to go to Marina Bay Sands, on the top. Less price, better view"
,,Stunning day or night,5.0,,"The best way to see these sites are by bumboat ride. Ask a trishaw driver in Chinatown to take you to the Bum Boats. At night, the whole family will see a view unmatched worldwide. Choose Christmas time thru Chinese New Year (for the more adventurous!)"
,,Great sights!,4.0,,"This was heaps of fun, and the watershow was amazing - definitely a must see!"
,,very nice city light,5.0,,breath taking just sit in that area or watch for free water show in front of marina bay shopping mall.
,,Singapore attractions,5.0,,"All the main sites hear, take a bumboat ride round the bay."
,,Fantastic light show,5.0,,This place is nice for a walk and to sit and take a breeze. The light show is awesome. Beyond my expectations.
,,Busy and tourists only get to see the view...,3.0,,"No entrance for tourists to the pool etc. upstairs. Also, the bar does not open until late in the day which is a really lost opportunity to enjoy the fabulous views from up high."
,,Great place to chill out,4.0,,In my humble opinion Marina Bay and the general esplanade area does not get the recognition it deserves. Wonderful place to take a walk and chill out.
,,Light show is better than the view,4.0,,"The view from the top is spectacular, but it's annoying that there's no where to sit and enjoy it - there are no benches and we were told-off for sitting on the ground. I would recommend the best time to be at the top is just before dark, so you can see the city lights turning on. The light show was excellent so make sure you are back on the ground in time to make that."
,,Something Worth Doing in Singapore,4.0,,We decided that a trip around Singapore Marina Bay would be a worthwhile trip and wasn't disappointed. The trip took a couple of hours and was fantastic. Well worth the money
,,if you like it modern - go and explore,5.0,,"Marina Bay - the area to wonder around in Singapore, from the Esplanade theaters on the Bay, past the Merlion, the Fullerton, Fullerton One and Fullerton Bay hotel along the actual bay. With the Marina Bay Sands being majestically across the bay from the Merlion.... this certainly is one of the truly modern environments in Asia. Take some time in the evening and sit opposite the Marina Bay Sands to take the play of light in. the change of copout from day light via sunset to night is amazing and just wonderful."
,,We were lucky,5.0,,"We just happened to arrive one evening to a fantastic laser show that we viewed from a roof top garden, also a free music event. Apart from these extras, the buildings are amazing, the atmosphere is great and yet something else to see in Fab Singapore."
,,A feast for the eyes.,5.0,,"I arrived before dusk and took the footpath circumnavigating the Bay. Easy to follow, only 3.5 km long and as night closed in the whole Bay changed its appearance and atmosphere. Apart from the obvious, (but strikingly stunning), architectural delights, there was a lights/lasers/music/water feature display from Marina Bay Sand that was terrific from the Fullerton side.
Your camera trigger finger will fall off!!!
The aerial view from the Singapore Flyer only enhances the splendour of the area.
Plenty of ""eateries"" to choose from or, MORE shopping."
,,A Must See,4.0,,We visited here a couple of times and since it is such a stand out in the skyline - you should stop in. We did not take the tour (expensive and limited times) but we ate in Sky 57 where you sit above the city. We also visited the casino and shopping mall while here. Casino was fun to see but with so much going on outside and the weather great - did not want to stay inside. Shopping center here goes on forever - and the highlight is the LV store on the water!
,,a very photogenic city,5.0,,"this place was remarkable..... at 7pm we can enjoy the lighting performance. even not as good as HONGKONG did. but still can be enjoy

and the building was so PHOTOGENIC. at every-side take a memorable picture, the city and building still photogenic.

i spent my 5 hours time to walk around the building. from day to night. very good."
,,Very good,5.0,,"The bay is much changed since we last saw it. We enjoyed the walks, the shopping and transport is excellent."
,,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Casino & Shoppes a Great New Attraction!",4.0,,"The building/s look awesome as you approach in both day and night. It gets somewhat overwhelming on the inside with the crowds especially at hotel lobby. Was there in January 2012. The experience of walking through and seeing the high-end retail outlets, indoor canal, casino and restaurants is a good experience. Its well worth a visit!"
,,marina bay hotel,3.0,,"was ok. But if you have been to large hotels like in Las Vegas, to me it was just another hotel like in Vegas."
,,awsum view,5.0,,"the merlion is indeed an icon.... the view of flyer, marina bay sands makes a wonderful skyline"
,,Extraordinary,4.0,,"This place is really extra ordinary, the high ceiling, all beautiful construction, and very expensive stores aline ... visit during evening around 8pm, and get to watch a free water light show...very nice..."
,,great view,5.0,,a must visit location. a walk down marina bay along the river is a wonderful experience. Singapore by night. immensely enjoyed the view whilst sipping a cool iced tea...........
,,Impressive developments,4.0,,"There are some terrific examples of modern urban architecture around Marina Bay, mostly on reclaimed land. The Helical bridge and the lotus-shaped Arts-Science Museum are quite striking, and it's a pleasant stroll around the whole bay (takes about an hour, probably, depending on how much you linger ... ). The large building that looks like a set of cricket stumps houses a lookout (quite expensive, apparently) and makes it easy to find the Bay. A very upmarket new and very large shopping complex is near the museum, with all the right names inside; good for the well-heeled ... The Youth Olympic Games lead to some of the developments, and it's worth visiting the charming garden near the museum to see the children's works that were entered in a competition and the winning entries."
,,View from the top is worth the trip up and some great photosgreat photos are available.,5.0,,There wasn't anything to dislike about the view from the top and it gave a great view of so much of Singapore. The mall attached to the Marina Bay Sands is worth a visit. The food court there is excellent and there are so many stores in the mall it is unbelievable.
,,One of the nicest parts of SG,5.0,,It is just a very nice scenery... Very modern and high tech... So Singapore!!!
,,Must see in Singapore,4.0,,"The Marina Bay is one of the most fascinating sights in Singapore with a beautiful skyline (especially at night). The Marina Bay Sands is an interesting place to see as well with stunning architecture, fabulous views of the skyline and zillions of shops and boutiques not to forget about the casino. Even when in Singapore for a day or two see this!"
,,Well worth the ticket to the top !!!,5.0,,"Not only Spectacular views from the viewing platform but incredible feeling knowing that part of the structure is suspended between buildings. Amazing ride to the top, a must do while in Singapore!!!"
,,excellent,5.0,,This hotel was just about perfect for me when I stayed. If there are any negatives it would be the crowd (I went early Jan so peak time) and not much in terms of a “personalised service”. Oh and the price is much on the dearer side. I payed approx $850 ($ SIN) for only two nights. If money wasn’t a problem (I wish) I would definitely stay there again.
,,Highlight,4.0,,"This area was the highlight in Singapore, based in a marina with loads of restaurants and gorgeous views of the city"
,,Mind blowing engineering feat,5.0,,Marina Bay is a wonderful new development in Singapore with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel / Casino being the headliner! Spectacular to view from any angle on the outside it is just as visually stunning on the inside. Pay a visit to the beautiful high end shopping arcades or you can sit and have a coffee in one of the many cafes or in the food court. Take a boat ride 'inside' for something different. The Singapore Flyer is also in the Marina Bay development and looks amazing in it's close proximity to the hotel. A great way to spend some time out of the heat.
,,Great place to spend money and eat food!,4.0,,"A fabulous range of shops from top designer to middle of the road with prices to suit every pocket.
The highlight, though was the food court which had a vast range of types of food, reflecting well the different peoples inhabiting Singapore. Prices are reasonable and give the opportunity of each person in the party selecting their own preferred food - Japanese, Indian, Malay, Chinese, Thai, European, etc."
,,Awesome (but expensive) Entertainment Complex,5.0,,"I visited Marina Bay Sands when they first opened & was pleasantly surprised when I went again recently to see so many more places to shop, eat & do there! Went to Imperial Treasure Chinese Restaurant for dinner & thoroughly enjoyed our meals. It was a Saturday night & the shops were opened till midnight, so it was as fantastic way to spend with my girlfriends after a satisfying meal! Coffee places are wonderful to go, but we are glad we chose to go into ""Toast Box"" instead of swanky establishments such as ""High Society"" or ""TWG"" as we reckon the coffees & snacks were better & not to mention way more resonable in price!! Definitely recommend any visitors to Singapore to check this complex on their next visit to Singapore!"
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Wow he best shopping area have seen, so man designer shops mixed with High Street brands"
,,great view,4.0,,it's a great place you you wanna have a nice view on the whole bay. really recommend it
,,Go on a cracker night,4.0,,"If you get a chance go when there is a fire works display. the ambiance is super. Also visit the hotel from the top, at pool side. gr8 city views."
,,Love this place,4.0,,What I love the most is the sting ray dish wrapped in banana leaf and loaded with spices. Truly worth trying
,,a must see!!!,5.0,,cant miss it. on tower 3 they will let you visit the skypark for free.
,,"When I say average, what I mean is...",3.0,,"Well, what I mean is, that this place in ways captures what many think of as both the best and worst of Singapore.

It is an architectural marvel, and the first time witness should strap their lower jaw before gazing at the 57 storey triple towers with vast 'boat'/'surfboard' on top. Even after several days of passing it from a distance I still kept thinking of Independence Day, District 13, or more specifically, the vast CGI creations featured on their cinemascope horizons. It is quite a view.

So, it represents the entrepreneurial spirit and ambition of the Singaporean people, which is all good, but... well, inside it is also, like so many of the Orchard Rd malls, full of soulless and eyewateringly expensive shops, which are 'exclusive' in the sense that there is a large swathe of the population that could barely afford to look at the goods, let alone buy them. Interestingly, there is a number of empty units, albeit cunningly disguised and not having Knight Frank TO LET signs outside. Locals tell me that the place is just too out the way for most, far from Orchard Rd and not on the beaten track.

There is also Singapore's second casino, which churns so much gamblers' cash that Singapore is now a top gaming nation. Not daft, though, the government insisted that Singaporeans must pay $S100 to get in, while Jonny and Jackie Foreigner may part with their cash for free. The entry price deters locals while encouraging we idiotic visitors to donate further to the island state's wealth.

The public areas of the hotel complex were airy and cool, with stylish looking (and very expensive) bars. The view from the top (called the Skydeck, costing $S20 to get up) can be wonderful, depending on atmospheric conditions - for me though, best to sneak into the residents' elevator at night to catch the downtown lights for free."
,,must see,5.0,,"highly recommended to see> one of the best hotels in singapore.marina bay sands, everything is there, the restos, the mall"
,,Jaw dropping!,5.0,,"So many things to see! Take a boat trip and you wont be desappointed, excellent photo oportunity"
,,Singapore Skyline View,4.0,,One should at least stroll through the Marina Bay Sands sometime. There are also interesting laser light on water spray shows in the evening.
,,Great views,4.0,,"Went to the observation deck at Marina Bay Sands, well worth a trip to get a view of the Singapore skyline"
,,One of the 'must visit' in Singapore,4.0,,"In Marina Bay you can experience nice panoramic views of the city, really recommended at night! Very close to the tube station, connecting you to Orchard Road. Inside Marina have a desert, chilling drink or a meal and afterwards you can take a walk along the see. Great experience!"
,,"Can you say, ""decadent""?",5.0,,"This place is a wonderland of shopping, eating, music, museums and more! Shame on you if you don't go."
,,A must-see in SIngapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay exemplifies what Singapore is or what it aspires to be. A collection of high rises, super modern buildings, a man-made lake and the superb Sands Park hotel and Casino.
You can spend the whole day visiting the many shops at the gigantic indoor mall by the hotel; walking around the lake to see the impressive architecture or pay a visit to the top of the hotel for the fantastic views for a fee. It is definitely 21st century. Every time I go to Singapore I ended up paying a visit to the area. Don't miss it.
Highly recommended!
Don Travel"
,,Breathtaking view at night but not a good place if it is raining,4.0,,"Went here to watch the fireworks during CNY eve. Like every night, spectacular lights of the structures surrounding it are breathtaking. Place is surrounded by a good enough number of restaurants and stalls selling snacks and drinks.

There's really not a lot of shelter though so be always prepared to get wet if the weather turns soupy. Of course, the fireworks didn't turn out so great as the sky was cloudy which made the fireworks a little hazy."
,,Good,4.0,,"The place is surrounded by high rises, waterfront and makes for a wonderful walk."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,Amazing view and very safe and clean area good for couples
,,Incredibly pretty at night,5.0,,A must visit at night to just see the view! It's absolutely beautiful.
,,nice hotel and shopping mall,5.0,,the hotel is amazing ane the shopping mall has very food stores and resturants
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"We were there for the Chinese New Year so, apart from the stunning architecture all around, there was a tremedous atmosphere from all the activities associated with the New Year."
,,Very cool,4.0,,"Walking around Marina Bay is a lot of fun. There are so many cool views, buildings with interesting architecture, great food, and just lots of people out enjoying life."
,,Great walk,4.0,,I was really excited about seeing the Merlion so the nice walk from the Sands Skypark to there made it a whole experience. It is a must if you go to Singapore
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"It's very nice place - one of the main attractions in Singapore surrounded by famous Merlion-symbol of Singapore,Sky Park hotel,Explanade,Bank biuldings and hotels"
,,Truly boring,2.0,,"targeting at the bayfront itself, other than the casino, the place is really not meant for the common people. Too many expensive places and shops, too many things you can see but cannot touch. Only go if you want to get inspired - ""One day I will get this rich and I will....."""
,,Great place to spend an exciting evening,4.0,,"Every visitor should drop by at Marina Bay to catch the amazing view of Singapore's bustling cityscape. Take the train to Bayfront Station and head to the Hotel's Tower 3 to catch the elevator to Ku De Ta the rooftop bar and restaurant that offers an awesome view of Singapore's skyline. Aim to arrive shortly after 6pm, order a drink and enjoy fabulous city views as the city transitions from daylight to dusk when the shimmering lights of the highrise buildings come on. Therafter head to the promenade outside the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes to catch the free multimedia show which runs at 8pm and 9.30pm. Then grab a bite at the self serve casual eatery Rasapura near Basement 2 skating rink. Here you get to sample the best of popular Singapore F&B such as BBQ pork and wonton noodles, chicken rice, 'bakut teh' or peppery pork rib consomme and 'chendol' a dessert of chilled coconut milk, palm syrup, green bean jelly and adzuki beans. Round off the evening with a visit to the casino or party the night away at Avalon (Crystal Pavilion South)."
,,Very nice,5.0,,Very nice to walk around and absorb the great atmosphere
,,Beautiful but pricey!,4.0,,"Stayed for several weeks in the Marina Bay of Singapore, and while we LOVE it, it should be noted that the shoppes and many eateries are pretty expensive. The Marina Bay Sands Resort top floor should not be missed - and you can visit it for a gander if you're a tourist, or enjoy a swim in the amazing infinity pool if you're a hotel guest. Tons of shops and a very nice long walk for sight seeing alone, from the Fullerton or Fullerton Bay (hotels) to the Esplanade (arts center) to the Marina Bay Shoppes to the river walk. You could spend 2 full days just checking out this very cool part of the Singapore."
,,Spectacular night time attraction,5.0,,"The laser light show at marina Bay sands is a must to see, and so too is the food court on teh bottom floor. Shops are very high class - so expensive, but the food is not expensive and of very high quality.

We spent two nights around the area visiting marina Bay and the flyer."
,,Better if you can try different angles,4.0,,"Around the Bay there are lots of different attractions, Merilion Park, Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade, financial district, etc...it should probably take a day to appreciate the Bay area."
,,Futuristic,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a place I like to visit day or night. been many times and come often as I always tend to be amazed by new perspectives of the place. The architechture is special and exciting and I appreciate the inspiring, sophisticated urban feel the place provides. Has interesting history including reclaimed land and now also water reservoir plus sustainable projects. My favorite is probably after dark on the beautiful wooden deck right next to the bay - often various shows are performed there with the city skyline as backdrop. The Marina Bay Gallery is a free admission highly informative worthwhile visit where the story of the place is told and future projects are displayed. I often cycle around the Marina Bay, excellent place to discover from the bike perspective."
,,great for a walk - expensive to eat/drink,4.0,,if it's a nice day - go for a walk around the Marina Bay -its super pedestrian friendly. benches and places to sit and enjoy the outdoors are everywhere.
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"I think this is where the Merlion is located. Great photos to take here both during the day and the night. I also took a night boat ride that left from near the Merlion statue. To find the taxi stand, go right past Starbucks and turn right."
,,visit during the night,4.0,,"Good, but you cant visit more than once. Rather go to Boat Quey and Clarqe Quey. Otherwise a decent place for the evening. The city otherwise is safe but you wil find some bad characters there. So dont stay late there"
,,Immaculate,5.0,,"Nice view overall, especially at night. It can be really hot during the day so bring as much fluids as possible. At night, it was a bit breezy. An excellent area for photo op. Don't miss the Marina Bay Sands light show at 8pm!"
,,Sand Sky Park Singapore Experience!,5.0,,"Had family bonding in that place.....me, my daughter and my husband had the chance to be on top of the world! Great!"
,,Nice Walk,4.0,,We walked around the bay with our two children. It took us about an 2 hours to walk around at a leisurely pace. There are both lovely views both day & night.
,,Expensive and quiet,2.0,,"Not much happening when my friend and I went here, and all the restaurants and bars were SO overpriced! Definitely preferred the atmosphere of Clarke Quay over Marina Bay."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"We visited Marina Bay for a lovely evening in December, the water / laser show is a must see - it is simply stunning and as its free one of the best value things you can do!

Went up to the observation deck - really great views of Singapore from the deck but if you want to go to Ku De Ta dress up - lounge suit required."
,,beautiful place,5.0,,this place is gorgeous. they have a creative view from the outside
,,Attached to our Hotel,5.0,,We were really enjoyed a lot as we hired a private boat from Marina bay sand hotel for 1 hour.The view has too good.
,,Scenic,5.0,,Scenic area of downtown Singapore. Plenty of shopping around the bay. Casino and mall on opposite side from Merlion.
,,Amazing new landmark destination,4.0,,"The shops and restaurants are pricey, but it's worth a visit to see this beautiful building. Take a trip up the Sands Skypark for amazing views of the city. A free laser light show is featured every night at 8:00, worth the wait."
,,Lots of Shopping and Dinning Options,5.0,,"The architecture at this entire site is fabulous. There are lots of dinning options and every shop you could think of. There's a theatre inside as well and there is a new MRT (metro) stop close by. Wear good walking shoes, the place is huge."
,,Amazing Structure,5.0,,"The Marina Bay is definitely a must do while you're in Singapore. Be sure to go at night when they play the laser shows (first starts at 8pm I believe). I recommend watching the first from across the bay and the second out front of the buildings themselves. Up close they spray a mist and project images on to it. Quite amazing to see from both perspectives (don't worry, they are the same shows so you won't miss anything). Afterward be sure to head up to the sky park - you can purchase tickets next to tower 3, just ask concierge for directions. There is also an arts center, cool bridge, and tons of shopping nearby. Oh, and can't forget the Merlion just across :D"
,,marina bay,5.0,,"Relaxing day, go on the Flyer, or go up to 57th Floor, or Visit the Casino. You can get the $12 a day hop on hop off Bus, Yellow one."
,,Calm,5.0,,This didn't even exist on my last visit! It is a lovely space around water in the city. Don't miss out on the Chill Crab!
,,Wonderful Place,5.0,,"That's wonderful place that i've never seen before. Nice place to stay , shopping and also nice view to see whole Singapore."
,,Great City View,5.0,,"Singapore has one of the best city skylines anywhere. It's a can't miss, more because if you do anything in the city you are bound to end up near the Marina anyhow. A large part of the city attractions are in this area from the Flier, to Marina Bay Sands, to the Merlion statue and all of the tours (ducktours, riverboat rides, etc...) go here. My opinion is that it is best to visit at night. Not only because it's cool enough to relax and enjoy the view, but also because the building lit up at night make a scenic backdrop for phototaking."
,,Dont miss the light show,4.0,,Impressive to say the least. Must see in Singapore. Remember to watch the water/-light show in the evening!
,,VOW!,5.0,,"The best place in Singapur to take a walk in the evening. There is some impressive architecture there like the marina bay sands hotel, the science museum, the sky bridge, ... You have to be there at the evening wenn the light are playing with this wonderful architecture. There's also a light show in the evening (with music). We loved to take a walk there, hear free concert, have a drink, or just sit there and look!"
,,Fab Place,5.0,,"Lots to see and places to eat - buzzing nightlife for everyone, from singles to families, well recommended"
,,"Great shopping, but wear comfy shoes!",4.0,,"Went into Marina Bay after a business meeting. Service desk people particularly friendly and gave us good directions, but what a long walk from the entrance to the conveniences! Then had drinks overlooking the water before rolling up the sleeves to go shopping
Huge variety of shops for all budgets, bought a number of colorful necklaces. Plenty of pricy restaurants, definitely something for everyone.."
,,wow,5.0,,thewow the pavillion is a MUST atch the lift up the skytowers for the view.
,,beautiful buildings,5.0,,wow it was really beautiful near the river. I really enjoyed my drinks here too. :)
,,Lofty view,4.0,,"Went to a swanky function at the top of this building and...when the clouds cleared e view was breathtaking.

Looks a lot like. Boat stranded on top of two towers and I don't think much of the lower lever of the building, but wrth a peek if you can get someone ese to pay for the huge cost of getting to the top!"
,,Very impressive part of the CBD,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is the visual cherry on the cake however Marina Bay is impressive from whichever angle you look at it.

The Bay can be seen from hotels, on foot or on a bum boat on the water. The bars and restaurants in my opinion don't make the most of the views or the setting but perhaps this is the charm of the place....

Highlights are -
Ku De Ta (roof top bar) @ Marina Bay Sands
Kinki (roof top bar) @ Fullerton Bay
Orso (roof top bar) @ The Esplanade
Gluttons Bay hawker centre
Over Easy @ One Fullerton
Water / Laser show @ Marina Bay Sands - each night at 8pm I believe"
,,Live postcard,5.0,,"At night this area looks fantastic, like on the postcards and the famous Marina Sands Bay is a true masterpiece of the modern engineering. Do not miss opportunity to get upstairs and have a fabulous view over the whole Singapore."
,,Special place to go,4.0,,"All you are looking for you can find in this nice area. Shopping malls, the new restaurant up in the air and all very close to China town. Take a boat to make a trip and visit Hooters for a nice cold drink."
,,A big Mall that,3.0,,"It was so big and so full of the standard and luxury stores you get at HK airport, mall in US or in UK. It was uninspiring. I wanted to get up to the skypark, which I did not manage due to the complexity and size of the Mall."
,,What a view,5.0,,Feel like you r in the clouds - the marina takes you to a different level even if for a small fee - the hustle and bustle around the casino was exciting and lively
,,An interesting and pleasant area,5.0,,"We really enjoyed exploring this area, There is so much to see and do.

It has been highly developed over the years and even more so recently and has a very modern touch to it.

This area has only added to our enjoyment of Singapore as being a modern, clean and entertaining place to visit."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Check out the shopping mall, the bar on the rooftop & casino!"
,,all-in-one,4.0,,"awesome architecture in that area. if you like to shop in s'pore, it's a place that you can spend your whole holidays there..... :-) walking along the bay at nite are pretty relaxing too"
,,this is a wonderful shopping complex,5.0,,you have to have a short ride in the gondla was so much fun all the shops are name brands so if your looking for prada quicksiler etc they are all here so nice and cool lovely views and the security where so helpful
,,Great walk,5.0,,Ideal for your first exploration of Singapore. Great for pictures and people-watching.
,,Wow,5.0,,"My most favourite thing to do with overseas guests is to take them to Raffles Place MRT then walk down to Marina Bay through the series of underpasses, then you pop up and right in front of you is Marina Bay - the hotel, the bay, the financial district buildings, the ArtScience museum. It makes people gasp. It is especially lovely of an evening when the city is alight. Try and catch the light and water show. It's free and occurs 2-3 times per night depending on the night of the week on the stairs in front of whirlpool fountain. The kids will love it. Then if you have the energy take a walk into the Marina Bay Sands shops and look at all the designer goodies, take a ride on the sampans, go to the lobby of the hotel or spend $20 and go and visit the Skypark Observation deck, then if you're still willing, walk across the Helical bridge (built like a strand on DNA) and get some arty shots of the bay."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,It will be good when the new train station opens--a long walk at present
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,We went to the observatory and chocolate bar! Great views!
,,breathtaking view at night,4.0,,"The entire Marina Bay area is a must go for travellers to Spore. From sight seeing to shopping , it has all. You could spend the whole day there and for shoppers , all the premier names are there. But ofcourse you need a very thick wallet and several gold / platinum cards. The 3 towers of the Marina Sands building is just awesome .For a spectacular night view and photographing , go back to the City / Merlion Centre for excellent viewing ."
,,nice promenade,4.0,,beautiful walk among lush green. picnic areas.shrimp fishing.
,,The best place to live!,5.0,,"Waking up to a view of the marina every day is pretty awesome. I love walking the circuit clockwise around the bay, from the promontory, round past the museum, the Marina Bay Sands hotel (stop at The Shoppes for some extravagant purchases), over the corkscrew pedestrian bridge (great photo spot), past the stands and the esplanade (stop at Gluttons Bay for awesome seafood), across the road bridge towards The Fullerton, down to Merlion Park (again another good photo spot) and along the waterfront at One Fullerton and the Fullerton Bay Hotel.

Lots of good shopping, eating, drinking, sitting and photo opportunities all the way round! And in September the F1 comes and the bay is filled with the noise of engines and music - a real festival!

The light show every night at 8pm and 9.30pm is also best viewed from aside the bay - take a seat at one of the bars outside One Fullerton to get the best view of the lights or along the boardwalk outside the Marina Bay Sands to see the water display."
,,Iconic building of Singapore,4.0,,"The Marina Bay area is one of the best place to get a view of the city's skyline, and also the Marina Bay Sands casino."
,,Best Pepper Crab,5.0,,Long Beach restaurant for best Chilli Crab and pepper crab
,,Enjoy Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"The viwe was great, the staff were frindly I got a great deal thanks to Mr.Lim Gim Siong Made new frinds at check in lunge Hana sama and Kris the service manegar. need more staff to check in Mr.Kim was very helpful while checking out."
,,The best,5.0,,"I really enjoyed it, we spent hours and hours in the Marina bay. The shopping is great all though i didnt spend much the canal through the centre is wonderful and the light show outside at night was amazing well worth it"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"We went up to the viewing platform which is a must see for all tourists. You have to pay and the dollars are well worth it. We were lucky the weather was good and we had a guided tour of the pool area but you are not allowed to swim if you are on the tour only if you are staying at hotel.

The shops under the hotel are high class name brand concept stores which was surprisingly quiet at that time of day ( mid morning)"
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,"There is so much to see and do in the Marina Bay area of Singapore, that it's a must for all visitors. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino complex is a marvel of modern architecture and the views from the top are sensational."
,,fav place to shop,5.0,,my favourite place to shop. make sure you get the tourist card at the tourist desk and you can get another 10% off your shopping. then you might even get vouchers if you spend more than a certain amount. every shop is there and it's also a great location.
,,A must,5.0,,"Fab shops and good to take photos, if you have the time take a trip up to the top of the hotel which looks like a boat on top of 3 pillars. Great views of Singapore"
,,Place You Have To Visit in Singapore,3.0,,"Well it will charge you quite amount for going up to the roof top, but the view was great and romantic!
Too bad you can't go to the pool freely since it's hotel's guest facility..(the view from the pool was greater) and it was quiet windy since it was on very high level

Overall, I love the view up there. But I think only for visit once..it's not a place that you will visit over and over whenever you go back to Singapore unless you haven't gone there then you surely have to visit"
,,What a walk,5.0,,"Walk both sides of the Singapore river. We started and finished from The Park Hotel on Clarke Quay, it took about 4 hours to complete the round trip via the Merlion. Amazing views with lots of eating and drinking stops available along the way. Lots of distractions which can make the walk a whole day affair."
,,Beautiful Nights,5.0,,"we loved the boat tours of marina bay , we loved just walking around it at night , the lights are beautiful and we took hundreds of photos of the Stunning architecture."
,,"Las Vegas-like grandeur and ""westerness"" in Singapore",5.0,,"A shopping ""temple"" with very grand scale and spacious layout. Do visit the Louis Vuitton tilted cube shop. (It's not long before they open of a café with exclusive branded coffee and LV-patterned cakes *smile*) Some might think the whole area lacks a lot of asian feel, but there are plenty of other places that offer that. A lot of views and fresh air is included for free in the package."
,,Great experience for all,5.0,,"We arrived by taxi at this hotel to look at its structure and it did not disappoint. There were three tours in the day to go up to the 58th floor to view the infinity pool and walk around the boat shaped deck - views were amazing and were higher than the Singapore Flyer - cost was S$20 and we enjoyed the experience - recommend for singles, couples and families - Singapore inventiveness at its best."
,,Impressive on the outside,3.0,,"The building it an impressive structure of architectural magnificence. However, the service is slow and expensive"
,,Fantastic shopping and eating etc,5.0,,So much to do. Eating is great and so is the shopping and walking around. Theatres are a little difficuklt to get to as taxi stands are on the opposite sides. we went to the Titanic and Cartier exhibitions and these were well worth the time. They were well priced. The English speaking tour was a fizzer as the group was way too large.
,,A must,5.0,,The new hotel is amazing and the view from the terrace is breath-taking. This is the best place to get a good view of the entire city. It beats the Flyer and any other skyscarper in town. The show at night is ridiculous but the atmosphere of the place is unique. A stop that no one can afford to ignore while in Singapore.
,,Architecture's haven,5.0,,you will get the most stunning views in Singapore with all the beautiful 'concrete jungles' in this area
,,lots to do,5.0,,"we stayed in a hotel overlooking the bay and found lots to do including walking, visiting the casino complex, the Arts area and the helix bridge. Is impressive at night with the light show too."
,,Beautiful But....,3.0,,"Wouldn't stay there again as I prefer the Fairmont on Beach Road for it's location. This place is beautiful however a little out of the way from Orchard, Beach Road etc. Housekeeping isn't that great either - very slow to get to the room. The whole complex is worth the visit though as they have beautiful restaurants and very high end shopping (if that is what you are into)."
,,WOW,5.0,,"Worth a visit for the wow factor,loads of shops,casino, theatres."
,,Marina bay,4.0,,"Expensive shops and resturants, the Casino is worth a look. The night time water and laser show is amazing. Stayed 2 nights at the HOTEL. Not great for caucasains really only for asains etc."
,,A display of Singapore's national development,5.0,,"For me this is a gallery for people to witness and experience Singapore's national development. On one area you have the Marina Bay Sands, Merlion Statue, Esplanade theatre, Suntec City, Singapore Flyer all in the middle of Formula 1 track.

The newly built foot bridge that connects to Marina Bay sands is the perfect place to witness all this."
,,the best location in singapore,4.0,,"nice place for walking , fun ,drinking, shoping &.....isaw marina bay every morning frome my hotel room wow perfect....iam photographer ( professional ) now i have lot of picture from marina bay."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"The highlight of Marina Bay is the Marina Bay & Sands hotel and its terrace (at 57th floor) - Highly recommended.
There is also a casino in the hotel and a great shopping mall.
A must visit destination for all travelling to Singapore as you get to see Merlion, singapore flyer, marina bay etc. in the close vicinity"
,,Awesome experience!,5.0,,Visited the marina bay sands hotel and casino which was absolutely beautiful!!
,,A Must See,5.0,,My partner and I went to Marina Bay Sands for the afternoon where we walked through the hotel. We also were lucky enough to go up to the Sky Bar and have a few cocktails whilst we watched the sunset over the city. It was amazing. Be sure to wear jeans and a collared shirt as the dress code for the bar is smart casual. We also went down at 8pm to watch the water show infront of the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Centre right outside the water fountain in the shopping centre. What a great night!!!
,,carols,4.0,,watched a moving carol service out side. we were all given candles and music sheets. a lovely area apart from xmas
,,Unbelievable View of the City and a Fabulous Infinity Pool,5.0,,"Even if you don't stay here, you must go to the top for the view. Spectacular. The infinity pool is amazing. The whole area around Marina Bay has been developed with the tourist in mind, and it is worth the visit."
,,top of singapore,4.0,,very good the views where excellent but it rain and was closed after about ten minutes of being up there . The hotel refunded our money $20
,,The place to be in Singapore,5.0,,I was there Christmas and New year 2011. Amazing place. Laser show on Christmas day. Don't miss the newest Vuitton store there......
,,"Perfect view, but really overcrowded",3.0,,"Perfect view, but really overcrowded It's really ok, if you live in another hotel and visit Marina Bay Sands to find out a perfect veiw"
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,Hotel Sky deck view and pool for magnificant 360 views of Singapore and best place to see the New years eve fireworks.

The view from the top of the hotel is wonderful"
,,MUST VISIT IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,"I was fortunate enough to be staying at the sail @ marina bay , right in fornt of all the action .. whenther its day or night you cld see tourist flocking there .

It was the new year night when the marina bay lit up with laser show and the fireworks.... feeling which cannot be described in words .

i would suggets to go when sunsets so you could see the lights .

As marina bay is a business hub , going on weekend wld be more peaceful"
,,Worth it,4.0,,"this is the best place to be in singapore at night. The setup , the lights , the open bars make life better atleast for few moments ;-) must visit at night"
,,part of the must see things of singapore,4.0,,this is of course a part of the must see things in singapore. If you have to possibility to go to the top of the marina bay hotel and overlook the surrounding and take some pictures ; part of the beautiful skyline of singapore
,,Incredible night skyline!,5.0,,It was nice to walk around Marina Bay at night and take some photos. Marina Bay Sands Hotel organized laser show around 11 p.m.
,,Walk,5.0,,"A lovely walk. Boat trip ot worth the money, do it by foot and then you can visit the marina bay sands, the Fullerton and all the cafes"
,,"a land mark location, with all facilities",5.0,,"the Museum, shopping mall, hotel, restaurants, deck, marina itself, casino, there is all there in Marina Bay... you can not go to Singapore and miss the bay. Taxi's are bit more expensive taken from there."
,,fabulous visit,5.0,,"view from Marina Bay Sands is breathtaking and absolutely worth a visit. Saw the most wonderful water, sound and light show on the bay."
,,All hype,3.0,,It is a great building and thats pretty much it. If you are at the merlion park you can get great views and take pictures. There is no real need to come here unless you really absolutely want to. The shops are mostly hi-end designer stores.
,,great view! best in Singapore,5.0,,"take it #1 in your sightseen program. Try to find time to spend there at daylight and nighthtime, it's different and very nice"
,,Big and sterile,3.0,,"It looks nice but has zero character, very sterile. The view is nice from the roof of the marina bay sands but the crowds are off-putting. The casino is depressing, reminds me of an airport, no one looks like they're having fun."
,,Loved it,4.0,,I was mesmerised by Marina Bay Sands. I couldn't stop looking at this great building and the shopping centre was great. We got the lift up to the top and took in the great views over Singapore. It's worth the money.
,,Lacked atmosphere,3.0,,"Expensive shops, though some like the Harley Davison and Ferrari shops are novel. Quite souless. View from the top would be amazing but we didn't feel like paying to see it."
,,Skyline view from Marina Bay Sands Bar,4.0,,"Felt like a real jet-setter sipping my cocktail drinks while overlooking the city of Singapore at night. The Marina Bay Sands bar was a little full when we got there, but there was enough room to drink, share some laughs, and quietly sip one's drink. Just a little below the bar is a paid viewing point. The interior is impressive, even intimidating."
,,Light and water shows are a must see,5.0,,Free light and water show every night. It's a little cheesy but you can't argue with the price! The area is beautiful with an eclectic mix of colonial and modern architecture.
,,Impressive,4.0,,Get on the SkyDeck (by day preferably) and enjoy the view over the city and the along the coast line. See the mega infrastructure projects around.
,,crazy place,4.0,,"the area is nice to walk around, and its easy to spend lots of money with all the expensive shops - i stayed well away from them!"
,,Shopping Centre Heaven,4.0,,Lovely shopping centre! Very clean and a good mix of shops. Obviously in Singapore its all about the label but I found some more wallet friendly shops too!
,,The new place to be and be seen....,5.0,,"The whole development of the Marina Bay area has created a new visitors' attraction in Singapore.

I would recommend the walk from the Merlion around the bay, through the Marina Bay Sands Mall, and finally across the Helix Bridge to connect back to either Millenia Walk and Suntec City or the Esplanade.

There are heaps of good photos ops in this entire area.

You can get good views both day and night.

And note that you can also finish off with a Singapore River Cruise from under the Helix Bridge that goes back up to Boat Quay or Clarke Quay.

All in all... you can make a cheap or free few hours in one of the poshest new developments in Singapore!"
,,Marina Bay is one of the kewlest places i have lived in over the last 10 years,5.0,,Been blessed to have lived opposite the Marina Bay for the last 3.5 years in Singapore. Great view. Nice ambience especially in the evening and the whole area has gotten a lot better since i moved in Sept 08. Nice restaurants and things to do around the area. And the skyline has changed with the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Highly recommend the same.
,,nice view on night,5.0,,"I love this area especilly at night. You can see light and sound shown form Maruna bay sand, sigapore flyer, Esplanade , and Merlion. I was on the bridge and saw these beatiful view here. You can sit and get some drink with your love one and saw all in one scence at One Fullerton. Recommended!!!"
,,A bit pricey but nice views,4.0,,"We stayed at the mandarin oriental which was literally on the marinna. The pub, and restaurants at the marina are a bit pricey (maybe be because it's a bit touristy) but the views of the marina bay sands hotel are amazing, and of course the marina forms part of the singapore GP"
,,Incredible Architecture - lots to see and do,5.0,,"We stayed at the Ritz Carton (10/10) so overlooked Marina Bay and could easily walk over the footbridge to the Mall and ArtScience Museum. It's a beautiful and awe-inspiring especially since the last time I was in Singapore that area was under water!!! The shopping is huge and varied and the food court is entertainment in itself - watching a chef prepare meter-long ramen noodles from scratch is eye-stretching stuff - and all cuisines available a freshly prepared on site including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Western, Thai, etc. There are also numerous upmarket restaurants with very good reputations in the centre. Even if your pocket cries at the name, the new out-of-this-galaxy Louis Vuiton Island Store has to be visited! The experience is tricky to describe as entering the store involves descending a spiral staircase, alighting a travelator through a photographic exhibition as well a book display/store with numerous coffee table books about the brand, and then ascending a looooong escalator up into THE STORE (capitals indicate my awe!) The entire wall of the space is glass and juts out over the bay so whe you walk to the side this has an amazing feel. And of course the shelves........
What grabbed my children's imagination and enjoyment the most, was Kenko Fish Spa and Massage shop. I can most definitely recommend this place and I supposed going back three times for fish spas, reflexology and massages speaks for itself. There are a number of Kenko Spas including Orchard Road, and prices are very reasonable. Just outside the Mall is the ArtScience Museum, currently housing the Titanic Touring Exhibition, it was more than expected, and the Cartier Time exhibition - which we didn't get to. With children along, we also didn't manage to pop into the Marina Bay Casino at the centre of the Mall. Most e enings there is a regular laser light show on the bay, also worth watching and it's free!"

,,Nice views over the Bay,4.0,,A great place to walk and look out over the Singapore skyline. Some places to take a seat.
,,A place to make for if rain is likely.,5.0,,"Spent a very pleasant couple of hours at Marine bay which is well worth a walk round, the interior allows access to a well appointed Mall with a good range of shops; take your passport with you and have a stroll round the casino. If it is dry pop over the skyway or undrpass to the adjacent hotel and visit Tower 1 to go onto the roof area for the best panoramic view of Singapore."
,,casino..?..haha.,5.0,,new experiences for sure and so many things that I can't forget.
,,A fun walk,5.0,,The new museums and mall are terrific. The Titanic exhibit is excellent.
,,A good way to see the city skyline,5.0,,We did this in the rainy season and got very wet inspite of the boat being covered. The colonial trading buildings have been well restored.
,,greatest property of the world,5.0,,with many high rise buildings and hotels and properties this is one of the best structure designed in singapore to attract a lot of visitors to have a look and glare its design with smile
,,Great place to stay,5.0,,Closer to sentosa fun park and all the other famous attractions are situated in this location
,,Walk around the whole bay,5.0,,"We walked all the way around and enjoyed every step. From the Merlion you go along past the new Fullerton Hotels and get a good look at the Marina Sands Hotel. Turn left along a park area that has some giant fans that are motion activated and solar powered, nice place to stop and cool down for a bit. Turn left again and go in to the building for a look at what is happening around Marina Bay, there's an interactive map and lots of information to be had (besides, by this time you're really hot and it's air conditioned). Continue along either past or (to be cooler) inside the shopping complex with its fancy shops and restaurants and lagoons with gondolas. From here you go across the ""Double Helix"" bridge and turn left to view the floating soccer pitch and part of the Grand Prix track. Finally, to get back to the Merlion you'll cross over a bridge and, if you're lucky, there'll be a vendor selling ice-creams from a slab which he'll sandwhich between two pieces of wafer (or bread if you prefer). Enjoy"
,,"Lovely bay, especially at night!",5.0,,I loved night lights and got wonderful photos. wonderful place.
,,This makes Vegas look 2nd rate,5.0,,"Walked over from the Ritz. My, oh my. What a complex. Three pavilions including the Sands casino. Across the street the three tower hotel with the SkyPark on top would blow anybody's mind."
,,good shopping,4.0,,a unique building with interesting shops and views across the bay to the city
,,"Great sights at night, and it is free",5.0,,"A nice walk at night after having a delicious dinner at the Marina Bay Shoppes. You have gorgeous views of the Marina. It's free, and it's relaxing, even romantic. A must-do for every visitor."
,,Very Impressive,4.0,,"Sands Corp have spent a fortune on this hotel/casino/shopping mall and it shows. Well worth a visit, especially if you are suffering Vegas withdrawl !"
,,Spend Some Time for Views and Food,5.0,,"Great place, day or nght. Go to Glutton's Bay to eat great street food. Watch the lazer show at 7PM and hourly each night. Catch a water taxi and head off to Boatt's Quay. Watch the locals."
,,Amazing Laser show,5.0,,Amazing laser show .. The guys at Hong kong with thier symphony of lights should be brought down here to learn what one can do with laser lights.. 8 pm from the Event plaza at marina bay sands and this is free too .. Not to be missed attraction if you are visiting singapore ..
,,Nice place for an evening stroll,5.0,,"We went there after a tiring day at Universal Studios Singapore, but the walk along the river was worth every second. Went to the casino afterwards which is one of the biggest we have even seen."
,,Worth a Peek,4.0,,"High end mall, casino, expensive Sands Hotel. Worth a visit once while in town. Must bring your real passport to enter the casino, not a passport card.
I hear the view from the top floor of hotel is fabulous but there is a charge - SGD 20."
,,"Bright, modern and expensive",4.0,,"Big buildings, bright lights and high-fashion shopping malls. An impressive exhibition of what man is capable of building. Make sure you check out the free water fountain, light, laser and music show every evening... very impressive."
,,Nice view by night,5.0,,"Was great, specialy view from Marina Bay Sands hotel. Nice at night great by day."
,,You must visit Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,We took a taxi at night to the Marina and walked to tower 2 and followed the signs to go in the lift to the top. It took seconds to travel I think 75 floors. We payed S$20.00 each well worth it and stepped out onto the top deck of the ship that stands on top of the three towers. The view is magnificent and took loads of pictures along with a few hundred others.If you are scared of heights this is NOT for you.
,,Laser Light Show,4.0,,Visit Marina Bay in the evening to view the laser light show of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is a visual spectacle. You also avoid the heat and humidity of the day! You can also try going around the bay in a cruiser.
,,Glittering Place for a cool evening walk,5.0,,"Best time to visit is while sun is settling down.. Also take the round trip Singapore River Cruise which touches the China Town , Clarke and returns back. I was there during lantern Festival weekend wonderful to watch the China Town bustling with activity from the Cruise.. Come back to the starting point opp. to Marina bay or close to the Floating Stadium and settle down for the 8.00 Light show to start.. Relax and enjoy the 10-15 mins. show and head out to the closest open Food court and enjoy the wonderful cheap food.. What a day to wind up.. in the Marina Bay.. Cool and Good.. will visit again and again.. always.."
,,Very Nice,4.0,,It's a nice place to walk around in Singapore. River cruise is available. Very neat & clean.
,,"Beautiful bay, make sure you visit",5.0,,"We had a lovely walk from Raffles City MRT to the Merlion and then we crossed the bridge near the Theatres on the Bay (the ""durians"") before making our way over to the wonderful Asian Civilisations Museum. When we were there, it was pouring with rain - will still had a good time (as per our photo), I can only imagine it would be even more pleasant in the evening or in good weather. Make sure that a walk around this area goes on your Singapore itinerary."
,,Nice area to visit,4.0,,"Because we stayed at Mandarin Orientel and had a marina bay view, we saw it from just our room which was nice. Although you can visit the bay from different vantage points.

We saw it from Marina Bay Sands & from the merlion statue. Not much to say about it apart from its a quick area that tourists can check out.

I believe you can do 'duck' boat tours around the bay as well too."
,,Great view from the top!,5.0,,"Worth visiting, you will enjoy great view of the city and the singapore flyer from the top!!! it is very expensive if you wanna have a drink or so but you can just go and visit without paying money!! so DO IT!!"
,,An underated activity,4.0,,When combined with the walkways in the quays this makes for a great 1 - 2hr stroll late in the day / earlyu evening. I would rather do this than many of the other so-called attractions in Singapore.
,,Best place to spend time at evening in Singapore,4.0,,"they have made it so beautiful.

it has foutain lazer shows with music and a very good message. the show keeps you busy from start to end and you realise you were in a different world.

the background with singapore skyline and bay view is beautful."
,,"Great for an evening stroll, night viewing of the city and harbor",4.0,,"As beautiful as the Marina Bay area has become over the past few years, its hard to imagine that this area is still under heavy development. The main harbor area inside the Marina Bay Sands hotel is mostly completed, making a fantastic promenade for casually strolling and enjoying your time. The Sands Mall, which seemed about 75-80% completed (March 2011) makes a good stop now. It will make a great add-on once completed, as will the Fullerton developments on the other opposite side of the inside harbor. The other side of the Sands Hotel is completely under construction at the moment, probably not accessible for a while. The new Marina Bay MRT station is not yet functional as well. Even the Merlion Statue seemed to be under renovation during our March trip.

As great as this area is already, it will only get better in the near future when everything is operational. We are already looking forward to a return trip to Singapore after everything is completed."
,,Awesome views from the top.,4.0,,This is an amazing complex. Costs SGD20 to get to the top. Crowded drinks area with a Diet Coke going for SGD9.25! On balance...worth it!
,,Best view in the night - marina bay,4.0,,"we walked along the marina bay area in the night. we started from One Raffles Quay at around 7.30 pm, walked along sail@ marina bay, marina boulevard, visited the casino and the high end mall at Marina bay sands, walked over the bridge with the backdrop of singapore flyer and marina bay sands building. With the lighting of the building in the CBD, the view of CBD from marina bay sands water front was just too beautiful to miss. take a camera sensitive to capture night images, you will get fantastic pictures."
,,Great place to see in Singapore,5.0,,"This area was amazing we really enjoy it. The bridge to the casino was excellent... far from was Theatre, May Bank... so on... every where was fantastic."
,,Exquisite High End Place in Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay located in Southern of Singapore City Center.
