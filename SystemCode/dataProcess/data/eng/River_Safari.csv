,,They can do better,2.0,,"There is potential for this part of the zoo to be a lot better than it is. My main concern is the way the animals are kept in the “ride” part of the safari, you have to pay extra to go on what is much like a theme park ride on a channel of water and I was very disappointed in seeing how small some of the enclosures were for the animals. They shouldn’t really keep some of these animals in these kind of conditions, they looked sad and depressed, it did not give me good feelings at all, they need to improve this part of the zoo."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Interesting river safari, a bit smelly, variety of animals and birds. Photo options provided are very expensive"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,This really should just be included as part of the zoo. It’s definitely not worth it as a seperate park. The amazon river ride - you wait so long for a few minute ride that’s not exciting at all. You see about five animals from far. Would not recommend.
,,A great half day out,5.0,,"We took our 2 sons (8 & 10) & had a lovely day out. They recommend you allow 3 hours, but it wasn't busy & we took our time and easily passed 5 hours. Lots of spaces to hide in the shade & indoors to keep cool. Lots of animals to see (Monkey Walk, Pandas, Red Pandas, lots of fish & reptiles). The free boat trip is a relaxing 15 mins (lots of info but not much to see) & it is worth paying for the extra safari boat trip as you do get to see quite a bit more. When we first visited the pandas they were all asleep so after out boat trip we wandered back & caught them all at feeding time & very active. It was well worth the walk back to see them a second time."
,,We loved it!,5.0,,"We visited the River Safari followed by the Night safari. We really enjoyed it. The animal show was great, the kids got to feed a Capybara which was exciting. We arrived around 3:30 on a Wednesday night and it wasn’t too crowded. We were done within 2 hours, but we didn’t do the boat ride as one child was already suffering from motion sickness."
,,Best for your kids!,5.0,,The location is the same area with Singapore zoo. If you looking for another experience than zoo this place is one of the best. They had a big aquarium also boat ride that you can enjoy animal through the glass. End of July is not too crowd so we finished all the park within 3-4hour. My suggestion is go early before 12PM.
,,"Go early, before the crowds",4.0,,"A nice walk through aquariums and a view of the pandas, before a short river ride. We went early to avoid the crowds, which was nice. The boat ride is really short though, just 15 minutes and we didn't see anything at all except for animals in the zoo, from the river."
,,Nice Place,5.0,,I love that place and it is a river themed park. It was a nice riding at Amazon Quest. You should visit to River Safari when you visit to Singapore Zoo.
,,See the pandas and walk with monkeys,5.0,,Great place to spend an afternoon in Singapore. Train ride and bus to get there but easy to navigate. Highlight for the kids were seeing the pandas and walking through an enclosure with a troop of monkeys. Could do the park in an hour if time limited. Plenty of shade/shelter for hot or rainy days. Boat ride tame but quick so have camera ready. Aquarium part also amazing. Highly recommend
,,One of the must go place in Singapore,5.0,,A lot of efforts spend to keep the natural reserve and taking care of the animals to make them as natural and as comfortable as possible. Great place for family to bring kids there for some fun too.
,,Loved the river cruise,5.0,,"I had a great few hours at river safari, I went on Friday afternoon so wasn’t too busy. I loved the animal show, it was great being able to feed the animals and have photos taken with them. The Panda was very cute, since it wasn’t busy when I went I didn’t have to wait. The amazon river quest was definitely worth the money, a relaxing boat ride and brilliant views of the animals. However, the other cruise (the free one) I didn’t get to see any animals so that was a waste of time. I definitely recommend river safari, there’s not enough to see there for a full day so maybe do river safari and then night safari."
,,Boat ride,4.0,,"Overall, we enjoy very much but the boat ride is closed for whole afternoon, the staff just ask us to try later, we go back 3 times but the service still suspend which waste our time and effort to go back and try."
,,Wonderful,4.0,,Only bad thing was hot & humid weather but A/C enclosures in between gave some relief. Good experience for children.
,,Definitely visit,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, won’t require all day - probably 3-4 hours max will cover it all off. Red Panda was a highlight. Skip the reservoir cruise, not much to that part of the zoo."
,,River Safari Singapore,1.0,,"We were quite disappointed - the safari was a semi educational trip. More suited to youngsters. Having been to the aquarium we didn’t need to see more fish. As for the ‘on water experience’- 15 mins on a reservoir, seeing the heads of two giraffes poking through foliage didn’t cut the mustard. However seeing the pandas was a joy."
,,Nothing to talk about!,3.0,,"Very average! The zoo was much better. U can finish this off in a hour or so. The zoo would take you atleast a full day to complete. Therefore, do the zoo & then finish off with the River Safari or the Night Safari, which was also very average!"
,,Good Family Time,4.0,,"I purchased the entrance and boat tickets on the official website. Very straightforward. Given e-tickets, so once you reach there, you will be able to enter without needing to queue for the physical tickets.
Walks in the park is nice. Well shaded. There were some interactions with the staffs for knowledge, for eg at the entrance, there was a small booth and the friendly staffs were there to explain the designs of some tools / toys for the birds. Which is quite an interesting topic i'd say.
Toilets are clean.
Easy to navigate. Plenty of rest areas.
Overall a really nice place for some relaxing and eye-opening experience for me.
The park isnt that huge, should be able to finish exploring within 2hrs or 3hrs depending on the speed and curiosity level of an individual. :)"
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Had a great time at River safari. Seeing the 2 pandas so active was amazing. We also loved the amazon river ride which you can go on twice for only one payment, and the river show was wonderful with beavers, pelicans, capabaras and more!
Would recommend."
,,Holiday with my baby,3.0,,Pros - Friendly to kids and elder. Nice place to visit especially Panda Cons - lack of choices for food in park.
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"We had such a great time on our river safari and we loved seeing the sights from the river. It was peaceful, enjoying the breeze and nature all the way to the lake. It's a very good experience and a lot of fun, kids like it very much. We will definitely go again."
,,Unique view of the World Rivers.,4.0,,"Visited on a Friday, not so busy. Displays are of the animals & aquatic life in the major rivers of the world. The first being The Mississippi River, Congo, Nile, Gangee, Mary (Australia), Mekong & Yangtze. All the displays are set behind glass walls with full descriptions and pictures of the animals or fish shown. It is a gentle walk along the walkways that are sheltered from the weather and reasonably cool. They have a touch pool for children. After exiting from the Yangtze River display, you are then in the Red & Giant Panda area. You then cross the bridge to the boat plaza were you can take a 15min ride around the Reservoir and you may be lucky to see the Rhino's and Giraffe in the zoo. The Amazon River Quest boat ride is also located here. The animals on display are listed as you enter each section, but it is sometimes hard to spot some, especially the monkeys and the boat travels quite quickly for any photo opportunities. Would come back again."
,,Such a beautiful park,5.0,,"River safari is one of my favourite location to take people who come to visit me in Singapore. It’s very well done, covers the entire world of river fish and animals who normally live around rivers and they have pandas! But no matter how much I like pandas, I think my favourite attraction is still amazon river quest. It’s a 10 minute boat ride through amazonian jungle. Highly recommend you to get this

Don’t bother getting the other boat ride on the lake as there is nothing special to see"
,,I will never swim in a river again!,5.0,,Some of the most fascinating fish I never knew existed! A must see even for those of us who like to keep out of the water. This exhibition is worth every cent of the entry fee.
,,An amazing experience,5.0,,"The highlight of our two days in Singapore. It’s a bit difficult to get to by public transport so we taxied from the city and were glad we did. Our driver was chatty and very informative and our trip seemed to pass quickly and was reasonably priced at S$21 (our return trip was longer because of the road layout and was closer to S$30. The River Safari entrance was close to the taxi drop off and we were soon walking around the displays. It’s a mix of internal displays and external walks with displays such as glass walls of water tanks or recreations of different water habitats. Unlike big city aquariums this is a walk devoted to the big rivers of the world - the Amazon, the Nile, the Ganges , The Mekong and the Mississippi and it’s done fantastically. The specimens are unique and very interesting. The highlights for us were seeing piranhas, the Pandas (both of whom - Kai Kai and Jia Jia - were out and active as we arrived, and seeing the spider monkeys plus other animals up and close in the special enclosure. It took us about 2 hours to see the things of interest and we departed absolutely exhilarated. Well worth the 30 minute trip each way."
,,Learn about life in and around water,4.0,,"The place is mainly sheltered and air conditioned. Hence, there is little worry about the weather.

It is a great place to learn about life in and around great rivers of the world. It is also one of the few places to see pandas.

The free reservoir cruise is little more than a joy ride. There is little chance of seeing birds or animals during the cruise. We spotted some rhinos and giraffes from a distance and that was about it.

The optional Amazon River Quest was more interesting. It may not be easy to spot or take photos of animals or birds while the boat is moving. However, as long as you do not exit, you can go for repeated rides at no extra charge."
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,"With the theme of rivers, it complements the visit to the zoo. Star attractions have to be Pandas and Manatees. There are also the Giant Otters, Catfish, Stingrays, Red Pandas etc. Have to go on the River Cruise and Amazon River Quest boat rides. Will go there again."
,,Must visit .,5.0,,Must visit. Good setup. Wheelchair friendly setup . Highly recommended . Very accessible . It was raining very heavily but all walkway are sheltered.
,,Good but not too priority,4.0,,"I bought 4 parks combo tickets and went zoo and river safari the same day. These 2 parks are very near and just next to each other.
Expected to see diff tanks and fish, which in fact the tank is well decorated compared to other theme parks so is a pleasant to see. Take the boat to see the lake but expecting it is quite hot as there is no fan not air conditioning.
Considering usually staying Singapore just few days while there are lots other things to do, I will have it on to-do list when there are spare time"
,,The pandas were the highlight,4.0,,"We travelled by public transport as advised in the website, very easy to get there.
We love visiting zoos and wildlife parks and chose this one for the pandas, we were not disappointed.
It did take us 3 laps of the panda area before we finally got the experience we had hoped for. They were both being fed and were absolutely amazing. The red panda was also great, very inquisitive.
The on-site Chinese restaurant was nice, we enjoyed our lunch.
The river cruise was peaceful, but not much to see. The cruise ride was good, but too quick.
The manatees were pretty amazing, we also saw them being fed, which was pretty cool."
,,All weather zoo,4.0,,"The entire walk through the zoo is covered, hence come rain or shine, it's good for a visit. Do try to visit during the feeding times for the pandas. Weekdays are a good time to visit to view these cute animals as the crowd is smaller. You may also get glimpses of the zoo when you go on the reservoir cruise. Quite a wide variety of animals to view. The zoo is accessible to wheelchairs except for the Amazon Quest. The whole Mandai zoo site is undergoing major renovations, mainly outside of the park areas, so there should be more attractions coming in the future."
,,Good park,4.0,,"My wife and I took a taxi from Sofitel Sentosa to the park and zoo ($28. SGD) we spent a few hours at the river Safari and we did enjoy it , the it has some good animals and fish to look at and the log flume type ride was very good.
Great park"
,,A rare experience,4.0,,"We spent about 3-4 hours here. The staff were very friendly. The river safari was okay, it was just another boat ride. The proximty to the zoo helped us cover both the spots in a single day. Good place for kids."
,,Great day out with the family,5.0,,"Easy to buy tickets online without having to queue. Ample signage from start to end makes navigating the park easy. Exhibits on displayed were engaging for all ages. Best attraction was of course the panda enclosure. Good place to go as most places are sheltered, so strolling around was still possible in case of rain. General upkeep of the attraction was also excellent. Highly recommended."
,,Great for kids.,4.0,,"Informative, well kept. A lot about fish but as well pandas and other land animals. We enjoyed it more than the zoo."
,,Not as impressive as I thought it would be,3.0,,"We bought a combo ticket to the Singapore zoo and River Safari as I read they were both amazing and my 7 yr old twins really wanted to see the pandas. I thought we’d be at the safari for quite a few hrs but 1hr was enough. It’s great how the entire walk is covered especially as it rained. We also loved the monkey enclosure as they roam freely all around you. Our main disappointment was with the pandas, the main attraction! One panda was sleeping which is ok, they sleep a lot and at least we got to see it, but the 2nd panda wasn’t even in its enclosure. It was in a room behind the enclosure sleeping and you had to view it on a tv. If I wanted to see a panda on tv, I could of stayed in Australia! My children were pretty disappointed."
,,Pandas,3.0,,A great place to see pandas especially as these ones were awake compared to the ones in Edinburgh 😂 great for kids but otherwise okay to tag on with the zoo
,,Fun,4.0,,"Amazon Quest very fun, boat ride very boring, nothing to see and very hot. But lucky see panda, so overall 70 marks."
,,Pandas!!!,5.0,,You have to see the pandas! Is one of the places in the world where you can do that! Kai Kai and Jia Jia are so cute! The boat rise is alsi nice so visit it!
,,Pricey and more of the same,3.0,,"Pricey - as everything in Singapore is. Might be good for kids but just more of the same, really. The river cruise was a massive letdown - you're taken around the reservoir seeing nothing in particular. Staff on board couldn't really answer questions about what was around them."
,,Underwhelming,2.0,,River Safari just didn’t do it for me. A few years back we spent a wonderful day at the Singapore Zoo which we thought was magnificent so perhaps our expectations were too high for this adjoining attraction. $34 to get in and for that all I seemed to do was walk whereupon I saw a few fish a few exotic looking water creatures and a few monkeys. Most else was hiding sleeping. I was in and out in little over an hour and was in a word underwhelmed. To take a family would be quite an expensive proposition and for me I just didn’t think it was value for money.
,,River Safari,5.0,,"The pandas were great, got to see them up close and personal ! my 5 year old girl loved the jaguar. My 72 year old mum and my girl loved the Amazon River Quest. A great bonding day out."
,,"Most enjoyable, though not what we envisioned!",4.0,,"The name ""River Safari"" suggests that one will be cruising along a river! While there are two actual boat activities - the Reservoir Cruise and the Amazon River Quest (both most enjoyable) - the remainder of the ""River Safari"" is on foot, which was unexpected! However, the displays are well set out and showcase a range of river life from around the world. Well worth a visit, especially if combined with a trip to the Singapore Zoo or Night Safari, as it is right next door! Be aware of timings - although it stays open to 7pm some activities/exhibits close earlier."
,,Great way to spend half a day in Singapore,5.0,,This reserve is maintained very well and it’s a delight to see the creatures through crystal clear glass in large tanks especially the giant turtles and manatees. The show is very enjoyable as well. The Panda exhibit was a highlight of our trip. We couldn’t do the Amazon river quest as our child didn’t meet the height requirement but are sure to return for that once he’s older.
,,Good experience,5.0,,"Fun experience. Suitable for family, friends or couple date. The boat ride was fantastic and it only cost you $5. A must try when u visit river safari"
,,A fantastic day out with my family,5.0,,"We had a wonderful day out with the family. Small things mattered - for example my mother needed a wheelchair, which was readily available. The overall experience in viewing the animals and their natural surroundings was exciting to see as well as energizing."
,,No excitement,1.0,,It was just a walk a way and nothing interms of river safari as expected We were expecting entire safari would be via boat for entire 2-3 hours taking us through various items.
,,Unique Zoo Experience,5.0,,"On a day in May when the weather was unsettled I visited River Safari. It proved to be an ideal environment to avoid the rain showers and the unpleasant humidity. The expansive areas of covered decking, and the ice cold air conditioning in the underwater caves was a great way to escape. However, the original presentation of land animals and underwater life associated with key rivers in the world was very engaging, and well suited to the river location. The healthy, contented animals were were a delight and the obvious stars of the show."
,,Singapore Zoo Visit with Family,5.0,,"We visited the Singapore Zoo with my family and it was so great. Although some of the attractions were closed for upgrading, still it was fun!"
,,River Safari Day Tour,5.0,,Great experience. River Safari is easy accessible and child friendly. Highly recommended for family tour with young children. Thumb up.
,,Great,5.0,,"Great ~ Not a lot of queue, Nice staff, awseome animals, would recommend taking both of the boat trips"
,,Our 3rd visit,4.0,,Overall pleasant experience. Easiest to navigate compared to Singapore Zoo or other Parks probably due to its size. Park is well kept. Didn’t manage to see the Indian Gharial on our last trip. But love seeing Jia Jia.
,,Best Zoo,5.0,,"The best zoo I’ve ever been. Love Kai Kai, Jia Jia, and the manatees! Will definitely come back again and again."
,,Fun for kids,5.0,,Our children (6 & 8) enjoyed the trip tremendously. It’s mostly sheltered so it’s not as hot as the zoo. The boat ride was a little over-rated but fun for the kids never the less. We’ll be back again later this year.
,,Perfect day out on a hot sunny day!,5.0,,An unforgettable time! The whole place is either indoors/air-conditioned OR shaded path - So it is a perfect place to explore when the Singapore weather is being quite hot and humid! We HIGHLY enjoyed the Amazon boat ride - Such a great idea!!!! Although the family before us were upset as your children do need to be a certain height to go on the boat ride which is a shame as even small children would enjoy it! We were lucky enough to not only go on the Amazon boat ride once but 3 times! Enjoyed it each time and the animals were all in different spots each time for us to view. Highly recommend for those looking for a different kind of zoo adventure.
,,River Safari,3.0,,"Visited this attraction in the morning, general display is good but the river ride isn't really worth the money. Very short ride and as we visited mid morning most of the animals were undercover and we couldn't see them."
,,River Safari Singapore,5.0,,"Even though the weather was balmy and hot, the overall condition set by River Safari was conducive for even my young son to run and enjoy.
He especially loved the being able to touch some of the animals (Which was provided by trained staff) and the panda enclosure."
,,Saturday morning walk,5.0,,"This was not a usual Saturday morning for me, my futsal game was cancelled. Didn’t want to vegetate at home, so Darling Jac suggested we head out to the River Safari. So that where Jac, my Daughter Mel and I headed for.

The last time I was here, my eldest, Bryan just his polytechnic studies (he’s 30 now)... so what’s that.. about 10 years ago. Have to say the River Safari has changed so much.. so much more to see.

I liked that they laid out the enclosures/exhibit based on regions of the world..i.e Amazon, African etc

I thoroughly loved the show they put up, very entertaining.

All the animals were healthy and quite active. And of course, how can I forget mentioning the two cute giant Pandas. A must see since these animals are so rare.

We loved the park so much, we decided to buy an annual 4 park membership. One time payment and you can go to the 4 Parks; River Safari, Zoo, Night Safari and the Bird Park as many times as you want with the 12 month of the purchase date (since then, darling and I did all 4 Parks already).

Anyways, it was a very nice day out at the River Safari.

If you have 3 hours to spare.. the River Safari is a pretty good place to hang out."
,,Fantastic experience! Eat dinner here early if going on to Night Safari,5.0,,"We absolutely LOVED the River Safari. Definitely as un-missable as the Night Safari. We very highly recommend doing the Amazon River Cruise part of the park also. The little monkey forest area was a real highlight, as were the pandas and the otters. We did the River Safari in the afternoon before doing the Night Safari. What we didn't realise was all of the eating places would close as the park was closing (we thought eating places would stay open a bit later) so we were forced to eat at the Night Safari, which cost us precious Night Safari time. Next time, we'd make sure we ate an early dinner at the River Safari, then continue to enjoy the animals at the River Safari, before heading on to the Night Safari."
,,Children had a blast,5.0,,"A highly recommended place. Again we intentionaly planned our visit here on a weekday. Few people are.around hence we were able to see the attractions hassle free and more than twice. Wait for the once upon a river , feeding of monkey around 5:15 and feeding of the mannatees 5:30pm. Kids love the panda and the manatees. Oh we love the amazon ride. But the reservoir ride not that much. But all in all , a big yes."
,,Surprising use of land,5.0,,"I loved this experience. It is a huge expense of land 30mins away from the city zone and a world away. The trip out is lush green, although condos crowd the motorway.
The venue is easy to navigate and has lots of interesting exhibits all beautifully kept. The reservoir itself is lovely (you’ll see it by night at the night safari). Great (small) spaces for the animals. The boat rides are sweet. Giraffes spotted from the boat in the zoo zone. ( They could get rid of the shrub fence here- giraffes don’t swim!)
Just now need to stop the screaming of the uncontrolled kids and tapping on the glass! Yep, good luck with that."
,,Nice tteat for kids and family,5.0,,"The parks planned and designed very meticulously. There are activity areas, eating places and rest area also. Trams and vehicles are also available."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"We did this as an add on to the day zoo, while it is great to do I dont need the urge to race back . The highlight is the aquariums they are awesome. We spent the extra on the cruise not worth the $5 thats for sure . In the future with more to see then might be back ."
,,A fun place for children to explore,4.0,,Spent few hours at River Safari after visited the zoo. A fun place for children to explore the wildlife. My kids most preferred places are the Giant Panda Forest and Amazon Flooded Forest.
,,River safari not Soo excited,4.0,,"Not Soo excited... you can see Pandas
You will enjoy One show which will last for 10-15mins with some animals kids probably enjoy this,
One river cruise it’s like Boat ride in river surrounded by thick forest full of greenery which will last for 15mins
Amazon river quest like some guided boat ride you can see some birds and some animals"
,,Go for the panda and the amazon boat ride,5.0,,"The highlight of the river safari is really the Panda. Cute and playful when we went, it entertained us massively with its antics. Located in a temperature controlled area which is another bonus as it is very hot outside, the panda did all sorts of tricks of rolling, climbing, giggling, etc.

The River safari is right next to the zoo and is themed based on major rivers of the world and the aquatic life found in those rivers. You would see the fishes, crocodiles, etc. and at the mid way is the location where the pandas are to be seen. There is a Red panda which can be seen as close as 5 feet and the giant pandas are seen from a healthy distance.

Reservoir cruise takes us to a 30 minute cruise on the reservoir - nothing special other than that it provides an opportunity to sit back and recharge after a lot of walking

The amazon boat ride is nice and lets you see some of the animals via boat ride, however it is too short - about 10 minutes

Another highlight is the ""Once upon a river show"" at 4:30 pm - Very entertaining and fun show that is not to be missed.

Overall, worthy of the visit and fun to do"
,,A different perspective,3.0,,"How should I put it? Is interesting enough to warrant half a day walking and looking at the different animals but it would have been better if there were more different types of animals. There were 2 different boat rides. One which was a 15 minutes ride around the nearby catchment area where you’ll get to see some animal enclosure located in the zoo and night safari. The other ride would take you around some of the animals enclosure within the river safari where you get to see flamingos and many other types of animals.
Overall, interesting place to go. Enjoy!"
,,Best River Safari,5.0,,"River Safari, Singapore Zoo and Night Safari are all located in the same place. It is a good idea to visit all three parks on the same day. As a park, there are mostly different animals. We reached about 10 river safari in the morning. And handle the cover for about 2 hours. The Park Most of this park is covered and although it is gold We are not very affected. Due to rain Cross our boat Still happy, we The Park"
,,Must see,5.0,,"Attraction can be done during rainy day. The path way is covered. We went on a rainy day, unfortunately the boat ride was cancelled and the monkey area as well. Beautiful surrounding with a lot of tropical tree which looks fresh during a rainy day. Love the restaurant near the panda’s."
,,Best day ever,5.0,,I loved every bit of it and i must say its worth every dollar and the long journey getting here! Would definitely visit again.
,,So much fun! Amazing pandas!,5.0,,We had a great time! Easy to park and access. We walked around viewing various animals and went on the boat ride and the river safari ride where we saw animals that we would other wise not have. This was extra but worth it. We had panda Bau in the restaurant! They were so good!! And we saw the amazing pandas eating their lunch! A lovely day out!
,,Interesting Place,4.0,,This was our first visit to River Safari we went there specially for the Pandas. Interesting place it's like an open air Aquarium the. The fish are housed according to the Rivers they are found in which was cool. We took the Reservoir cruise which was fun there was small section where the kids could touch some starfishes. But the star attraction were the Giant Panda my kids saw a Panda for the first time they really excited. Its not a must Visit place but if you have the time it's informative and different you can spend a couple of hours here.
,,Zoo official ticket pay extra inside for river cruise,3.0,,If you buy the official ticket at the gate you are confronted with paying 5 dollars extra at the gate to the river safari ride which they call river quest. Seems that they can only get such a high price because of the pandas.
,,Good if you have 2 -3 hrs to spare,4.0,,This too needs walking just like other parks. The river cruise was ok and a short one.. . They have an aquarium with some nice collection of fish. The main attraction was panda though.
,,Fantastic Experience for Old and Young Alike with Outstanding Staff,5.0,,The view were stunning with some experiential splendor that entertains the young and the old (21 elderlies on wheelchairs). The staff were very helpful and goes beyond their call of duty to help our Thong Teck Home residents take the boat ride around the river.
,,OK-ish trip,2.0,,"There is more sight seeing and less of animals. Its made on vast land so you end up walking n spending time a lot so that part can be enjoyed if weather is good.

My biggest complain is when the guy did not let me son take the boat ride -Amazon river quest even though he was right till the height and more than 3 years old age. I honored his request but when we went in without our son, I was shocked to see other kids much shorter than him allowed to board the ride. Don't know why this disparity!!!

good thing- very wheelchair friendly and small pop shops inside.

The cruise does not operate during rains- valid reasons but be prepared to end up missing it.
ZOO is way better and more fun any time!"
,,Visit with mum to River Safari,4.0,,"A little too few attractions. Some of the toilets were too dark. There were a lot of spider webs on the pillars throughout the park. The park was generally well maintained, from the Panda enclosure to the big aquarium and the footpaths. Wished there were more animals and more attractions."
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,"Just next to the Singapore zoo and in the same complex, this is a unique experience. You look at animals from a boat which passes through an artificial river.While you pass, animals can be seen on either side of the river including lions, cheetah, monkeys, swans etc.
Though a short trip, I would have loved if it was a bit longer but all in all a great adventure."
,,"Well worth the visit, loved manatees and pandas",5.0,,"Seems very few overseas tourists choose to visit this park, which is a shame. There were some truly amazing creatures in modern, naturalistic enclosures, and plenty of shade and rest areas for those of us struggling with hot steamy weather. The manatees were wonderful, as were the pandas (Giant and Red). We enjoyed the slightly cheesy Amazon River ride, however the reservoir cruise felt pointless (out and back in ten minutes, no pointing out local animals). The ""Once upon a river"" show was excellent and my personal highlight was hand feeding carrot to a Beaver after the show. Well worth a couple of hours, great to do after Singapore Zoo and before the Night Safari."
,,Great adventure,4.0,,The trip was very adventurous and we noticed the manatees have grown and their family is expending. My girl loved the place and the panda was superb too.
,,Awful staff behavior,1.0,,"We reached at normal hours and fortunately, there was no queue.
Anyhow there is a walkway [ covered with ropes to make queues ] you need to pass to board the boat.
- My mother has health problem and cannot walk much.
- Since there was no queue and no person apart from us, we asked the staff if they can open the rope for my mother so that she has to walk less.
- To our surprise, the staff came to us and said she cannot go in!! I explained the staff the request is to cut the distance short for her (in clear and soft english which they can understand) but the guy (from staff) was on loop mode and kept us telling that she has to move out!!
- At last I was about to loose my cool when other staff members were just looking the scene [ including the member whom we asked intially and was aware of my mother's walking situation ]

At last, my mother had to walk throughout the walkway to reach to the boat. Note that the tickets needs to be purchased well before you reach to this spot and hence you would not like to skip this when such pathetic staff members are in your way."
,,A large aquarium,4.0,,"The river safari is like a large aquarium based around a river theme. I found it interesting, but there is a lot of walking required (even though it is relatively flat). The Amazon River Quest is worth doing as is viewing the animal show. Parts were disappointing - only one of the pandas was on display and several exhibits were impossible to find in their tanks. It is said that the average time for a visit is 3.5 hours. I was there closer to 4 and that was without lingering. Public transport to the venue is not great. Waited 40 minutes for a shuttle that is meant to run every 20."
,,Good place to go for the family,4.0,,"I enjoyed the day out with my young children at the River Safari. To save time, and maximise your time there, you can buy your tickets online. For locals, this option allows you to enjoy a discount.

Take the boat ride. You don't see much animals, but it is an experience to see the reservoir from inside it. In any case, it is a short ride, and allowed me some time to rest.

Once again, like the Night Safari and Zoo, they have done up the attractions very well."
,,Kids had lot of fun!!,5.0,,The fishes and panda is fantastic. Boat ride is ok. Didn't realize the adventure ride was different and kids got extra ticket accompanied by one adult and they had lot of fun.
,,Pamdas by the river,5.0,,A very interesting and informative visit highlights are the Pandas and manatees there is also a river cruise that you can do for a reasonable price
,,Remarkable zoo,5.0,,My first time to River Safari. I was expecting something like maybe a place full of fishes but I was surprised that it has more animals to offer. The pathway was made in a way that you just follow the path and you will complete the visit meaning you won’t miss anything. This is where they house the 2 panda bear. They even offer a short river cruise to see some wild animals. The visit was worth it and it will be cheaper to bundle with Singapore Zoo. It will be a good experience for kids to learn about animals and their habitat.
,,Excellent and unique zoo experience,5.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect at River Safari but I was pleasantly surprised. The park itself is relatively small but they cram a lot into the space, with themed areas containing wildlife from certain regions. The highlights are the pandas, who live in air conditioned luxury (you must be quiet when you visit) and the Amazon River Quest, a gentle boat ride that takes you through exhibits such as flamingos and leopards. Highly recommend."
,,Early Visit Best ......Why Not Single entrance Fee?,4.0,,"My daughter and I enjoyed most of this river-based zoo with minimal crowds by arriving before opening time (10 am). Interesting collection of fish, mammals and animals, and whilst we enjoyed the Giant Pandas who live in mountainous bamboo forests, not quite sure why they feature in a zoo based on several of the world's rivers? The 15 min reservoir cruise is pleasant, but you don't see any animals bar a few from distance. Strangely there is an extra charge for 10 min Amazon Cruise and would encourage the management to simply make one inclusive entrance fee and stop this nonsense. We enjoyed the ""Once Upon A River"" show at 1130 which was good fun. Overall it was enjoyable to visit this slightly different format of zoo, but lower your expectations on what you will see from the boat."
,,Something different,4.0,,Was nice to go somewhere a little different from normal zoo. The boat trip was a highlight. Daughter loved the pandas who were both very active.
,,EDUCATIONAL and ENVIRONMENTAL,5.0,,Wear flat shoes because this is one of the LONGEST WALKS you'll ever experience in your life! My family enjoyed the Amazon River Tour so much the additional 5sgd is worth it
,,Perfect for the humid Singapore weather,5.0,,"If like me, you have been to Singapore several times and need something to do with older kids, 8-10years, this is a perfect choice for those sweltering humid days.
We have done the Zoo and Night Zoo before. Getting here is convenient and cheap. You can take the shuttle from the Khartib MTR station. Cost 1SGD. Most of the way is covered or in shade.
The displays are done nicely. The mix of marine and animal displays also makes for an interesting change. The Chinese restaurant onsite has affordable lunch menus, with nice views to the lake.There is also a small sandwich Kiosk, if you need some nibbles.
Included is a river cruise, very low key, but a nice quiet 15 min interlude.
An add on is the Amazon ride for 5SGD, which has a small thrill factor. Would come here again. At the exit we also made the time pass, before heading back to the city"
,,Extremely kid and elderly friendly attraction,5.0,,"River Safari is a much younger entity under the Singapore Zoo, and it was definitely well-planned with the young and old in mind. We intentionally chose this place to visit because it is almost entirely covered in shade, and extremely easy to navigate. There is just one route and you just follow that route, which will bring you to at least five themes of river e.g. Amazon River (America), Ganges River (India), Yangtze River (China), Mekong River (Vietnam), etc etc etc, The animal exhibits were were curated and well taken care of.

We even rented two scooters from the front counter, at about sgd20 per scooter for about two hours. The elderly in our family had a great time even though they couldn't walk much. And the little ones enjoyed being in the prams with no bumpy roads, just smooth rides all along. Great family bonding between the very young and old.

The first highlight was definitely the pandas conservatory, as we were able to literally walk into it, on a bridge hanging in the air above their home on the ground. Tip: they are most active at 9am, during breakfast time. Miss that golden timing and you may not be able to catch them at all!

The second highlight were the River Safari boat rides. However, even though the family caught the ride at around 11am, most animals were already hiding and sleeping as it was hot out there. Tough luck. Probably better to come at a not-so-hot timing in Singapore (which is tough too considering Singapore is famous for being hot all year round). Well at least the ride itself was leisurely and enjoyable. Those who are not able to ride the boats (i.e. children below 1 metre) can actually enjoy meeting some animals at the mini stage set up right beside the river boat's ticketing booth. The little ones managed to feed some wombats and pelicans and that was awesome.

The third highlight, and possibly one of the coolest, was their Amazon River aquarium. How very cool to depict the flooded Amazonian Rivers with its seasonal aquatic animals entering and living in the forest, when it's flooded. You can view the manatees both from the aquarium point of view, as well as from above the aquarium. It's true that it's not a full aquarium like the SEAquarium at Sentosa, but hey, it's pretty good enough considering it's only ONE of the many other interesting spots within this River Safari.

There ain't many eateries, but several small ones which were good enough:
- mama panda cafe right after the panda exhibit, great first point of rest for your tired feet with strong air-conditioning
- several ""stores"" all housed in the big tent at the main entrance/exit to this park. They sell local foods, desserts, western and Italian foods, ice-cream, and of course Chinese foods too. No A/C here.
- if all else fails, they still have some small cafes and KFC (with A/C)!"
,,Not at all value for money,1.0,,"It mostly has different types of fishes in disty water (not as clean as sea aquarium).
I wouldnt have regretted doing river safari if the ticket was not 32 dollars. It is really nicely made, but not much to see. To make it worse the boat ride was closed due to weather which is out of anyone's control."
,,Awesome though...,4.0,,"The place is clean, and the entire place is great especially the 2 cruises- boat cruise and the amazon cruise. We only see few animals during the boat cruise, and most of the time, the 10 or 15mins was only the river view. For amazon cruise, it was a very good experience and a must-see. Also don't miss the red panda and 2 pandas."
,,The river boat ride was alot of fun seeing all the animals and birds,3.0,,We Loved seeing the Panda . This place has a lot of shade covers over the walkways which was great. The River boat was the best part of this place and seeing animals and lovely birds from here. We found the rest quite average for adults. Kids will love it .
,,Get there early,4.0,,"Lovely walk with riverboat trip, gets very busy as the day goes by especially at the weekend, quite pricey for what's there but Singapore is expensive, loads of food outlets and easy parking"
,,Interesting experience,4.0,,We went to river safari on a weekday evening when the weather was really nice. Luckily we could reach the boat on time before closure on 6pm but maybe half of the animals on the boat ride were not visible and we were told that they are mostly out in the morning and go back to their home in the evening. We also could see one of the pandas (out of 2) from far and there were some interesting animals that worthed seeing as well. However the whole thing is not very big and it could be visited around 2 hours. Overall its an interesting experience to have at least once in Singapore.
,,A Wonderful Family Day Out,4.0,,"Just brought my two boys aged 8 and 4 to the Singapore Zoo and River Safari for the third time yesterday. The last time, we visited the River Safari first and then the Zoo but we've decided to do it in reverse this time around because there's more shelter in the River Safari. We went to the Zoo at about 9:30am, had lunch at the dinner area outside the Zoo at about 12pm and then went to the River Safari at about 12:45pm. The River Safari is a lot smaller than the Zoo and as we had visited twice previously, we moved pretty quickly. It's always nice to see the pandas and the Mekong exhibit."
,,Excellent display of animal aquarium / enclosure,5.0,,"I love that the size of River Safari is just nice, not to big and too small. Great for family time. Walkable size of walking distance for all ages. A lot of sitting spots, so that the elderly or small kids could rest in between their walks. The animal aquarium or enclosure is really awesome and cool that you can enjoy the views of Big Fishes from any angle. Took the Amazon River Quest, it was great but would be better if the animals can be easily spotted. The Reservoir Cruise is nice too, very relaxing. Overall, the ambience was naturally awesome, worth value of money and time well spent. Will definitely want to go again."
,,Singapore trips,4.0,,"The water zoo is located near Singapore Zoo. And the Night Safari has strange aquatic animals from around the world. And cute animals Like Panda and Red Panda, see also Including can rafting along the river, watch animals from the Amazon forest, Amazon River Quest. And take a cruise boat ride to watch the river.
May be a little difficult because you have to sit on the mrt and connect the bus If it is most convenient, advise to take a taxi."
,,Couple Date,5.0,,Awesome! My boyfriend is a big fan of fishes. Will come by again. As this was my boyfriend's first time here. We do enjoyed the place there alot even though the price was abit expensive. Great trip once again!
,,Good,4.0,,It was relaxing trip. Go before 5 pm that will be helpful so that you can go around and also experience the joy of amazon river safari
,,Good fun,5.0,,Informative and relaxing. The Amazon cruise can be repeated free of charge which is great. You see more the 2nd time round.
,,River safari feedback,5.0,,"The place is amazing very clean and well kept. However was a bit disappointed for not being able to see all feeding sessions as they were kind of close one to another. Additionally, the boat trip was a bit too noisy and the volum of the information play was too low so could not benefit from what has been said.
Otherwise, the place was just great"
,,So much fun,5.0,,"Great zoo, it’s not huge so easily done in half a day. Also most areas are undercover so doesn’t matter if it rains. You can get quite close to the animals too :)"
,,Outing,5.0,,Great place to spend the weekend but importantly ensure that there is no corporate event happening during your visit
,,Excellent,4.0,,"Really enjoyed this park. Some really different exhibits and very well done. Don’t miss the amazon river ride it’s an optional extra when you book but it’s essential in my opinion. The squirrel monkey walk through is fabulous, so great to be up close with the monkeys playing around you. Seeing the manatee being fed was awesome. They are amazing creatures. As a European visitor the panda enclosure was great for us as it was air conditioned ."
,,"Wow, we love all the parts making up Singapore Zoo",5.0,,"We bought combined tickets for the Zoo, Bird Park, Night Safari and this the River Safari.
As with all of the other parts of the 'zoo' this was very well kept and maintained and is the only 'river zoo' we have ever been to.
We spent ages watching the manatees - we have never seen them anywhere before and my budding zoologist teenage daughter was overawed by them. We stopped to watch them feeding which was great to see.
We also desperately wanted to see the pandas, and weren't disappointed on this count either!
We were there fairly early in the morning to try to avoid the sun which worked for us and the place was not crowded at all which meant we got up really close to many of the animals."
,,River safari is a must,5.0,,Be sure to catch the red pandas. The river safari can be done on another day from your zoo visit or tag on. It is worth it
,,Fun day out,5.0,,"Having been disappointed with our visit to the Bird Park, our visit here finished off our day on a high. The panda bears were a treat as was the river ride. Some very interesting exhibits and enclosures"
,,Amazing time spent,5.0,,"Very well kept and maintained as the first and only fresh water themed zoo in the world.
Sheltered all the way so can walk even with in a hot afternoon! We spent a well 4 hours - the show and Amazon river quest was amazing. You get unbelievable close to the animals! Pandas and the money forest were amazing as well! Really worthed every penny considering it’s cheaper than surrounding zoo enclosures:)"

,,"Waters of the world, plus oh the pandas!",5.0,,"Most of the acquariums you would visit would mostly have ocean creatures in a closed building. This is quite a different experience, one you cannot have unless you travel all the rivers of the world.
In this beautiful park you will learn, and see river full ecosystems at a close distance, as if you were an in invisible witness in the middle of nature.
But as if this was not enough, we would have needed an extra day just to repeat the amazon river quest (make sure you get a stamp if you want to re-ride) and the pandas enclosure. Three keynotes on the panda visit: 1) Go when they are eating so you see them awake, 2) Do not miss to have a panda bun in Mama Panda Kitchen and 3) Check the panda cute merchandise in the shop next to the enclosure."
,,Entrance Price is a bit high especially for local student,3.0,,The place is rather small. We finish the site seeing and river quest in less than 2 hours. It is not as educational as the zoo yet the entrance fee is $32+$5. I wonder if WRS can reduce local price especially for students like us. Food and drinks are also expensive for us.
,,Very good,4.0,,"Took my parents down this January. We went early in the morning on a weekday. There was no crowd, which made it way more fun. Very calm, serene, scenic place. Especially loved the water coolers - very eco friendly and encouraging people to bring their own bottles, and not the plastic use and throw ones. Completely covered walk way, so even though it was raining, it didn't hinder our trip.If I had to mention the gripes I had though - 1. The boat ride : We didn't see any creature. Perhaps we were unlucky. But otherwise, if it was a quieter ride, perhaps we would have enjoyed it better.2. There was a tribal tour entrance, for which we needed to pay extra. We did not pay for that one thinking it was just a wall of tribal art or something. Unfortunately, that meant we ended up missing out on the tapir and other creatures. I feel like this should have been indicated somewhere.3. There was some work being done in the monkey enclosure. Again, perhaps we were there at the wrong time. But the animals were disturbed and seemed a little unsettled, and so were we.Other than that, I'd say it is a must visit."
,,Review of river safari,5.0,,"River Safari is a fresh & combined platform to discover some rare species of fishes and wildlife, brought from all around the world..special attraction are Giant Pandas and Red Pandas of course...also you can observe and experience different Rivers around our planet with their inhabitant details, River cruise, Amazon River quest boat ride, some live animal show, massive S.E.A aquariums and many more..

For the first time I came across anacondas, Electric Eel & Piranhas here ..

Moreover, there are some friendly staff, have seen care takers ( seems they are school kids) cleaning the tanks from outside as well inside..must learn from them the way taken care of the wildlife..
Highly recommend place in Singapore, less crowded than zoo and night Safari by less covering time."
,,"Some really great stuff, but not enough to hold interest for a long time",4.0,,"There were 3 highlights for us - the Pandas (including the roaming Red Panda), the Amazon boat ride and the interactive monkey exhibit. Apart from that there was a slightly interactive touching of starfish but generally not enough to hold our interest for a long period of time."
,,Great!,5.0,,Great. Well worth it. If you are a family of 4 I would look into taking a taxi there. The expensive stuffed toy I purchased had a hole in it so do a thorough check before buying.
,,Informative,5.0,,So we think this attraction is a bit of zoo and a bit of aquarium which brings the best of both together. It was so informative learning of all the aquatic life from countries around the world but the best was the panda's. They are just adorable
,,Unique wildlife experience.,5.0,,"A wonderful cross between aquarium and zoo. The tanks were amazing, especially the manitee and giant otter tanks. Amazon boat cruise was fun.. even in the rain though a little too short and sometimes passes the animal enclosure too quickly. Should be included in regular entry ticket. The wildlife show was great, as expected. Get there early for good seats and to meet some animals up close and personal. Definitely a must if in Singapore especially if you like aquariums or animals."
,,Great experience - highly recommend,5.0,,"We went to the River Safari on a weekday. It wasn't too busy and enabled us to have time to take our time in the animal encounters. The manatee aquarium is fabulous - giving different viewing spots to get a real impression of these great sea mammals. Take your time in with the squirrel and black howler monkeys in the Squirrel monkey encounter - the monkeys came up close to us, particularly when there were only a few other people around. Really memorable and great photos!
The Amazon River Ride quest does go by quickly - but you do get the chance to go back for another ride (without having to pay again). We went on it, then went and looked at the pandas and then came back and did the ride again. We saw different animals moving around each time - it also meant we saw the amazing pandas twice - another fabulous experience.
Well worth it!"
,,Bad signage direction to the Amazon River Quest,1.0,,Bought 2 tickets for the Amazon River Quest but ended up not taking the ride as the the signage direction to the river quest is not clear. My husband and I ended up taking the ‘free cruise’ around the reservoir thinking it’s the River Quest that we had paid for. I still have the unused e-ticket! There are also no staffs around to ask for direction. Felt disappointed and cheated.
,,River Safari,5.0,,"It was a fun experience and I really enjoyed all the boat rides too. The informative displays tell me more about the animals and I was thankful to have learnt more about them. The animals were difficult to spot on the boat rides so it would be good if the rides were slower and longer. The place was not too crowded, hence, we managed to enjoy the experience without feeling overcrowded. The crowd control was effective. The food items sold there were, however, overpriced. I understand that it may be a tourist attraction, but it would be deemed more affordable if the price range was wider."
,,A fascinating day out.,4.0,,If like us you are curious and concerned about the world’s eco systems this should be a very informative day. We found we needed the whole day as there was so much to see.
,,A must go,5.0,,The big attraction of this place is the PANDAs. Though a 15 - 20 boat to amazon river safari is also good. Something new to see. Just next to the Singapore zoo. Just try to finish before sunset.
,,Excellent Place to Catch Rare Creatures,5.0,,"Visited River Safari with our toddler and it was a great place to spot creatures that are not available in the Zoo. The enclosures allowed for some close up views and we even spotted a forest lizard in the cafe which was an interesting sight.

Giant Pandas and Red Pandas are the highlight of the River Safari for sure especially when the Red Pandas are out and about.

Queues at the cafe can get really long at peak hours - food is mostly szechuan style. Menu has expanded quite a bit since the first time it opened and the Panda baos are not to be missed."
,,Longer duration for Amazon ride,3.0,,"Finds the ride too short. Not many variety of wild animals. Best if can add more wild cats (e.g. lions, cheetahs, tigers) and other types of safari animals like elephants, hyenas, girrafes, rhinos, alligators etc."
,,Pleasant day at the River Safari,4.0,,"It was a rainy day, but fortunately most of the safari is sheltered. It is a pleasant surprise for us that the safari is not too crowded, probably due to the wet weather. The routes are well planned."
,,BOT VIEW,3.0,,"WE toured around the lake , likely to see anything except river ride could be better. there was nothing to view. We heard tourist commenting and chuckled, really disappointed."
,,A great addition to the zoo,5.0,,"A great addition to the zoo from when we were there 7 years ago, loved the Panada’s. and large aquarium. The river boat ride that took you passed all the animals was really cool, although not sure why an additional cost for this inside the park. It was so busy and there was a wait to got on the large river cruise on the lake of 60 minutes so we were unable to do this, otherwise the park would be closed before we could see any of it. It is a shame that tickets are sold over capacity as it reduces the experience for all. The lines to get in where just ridiculous they were as far as the eye could see."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Give a visit to the River Safari and you will not regret it at all, lot of animals to explore closely, have also animal show which was very wonderful and funny at the same time. Have also the River Safari which was unfortunately suspended due to the heavy rain that day.
But still we enjoyed all the other stuff.."
,,Wow.,4.0,,Running out of time . It was either this or night safari. Chose the river safari of course and glad i did. The whole area is covered so hot or rainy day u r safe except the monkey enclosure towards the rainforest area. Really wanted to see the pandas and i did. Jia jia was moving around alot so got to see that. The displays are set up in sections of famous rivers with interesting facts about the species in that particular river. Then comes the display with those species in it. Loved that idea. Theres food inside and it will cost u. Not much western food to choose from however starbucks is outside the entrance so u can wait until then. We went on the river quest. Cute ride on a boat through sections made out to be the amazon rainforest. Half a day here too.
,,River Safari,3.0,,"The River Cruise which is complimentary was rather short (no more than 10 mins). I was expecting a slightly longer ride and covering a longer distance.What is even more disappointing is the Amazon River Quest ride . . . the build up to the ride was good but from then on, it is literally down river. The ride (again) is rather short and quick and it would have been good if they can stop at the various points for people to take in the sights. This would have been a plus."
,,River Safari first experience,5.0,,"We already go to Singapore Zoo and Singapore Night Safari. But when we are going to visit River Safari, it several times close down or have a maintenance. So finally, we have a chance to visit it. We don't have any idea what is it. We only know that it has two boat rides. After we arrived we know that it has big boat and a small boat. The big boat is just like we are cruising in big river in africa. With a small boat, we are just take a look what is the animal lived in the river"
,,Small park with many unique animals!,4.0,,Great place to spend half a day with for kids to see Pandas for themselves. Sheltered walkway in most places so no worry about rain.
,,River Safari,5.0,,River Safari offers great adventure for the whole family especially the young kids! Definitely recommended!
,,Variety of aquatic animals,4.0,,Many aquatic animals and creatures can been seen in this place. There are 2 river Safaris. One is cruising in the man made lake and other is Amazon river. Must try both.
,,Great Day Out!,5.0,,"This was our first visit to the River Safari and it was totally enjoyable for both kids and adults. We thoroughly enjoyed all the exhibits and the layout is so well thought out. Also, our little wagon was misappropriated whilst we were having lunch, and when we reported it, the staff managed to locate and get our wagon back within 15 minutes! Best service ever. Keep up the great work, WRS!"
,,Ok if you have time to spend,3.0,,"We took a cab from the city, which dropped you off right at the gate. There is a small food court area, but it is just that...a food court. We grabbed lunch there, then did the Zoo and the River Safari. We were staying to do the Night Safari and didn't want to eat at the food court again, so we took a cab to a mall within 15 minutes as we had a few hours between our time at the River Safari and Night Safari. We do not have children so it was really easy for us to do all three within one day. We arrived to the Zoo around 11:30 a.m. We did the Zoo from 11:45-1:30 or so, then the River Safari from 2:00-4:00. Our tickets to the Night Safari weren't until 8 p.m., which is why we had some time to grab dinner elsewhere. Overall, we enjoyed our day. Our favorite was the Night Safari, then the Zoo, then the River Safari. The highlight of the River Safari were the pandas!! The actual river ride was kind of dumb, but okay if it is included in your ticket. We would absolutely go back to the zoo and Night Safari. We could take or leave the River Safari."
,,River Safari,5.0,,The experience was amazing. I didn't expect to see deep see monsters from all around the globe. Scary but very informative.
,,Great river safari minus the irritating commercial photographers,3.0,,"It was perfect the animals and the customer service. The boat ride and animal shows. My favourite is the flying squirrel, the giant manatees, pandas, and the otters. I just coulxnt stand the commercial photographers at each attraction. They were expensive and they took without animals with us and at the exit of attractions they had overpriced pictures of us visitors with animals photoshopped with us. Sigh..."
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Overall, it was good and we love the unlimited rides at Amazon river cruise.The only thing that needs to improve will be the food at the panda cafe as the noodle soups tasted below average."
,,Awesome attraction,5.0,,Many years since our last visit to Singapore and a therefore a must see especially as this is a new attraction since last being here and was highly recommended. Definitely did not disappoint.
,,Waste of time,2.0,,This is my third out of the four parks and all have disappointed me. Took longer to get there than to walk around. Amazon River experience not worth the extra cost. In fact many areas on it had no animals. Also no Panda in the enclosure.
,,Wild escapades,5.0,,River safari was both educational and interesting with some of the animals we never see before. It was a bit warm need to provide more cooling features. Panda was so nice and fun. Animal show should provide more seats since not allowing to stand during the show. Overall was wonderful experience.
,,Amazing Manatee experience,5.0,,We were fortunate enough to part of the Manatee Mania Experience. What a fantastic and informative insight into these wonderful animals. Highly recommeded.
,,Recommend,4.0,,"Compared to other zoo, river safari is especially good for small kids since they can easily see many fish and animals from their eyes.
Example, in Singapore Zoo sometimes parents need to hold them high to make our kids being able to see.

Red panda & panda area is one of the best choice, definitely your kids loves to be there!"
,,River Safari Singapore,5.0,,"Great, had lots of fun. Children learn lots of knowledge from those exhibits. Participate in the games"
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"I first visited the Night Safari more than 20 years ago. It was not a good experience as the animals were kept too far away under extremely dim lighting which did not allow us to spot many animals. My most recent visit was therefore a pleasant surprise. We started with the 40minute tram ride which gives a comprehensive tour of the main attractions of the safari (tigers, lions, elephants, hippos etc). We were a party of 4 adults and 4 young children, so this was a fantastic way to see the zoo. The audio guide was informative, the stops were long enough for us to spot the animals, and the enclosures were well planned and beautiful, allowing visitors a good view of the animals (the lighting was dim but sufficient, a good compromise for the comfort of the nocturnal animals and visitors). Sections of the tram route were open safari, where animals (herbivores of course!) were allowed to roam freely, and we came up close to some of these animals, which was a real treat for the kids. We also went for the Creatures of the Night show and it was extremely enjoyable. The hostess in particular was eloquent, amusing and engaging. All in all, a wonderful evening especially for the kids."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"Educational and well presented. Would definitely go again. Great for all ages, many animals to see, the pandas were fascinating and the aquariums are well done. We spent a good 4 hours just taking our time looking at the animals and reading some of the information. Worth the money."
,,Great Experience at River Safari,5.0,,It was school holidays. Brought the kids to visit River Safari. It was a good experience though the weather was hot. It was a pleasure experience.
,,Good day to spend the day,4.0,,"River safari has quite a few attractions. I liked the animals and fishes from various rivers of the world as well as South American animals,. It was my first time seeing some of the south american animals. There is also a panda enclosure and it was good to see those too. Restaurant onsite can be busy at times and queue can be long, Overall a good park to cover at your pace. You can spend 3 to 6 hours here depending on your interest level."
,,Ok Ok,4.0,,The best collection is Panda. Good place to visit with your family and spend a quality time. Well planned and tidy place.
,,Great way to see some South American animals - and plenty of others,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit here, plenty of fish we hadn't seen before with informative posters regarding their habitat etc., cruise on the reservoir was a relief from the heat though we only saw giraffe and rhino (including a cute baby) but what we really loved were the pandas and the Amazon river cruise where we saw giant anteaters and jaguar for the first time - plus you can repeat the ride if you want (which we did). Also loved the manatees, allow at least 3 hours to see everything leisurely."
,,Excellent day out!!,5.0,,We had another great day out at the River Safari last week. The animal enclosures are lovely and the whole wildlife park is really well laid out.
,,Worthwhile,5.0,,"Grea attraction!!! Insanely busy during early Jan but although very hot outside, lots of cool, air conditioned or fanned areas around this venue. Came to see my son’s favourite, the pandas."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,Great place which is well set up. Neat opportunity to see the Pandas which was a dream come true for my son. The boat trip was amazing :-)
,,Loved it!,5.0,,Weather helped but well designed sheltered walkways didn’t make it feel cramped even though there was a steady stream of people. Coupled this with lumina and twilight encounters was also a great idea!
,,spending my last day of 2018 with the bf.,5.0,,"great outing with my bf @ river safari, even though we got drenched during the amazon river quest. but we had not much food choices after were done, as most of the f&b outlets closes @ 7pm"
,,Well organised and clean,5.0,,No long queuing time It’s very pleasant visiting there. Highly recommended. It’s not too big and too small just good size.
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"The rivers of the world aisle was an amazing route, in order to observe the various species of the water world. it was refreshing for the eyes indeed.Moreover the Reservoir cruise was an amazing trip on the boat, providing the passengers to soak in the beauty of the greenery and the river that is engulfing the Singapore zoo area. Passengers also get a glimpse of the giraffes and the rhinos of the zoo from a distance. onthe other hand, the amazon quest is an amazing experience, letting the visitors view the different species of animals."
,,The PANDAs :-),5.0,,"The river safari is a must as you can see the""PANDAs""and many other animals like the Capybara, Beavers can feed them and touch them also.... I went on a week day so was less crowded... There is a 15 minute boat ride in the reservoir. The ride is nice..."
,,A must-go when you're in Singapore.,5.0,,"I loved the experience here! The only qualms I have are the hot weather and expensive refreshments. Other than that, it was a lovely day out. The pandas are indeed impressive, but so are the other exhibits."
,,Great place,5.0,,"Went there on second of January, what a start to the year. It's my first time year and it's great to see so many wildlife properly taken care of."
,,Quick visit to River Safari,4.0,,"Visited river safari with family, wonderful place to give kids over view of different animals breeding around some of the world large rivers. Also shows which animals are facing extinction and teaches importance of conservation. River ride and Amazon experience is really great.
Important thing to remember is the height of the kid must be more than 1 meter otherwise that might be denied entry to some rides.
The panda experience is also great."
,,Loved the organised staff,5.0,,The river safari was a great experience. We got to see the live pandas kai kai and jai jai. Also there are many other animals that are rare to be seen otherwise.
,,River safari- singapore,5.0,,"One of the four options available in singapore wildlife reserve. I selected this because it includes boat rides, one is free and for one, which is amazon river quest, you have to pay some dollars(check on their website for that).
River safari as the name suggests includes many kinds of creature which have a connection with water.
Panda- is one of their main attractions and you can also enjoy a show which is at entrance of river quest and in between many attractions are also there.

You can chill and relax near the water and just see the beautiful sky with sun hiding behind the clouds.
I choosed this among the four and i am happy about that.

*one more option will be added from 2020, construction for the same is underway and jurong bird park will also be shifted from its current place to the place nearby the singapore zoo"
,,Life in the river,4.0,,"River Safari was a nice and pleasant place to see so many nice and different fishes and animals who survive in water and made us realize how we are polluting the environment and promoted us to reuse, reduce and recycle. The seals were really cute and gigantic and the amazon river quest was also very nice. They were also so many squirrel monkeys, but the best part was watching the Pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia. They were so adorable and their fur was was looking so fluffy. They were pleasingly nibbling on the bamboo and smiling. The river safari also tells us about many rivers that's why I give it FOUR STARS."
,,A really interesting experience,5.0,,"The River Safari was a great experience- really interesting animals and river creatures that we had not had the opportunity to see previously. The layout of the Safari was good - broken into geographic areas. Unfortunately when we were there, the Amazon River Quest wasn’t running due to a technical fault. The River Safari staff were great in explaining the issue and we were able to exchange our prepaid River Quest tickets for goods in the souvenir store (we were offered a range of options to exchange the tickets)."
,,Family time in River Safari,4.0,,Overall good experience. Lots of variety of Fishes to see. River Cruise needs improvement with more time in River. Amazon River Quest is a must see...
,,Short & Sweet,5.0,,"Couple of imp pointers for river safari:
1. Go in the afternoon after 3 for two reasons- a.the weather is slightly better. b. after the river safari one can go for the night safari which starts around 7 in the evening. Both these activities are close to each other. the river safari is a 10min ride but it takes time to go & come back.
2. Keep your camera handy as one gets to see the animals for a fraction of seconds
3. Theres also an option of a second round if one wants to.
4. Carry water, hat, camera & some snacks
5. Booking on the Singapore river safari website is better as then one does not need to wait in queues."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"We went solely to see the pandas, I don't endorse zoos, but this was a different experience, the giant pandas were well taken care of and the River Safari has a liaison with the Wildlife Reserves of Singapore as well as Chinese conservation centre for breeding this endangered animal.
There were many other different species of unusual river creatures from different rivers, as well."
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,Very nice safari filled with marine creatures I have never seen. Was lucky to witness manatee feeding!
,,Loved it!,4.0,,"Highly recommended especially the Amazon river cruise! We went on a weekday during the school holidays n i was bracing myself for the crowds. Surprisingly it was not crowded and weather was cool, doable even on rainy days as its mostly covered!. We were expecting it to own earlier though, opens only at 10am. I would also suggest bringing your own food and going for the animal show. Kids get to pet and feed the animals!"
,,Review,4.0,,A boat ride of a chance to visit the nature side of Singapore away from the buzzing and noises of city life.
,,Visit to River Safari,5.0,,Had a great time at River Safari with my 2 children. For first time me and me and my daughter experience the boat ride which was amazing.
,,Price,3.0,,"Why the services provided are so expensive? Is a tourist place, why Singapore still need to pay for same prices be it in photo or foods."
,,Unusual animals in thematic surroundings,4.0,,"Many unusual river animals and cute animals in thematic surroundings. However, certain animals were only briefly viewable on the Amazon River Quest boat ride, which made it a bit difficult to admire them properly."
,,Wonderful experience,4.0,,"Wonderful experience as most of the park is clean, well shaded and facilitated with detailed signs and instructions. The kids loved the Amazon river quest the most, as the ride is fun, exciting and educative! Highly recommended!"
,,service was great,3.0,,"the river safari quest as i unable to enter due to my child not sufficient height, i was inform by the staff that i can actually obtain a refund on my ticket. If this wasnt noted, i would not know that its possible to obtain a refund. Staff was good and infact provide alternative"
,,Trip to the River Safari,5.0,,"Place is clean. There’s a few areas offering clean water (Hyflux) to replenish our bottles as we go. Attraction wise, it’s well coordinated. Kids were extremely happy."
,,Family-friendly,5.0,,"Pleasant experience as always, stroller and weather friendly. Would have been better if there were signs to show how far the walk / route can be from one attraction to the next."
,,Great Family Outing,4.0,,great place for kids to learn about river living creatures. do take the amazon cruise though is just 10mins ride. quite a cheap thrill for the kids. and do be careful with flying creature's droppings.
,,Great Experince in River Safari,4.0,,Quite a pleasant trip during River Safari. We had fun at Amazon Boat. Too bad raining in the afternoon so we cannot ride the amazon boat again. But River safari all the way have shelter so we didnt get rain. unlike Zoo. if raining we cannot walk around and continue the journey in zoo.
,,River Safari,1.0,,It was boring...there was no commentary on what we are viewing....for the price I paid it was definitely not worth it...my Son was very disappointed...
,,Nice setup and natural,5.0,,It is nicely done up in a natural setup and the animals look well taken care of. Definitely is kid family and insightful for young and adults.
,,Excellent Small Zoo,5.0,,Went with my friends. Great small river Safari but with many animals. Clean and cool. Enjoyed the Amazon boat ride. A place not to be miss if you are in Singapore.
,,Enjoyable morning outing,4.0,,"One of the 3 parks in Mandai. Underwater aquarium experience where you will see manatees, stingrays and other fishes swimming over your head. Other special air conditioned enclosure has red panda and a pair of young pandas. Get up close to spider monkeys and do catch the animal show at specific showtimes. It is very interactive. There is an optional river cruise at extra costs. There are many more interesting species. You can also buy a ticket to hop over to the zoo or wait till evening when the night safari is opened."
,,Had a great time!,5.0,,We had a wonderful experience! The animals are exotic and fun. There are many engaging activities in the River Safari. It's definitely worth the money and time.
,,Amazing amazon,5.0,,Guides were very helpful most enjoyable visit would consider doing another behind the scenes trip soon
,,Shy Panda,4.0,,"We were high expectations for the panda but kinda diappointed because it is shy not like what you saw on the internet pandas, at it was just 1 panda. the sea cows were eating at the time we were there so you will just see thier back."
,,The least compelling of Singapores four nature reserves,3.0,,"1. Fewer exhibits than other parks and way less interactive.
2. River cruise is quick ride along the banks of a lake with little scope to see any wildlife
3. Amazon ride went too quickly to really appreciate the wildlife
4. Opportunity to interact with Capybaras and Iguana was high light
5. If you buy a four park multiples and are struggling to visit all four...this should be the last one or the one that is left out. If not crowded the whole thing can be done in an hour."
,,Good concept,5.0,,"Good concept if you (and your children) want to learn about the river and its habitats
You definitely should go check out the Amazon River Quest
I think it’s the most interesting attractions here.
If you want to eat here, there’s a foodcourt between Singapore Zoo and River Safari entrance
Quite far from the Downtown"
,,A place definitely worth to go!,5.0,,"Having spent 5 fascinating hours walking around plus taking the Amazon River Quest, has been a truly worthwhile experience. This place provides a truly unique view on some of the world’s most fascinating freshwater ecosystems with plenty of great fish, manatees, and many other animals to be seen at very close proximity.

And all this in a way, which at least appears to be as sensible as possible to the animal’s needs. It's a great place for kids, but at the same time also provides plenty of complementing information for adult visitors. Overall, a great place for everyone to go.

I am not sure if I understand how the Pandas fit into this “freshwater ecosystem”- concept. But having seen the two big Pandas plus a very cute Red Panda -all of them behaving incredibly relaxed -has definitely been a very highlight of this trip to Singapore.

How to go there?
This place is in immediate proximity to the Singapore Zoo. Although pretty remote in the North-western part of the island, you can easily reach it via MRT (taking the North-South Line to Ang Mo Kio - NS16) followed by a ca. 35 minutes bus ride. The line #138 is starting at bay 1 of the bus interchange (just follow the signs) and is ending at Singapore Zoo. And with the Singapore Tourist Pass you don't have to worry about anything payment related."
,,"River environment, Pandas, Manatees!",5.0,,"It's a lot more than just a boat ride (although there are 2 options to do that, too). Very interesting focus on Rivers and the animals that live in or close to them. The stars of the River Safari are the Pandas and the Manatees."
,,River Lockdown at River Safari,5.0,,"This is my review for the Tales of Fearsome River Creatures event currently on-going at the River Safari till end December.

We participated in the River Lockdown game, which is similar to an escape room type game. You receive a game board and will need to complete 6 puzzles to earn the pin. You will have to sign up at the booth upfront and games start every half-hour.

As we've visited RS many times before, viewing the exhibits was not really our top priority so we spent our visit completing the game, which took a little over 2 hours. You can still play the game and view the animals but it can get quite frustrating as you will need to keep going back to the game masters. My family has just recently discovered escape room challenges, so we had a lot of fun completing the lockdown game together. The puzzles are challenging but not unsolvable, the game masters are helpful and it really added a new dimension to our park visit. It is very tiring though, so it is best attempted when rested and alert.

My kids also played the River Games and earned some cool stickers. We waited 15 minutes to catch the red-bellied piranha feeding but it was quite a let down. Apparently captive piranhas don't go into a feeding frenzy like in the movies (LOL) and instead take little nibbles from their meal."
,,2~3 hours of visiting time,4.0,,"Part of the Singapore Zoo experience, which focused on animals found along the river. Compared to the actual zoo or Night safari, River safari is much smaller in scale.

The highlight is definitely the pandas, which really depends on luck. My first visit, the pandas were sleeping all the while, the latest visit the pandas were out eating the bamboos.

Overall not a bad visit should you just want to spend 2~3 hours"
,,Not that what I expected,2.0,,The animals are not much . They focus only on the two panda. They should bring in more animals so that the kids can enjoying themselves.
,,Escape the River Safari Lockdown,5.0,,"River Safari collaboration with Lockdown Singapore produced a very interesting quiz that kept my family engaged. The quiz was challenging enough for adults and yet had elements that younger pre-school children can solve. Unexpectedly, days after the quiz, we can still remember the number of green anacondas in a breeding ball."
,,"Great visit, great to see pandas",5.0,,Enjoyed the river safari - walk across the bridge over reservoir. Manatees and pandas just the highlights
,,Loved the manatees!,5.0,,We could have spent hours with those gentle giants! Kids loved watching them feed off the rafts and the air-conditioned indoor viewing gallery was a welcome respite from the Singapore heat! Kids also loved the Amazon River Quest boat ride - it had just enough excitement (dips and splashes) for our boys...it was nice they allowed you to ride again and there were no lines when we got back from the first ride so we could step right back into position for the second ride! Highlight was definitely the maned wolf which was very actively striding back and forth...
,,Toning day nothing to see,2.0,,"We had bad luck since it rain so heavily that we can’t do anything besides walk around :( I know that they can not manage the weather, but at least I think that they will be able to give something in return when this happen, since the most excited part of the tour is the boat... my family was traveling from overseas to visit us and this was one of the places that they want to go... so not a nice experience :("
,,Great,4.0,,"River Safari sort of fills in what you won't see in SEA Aquarium l, as far as aquatic life is concerned. We also got to see the 2 pandas, so that's another you won't see in Singapore Zoo.We bought the add-on ride, Amazon Quest, but it was not as exciting as I thought it was. Animals in the Amazon Quest we're either hiding, sleeping or simply boring. We took the ride around late afternoon, there's probably a specific time when you might see them active."
,,Love the Manatees!,4.0,,"The giant manatees and pandas are not to be missed, but Jia Jia the panda was asleep in an enclosure during our visit. We could only see her through CCTV. The animals on the Amazon Quest cruise were hard to see. We only managed to see some. Others were probably hiding."
,,A lot of fun,4.0,,"I brought my six year old grandchild and we arrived before ten on Friday as she had a day off school.
Ticket purchase was quick and easy and we sat in Starbucks for ten minutes whilst waiting for the opening of the River Safari, Starbucks is right by the entrance and a good place to cool down.
We enjoyed most of the informative posters and then queued briefly to gently touch a starfish and small ray. In the last pool my grand daughter was enthusiastically stroking some other fish when the staff member advised us, ‘They’re sharks and they bite!’
The Panda enclosure was fun, they were enthusiastically chewing their breakfast of bamboo shoots and it was good to see them close up again.
Not many animals visible on the river ride but we ended up going twice and then chilled on the larger boat trip on the reservoir.
Overall it was really good fun, my grand daughter loved it and learned a fair bit also."
,,Great park but panda needs attention,4.0,,"Had a lovely time with my toddler and husband. Enjoyed seeing new marine animals and exhibits and facilities are well kept. But I do agree with another reviewer that one of the pandas shows stress by walking around around and around in the same path. They need more stimulation, I don’t know why they don’t put the two pandas together so they can have some social interaction. Overall we had a great time."
,,Set up to rip you off,1.0,,"The actual park is good but as you are cajoled to book and pay online to avoid the line ups and to get a discount you pay first then go. As it was the rainy season, guess what it rained! So the river boat cruise was suspended by the park. That’s fine but when we ask for our boat cruise costs to be credited the response is that you have to use the amount at the gift shop or their food outlets. Naturally they are over priced and may be you didn’t want a toy or food but we got something and when checking out would have been under the credit amount by $2. No cash refund so either forfeit the amount or buy something more expensive.In the end they gave us some money back but if you pay for something the merchant can’t provide then you should get a refund freely. This is a policy that is wrong and I wonder how many people are left with a sour taste as a result. Everything is credit card related now a days so very easy to refund. This is just tantamount to “we have your money and we’ll decide what to do with it”. God help you if they closed the park as then you’d need to ‘buy’ a very expensive load of souvenirs or toys to get your money back."
,,Perfect place for education and family time,5.0,,Perfect educational place and for family time. Easy access by public transport. Prebook ticket is very helpful and quicker.
,,Excellent zoo exhibit,5.0,,"The river safari was really good, very interesting and educational and the otters were so cute. As were the Pandas"
,,Nice Picnic place,4.0,,Good visit. Kids enjoy the trip. Nice picnic spot. Rare species of fishes can seen here. We enjoyed the day.
,,Manatee Mania - Amazing Experience,5.0,,We had an unforgettable encounter with these gentle and lovely mammals of the Amazon. The meaningful and engaging experience left us with a wonderful memory of a time well-spent!
,,Great day visit,4.0,,"On a recent family visit to Singapore, as part of a 4 Park ticket, we visited here. Located within the massive Singapore Zoo area (the Zoo is split into several different parks), a short MRT ride from the city to Khatib station. There is also shuttle bus service which will take you from the station to the Zoo entrance.

By its title, the Park is all about species of animals that live in/around water. They have some amazing species, including red pandas and two full size pandas. It os easy to walk around and there is plenty of cover for when the weather turns. It sits on side of lake and there is a boat tour you can take around this. A great place for a day trip, especially as part of the 4 park ticket. Well worth a visit."
,,Wonderful time,4.0,,"Have fun walking around, touching pool is something new and good experience for kids.The animal show is kind of nice too, but would recommend them not to scare the audience with fake snake though (parents will be kind of piss off)."
,,A must place to visited,5.0,,Very good place and a must place to be visited especially for family with young kids. A lot of attraction inside river safari. The amazon river was great!
,,Giant Pandas!,5.0,,"We thought the River Safari was great. It's a little smaller than the other zoo parks and really only needs 3 hours or so to get through, but the layout is very good. Virtually the whole park is sheltered/undercover which helps with the heat, and the signage on all the exhibits is detailed and informative. The Giant Pandas were active and seemed very happy. We were also impressed with how close we got to the squirrel monkeys in the monkey forest, it probably helped that we got there just in time for feeding!

Would recommend doing the Amazon Quest ride, it was only $5 extra and we saw animals that we hadn't seen elsewhere in the park (including a Jaguar!)."
,,A short visit to the River Safari,4.0,,"We brought our children (aged 8 and 6 years old) to the River Safari on a public holiday and it was an enjoyable and manageable visit, given that we only arrived at 11am, and was able to complete the attraction by 3pm. We even had time for a show and a ride on the Amazon River Quest.The animals all had clear descriptions and a few interesting facts about them, which had my children reading excitedly and wowing another with the facts they learned.Unfortunately not all exhibits had animals inside and some of the exhibits which my children were eagerly looking forward to were empty. The signs to each zone were clear and visible and there were adequate seating spaces spaced out throughout the River Safari. We appreciated the huge fans circulating the hot air which made the trip more manageable and enjoyable.We will definitely head back out again for more new shows or animals."
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,"For first time visitors,this is a great place to widen knowledge about nature and how to continue its conservation.Will go back and try the amazon river cruise!"
,,Amazing experience of nature and animals,5.0,,Going to River Safari is a beautiful experience getting to see nature and animals. Getting to see the pandas and manatees are a great treat. Reservoir cruise was great too looking at nature.
,,Pandas!!!,4.0,,"I enjoyed my visit to the River Safari, although I thought the ticket was maybe a little expensive for what you could see. Lots of fish. And pandas! Seeing the pandas was definitely the highlight of my trip to Singapore. Nice covered walkway all the way round, so you don't have to worry about the weather."
,,Lots of cover,4.0,,Bought this together with Night Zoo. The River Safari is well laid out with lots of shaded walkways so you could easily visit any time of day. The ticket includes reservoir boat trip and A river boat ride lasting 10 minutes was extra. All boat rides were cancelled because of the rain and storm (personally i would have enjoyed it in the rain.....the boat had a roof). We easily spent 3 hours there. The pandas were a bonus.
,,River Safari with the pandas :),5.0,,"We came to the River Safari after our trip to Singapore Zoo. Though the place is much smaller compare to the zoo but our family loves this place as much…it’s just what we need from the exhaustion from the heat and crowd after the zoo visit.
.
The panda forest is very good (not to mention that the controlled room temperature was just perfect on a very hot day). The pandas are lovely, they are very comfortable in their own space lazed around and eating the bamboo.
.
The kids love the Amazon River Quest Boat ride. The ride itself was nothing special, not many animals to see along the ride not sure if they were hiding or sleeping (all I saw was the flamingos). But the kids love the ride and asked for the ride twice (so we buy one more ride extra, our tickets include the first ride). When we went to the River Safari, there were not many people and as soon as we finished the first round, the kids went straight to buy tickets for the second round without having to wait long. I am surprised to see many negative comments about the Amazon River Quest though. Well it’s not great but it was not that bad either."
,,On a Rainy Day in Singapore,5.0,,"Most of Singapore (including the zoo) is just absolutely miserable during the rain... BUT the River Safari was pure delight as if the clouds had parted on our little group and sun rays of fun were beaming from our toddler.

The River Safari is almost 100% covered- in buildings or by a canvas canopy. The pandas (price included in River Safari ticket) and manatees were our favorites. This area of the zoo was done so well, I don’t think I have ever been to a nicer animal park.

-wear good walking shoes
-hard to find trash cans
-easy to use a stroller
-bathrooms are nicer than some New York restaurants
-Starbucks sits at the entrance to the Safari

This is a family treat you will not regret."
,,Wonderful holiday,5.0,,It is very beautiful and well organized and manage zoo . I and my family have enjoyed the park very much. I like to see pandas and all kind of fish..very attractive and friendly staff.
,,Definitely worth a visit for animal lovers,5.0,,"After purchasing the 4-park tourist tickets we felt compelled to visit River Safari and we were not disappointed. (Purchased the tickets through the WRS website which includes other extras at parks like rides). It is a smaller park compared to Singapore Zoo, but right next door, but has other animals you won't see otherwise, panda, red panda, giant otters, manatees and the fish from the rivers of the world.

We went on a weekday and it was not crowded at all which was a nice change.

You would spend 2-4hrs here, depending on the kids if you have them. Overall definitely worth a visit, especially if visiting the night safari after.

Tips:
1. The park is similar to the other zoos and offers water refill stations, so bring your own bottles.
2. There are not many places to go for lunch, basically one place in the middle of the park, Mama Panda, which was average for the price you pay. There is a Starbucks at the entrance, otherwise eat beforehand or take your own lunch.
3. The ride, Amazon River Quest, has height restriction of about 1m. If your child is less than this they won't be allowed on as we found out. So had to go on the ride separately while the other played babysitter. It is not a fast ride, so not sure why the restriction if a parent accompanies them.
4. The boat ride is relaxing but nothing much to write home about. You get to see some giraffes from the adjacent Singapore Zoo from the reservoir though which is the most exciting part.
5. Best way to get here, and to the other zoos, is to get the MRT to Khartib station, then take the zoo shuttle. Note that you should line up for the shuttle as it can get full quickly. Also ensure you have your MRT card, they don't take cash. I think you can buy a ticket for $1 from somewhere in the station though. Saw a couple of people get very annoyed when they were told they could not get on, but if you don't read the sign its your own fault."
,,Best for first timers!,5.0,,"It was a fantastic experience for us first timers. They say, Singapore zoo is best among these four wild life attrations. But based on our experience with our kids, we enjoyed much the river safari. However, they didn't allow my 5yr old son in the river safari quest because of height qualification..but upon trying it, it's not as dangerous as expected. It was a beautiful ride for a family with kids. I hope they can make an adjustment regarding their height qualification especially when both parents are there to supervise because even a 4 or 5 yr old kid will appreciate the river quest..."
,,if you miss it don't regret :),3.0,,"I took a park hopper ticket and am thankful I opt for it because none of the park now is worth visiting with the kind of money that is been charged. Good for the first time visitors but same story as night Safari park has not upgraded since long time feel 2 hrs wasted, new ride introduced called River Splash is disappointing to biggest extent. If you have visited earlier please utilize your children's vacation, time and your money better."
,,Fun and educational trip,5.0,,All spots are well-directed and explained through the signage. You may also use WeChat QR scanner to listen to the narration in mandarin. You can never missed a spot. River quest is SGD 5 and requires min height of 1.06m and the best thing is: it’s unlimited ride! You can briefly walk through the park in 2 hrs or a deep dive for 4 hrs. Beside the park are Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. Annual pass is a good deal if you are a zoo lover or your kids loves animals.
,,Not to miss,4.0,,We actually planning to go night safari. But as I read few things in attractions of Singapore. I decided to visit this place . This place is not about just boat ride . This all about seeing the nature . People who like nature never miss this
,,A visit with my teenage daughter,3.0,,"We bought tickets as a package with the zoo and night safari. It was interesting, but nothing to wow about. But at least, this visit satisfied my curiosity about the place."
,,Good place for raining day,4.0,,This is a place good for visit during raining day. All over the place was covered. If you lazy to walk they have boat to tour you around.
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"We had very limited time in Singapore and given the choice of all the Parks we opted to go for this one. The zoo is huge and would have taken most of our day. The night safari would have have been a great experience but we weren’t sure if our kids would have stayed awake to fully appreciate this attraction.

The River Safari was a very enjoyable experience and deceptively vast. If you don’t study the map, you would think it was was limited.

From the large River Otters to the Red Pandas this park covered a lot of marine and land animals. The aquariums were vast with large variety of fishes.

The Amazon Ride was good and suitable for my young children. We were able to go on this twice as it wasn’t so busy. It’s a shame they charge you for this, in my opinion this should be included in the ticket price. The other river cruise was free but nothing to write home about.

The live shows were also very well organised and far more interactive than I have seen in other parts of the world. They bring out all sorts of creatures such as snakes, lizards and parrots prior to the show for audience to take pictures with. My kids really enjoyed this interaction.

The world rivers which showcased the Amazon, Nile, Ganges as well as others was very interesting but in my opinion I think they could have more here, and perhaps added more feature. Most of the focus was on the Amazon but the other rivers did not feature as much. Overall very informative.

We managed to spend a good four to five hours here, leaving us enough time to make the most of our day."
,,Best of the 4 parks,5.0,,"We went to all 4 parks & for me this was the best one, hand fed a beaver & capybara's after the informative show, then did the boat rides. Park well laid out & easy to get round. CEAX bus was $12 return but didn't always drop back at hotel, taxi was around $18 each way."
,,River Safari,5.0,,It was fun and a learning experience. Love all the animals! My niece enjoyed the trip and would love to come back again! Well done!
,,learn about rivers and panda,3.0,,good place to go with child. it lists all the big rivers in the world. for the panda they are so lazy and sleep all the way when we are there.
,,Nice attraction,5.0,,I like it because if it rains its almost sheltered. Clean and alot of animals to see besides panda. Great place to go!
,,Bad customer service ( JUSTIN ),1.0,,Staff attitude very bad!!. Name Justin!!He totally spoiled our mood!!!I think this staff really look down to foreigners. Yes im just PR but my son is local. He talk very rude to my friend (who holding LTVP). Attitude very bad!!!
,,The welfare of the pandas was concerning,2.0,,"I love the written message and philosophy of Singapore Zoo and Wildlife Reserves Singapore. In writing and speech they really seem to value animal well being and conservation. This is admirable.

However, I did not feel they are living to their written philosophy with the panda exhibit. Jai Jai, the female panda, retreated to her concrete enclosure and laid on a metal table in preference to coming out and being exposed to the noise of all the visitors around her enclosure.

I have no doubt Jai Jai probably receives good quality food and the enclosure appears aesthetically pleasing, clean and of a reasonable size but the emotional stress she seems to have from the noise of visitors is not, in my opinion, in the interests of her well being and she seems very tormented by it.

There are signs at her enclosure for visitors to be quiet. However, this is ignored. I spent a number of hours on my visit to WRS River Safari in the panda exhibit and it was NEVER quiet. Many visitors did not respect this and it was rare that a keeper was there to enforce/remind visitors to be quiet. On the occasions when Jai Jai was locked out of her concrete den and forced to be in the tree enclosure so visitors could see her, she looked petrified and paced around and hid in the back corner or stood at the door of the concrete den waiting to be let in.

I found the panda exhibit DISTURBING and I came away encouraged to do something about animal well-being for the wrong reasons.

Please WRS, live to your ethics and do something about the quality of life Jai Jai is having. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for at least the noise to be blocked from her enclosure by the use of a glass wall."
,,always pleasnat,5.0,,"Another great visit. Their staff is always friendly and helpful.
This time I got the chance to see the pandas that I missed last year.
Also enjoyed the different species of fish and other animals we saw.
Bought cool souvenirs from their gift shop.
Definitely worth it, even for an hour or two, best time in the afternoon, so you can enjoy fantastic views and lovely breezes"
,,Very good family outing venue,4.0,,Nice and shady place for an outdoor family outing in the tropical Singapore. Loads of flora and fauna for the kids and adults to explore.
,,Great variety and well designed - Good for children,4.0,,"The river safari variety is of course different from the SEA @RWS as the theme is RIVER and not SEA. That said, it means the fish are not as colourful but still interesting, including the upside down fish. Yes there is the species of fish that swim 'upside down'. It is a kind of catfish. Not sure why the Pandas are included but the air-con provided a reprieve on a hot day. Most of the venues are under-shade though so one can still stroll through on a rainy day. Only 1 restaurant that offers not many options for food. Best to eat at the ticket area at the zoo and enter the River Safari again. To do so, remember to obtain a re-entry 'stamp'.
For now, there is a free show, at the boat plaza with free feedings of animals after the shows. (at the zoo, one has to pay (donate) a $5 for feeding). They have the cutest animals for the kids to touch/feed, including the capybaras (huge rodents), America beavers. For touch only, the cutest hedgehog and the bearded red dragon. On different days, they do bring out different animals.

Tips: Go on a weekday that is a non-school holiday and it will be less crowded.
Be seated to the front (go 10-15mins earlier) at the show so you can be the first to 'dash' to queue up for the feeding. Limited to number of carrot sticks or long beans.
Going earlier to get a good seat is not boring as they bring out the red-bearded dragon and parrot for the kids.

If going on the boat river quest (subjected to height and weather), one can run back to take the ride again before exiting. Kids love to go a few rounds.

On a crowded day, consider the walk from the otter/manatees sections first as most will go the standard route by following the River Safari map - River Wonders/Mississippi River.

The Manatees section is the other air-conditioned venue (besides the Panda. Note Pandas section is the coldest), and has seating area for adults to rest while the kids run crazy there. It is quite dim so do look out for the kids as lots of people hang out in this section.

Child-friendly toilets are available at River Safari and their toilets are cleaner than those at the zoo."
,,Good experience,4.0,,We had a good day out especially the Amazon Quest Ride and thereafter walking through and seeing those fishes in the big tank. We happened to witness the keepers swimming among the fishes and feeding them. It was amazing! We recommend.
,,Ridding on River Quest is so much fun!! We love it,4.0,,The thing that I like the most is “River Quest Boat Ride” That was pretty good idea to take a ride and see the animals along the river. My daughter love it when she got some photos with flamigo very very close.Luckily it wasn’t rain.
,,Interesting and different.,4.0,,"Don't get confused with the parks name. You are not cruising around on a river. No, most of this park is done on foot. The River part refers to the fact that the park is trying to give you an idea of what wildlife lives in the various great rivers of the world. There do this with large aquariums. You walk around in the open but under cover (ok for a rainy day). The rivers include the Amazon, the Ganges, the Nile, the Mekong and others. There are a variety of fish to see, unless of course you think a fish is a fish is a fish.
There is a part of the admission fee that entitles you to a 15 min 'cruise' on the reservoir. Also for a small extra fee you can do the Amazon river quest whereby you travel on a lazy river/log flume style ride. (The only drop is at the beginning to set you off). On this quest you may see a Jaguar, monkeys,Flamingos plus other animals.

As well as this there are the two Giant Pandas. A hit for everyone, however I think the enclosures looked too small. Indeed one of the pandas was pacing up and down in the way I have seen on TV programmes of distressed bears.
Overall an interesting concept and quite enjoyable"
,,"Small and fairly limited, nevertheless interesting. Pandas the highlight.",3.0,,"Arrived by taxi, $23 from down town- straight forward, easy and quick. Fairly busy at entrance, mainly with local school parties. Went into Amazon side first to try and escape noisy school parties. Pandas were the highlight, good viewing of them sleeping precariously in the trees. Eventually arrived at boat ride. Now this is why I only give the attraction 3, would be zero if i was just reviewing this, 15 minutes partial tour of the edge of the reservoir, saw some rhinos and giraffes at the start from about 200 mts, then absolutely nothing!
Amazon boat ride was a big disappointment, passed by what animals were out in about 10 seconds!
Monkey enclosure was ok, did see some up close.
Pleased we didn’t waste more time here than the two hours it took. Our two children enjoyed it to a certain extent, Pandas and Crocodiles. But Chester zoo is better and cheaper!
On the strength of this, reviews and friends experience, we will not be doing the night safari, the crowds and subsequent reported mayhem have put us off, together with today’s lack lustre experience."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,We had senior citizens with us and they find it smooth and elderly friendly. Will definitely come back.
,,Great experience,3.0,,We had an enjoyable time at the amazon quest boat ride. We got to experience a close contact with the friendly animals without any fear.
,,River Safari,3.0,,"the boat rides were interestinghowever the one that needs a fee. the water seems stagnant and smelly.although no mozzies, but the smell does come outalso, the big aquarium, is a waste to leave it like that. they should do a feeding show with the large mammalsthe lotte world aquarium is very good at their offering"
,,Common fishes. Limited species.,3.0,,Not many animals to see. No animal interaction. More like an aquarium with common fishes and with a few snakes.
,,Manatee Mania Tour,5.0,,It was a fruitful and educational trip for myself and my eldest son. He has always love manatee and this is the first time we get so up close with the manatee. He enjoyed so much during manatee feeding time. I believe this is the most memorable birthday surprise I gave him! Thumbs up for the tour and experience and the zoo staff!
,,Awesome,5.0,,Great for young kids and not too hot even if the sun is full on. Obviously visiting on a Friday was great to avoid crowds and queues. Highly recommended!
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,Lovely park with a wide variety of water creatures. The 🐼 is amazing lazy animal. I think it is a must visit park.
,,Singapore River Safari,4.0,,Great. My children really love it. They wanted to revisit it again in November. They enjoyed the show and boat ride. It was a really good family outing at the river safari.
,,"End of afternoon visit, cool and animals were active",4.0,,"We visited from 4 to 7 PM (and continued afterwords with the Night Safari) so enjoyed cool temperature and could see the animals quite active. The panda exhibit is fabulous. The boat ride is a must-do, since the animals from that area cannot be seen from the trail. Pity that the boat ride ticket is not directly included in the River Safari entry ticket. However, when you have it, you can do the boat several times by just queuing again."
,,Nice place for kids and elderly.,4.0,,"Comparing to the zoo, i think the river safari is less tiring and the size just right for a day trip with my 8 yrs old child. Most of the place are sheltered. If they can provide more water cooler and improve the boat ride, it'll be even better. Do bring along something for picnic if u are visiting. The things sold at the ksioks inside are expensive. Double the price of what u can find outside."
,,Good for half day trip,5.0,,"mostly sheltered area, good for all weather conditions. kids can be kept occupied with the exhibits and feeding time talks. touch pool was also interesting for the young children"
,,A Few Leisurely Hours of Edutainment,5.0,,"The River Safari is a fantastic venue of its own, situated right next to the Zoo.What was realy great was the simple to follow route that takes one through all the exhibits and enclosures, save for any optional cruises.Great display of animals and, near the end, the huge aquarium was a wonderful place to sit back and enjoy the animals. Wonderful excursion!"
,,Enjoy the River and close-ups with the fish!,4.0,,"We took our grandson to the River Safari and he loved it, he got to touch a starfish and he saw the giant pandas at feeding time. Also got Clive to the manatees.

However the safari was expensive and over-priced. Not cheap to get in and the you had to pay extra to go on the boat ride....so we didn't!"
,,Meaningful and fun,5.0,,"The tweens enjoyed the activities at various stops, thoroughly. Best of all: Feeding archer fish, beavers and cabybaras"
,,More to improve at River Safari,1.0,,"Nothing much at river safari, not interesting and the worst, nothing to capture our mind. Should import special species, create an animal free roaming place and we can have close contact with. And to create a park to go near all the wild animals too."
,,Pleasant visit,5.0,,It was an easy process to buy the tickets online instead of joining the queue to get tickets. Admission was fast too.
,,Mainly river based animals in various aquariums,3.0,,Two boat rides - one a bigger one and just a lazy ride - relaxes your feet. The other is the Amazon river quest - unfortunately due to a mix-up the park attendant did not allow us even though we had park hopper plus tickets which are entitled to this ride. Later the park authorities were kind to offer a complimentary ride some other day - but we could not make it. So don't know how the amazon river quest ride is like.
,,Superb Visit to the River Safari,5.0,,Visit to the River Safari will always be a fun one especially for the children. Even my 9 mth old son had his eyes glued to the movement of the fishes in the glass enclosure. Programme like 'Fight the Deadliest Monster' keeps the kids occupied and focused throughout the trip. We enjoyed the boat ride and the atmosphere at the Flooded Forest. It was a non-tiring trip even for the toddlers.
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,"Visiting the river safari was an enjoyable trip for the kids and parents. Loads of animals to see in a comfortable environment setting. However, due to the height limit for the river ride, my kids missed out on quite a number of animals. I wish there is a walking trail for those kids who doesnt meet the height limit. Overall a wonderful experience. The next trip is when the kids hit the height requirement."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"The River Safari is fantastic, would definitely recommend for families. It was awesome to see Pandas so close. We loved the river ride too. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely go back on our next trip to Singapore."
,,A fun trip to river safari,5.0,,I went on a boat ride and lt was very fun and exciting because there was a lot of drops and we also saw many animals！
,,Awesome,5.0,,Enjoyed it. Good it has sheltered walk ways during hot sunny days. Could have another restaurant in side.
,,Singapore River Safari,5.0,,Amazing to see sea creatures swimming. An eye-opener for those who love the wonders and beauty of sea creatures on Planet Earth.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,What great place to visit! Our family loved seeing the manatees and pandas. Worth paying the extra $5 for the ride our children loved it.
,,Well managed place,5.0,,Impressed by the wide variety of fishes and animals kept. I hv gained a lot of knowledge through this visit.
,,A very enjoyable wildlife experience,5.0,,"1. All the exhibits are well maintained2. Keepers are well informed and experts3. Variety of animals is also beyond imagination4. Panda, red panda, and boat ride experience is definitely worth a watch"
,,Good experience but some improvements,4.0,,"Better food needed , better toilets neededz better baby changing rooms needed. Attractions are great , facilities need some improvements"
,,A unique experience!,5.0,,The river safari at Singapore is indeed unique. The theme park has been well conceptualized to showcase aquatic wildlife of different rivers across the world. The highlight of the safari was the Amazon river quest which was a one of a kind experience with a simulated river cruise and spotting wildlife all along the way! The park is well maintained too.
,,"Amazing! Cruise, River Quest and many more!",5.0,,"We went to River Safari right after the zoo using my Company's premium corporate card which allows 4 incl. Staff. We went on a Wednesday where it wasn't crowded nor too noisy. The map is easy for you to understand, showing that we will go on one direvtion, covering all areas. There are different sections of rivers coming from all around the world, China, India, Europe. Its well organised and so much to discover in each section. There will be no trams, as the routes are quite clear cut and you just need to walk and learn/interact. At the starting point, there will be a touch pool where we can touch a starfish and a horseshoe crab (tho I thought horseshoe crabs are dangerous so I didn't touch that one) Continue discovering and you will see a bridge with beautiful view of our Reservoir before you go on a cruise ride. Take a picture anywhere and everywhere. There is just so much to view. The river cruise is free for corporate cards but the Amazon River Quest tix cost $5/adult and $3/child. The Cruise will take about 15 mins just moving around in the vast waters. There is nothing much you can see except taking photos of landscape and maybe you can spot an eagle up there. You can see the giraffes from the zoo side since the zoo is just next door. I highly recommend the Amazon River quest. It is a designated boat ride thru many open concept enclosures, and that is also where you can see the beautiful cheetah, of course through a glass. There are lots of things to see everywhere while in the boat, not forgetting some fun mini boat slides that the kids will enjoy in between. The animals were spectacular just being themselves. Retail outlets are only available at the start and end of the river safari. There are no foods inside. The pandas Jia Jia and Kai Kai are a blessing in disguise. They are so adorable and the cold huge environment set for them is perfect. We are able to view them in their own enclosure via a high bridge. The animals are well behaved and just beautiful to watch. There is a huge aquarium where you can see all the fishes, otters all in one big full height of a storey
All in all, what a wonderful experience with great rides and discoveries."
,,River Safari was awesome,5.0,,"We were all keen to visit the River Safari as it was new since our last visit to Singapore. The family all loved it esp as it was raining but it with undercover walkways it wasn't an issue. Loved the reservoir boat ride and the Amazon quest ride.
Best part was seeing the Pandas though one was super shy in their enclosure.
Was awesome value getting the Parkhopper Plus card and this was our favourite out of the 4 parks."
,,A great day with family,5.0,,"We had a teenager and a 6 yrs with us, and it was a great day. We would recommend the Amazon River Quest. It's a bit more cost for the ticket but it was worth it."
,,not so exciting,3.0,,"had a family trip earlier this month but didnt find it as exciting as was expected. the reservoir cruise was just a waste of time and the amazon river quest was suspended even though the weather was quite ok.. waste of ticket that was purchased online. only major attraction was the Pandas but then my question is why PANDAs have been put in the River Safari, i dont think PANDA is a river or sea species, rather i think its just for business purpose to attract more tourists towards River Safari."
,,Doesn't Live Up To Expectations,3.0,,"We recently visited the River Safari, after Singapore Zoo and I would of been extremely disappointed if I did the River Safari on its own. On the plus side the pandas and manatees are really the only exhibits worth seeing and I am glad I went purely because I got to see a panda. The Amazon River ride was also good fun and well worth the extra cost. Without doing this ride there is little other reason to go to the River Safari at all. Many of the animals were not to be found on the day of our visit and the reservoir boat ride is very ordinary. You need at least two and a half to three hours to see everything, not because there is a lot to see but because it can be quite crowded and it's difficult to get a good look at the exhibits. Unfortunately we only had 2 hours and as a result missed out on seeing the manatees."
,,Amazing...,4.0,,"A wonderful escape from the urban concrete jungle. Found it to be better than the next door zoo as everything is just more compact. It is a breeze to move about the place and view the different display and animals. There are plenty of informative signs about different animals everywhere.

The only let down has to be the humidity of the place (which is why it only gets 4 out of 5 for rating). Even with sheltered walkways, it is still quite a challenge to move about in the heat by mid afternoon. So do keep well hydrated.

If planning a day trip, it is best to visit the place early in the morning and treat yourself to a leisure ‘river’ cruise and chill at any of the indoor exhibits after lunch. Apart from the aquarium exhibits, most of the outdoor animals seems to be also less active and themselves hiding from the sun by mid day.

Do make a trip as it is truly an amazing experiences."
,,Great place to complement the zoo,4.0,,"River safari is in the same premises that houses Singapore zoo.

It is a much smaller area compared to the zoo. Houses Animals found in the river and nearby areas. The exhibits are divided into sections based on the rivers you could find them in. Walking around the sections was quite a breeze as most of it had head cover from sun and intermittent rain.

Amazon adventure boat ride was interactive and unique. My 7 year old daughter loved it. It is one of the must do things in the river safari.

Exhibit of giant panda was awesome. Seeing the cute creature in a large temperature controlled enclosure resembling their habitat was very good.

Overall, worth spending half a day."
,,Easy day out,5.0,,"Easy day out , mostly undercover, stayed 3 hours , see great animals , pandas are a favorite, both boat rides are fun , caught a grab cab in paid $18 from hotel, taxi back home $24 ,"
,,Watch live mermaids in one of the biggest aquariums for manatees,5.0,,"A new attraction, just beside the Singapore Zoo, for the family. Creatures from the great rivers of the world could be seen."
,,About wildlife in largest rivers of the world,4.0,,"Well organized, technically well executed. Unfortunately, the Amazon section was closed on the day of my visit. Interesting to see the park that is based around world rivers, not seas or oceans. Same location as Night Safari or Zoo, so easy to combine the visits."
,,A Must in Singapore,5.0,,I enjoyed this place especially the boat ride. It’s not too hot because it’s windy and sheltered. Though it gets humid but there’s drinking water every where. Just bring your own bottle.
,,Loved! Bunch of adults,5.0,,"5 adults, all really enjoyed river safari. Spent more time at river safari than we did at the zoo. Was calmer, less crowded, more displays and more animals we were interested in. Absolute highlights were manatees and pandas. Highly recommended, thoroughly enjoyed. And I’m not a zoo person!"
,,River Safari Adventures,5.0,,"It was a wonderful day. However, the weather can get really hot, so remember to always keep cool by wearing a cap or drinking lots of water."
,,The kids loved it!,5.0,,"Went on a weekday morning so we avoided the crazy weekend crowd. The trail is mostly sheltered, which makes it gd to visit rain or shine. I would recommend bringing along some insect repellent, water and snacks for the kids."
,,Really good visit,3.0,,"This was really good. You can see lots of different species of fish and some animals. There is a touch pool which is good. The pandas and manatees are the hilights. Especially watching the manatee feeding time. One of the pandas doesn’t come out much but you can see him on cctv. It’s good that the otters can swim over you. The river cruise as nice as it is, you don’t really see anything although we saw a giraffe through the hedge from the zoo next door. I would recommend taking the amazon river ride as it’s the only way you get to see animals such as tapir, jaguar etc. However this ride goes fast and it’s difficult to see these animals. It would be nice if you could walk around and see these at your own pace. Overall a well maintained park. Also the gift shop is outside the park."
,,Fantastic place to visit!,5.0,,"We’ve been to Singas a few times and done the zoo and night safari but had never been to the River Safari! What an unexpected treat! It wasn’t busy at all, easy to walk around, plenty of shaded areas and a great set out with all the different river locations!
The reservoir cruise is free and lovely to enjoy a peaceful cruise and you can see a few animals from he back of the main zoo.
The Amazon River Quest ride is $5 and well worth it, they even let you do it twice - it was fantastic!!!
We loved seeing tha manatees and OMG seeing a panda was simply one of the highlights of my life!
A must do experience in Singapore!!!"
,,Enjoyable few hours,4.0,,"fun morning out, amazon boat ride was good, but we were lucky to see lots of animals. can imagine it might be a bit boring if the animals are feeling shy and hiding in their enclosures. Scenic boat trip was OK - nice to take a few minutes to sit down form a hot day. Good mix of animals, enjoyed the pandas. Glad we took our boat rides early one - it rained later & everything was shut down."
,,A good place to start as compared to the zoo for my 1 year old,4.0,,"It was our first visit with my 1 yr-old. Checked out the website and as advised, took about 4 hours. The zoo will take 6 hours, hence the choice to try out the safari first. Thankful for the sheltered walkway which I didn't have to worry about it being too hot. Enjoyed the entire visit. Do note that you will still get wet if there is a downpour. On the overall, I throughly enjoyed the visit and the crowd was not too bad for a Sunday, but it was not the holiday season. Be prepared to spend more than half a day in there and also that the restaurant will be packed at lunch as it is the only restaurant in there."
,,Exciting cruise,5.0,,"Although the cruise is only 10 minutes, 2 grand children enjoyed the raising boat and bumping with splashing water at beginning of the cruise!!! Watching & listening to the explanation along the way of different types of animal. It was knowledgeable & distanced contact with the birds & lovely animals."
,,River safari/Lumina Zoo,2.0,,Went to the river safari on the 29th September. Was very disappointed with the exhibitions. There were not enough variety of animals/fishes. Paid for the Amazon quest ride. Ride was too fast. And was not able to enjoy the views properly. LuminaThere were too many people per time slot. Was not able to take a decent photo. Below expectation. Very disappointed.
,,Very Boring highly not recommended,1.0,,"This is soo boring to say the least. you can barely see animals around you, actually the number of animals I have seen can be counted on one hand, it is not really a safari but just a boat ride around the river, and the admission was not cheap, I would not recommend it to anyone."
,,the rivers edge,5.0,,the place is great. clean . friendly. the journey you experience throughout is eye catching and informative to say the least!
,,Amazing trip for the preschoolers,5.0,,We went to the Mermicorno and Manatees event and the children loved the panda and mermaid show. It was thoroughly enjoyable.
,,Time your visit right to see the pandas,5.0,,We were lucky to see the 2 pandas out of their dens in a single visit because we came during their feeding time which was about 4.30pm on a Sunday. The approximate visit time of 3 hours from WRS site is a good gauge if you are quick and not the type who will linger on an exhibit for 30 minutes.
,,River Safari visit,5.0,,"Many thanks .Your staffs were very friendly n helpful. The whole experience was good.Unfortunately, we didnt see the red pandas when we were there at 10 plus in the morning. The mermaid show was excellent. By the way, i notice a crack on your aquarium panel. Unsure how to report, so we left.We are looking forward to re visit .Keep up tgr gd work.Have a good day. Jas"
,,Excellent exposure.,5.0,,We are surprised there were volunteers at each enclosure which enhanced our visit as my child learns more than just wowing at the exhibits or reading from the information board. We have enjoyed tremendously and please keep it up!
,,Mermaids & Manatee,4.0,,Reiver Cruise was most enjoyable because there were many different animals and they were all visible. The short drop was also exciting.
,,Review of River Safari,5.0,,"Visit was on a very hot day and was pleasantly surprised that most of the sights had covered paths ways. A Lot of signage along the way was very interesting read for my daughter. The safari ride could have included more animals. Very clean premises. Overall a very good new experience, will definitely recommend for future visits."
,,Awesome! Friendly Zoo for Infants,5.0,,"The downside.. limited animals available. only 1 animal show. The pros.. it is almost fully shaded, and nice pavements. it is easy to walk with a baby in a stroller."
,,Another wonderful experience.,4.0,,My wife and I brought our toddler daughter there and it was another wonderful experience at the River Safari.
,,Wish it was better!,2.0,,"Firstly, the gharial was missing! Secondly, the reservoir ride is quite boring as the chances of actual animal/bird sighting is very low. Thirdly, the entire amazon forest section was closed and no information about this was provided prior to the visit. The last time I visited the park a few years ago, I absolutely loved it while this time I was let down."
,,My daughter enjoyed it very much :),4.0,,"It will be good if the mermaid show have more timings - as we went pretty late during the day. Other than that, my daughter enjoyed it very much. It was very clean. It was raining that day, and we didn’t have to pull out our umbrella at all, as the walkway was fully covered."
,,Family gathering,5.0,,A weekly or monthly family event for us. It was sure a relaxing walk on that cooling day. One of the staff introducing the species of breed in their park area by area while we found it very informative rather than watching them in the tank. Enjoy the interaction activities with animal feeding during one of the show. Suggest that maybe a chart be place in front of the animal if it is not so friendly so that all tourist and local will not pet them after reading.
,,Go for the pandas!!,4.0,,"Kai Kai and Jia Jia are the cutest giant pandas and are a treat to watch! I wouldn't say it is a 'river' Safari and the basic fee doesn't cover much. The whole area is covered and quite cool and is a respite from the humidity. Overall, a good 2-3 hrs of fun with pandas being the stars of the show."
,,Tokidoki River Safari,4.0,,Good experience!!! My boy did enjoyed !! With Tokidoki Figures for phototaking !! Love it! Will visit again ...
,,Disappointed,2.0,,Only point of interest is amazon quest.the other boat ride felt like a very normal boat ride.one has to be real lucky to spot any animals .Wouldn't recommend it unless going for amazon quest for which we need to take extra ticket
,,Nice to get out from downtown,3.0,,River Safari is a Great Place to visit ! Unfortunately the Amazona tour was quite disappointing because we can t see so much animals as advertised.
,,Awesome Family Trip @ River Safari,5.0,,"I had a wonderful time at river safari with my family on 9 September. Although it was raining heavily on that day, it did not dampen our mood to explore the area. The whole enclosure is pretty well sheltered and sufficient seats for people to take a break while exploring. The main attraction is definitely the Pandas, Kai Kai & Jia Jia. They are totally adorable but you have to take note that JIa Jia is the shy female panda and you will be fortunate if she comes out from her cave and hang out in front of you. haha. We will be visiting again for sure!"
,,Once Upon A River - must go!,4.0,,"We went River Safari in 3 families with young children ages 1 to 5. We managed to complete our visit in 2 hours. Although it rained, the exhibits were all sheltered so we had an enjoyable time walking. The show - Once Upon the River - was really interactive and brought the animals up-close. The children had the opportunity to feed and touch the capybaras, beaver, iguana and the pelican which was a unique and wonderful experience for them!"
,,Clearly Overpriced,3.0,,"We visited although we knew that the faster ride was not operational at that time (it costs extra anyway). The route itself is a nice walk with viewing some animals. We did know the fast ride was closed, but we didn't know that half of the larger animals can only be seen from that ride! There is no way to walk and see those animals. So for the full price all you get to see is half the selection of the animals plus the Pandas and Manatees. Zoo and Night Safari are better, the orice for this should be lower than it is today."
,,The zoo's less worthy partner,4.0,,"We came here because we had the all inclusive ticket for all four of the Singapore zoos. If I had paid for this independently I would have been a bit disappointed. It is a long way from town and taxis are $50 each way. So it definitely doesn't justify a whole day trip, but if you are at the zoo or night safari anyway it is worth a quick look.
The park is small and the Amazon Quest is a bit of a cheat. Without the joint ticket you have to pay for it additionally. My best advice is don't. It has a long queue, and moves too quickly to actually see any animals. Some main attractions are here such as the jaguar, but there isn't enough time to stay and spot it as the boat is whisking you away before you know it.
The panda is the star attraction and the free roaming monkey enclosures save the day and this review."
,,Nice Attraction if your into animals,4.0,,"Visited the river safari right before closing mainly because we were in the area to visit the night safari. The river safari was a nice decent size exhibit with two main feature rides, the amazon and the ferry. Definitely do the amazon ride as you are more likely to see animals than the ferry or do both. After the rides took some time walking through the park looking at the well planned and very informative aquatic exhibits. Saw plenty of sea life in a relaxed environment.

There’s also a Starbucks near the exit so you can grab a snack before continuing on with your day.
I will definitely visit again whenever I’m in Singapore"
,,River Safari visit Sep 18,4.0,,Well organised attraction.There seems to be enough space for more exhibits. Too many blank spaces in between.Large aquariums are very impressive.Perhaps on the reservoir boat ride a few more sightings of the zoo animals. Seemed very popular.
,,Kids loved it!,4.0,,"Took our family of 5 (three young children) as part of a birthday celebration. Great visit! Only disappointment was the River Cruise. Absolutely nothing to see on our. Enjoyed the rest, especially how up and close the red panda was!"
,,Boring,2.0,,Nothing much to see.. quite a dead place but very clean and well maintained. Only managed to see one sleeping panda. Not much attractions
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"Came during special event: Mermicorno meets Manatees.Fascinated by the ""mermaids"" graceful swim surroundee by sea cows & the animals are so friendly. Kids were excited by their presence, not forgetting kaikai & jiajia (pandas) & other animals & sea creatures. We managed to see kaikai only as jiajia was sleeping in her cave. Would have given 5 stars, if not for the long waiting time for river cruise."
,,SEPT SCHOOL HOLIDAYS,3.0,,the animal show is only two session per day.But the sit does not cathering enough siting .Not even 20% of the visiter .
,,River animals,5.0,,You could skip the reservoir cruise to save time here but the rest of the walk through areas with the animals makes this park worth a visit. You can get up close to monkeys and other wildlife (no bars). Took some great shots on my phone with a bit of patience. This place is worth a look on a double pass with the zoo.
,,A little disappointed,3.0,,"After loving Singapore Zoo, I was a little disappointed with this park extension.
The park focuses on the rivers of the world, housing some good fresh water fish tanks and the squirrel monkey walkthrough is good. There is also a massive manatee enclosure which is great at feeding time and to see them up close.

Unfortunately the ""river safari"" part was under refurbishment, which they failed to inform me when getting my tickets and the pandas were also not in thier enclosure due to keepers cleaning (which obviously needs to be done, but maybe not at peak times).

I would visit as an extension of the main zoo rather than a solo visit."
,,Great place to see animals,5.0,,The main exhibition is the panda and red panda. do ask what's the feeding timing for the animals to be able to see them in actions. otherwise most of them would be sleeping.
,,Visited mainly for the Pandas,4.0,,"Visited in April 2018 (sorry for late review). Had bought a combo ticket along with Singapore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park.

Visited this park after the zoo but before the bird park and whilst it wasn’t as varied as the zoo it was nice to see different “zones” related to worldwide rivers as well as the pandas!

We visited late afternoon so the panda exhibit was fairly quiet which meant we had a bit of time observing them (first time we had seen pandas)

Also enjoyed the river ride (although not overly exciting)

Exhibits were of a good size for the animals with lots of information about that particular river habitat and the animals

Would recommend but not an absolute must thing to do."
,,A very good attraction,4.0,,"I think the Amazon River Quest ride needs a bit of improvement - we experienced it just before it was supposed to be closed for the annual maintenance. If you plan to ""Meet the Beavers"" book the event in advance by going there (at the ticket counter) in the morning even if the event actually takes place in the afternoon. All the River Safari exhibit is interesting, with the Panda bears being the main attraction, of course."
,,Perfect for kids,5.0,,"This place is perfect for little kids and maybe even tweens. We had 7,10 and 12 year old and they all enjoyed the boat ride the most- not the free one. However you can go a few times on the ride so the fee is worth it. They also enjoyed the monkey thing. Can’t remember the name now but they were small monkeys and free to roam about. Place is not too big so you can pace yourself nicely and enjoy the whole park. It’s clean. And they also food in so it’s nice that place is still very clean despite them allowing u to bring food in. It is also wheel chair friendly! So grandma could enjoy the park too."
,,Missing fishes,2.0,,"We have been ro the River Safari half a dozen times (approx twice yearly), & unfortunately during our more recent visits, a noticeable amount of displays had missing exhibits as advertised on the side panels. Please either ensure displays are properly mustered or that panels are updated. Thank you"
,,great rainy day out,5.0,,Rain makes it cooler and keeps the crowd away. The park is impressively designed with top facilities. And it’s all covered so we get to enjoy it even in the rain. We didn’t go on the boat rides but it was was still so fun with my kid.
,,Adventure of 7 great rivers with our grandchildren,4.0,,"It was raining bucket and bowl, but we went ahead as not to disappoint the kids. Luckily all the rivers cruise indoor except for the 2 boat rides. The kids had a wonderful and fruitful time there"
,,A place to learn interesting facts,4.0,,"My kids had fun visiting the place. The set up and the flow of the place is comfortable, and the learning is good for both adult and children."
,,I was lucky to ride the Amazon River Quest & Reservoir Cruise during raining season,5.0,,"It was a rainy day when I visited the park. We were able to ride the amazon river quest and reservoir cruise when the rain stopped. It is better to buy the ticket separately for the amazon river quest when you are inside the park, because bad weather will suspend the amazon river quest whole day. And, the ticket is available for sell just at the entrance of the amazon river quest and so far no queue no. was given during my ride. But one ticket is only valid for one time ride, not for multiple times. Meanwhile the reservoir cruise is inclusive of the admission ticket, but bad weather will suspend the cruise as well. About the panda exhibit, I only managed to see Kai Kai only, Jia Jia was not well and hidden inside her own cage. So far, it was great first time experience in river safari."
,,Fantastic outing,5.0,,"Had a fantastic outing at River Safari last weekend, when the sky cleared as its been raining everyday. It was cooling and great fun to be outdoors.
We saw a great number of large and exotic fishes and reptiles and not to be missed, those beautiful mermaids.
Took a slow boat ride to our next event, to win a limited edition Tokidori pin when we completed the Mermicorno and River Safari Trail.
Had a quick lunch at Mama Panda Kitchen, the food was delicious, like the chocolate filled Panda Pau.
It was a great and wonderful outing."
,,Amazingly amazing Amazon’s river quest safari,4.0,,We did both the river safari one was amazing river safari and Another one was river cruise reservoir.. but to be very frank we liked Amazon’s river safari much better as it had some adventure thrill and excitement and we did spotted few animals and really enjoyed but river reservoir was kind of dull and gives u a tour of the river where u can’t spot anything and just a waste of time.. so plan it accordingly.. before u start your river safaris u go through the entire fish aquarium and gets to know about different species of fish and it’s habitat.. also in the end u have a touch zone where u can touch and feel star fish as well as other sea creatures.. which I thought very informative for kids and adults too..
,,Not what expected,2.0,,"To be very clear, this review relates only to the River Cruise and Amazon River Safari. The Zoo itself is quite good if you like zoos and accept there is value in the educational role these places represent. As for the River Cruise and Safari ride these to me are not much more than tepid theme park tours.
The Amazon River Safari left you wondering what did you pay. If it is seeing animals that was certainly not what we got. Firstly the ‘boats’ tend to travel too fast to see anything much assuming there is much to see anyway. Personally not worth spending the extra.
The river cruise is no different. Basically you do a 10 minute circuit around what is basically the city’s water supply reservoir which the zoo abuts. Seriously, save your money and give this a miss. Perhaps if you have 4-6 year olds they may get a kick out of it, otherwise forget it. I seriously don’t get girls dressed up in mermaid costumes swimming with manatees in their enclosure. What the....? As a zoo there are some things they do really well but these two attractions are just tacky."
,,Beautifully presented,5.0,,"The place is well-maintained. I love the river cross-sections showing life both in and by the rivers. The river ride is a must, where you'll see more animals up close. This ride is designed like those in amusement parks, where you get some dips and slashes (all pretty mild, no worries)."
,,Educational yet fun,5.0,,"It’s truly a great place to visit during the day. Great for family with kids. Watch out for the pregnant Panda, Jia Jia."
,,Fun,4.0,,"In overall is good, the service is fast and less que time for the boat. Put more variety and animal shows. Some educational talks with visitors on wildlife conservation"
,,River Safari Adventure with seniors in the family,5.0,,"We had a great time and it was easy to travel with the zoo shuttle bus that only cost $1 from Khatib mrt station. The highlights were watching KaiKai feasting, Dugong and family (although aquarium feels kind of small for so many huge size mammal) and the river safari animal show where we got to meet and pet them."
,,Blown Away!,5.0,,Love how they present the various rivers around the world and their creatures. Manatee is sooo adorable! Amazon river cruise is amazing. Whereas the other ride is just meh.
,,Covers Creatures from Major Rivers across all Continents,5.0,,Good to spend a day's time. There are creatures and fishes from all the major river across all continents. There are fresh water fishes from amazon which are twice the size of humans! have fun
,,A good half day park,5.0,,"We arrived at midday and easily got through everything by 6pm. Feeding trails were good. Good variety of animals but not what we expected. Amazon cruise, Pandas and Giant Otters were our favorites. Worth a visit. New once upon a river show was really good. We also visited the Night Safari the same day which was probably a bit much for our 5 year old daughter."
,,Covered a variety of ecosystems in one single park,5.0,,"Interesting river-themed zoo and aquarium combo. Park also offers a free boat cruise that runs till about 6pm. Caught sight of giant panda and red panda, looking superbly cute."
,,Everyone Should Go!!,4.0,,Very educational and I really enjoyed the chill environment :) Love the animals and the cool breeze! I hope River Safari will continue to take good care of the animals and play an active role in enabling humans to better understand animals.
,,A wholesome experience!,5.0,,"An attraction that is very well-planned, maintained cleanly and has a wide range of land/sea animals. The Amazon River Quest boat ride was one not to be missed!"
,,you should come,5.0,,I think river safari is one of the great zoo in Singapore that you should come. I have a chance to come only one and still wanna try night safari also
,,Wonderful reserve park,5.0,,"I love the entire park and how it was structured and the awareness each section provided for the visitors, including the cruise ride. Amazing time spent, it took roughly half a day and I enjoyed it thoroughly, including spending an awesome time at the panda-theme café."
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Loving the place! Its an experience to have the chance to see the different kinds of animal.. there are food stations availble if you are feeling hungry, but i wish the hotdogs are halal though.. anywayssss, overall im loving it!"
,,"Pandas, otters and fish. Cuteness plus",5.0,,"The River Safari gets more fascinating and childishly exciting the further in you go. It starts with just fish in tanks and interesting facts but later there are pandas, walk through underwater tunnels, the River ride and the boat on the lake so if your kids complain let them know things get more exciting (as opposed to educational) soon. The boat and River ride close at 6 so make sure you allow time for both."
,,Firsr time to river safari,5.0,,"Awesome.. with the long queues at the rides, i think they shld just build benches there.There were some on the cruise ride but just the first row of q.. might as well :)"
,,Very well thought!,4.0,,Visited on a pouring day! We waited at the food cafes for hour hoping the rain to stop. After which only found out that it’s sheltered the entire route! So yea very well thought! Mainly to visit the panda but too bad he wasn’t in the mood and we only got to see his butt throughout overall has been a good experience!
,,Good for kids!,4.0,,"Love the manatees! The red panda was in its house and we could only see its tail too bad! We saw the bigger panda eating but the shy one was in its cave, too bad also! The reservoir cruise was so lame! We only saw the giraffe, none of the other animals that the voice over talked about. it was not really an exciting experience. if you only want a boat ride along the reservoir, then do it, but if you don't want to waste your time, dont go, its not worth it!!! But the amazon river quest was quite okay, just a few animals too! But you could get wet when the ride goes up and down the river. mind the height requirement if you have kids with you. its good my daughter was 3 cm above the minimum height and could join us in the ride. and of course a photo op at the end :-) But all in all, I liked this attraction because of some of the animals that we could not see in other attractions. but its like ocean adventure in Philippines, except that there are no shows here in the safari. I would still recommend it if you have kids who love water animals :-)"
,,Best time in safari,5.0,,"We took half day to spend in River Safari - if you plan to spend the whole day, suggest you do two visits: River Safari and other zoo (Bird Park, Singapore Zoo, or Night Safari - they are all in the vicinity)

Food court was surprisingly good!

Star attraction is Kai-kai the panda, and the animal show. Love the animal show, so watch out for it and sit early because it tends to be crowded."
,,Not just fish!,4.0,,"River Safari does not offer the lush greenery the Zoo offers. It is sheltered much of the way but not for the boat ride. Also unlike the Zoo, there is no drinking fountains. So good to bring a water bottle.

Information of the wild life at major rivers of the world is great. Fishes and animals are interesting. The two pandas are a great addition. They are isolated from each other and thus feel lonely. I personally like the red pandas better.

There is a Starbucks near the entrance and a self service restaurant after the panda exhibit.

If there is limited time, then the zoo is better. Having said that, my daughter keeps wanting to go back to River Safari."
,,A wholesome experience!,5.0,,"An attraction that is very well-planned, maintained cleanly and has a wide range of land/sea animals. The Amazon River Quest boat ride was one not to be missed!"

,,Excellent,5.0,,"When we first went in it was a little disappointing as one lot of the penguins were in a confined space & were unable to go in the water as there was work being done. There was no polar bears either.As we continued the experience was amazing with so much to see & watch - penguins, fish, animals & the best attraction of all was the Pandas - we could have stayed all day just watching them.The actual river cruise was just a ride up & down the river - not one animal to be seen so I am not quite sure why this is called the river safari ! The river quest was ok nothing special - we went on it twice but see very few animals.Overall we would go again to just see the Pandas"
,,Boat rides can be improved,4.0,,"The visit was good. But I felt that the Amazon Quest should be included in the admission fee (not pay extra) and there should be more animals along the Amazon Quest ride.The reservoir cruise which was included in the admission fee has nothing to see, just a joy ride."
,,"Too much to see, so little time to see it",4.0,,"My fault for not realising that there was just so much to see at the River Safari. I really just thought it was a few animals and a cruise on a boat and that you could do this in about 30 mins. I was at Singapore Zoo for most of the day and only got here about 5pm and of course some of the exhibits, Pandas, start closing early. Leave yourself plenty of time and do the Amazon River Quest a very interesting 'river ride'"
,,"It is weird the main attraction in the ""RIVER"" safari is the Panda.",2.0,,"The park is really normal, the fishes were not very special. The reason we visited River Safari is because of the Panda. It was quite disappointing. If you would like to see sea creatures it might be better to visit the Sea Aquarium, at least it is in air-con."
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"There is nothing to dislike about the River Safari and everything to love. The exhibits are well-displayed and informative, there were enough interactive elements and most importantly, it’s almost completely sheltered from start to finish which is a plus in Singapore’s heat and humidity."
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,A great attraction for all ages. Amazon river safari was highly recommended. Panda exhibit could have been opened a little longer as the park closing time is 7pm.
,,Fun Day,5.0,,"I have my pleasure of staying there 2 hours include eat. I see panda and mammals, snakes. I enjoyed."
,,Must visit place !!!,5.0,,This is a must to visit place along with Singapore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park to complete the adventure!!!
,,River Safari,4.0,,Very little animals & the free boat ride was not very interesting. Only the quest ride wasn’t too bad.
,,Excellent.,5.0,,"Allow 2-3 hours, there is a bit of walking, with a boat cruise of the reservoir at the end. Dress lightly, as it can be hot. I would do this before the zoo. Buy a 2park pass at the gate, the line up was only 5 minutes, at peak time. Expect to see amazing aquarium type exhibits, panda bears, monkeys, bird life and some remarkable fish, some of which are huge."
,,Small but interesting place,5.0,,"Beautiful and nice place. Children like it very much, especially the Amazon river quest. Mama Panda Restaurant is also great."
,,Learn about the world's great river animals and Giant Pandas,4.0,,"The River Safari is not on board a boat, although an optional river cruise can be purchased. The walk through displays are about the great world rivers and the amazing life that is fount in them, much of which is on display. Also on display are a pair of beautiful well kept giant pandas which can be viewed most of the time. Well worth the effort."
,,Excellent exhibit displaying a myriad of different animals,5.0,,"Excellent exhibit focusing on animals and fish found in river systems around the world. The “safari” is a continuous boardwalk (suitable for wheelchair access) with seperate enclosures along the way displaying fish, turtles, crocodiles, giant and red pandas, birds, monkeys, reptiles and manatees. Seperate to the admission price for the River Safari is the optional Amazon River Quest boat ride which can be purchased and which we thoroughly enjoyed. Similar to a theme part water ride, this attraction displays some animals that are not seen elsewhere in the River Safari, such as jaguar, flamingo, tapir, giant anteater and a couple of monkey species. Repeat rides are possible with the one ticket if you missed them the first time around. The River Safari is within the grounds of Singapore Zoo, but a seperate attraction. There are ticketing options available for the zoo, river safari and Jurong bird park if you want to visit multiple attractions. Would recommend a minimum of 3 hours to see the River Safari. As the zoo is about a 30 minute drive out of downtown Singapore, look at various ticketing options from tour operators which offer included transfers."
,,"relaxing, entertaining day out",5.0,,"Structured, well-organised routes, and plenty of wonderful exotic animals to look at. Visited on a Monday and crowd was very comfortable."
,,Average,3.0,,There was nothing extremely interesting... maybe just the pandas and rides. however the amazon river quest was very enjoyable! i suggest the animal shows should be longer!
,,Amazing night walk,5.0,,Really nice place and worth the walk I will recommend the express tram as the normal one have a very long que the walk will take at least 1 hr and the tram is almost 40 min time we'll spent and worth it
,,No safari after all,2.0,,The title and pictures of „river safari“ misguided us to think it would be visiting the zoo by boat when in fact you would walk all the time through a normal/marine themed zoo with the option to get on a 20 minute cruise over the lake. Quite disappointing if you expected a safari.
,,Must Go for families,5.0,,"The River Safari is one of my favorites among the attractions in Singapore! Great for kids, teens and seniors alike. The Amazon Quest Boat ride is definitely recommended for just S$5 more, it will be the highlight of your trip, if the Pandas, Manatees and Otters weren't enough!"
,,Must See River Exploring Safari,4.0,,"In general, all attractions are well positioned and nicely done with amazing animals like monkeys, snakes (Anaconda), fishes (small & big), crocs, critters, Panda; we also can see our 'longkang' waterchannel type fishes & large animal like Manatees; of course our favourite is seeing our beloved panda. The best thing is the walkways are sheltered from the heat & rain. My least favorite will be the free 15mins big boat ride (40 seats pax) in which we don't see much actions. The exciting part will be the river quest which costs $5, seating in a small boat of 10 pax, providing some thrill & fun (a few gentle falls along the river route) & close up of some interesting animals along a river route. Overall: my teenagers, my wife & myself like it very much."
,,"Worth visiting, but not as exciting as the zoo",4.0,,"While it was my second time visiting the River Safari, I still enjoyed myself. Learnt quite a bit, and it was interesting to see the behaviour of these animals up close. The manatee exhibition in particular, was a highlight for me as they were active, playful and unexpectedly graceful. However, it is a tad small - you'll probably take at most 3 hours to cover the entire river safari - as compared to the Singapore Zoo, which usually takes up your entire day. Nonetheless, well worth a visit!"
,,Terrific for families with small children,5.0,,"We’ve been to the river safari 4 times now and have loved it each time. As a family with a small child, we enjoy it cos we can let him explore on his own and not have to worry about trams or cars going by. Everything is at his eye level as well which is just perfect... moreover the walkway is shaded so you don’t have to worry if the sun is blazing hot or if it starts to drizzle. Still my favourite of the parks in the area."
,,River Safari,5.0,,Excellent place and we are totally awed!!! It was raining and the place was fully sheltered. The aquariums are beautiful. The downside is that the Amazonia ride needs a minimum of 103cm (i think). So that was disappointing. The free boat ride actually nothing much to see... Overall was not bad.
,,better than night safari,5.0,,This is the cleanest fishing tanks/aquariums that i have seen. It was quite alot of them with different species. Our familiy enjoyed the river safari more than the night safari. We saw one of the pandas (Kai Kai) and took both the boat and amazon quest. We did not see much animals on the boat but it was nice with some air. I would definitly recommend this alone and/or in a combination with e.g. zoo.
,,River Safari - not what we expected!!,3.0,,This is simply a walk full of tanks filled with river species from main rivers in the world but if you want to see the Pandas there are none in the Singapore Zoo so you need to pay extra for the river safari. Badly exit signed and we got lost. Apparently you just walk to the end of the Pandas ( only one on display anyway ) then turn around and walk all of the way back which was rather a long way and boring a second time around. Great concept but if the Pandas is all you want to see rather a long way to walk.
,,Super nice!,5.0,,This trip was awesome as I have never been to any river safari in other countries. However some of the activities may have to charge separately therefore travelers might be confused sometimes while they wish to join some of them randomly.
,,Love the whole atmosphere. Love the Plus size fishes.,5.0,,Had been going around the whole Safari more than 3 times. Loved the Amazon Flooded Florest and the Giant Panda Enclosure. The boat ride around to have a close encounter with animals and the animal show is just something every little kid and their parents should not miss.
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore. Taxi isn’t that expensive to get there, but can also take MRT plus shuttle at train station nearby."
,,River Safari,3.0,,Everything was really informative but most importantly it was too pricey for the amount of time you can spent there.
,,Good and Disappointing,4.0,,"Generally good as the whole park was sheltered. However, disappointing as my son is not able to take the boat ride as he is not tall enough. Are you able to let kids in with parent supervision?"
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"Exhibits were few and miserably boring to say the least.
River safari isnt cheap and yet we still have to pay for river cruise in order to visit attractions that are otherwise not available for viewing by foot.
Overall, it was an expensive and horrid experience which taught me that the money would be better spent in other areas. Would not visit again."
,,Great educational info and covered throughout,5.0,,"The signboards were really educational, and you could tell they put in a lot of effort into the signs. Enclosures were well maintained and the animals looked healthy. I really loved that the whole place had sheltered walkways, especially since Singapore is hot and rains often. The animal show 'Once Upon a River' had great performers. Wonderful experience!"
,,Cute animals!!,4.0,,The exhibition was interesting and architecture was really amazing!! The cute chocolate Panda pau just right outside the JiaJia and KaiKai’s attraction should be tried as well!
,,great concept,5.0,,"situated next to the normal zoo. the river safari isnt a safari trip but a walking loop past enclosures and tanks that showcase the plants, animals, fish and reptiles of the major river systems of the world. The displays are clustered for each river to give an ecosystem overview to what you see which I thought was a great concept. Took us a couple of hours and provided the perfect infill between the main zoo and the nite safari zoos."
,,Refreshing and friendly staff,5.0,,The environment is clean and staff are approachable. It was a nice experience knowing that our animal friends are first priority.
,,great day out with the family,5.0,,"River safari is the home of the pandas in Singapore. Apart from the boat rides and sightings of pandas, Once upon a time show is amazing. Animal show was interactive and informative. Kids get amazed by the wildlife and at the end of the show you can feed the capibaras. A great day out of the family. Suggest to go as early as possible to escape the crowds, apply mosquito repellents and Starbucks at river safari has a good selection of menu for the family."
,,River safari,5.0,,Excellent attraction. Worth the ticket price even for the pandas alone. The monkey enclosure is awesome. The boat rides are also great.
,,Good tour for all ages,4.0,,The river safari was basic but the live species of water creatures made up for it.very easy walk through the underground and above ground aquariums. The South American species of fish was a great sight. We enjoy it.
,,Good exposure,5.0,,"There's a lot of different species of animals you get to see. My favourite would be the dugong! Also the panda.. but seeing the panda awake would depends on luck though!!
Also there are lots of different catfish and all those big fishes! Just couldn't remember their name. It's sure worth the visit!"
,,Informative & Enjoyable,4.0,,"Place is well structured, organized and ventilated. Many exhibits and informative. The kids like it alot"
,,A Relaxing Day-Out,4.0,,"Went on a Monday with my grown-up sons. Enjoyed the cool, mostly sheltered and relaxing walk as we strolled through the exhibits. We enjoyed the serenity of the greeneries, without too much heat, the fresh air and watching the pandas chewing off their lunch, among other things.:) Some of the rare exhibits fascinated us, eg. the Sturgeon. The boat rides are generally underwhelming, to be honest, but I guess it makes them suitable for young children and elderly folks. Staff members are friendly and patient. The attraction is overall wheelchair and stroller friendly with toilet facilities conveniently available. So I highly recommend it for family outing and bonding."
,,Interesting Place,4.0,,"You can find the signboard with explanation, or you can scan the QR code for Chinese version. Spend almost 2 hours in the park."
,,Bad attraction,1.0,,Paid $5 to take the Amazon boat ride but the animals were not there and we couldnt see anything throughout the 10 mins ride. Finished touring River Safari within an hour because there isnt anything much to view and is pretty much like singapore zoo. Would rather go to Singapore zoo instead.
,,River Safari Amazon River Quest,3.0,,The boat ride was slightly disappointing as we did not get to see as much animals as we expected and there were quite a few enclosures that seemed to be empty and also the boat ride was a little fast along with the narration so it was a bit hard to catch on what was said.
,,River safari splash,4.0,,Lovely experience.. hope to see more excursion / adventure type trips to make the experience even more exhilarating
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Amazing is an understatement! We had a guide who received us right at the entrance and the guide (Justin) was extremely insightful and knowledgeable on all the attractions and animals. Above all else, the two pandas were of course the highlight of the trip - we were lucky enough to be able to capture lots of close up videos and photos of Jia Jia and Kai Kai having their meals. It was definitely and eye opener and we all look forward to our next trip to River Safari! Special thanks to Jason and Justin for such a very smooth coordination."
,,Good visit!,4.0,,Do note that one of the attraction close at 5pm instead of 6pm. We missed it as we assume everything closes at 6pm.
,,Excellent Attraction,4.0,,"This was a very awesome day out. Amazing animals and loved the manatee aquarium. Kids enjoyed the log ride, but be aware this is not included in your admission ticket it is an extra cost, although not expensive. Overall very well laid out and a fabulous attraction worth a visit."
,,Great afternoon,5.0,,"We spent about 4 hours at this amazing attraction. The River Safari is well laid out and easy to get around. The show was good, kids loved meeting the beavers. The pandas are a must see and the river ride was lots of fun. Definitely worth a visit. We combined river safari with the night safari which worked well."
,,Love the manatees,5.0,,Lovely way to spend half a day appreciating the tranquility and watching the animals go about their day. You can get really close to the creatures and the signs have a great narrative.
,,Fun River environment,5.0,,They have done a great job with the river environment and the best surprise for us was that that Pandas are located here instead of the big zoo! It is a confusing choice of location but it was great fun as it was feeding time when we arrived.
,,Worth to visit,4.0,,"I've been here for 2 times this year. It's very nice attraction, worth the money. Better visit on weekdays but if you have to visit on holiday, better buy the ticket online before going."
,,Amazing river safari !,5.0,,"As all things in Singapore , this attraction is also beautifully developed , constantly reengineered ! Great thot is given to the basic theme of the park as well . It needs a lot more animals given the space ! Fabulous experience !"
,,Marvelous Manatees,5.0,,"Absolutely loved the River Safari as my 11 year old had just completed a term project on the Amazon - it was fantastic for her to be able to see so many Amazon animals. We also did the optional extra Manatee Mania tour and were able to feed and pat 12 gorgeous creatures - this was the highlight of our trip to Sinagpore. An amazing day, fabulous guides.....recommend highly."
,,Good place,4.0,,"A good place to be, especially a date. However, there are a lot of noisy and loud foreigners, so it can get irritating and frustrating, especially during the Amazon Ride, so be careful of them."
,,Relaxing and Engaging,5.0,,"Love how the route through the River Safari is sheltered almost 90% to afford a leisurely and comfortable viewing of the animals away from the heat of the scorching sun.

Love the layout of the exhibits by geographical regions and the educational information provided.

Enjoyed in particular watching the divers in the gigantic aquarium of the Manatees, the Touch Pool, the River Cruise and the primates walk-in enclosure.

Love,
Mummy Kok"
,,Good place for kids,4.0,,The facilities are family friendly and had shade in most area. The only down side was that the pandas were not in the enclosure when we visited and there was no notification on that.
,,"riversafari is nice, clean and very informative!",4.0,,nice place! all sheltered! but too sad that we can’t see the pandas... 😭 saw one of them was sleeping from the screen.
,,Awesome,5.0,,First time visit to the Singapore River Safari - bought a combination ticket with the Singapore Zoo. Excellent and full day out! The River Safari is a great addition to the zoo and proves again the Singapore does zoo's best. Highly recommended!
,,Good experience,4.0,,"It was a good trip. Took us about 2 hours to finish up the entire park. The only disappointment is that Jiajia's cctv was not turned on, hence we did not get to see her at all. Other than that, it was a really good trip."
,,Interesting and probably should visit at least once.,4.0,,"You can go through the whole park within a few hours. The most you'll probably see are the fish in the tanks. Other animals are hard to spot since they may not make an appearance. The included boat ride ""Cruise Reservoir"" was relaxing but don't expect to see anything. It goes in a small circle around the river. The Amazon Quest is another boat ride, which you have to pay for. It's about $5/person. Again, don't expect to really see much because you may or may not see the animals. The great thing is you can re-ride a second time free of charge in case you miss anything. I can see the park being fun for kids. It was good to experience it at least once."
,,Looking at wildlife,5.0,,"This place is just next to the zoo. Full of animals like fishes, amphibians, snakes, etc in a glass cases. It's well shaded and sheltered all the way making it easy to take breezy walk wild admiring nature. All animals look very graceful, the panda especially, happily eating away without any cares in the world while people watching them. It' good to take boat ride so that you can be closer to the animals. The animals comes from all over the world. You have to pay $5 ticket for that. Most places are either in aircon room or with fans so that it's cooler for visitors. Really an enjoyable place even though it's not as big as the zoo."
,,A great afternoon,4.0,,"Exceptional exhibits especially the different rivers from around the globe, the manatees and the amazon ride. Pandas were asleep so a little disappointed for my girls. Did the River Safari after a full day at the Singapore zoo so we were exhausted at the end."
,,A decent experience that could have been better,3.0,,"I went to the River Safari while on vacation in Singapore and purchased the Park Hopper ticket which also included a ride on the Amazon River Quest. The River Safari is probably smallest of all wildlife parks in Singapore so you don't have to walk as much to cover everything. While this means there's fewer animals on display, they also have a good variety of fishes. At one particular place, you're also allowed to touch a starfish and a crab if you like. Also, being contructed in an enclosed space, there's very good air conditioning unlike other parks where humidity can become a huge concern after a while.

While there are quite a few good things going on, there were some disappointments too. If I knew what's on display on the boat ride, I'd have no problem giving it a miss. At the end of the ride, it felt like we wasted 15 mins of our time. There weren't any exotic or rare to see animals. The Amazon River Quest, although good was a bit too short. So much that we spent about an hour in queue for our chance on the ride which finished in about 10 minutes. Not to mention the frequent technical issues with ride causing indefinite delays. The management will most definitely have to rethink the idea of the River Safari.

A tip for first time travelers. Pick up the park guide pamphlet at the entrance. That's all the guidance you'll need while at the River Safari."
,,River Safari,4.0,,"Partner & I went on the river safari here - very pretty, very unique. Was a little bit disappointing as a couple of animals weren’t there though, may have been a reason for that though."
,,RIver Safari,3.0,,"Good place for kids.The trails are very straightforward and its not too much to do in a day. If you want more adventure, Singapore zoo might be a better place. Good thing is that you can bring your own food in even though there are some restaurants available. No halal food place, so just keep in mind."
,,Short vacation,4.0,,"We enjoy a lot together with my sons, whos having a short vacation only...He learn a lot of experiences and enjoy the animals!!"
,,Great day out,5.0,,"A great day out, lots to see and the show and amazon boat ride are great fun. It’s all under cover, so even if it rains you can still enjoy the attraction and also escape the hot sun. With the extra buying the tickets for the amazon quest ride too."
,,Singapore River Safari,5.0,,I have previously visited the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari and the River Safari I think is to be the best option out of the 3 attractions. Its great has majority of the walkways are covered meaning you stay cool in the shade. Great animal enclosures and you get to see the pandas and the jaguar. The riverboat ride is great however if you can't see an animal then you unfortunately you can't just hang around as the boat is continuously moving that would be the only the down side to the river boat ride and its the only way of being able to see the jaguar. The reservoir ferry is nice as it offers a cool breeze but there really is not much to see. The aquarium is also a nice attraction and good way to finish off the day.
,,Great adventure,4.0,,Good family outing. Wish the Amazon river cruise is for kids above 100cm. The current height requirement of 106cm is quite high in my opinion.
,,An expected visit,5.0,,"This is my 4th time visiting the exhibits and I continue to enjoy them lots. There are some new ones, while the old ones still enthralled. Well done!"
,,Best for 4 years and above,3.0,,The river quest meant for 1.05 m an above. And its educational for toddlers that can read or start appreciate which animal at which river (they simulate few river around the world). My trip was quick coz w 2+ years old toddler
,,Interesting theme park,4.0,,"River safari is an interesting place with lot to learn . Boat ride across the animal habitats was fun . However this is just a one time visit place.

For adults there is nothing much to expect, as i found that this place is suitable for kids ."
,,Interesting walk and a good experience,5.0,,Went to the river safari in the noon. Was pretty hot but there was enough shade and refreshments along the whole area that allowed us to recharge. Was a pretty good experience overall.
,,30 minutes walk,3.0,,"I would say that this attraction is generally boring. There was nothing interesting to see. Except the Pandas which was not active. I visited the attraction when it was raining so the boat ride was suspended. So do check the weather for going here. If not, you kinda waste your time but overally it is worth going if you like fishes"
,,River Safari,4.0,,"This activity is inside the zoo only. While exploring this we saw a boat cruising on the reservoir we thought this may be the river safari but fortunately not.

River Safari is theme based cruise drive in Canal passing through the forest with different types of animals & birds etc with narration. At the end of tour when the boat lifted up dropped in water was great!"
,,Awesome Park!,5.0,,Family friendly park especially to elders. Highly recommended to add-on the river quest boat ride. Awesome!
,,Great for kids,4.0,,"Our young son loved it, lots of different animals to see and enjoy. Be prepared to wait a while to get on the river cruise themed ride"
,,Lovely animal park,5.0,,"The River safari was another must visit, from Manatees to Pandas, it has a great selection of creatures and a lovely lay out. Definitely pay the small extra for the River Quest ride as it was fun and another way of seeing some animals (I recommend a front seat in the boat if you can!). The walk through monkey enclosure was a thrill, and a great photo opportunity. And the humongous display with Manatees is incredible, you can see below the water, and walk around till you look down at the tank from above.
Do not wait in line for the boat ride that is free... there is not much to see and it would have irritated me if I had waited to go on it. You can see the giraffe from the zoo, but that’s about it.
This park did not take as long as the Bird Park and the Zoo, and was easily done in an afternoon before the Night Safari."
,,Great new tour called Manatee Mania,4.0,,"We are no strangers to the River Safari, but this time around we tried the Manatee Mania tour and found to be a truly enjoyable experience as we got to be up close these gentle and amazing creatures, feeding and interacting with them. Highly recommended."
,,Zoo for water animals,4.0,,"This is the zoo near to the Singapore Zoo. This contains all the fishes, water cost animals and animals with river as their habitat. This is much structured zoo unlike Singapore Zoo. They have shed all over to cover you from Sun. They have pretty huge fishes out there which are worth the watch. I would highly recommend the Amazon quest boag which is a memorable experience for me. They should all the animals that live in river coast with English commentry in the background. The flamingos are a must watch sight. I would recommend taking Park hopper plus pass to visit this along with other Flora and Fauna attractions in Singapore."
,,River Safari Visit,5.0,,"!st time at River Safari with my family, finds that this place is much more cooling that the original zoo. My family loves the river safari very much, especially my daughter who particularly like the boat ride at the Amazon forest adventure."
,,Short ride..Felt wanting for more,4.0,,"You will need to walk quite a distance from the main entrance to reach the river safari. One relief is the aquarium and other attractions you get to see. If you have missed SEA aquarium in SENTOSA then this place should provide you some relief. The collection of fishes and glass enclosure view is breathtaking. Enroute there was Panda exhibit as well. Final touch was the walk across the water front in a bridge which had amazing view of the water body. Finally, when it comes to the river cruise the boat ride was about 15mins and we were shown Rhinos, Giraffe during this time. The boats were good, carry your sun glasses..overall, felt the ride could have been for some more time and few more exhibits."
,,A bit disappointing compared to the other Zoo attractions,3.0,,"This river safari didn't exist when we came to Singapore 10 Years ago. They are trying to Disneyize the zoo, with this river ride. But I was underwhlemed, particularly after the long queue (30 minutes' wait). Similarly the lake (well reservoir really) ride doesn't have much to see, other than a giraffe's head peeking above the trees. It was quite pleasant and there was a cooling breeze, which is always welcome after the steamy heat."
,,Great attraction for kids to observe upclose!,5.0,,"River Safari has nice broad boardwalk and is mostly sheltered, making it a great place to visit when it’s really sunny/ somewhat rainy. I also like how the glass panels are wide and low enough for young kids to enjoy. Sometimes at the zoo the animal are quite far but it’s hardly the case at River Safari. The boat ride is also enjoyable."
,,Fun but food option is little,4.0,,"The kids and the adults enjoyed the river safari, with the rides and the animal at the river safari. There 2 shows happening and we managed to catch both and have photo opportunity.

There is also 2 rides. The Amazon ride is payable, $5 for adult and $3 for kids. But what we did not know is the kids need to be at least 1.2m as we bought the tickets online. so too bad, one of my kids can't take the ride and we have to spilt up.

The other river ride available is free for all, but the waiting time is about an hour.

The food option is very little. Only 1 restaurant after the panda viewing place and it is super crowded during lunch time."
,,Unnecessary,2.0,,"Singapore zoo is good to visit. However, doing river safari and night safari in the same day seems to be irrelevant. You have to keep on pushing yourself keeping in mind river safari will also close at 6pm and night safari will open at 7pm. I found river safari boring. Nothing special was there. Just a water boat ride and that's it.
I will put video of the river safari and my review about it on my YouTube channel 'Explore with DD'. Please do check my channel and subscribe to it for latest video updates.
Thank you and hope to seeing to on my Channel."
,,Good way to spend an afternoon!,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the place. Be careful to catch the Amazon show on time, as it only happens twice a day. The rest of the river safari can be explored at leisure, and our favourite bit were the Manatees that we saw at the end. And the Pandas!"
,,River Safari feedback,3.0,,"It is worth the cost, there is nothing much except for fishes and few others plus a short boat ride. 30 dollars is a day robbery for Singaporeans to visit."
,,Good place for children,4.0,,"Kids can enjoy animals and fish at the same place, so if your children like zoo and aquarium, this is the place to go.

There is hight limitation, but my older kid could ride on Amazon jungle boat with me.
Unfortunately, it was around 2pm and really hot, so most of major animals tool a nap or hid behind the facilities so we could not see them."
,,River Safari Experience,5.0,,The place was well maintained with friendly staff and informative signboards. I expected the weather to be scorching but it was not too bad as most of the route is sheltered. The panda exhibit was adorable!
,,Highlight - pandas Kai Kai (凯凯) and Jia Jia (嘉嘉),3.0,,"This park was one of the 4 Park Hopper Plus Pass attraction. In my opinion, this park is not worth visiting if you have to purchase the ticket individually.

We were advised to do the River Safari Cruise upon coming through the entrance and it was disappointing. It was quite a walk from the entrance to the dock and the cruise is only 15 minutes ride. We could barely hear what’s playing because the recording was unclear.

We proceeded to see the two pandas Kai Kai (凯凯) and Jia Jia (嘉嘉). I would say this was the highlight of this park. We were lucky to be able to see both pandas as I’ve heard one of them was extremely shy and has always been hiding inside."
,,Great attraction!,5.0,,Great place for to visit with kids. Like the route as it is a single loop and under the shelter. Nice alternative to visit if it is raining at the zoo.
,,Family friendly and Flexible attraction.,5.0,,I like that we were allowed to go again on the boat ride so that we could have another chance to see the hiding jaguar.
,,Rooms for improvement,3.0,,"Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari have for years set the standard bar high. It's a tall order to catch up to the same standard. Overall, the exhibits and experience is pale in comparison to the more established sister parks. For this reason, the admission fee, being about the same as the other 2 parks, felt quite steep. They can easily merge the River Safari as part of the Zoo."
,,river Safari Review,5.0,,fantastic experience . Will revisit again with my friends & family. Would like to volunteer. kindly advise
,,River Safari,5.0,,Wonderful place to visit for young child. Mostly sheltered and air-conditioned with lots of water points.
,,Well organized and entertaining experience,4.0,,"While smaller than the zoo next door, River Safari offers lots for young kids. Well designed and executed."
,,Singapore river safari,3.0,,The price of the ticket do not match the attractions. Expectation is not align to my expectation. The ride that can see the animal in the park is excluded from the park ticket and need to pay extra 5 bucks
,,Great for kids and big kids,4.0,,My 8 yr old loved this excursion. The sea cows were the highlight. Monkeys were adorable. Walkways are wide and seemed not overly busy when we were there in June. The toilets were clean. The boat ride in the end is ok we only saw the giraffe and a turtle. It seemed short though. Still enjoyable morning out.
,,Countryside attraction of Singapore,5.0,,"Less known attraction and smaller in scale compared to Singapore Zoo, but its countryside feel make it more relax to stroll around, enjoying the surrounding view...whereas in zoo, everyone seems to race against time to catch the next showtime or view as many animals as possible. Most importantly, get the chance to see pandas!"
,,Interesting pandas and amazon quest ride,4.0,,"There are 2 boat rides. One is the normal ride for about 20 minutes where you can see rhinoceros and giraffes and few other water birds. The other is the amazon quest, which is more interesting and we could see flamingos, jaguar, spider monkey and few other animals. You can take the amazon quest ride multiple times, but for that you need to take the exit door with a repeat ride. There are various fish exhibits and the most interesting was the giant panda. One was sleeping, while the other was eating bamboo and walking around. We were lucky to see to the polar bear also. Amazon quest ride is additional 5 sgd if bought at the ticket counter. The tickets are available with agents and online at a lesser price than the zoo."
,,river safari,4.0,,"Good set of exhibits, although we went later in the day. Enjoyed the manatees, adventure ride, pandas. Not much on the river cruise. Could do with more guidance on where to go and we went for the wrong river cruise ride at first."
,,River Safari Singapore,4.0,,Place was great but i just recommend to put the word Singapore on their picture frames or album because it only says River Safari and theres tones of them around the world.
,,Beautiful place,3.0,,"The River Safari is beautifully designed. The park is sheltered, so even if it rains, you can stil See all the enclosures. However, the river cruise will not operate in rainy days. Do catch the Animal show at 11am. Panda bears were very active.
The F&B was disappointing though. Found a 5cm Long feather inside a wanton. When shown to the restaurant supervisor, she asked me to fill up a form if I want to complain ..."
,,Really interesting attraction,5.0,,"Pandas are a life long experience. The cruise a nice chill out. The other boat attraction really exciting, we have done it twice."
,,Not a very good one. Q average,3.0,,"I know this is quite difficult to ask but when I was there, one of the pandas was asleep and another panda went into the caged enclousre so tbh, i don’t think anyone was able to see the panda upclose, so if we went there for the panda, it was a rather disappointing moment. Maybe close the caged enclosure at times?"
,,Fun and Enjoyable,4.0,,"the zoo is unexpected clean. all paths are with shelter, no worry about raining day or hot sun. My children are so pleased to see the Panda and ferry ride. It is a good place for family outing."
,,Awesome Trip,4.0,,"Eye-opening experience on those fishes but not the pandas, manage to see one (Kai Kai) only which is sleeping"
,,Animals view from so dam near!!!amazing,5.0,,Firstly the quest ride was amazing .... v all really enjoyed . It was like seeing animals from an arms length . The surroundings the music ... the ups n downs during the ride ... then that tiger .. ooo mama... waterfall ... in between... it was an altogether diff expereince ... dont ever miss river safari ... rather any thing once u r to this side of singapore..
,,Peasant trip,4.0,,Nice experience especially the amazon quest ride. But would still prefer to go to the zoo and night safari which is much bigger and more animals.
,,Nowhere As Good As The Zoo,2.0,,"Buying a hopper ticket gave us the entrance to the River Safari. If I had to pay a separate fee for this then I would avoid going at all.
The panda's are really good to see and we would probably never see them again. The boat ride was ok. I think we were there for about 1.5 hrs so please do not think it is a whole day event like the zoo."
,,Skip the Boat & Go When it Rains!,4.0,,"We were blessed with a large thunderstorm on the public holiday when we decided to go see the pandas. It was an excellent opportunity. Most visitors delayed their arrival and those who were there stayed at the front of the park while the rain bucketed down. We headed straight for the enclosed panda area via the covered walkways. You still need a raincoat/umbrella to keep dry with heavy rain but the walkways were mostly sheltered. We had exclusive viewing of the pandas for about 10 minutes before anyone else made their way to the area. It was HEAVEN! The enclosure for the pandas is fabulous. We stayed for about 40 minutes and left when the crowds started getting more than we could bare. I highly recommend skipping the boat ride. It's a great marvel of machinery at the beginning with the elevator lift but you don't see anything on the trip. The boat move WAY TOO FAST. We also enjoyed the funny looking monkeys with the beards and the ones in the open enclosure that you can walk around with the monkeys. Watching the feeding of the manatees was also great fun and I could spend hours watching the otters. They play with their reflections in the glass. It's priceless. Let's face it though, people come for the Pandas and they are world class. Skip the ""normal"" route, head straight there get as much viewing as possible before the crowds come in and then go explore. It's not the Night Safari but it's worth the time and admission."
,,Panda visit,5.0,,"The amazon river cruise is worth doing, you get up close to the animals as you cruise along the river. My favourite part, was seeing the Pandas stripping the bamboo to munch on."
,,"Not worth the time, except for the Pandas",2.0,,"If you want to see the giant Pandas, or the cute little red panda, then go here, see them, and come back. Otherwise the safari isn't worth it. It is a nice to walk through the venue and quickly look at all the fishes. You can get a much better experience of sea creatures at the SEA Aquarium in Sentosa.

Avoid the boat ride, it is absolutely worthless. They try to show you the animals from the other side of the river which are in the Singapore Zoo and you cannot spot them anyway."
,,Disappointed!,3.0,,"Boat ride was suspended without notice on the website, where we bought our tickets. Had we known we would not have visited that particular day. Could not see Kai."
,,Not fantastic,2.0,,"Many places were not in order, not operating. Many shows unavailable. Frankly nothing much to see or do there."
,,River Safari visit,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed this visit - it was very well set out and easy to get around. Very interesting to see different river creatures from around the world. Particularly enjoyed the boat ride.
,,Unique exeperience,4.0,,I don’t think that there is any other zoo in the world that focuses on the river systems. The animals are very unique especially the giant manatees. Our son loves it very much. It’s not too big so we can cover the entire zoo in 2 hours which is great for young kids so they are not too tired. Also all the walkways are covered making it convenient whether it rains or shines.
,,River safari trip,5.0,,"Extraordinary and amazing safari with different species of river fish, crocodiles, panda and monkey. Great for family outing"
,,River safari,4.0,,So far the trip was enjoyable as the weather was great and manage to take the boat ride as previous trip didn’t manage to take as it rain. My sons love the trip and the animals.
,,Splendid Day,5.0,,"Overall it was good experience, not too long of a journey. Enjoyed the Amazon River Quest the most. Like the ambiance, most importantly its very a friendly environment for the elderly. Lots of shelter & resting area."
,,I am very disappointed,1.0,,"Short of main attractions and animals such as Jaguar was only view via the boat ride and it lasted 5 seconds, I am utterly disappointed as a Singaporean as its expensive and the animals to view are limited."
,,"Good experience, but expensive",4.0,,It was a good experience with riverside animals. However I felt the pricing is bit too much for what i offers. Understand that maintaining these animals might be expensive. But it still felt like
,,River Safari review,3.0,,"The attraction is ok to see, we have been to better places.We bought tickets from our hotel at a discount. We took the Mandai bus outside the Khatib MRT station to reach this place. Singapore zoo, jurong bird park and night Safari are also located here. We took the boat rides inside the attraction. Could see very few animals. But we saw the red panda and the white panda.Lots of fishes in the aquarium. Time required is 3 hours. Ideal for all ages. Restaurants and toilets are nearby. The attraction opens at 10 am daily."
,,Nice place to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"Unique set up, good place for an afternoon round up with family. YOu only need 3-4 hours but can be very satisfied."
,,Fantastic day,5.0,,"Didn't know what to expect here, but what a great place to visit. So close to pandas, and aquatic animals. The boat ride was amazing. Lots to see and do. Thoroughly enjoyed our day and would HIGHLY recommend."
,,Pandas,5.0,,"This place was great. Clean, organized, great array of exotic animals. The Giant Pandas were the obvious highlight. A close second was the Giant Red Panda. IT's one long loop that you walk. The pandas are about halfway through the loop. When I got to the panda exhibit, one was sleeping and one was hiding. I was happy to see the one sleeping, but I wanted more. I waited for a while, but nothing changed. So then I continued on. Then after I was done, I rushed back through the entire first half to see the pandas again in case they had woken up. And they had. Both of them. It was fantastic. I could have watched them for hours. I was also very lucky in that the park was practically empty. No crowds."
,,Suitable for toddler,5.0,,"My girl 18 months really enjoyed to visit River Safari. All Sheltered, she can enjoyed even in raining day."
,,Fun couple of hours,4.0,,Had an enjoyable time at the river safari with my 6 year old. She liked it so much we went around twice. Great that it’s practically covered the whole way. Probably not so exciting for older kids and bless they are fascinated with aquatic animals.
,,THE BEST,5.0,,"I went solo and at first I had doubts that I’ll get bored but just by the scenery of the zoo, it awed me and made me fall in love with every animal. Of course everyone loves the panda and it was nice seeing them in person."
,,A fun day out,4.0,,"The River Safari is a water based attraction near to the Singapore Zoo. For added discounts, combine a ticket here along with a multi-attraction ticket (you dont have to visit all on the same day and certainly might not be able to if you are doing the Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari given the amount of time you'll need for all 3). Allow yourself 2 to 3 hours to explore the whole River Safari. Unlike the Night Safari, the main part of this attraction is walking around river themed areas (Amazon, Nile, India etc) with various aquatic creatures to see. There's a small area where you can touch a starfish and horseshoe crab and you may need to wait about 10 minutes for your turn if its busy. One of the main animal encounters will the Giant Panda (there are 2 pandas here, a male and female) so if you've never seen a panda before, then the River Safari is a must. After the first half of the tour, you can hop on to a boat (there may be a 15 minute wait time here depending on crowds) but you'll enjoy a 20 minute, relaxing boat ride across the reservoir and may spot rhinos and giraffe grazing through the trees across the river. This is included in your ticket. There's a second boat ride, the Amazon Adventure which is at a 5 SGD supplement to your park entry (personally I think this really should be included in the park entry). Its worth it if you have small children as they'll love the 10 minute journey seeing monkeys, birds, the jaguars and leopards among other animals. It can be missed however. Try to get here early in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid the crowds (but note that the last boat tour departs at 6pm). Compared to the Night Safari and Singapore Zoo, the River Safari is slightly less of a must-do - but that's my personal opinion. If you love water and sea creatures then this isnt to be missed."
,,Interesting storyline,4.0,,River safari takes you through major rivers and life in them. Amazon wild ride is not to be missed. I however found not enough written commentary around each zone which would have made it educational.
,,Mixture of zoo and aquarium,4.0,,"The theme of this park is the rivers echosystem. It is represented in a way mixing zoo and aquarium expereince. I would recommend to combine this, the zoo and night safari in a whole day long experience."
,,Quick tour in a rainy day,4.0,,"Youre up and ready one morning to explore singapore zoo but it starts to rain. Youre at the counter to buy tickets but dont know if you should go ahead with the your plan. Well this scenario is typical of many in tropical Singapore where it rains 1/4 of the year. Dont fret much cos the singapore river safari is here to the rescue. Mostly dont under the comfort of a sheltered walkway or indoors, this small but eventful park has a few surprises along the way. Able to finish everything within 2-3 hours, i would recommend any who wants to wait out the rain before exploring singapore zoo. Its designed in such a way that you just follow the flow, exploring the park clockwise; youll know what i mean when you get there.
Tips:
-Reservoir cruise is complimentary and sitting on the left side gives you a better view,
-Amazon river quest costs $5 but its super recommended,
-Spend a little more time at the giant panda enclosure to get that perfect shot,
-Enter the park and start your journey at the time of the first feeding time for the first enclosure and you’ll get a guide-like tour for the first half of your journey 10.15am / 2pm"
,,Only panda and manatees worth the visit,3.0,,"Looking at map, I knew it will be a boring place, but the bundle tickets offer great saving and the location is just next door to Singapore Zoo and night safari so we decided to visit. All the fishes are just ordinary. The only good thing is only panda and manatees. There are plenty of manatees, small and big. This is the only thing I enjoyed here."
,,Very Enjoyable afternoon experience,5.0,,"We visited the River Safari one afternoon in January. It was a great experience, everyone was friendly and helpful. The exhibits were interesting and well-done."
,,Pandas Pandas Pandas,5.0,,We had limited time to visit any of the zoos so we chose to visit the River Safari just to see the pandas. We were not disappointed. We got to stay as long as we liked at the Pandas enclosure and they were not behind a glass wall so it was amazing to be so close to them. Both pandas were out in view. One was munching away on bamboo while the other panda was curled up in a tree sleeping. SOOO cute!! The rest of the river safari was ok. The mini boat cruise was disappointing. If you are a panda lover then you definitely want to go. The rest of the river safari was good too but not great. It is just a matter of opinion though.
,,Was Ok,5.0,,"River Safari wasn't that great, just a 10 min round in the boat, nothing much to see. On the way to reach the river safari experience was good."
,,Great Experience!,4.0,,"I don't know of any other place where you can see and learn about river systems and the creatures that live in them. There are so many sea aquariums but this was quite unique.
We were particularly blown away by tha manatees display and spent ages watching them. Singapore does these attractions so well.
I do agree that the pandas were disappointing. We saw 2 I just hope they r ok. Otherwise this would have been a 5 star from us."
,,wonderful experience,5.0,,"We finished with the zoo in about 4 hours and post lunch decided to go for the river safari.
it's a bit of a walk once you enter the river safari so if you have small kids it's better to take strollers. Same holds true for the zoo as well. The best part is watching the 2 pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia. You will find a majority of the people watching the panda's playing around. the Amazon river quest is also good and you can see flamingos, Capybara, and monkeys as well. overall a nice experience."
,,Not fantastic but OK,3.0,,Disappointed with the Panda area. Only 1 Panda. All quite boring really but set within nice scenery. Worth a trip but 2 hours max
,,River Safari during May Day,4.0,,The place is great for young children. The café is however too small and was overcrowded during May Day. We enjoyed the boat rides very much.
,,Simple yet fun day trip with cousins,4.0,,"Very unique attractions and exhibits. A lot of animals, especially all the river fish were new to me.
Most of the park is covered walkways and you can visit even if it rains. Crowd levels were relatively low on a weekday and the only waiting time was for the river cruise.
The River Safari combines the best elements of all other Singapore attractions: The Zoo, SEA Aquarium, Universal Studios (because of the Amazon Quest ride) and even Gardens by the Bay (because of the pandas climate controlled zones).
There really is a lot to see here, and River Safari truly should be considered an attraction in its own right."
,,An absolute must do activity,5.0,,We simply loved the River Safari. It was a wise decision to not club the visit to the Safari with the Zoo as there was so much to see and do with the kids. We all loved the water rides and can't wait to go again.
,,Complete avoid,1.0,,"This is one part of the tour which was a complete disappointment
They can easily merge this into the zoo and charge a single ticket but everyone is here for the extra buck
Hardly any fishes on display
They have cleverly shifted the panda and tree panda enclosure here so people invariably land up going
The river cruise is absolute crap ,they show you the rhinos and giraffes again ,only this time from the boat ,what a hoax
They give you a ride along the mangroves for 15 minutes ,better ones in India
Few more turtles ,camians are thrown in
Manatees are another added attraction along with the panda
If your short on time and money this is a complete avoid
Just do the zoo and night safari"
,,River Safari is a rip-off,1.0,,"We bought a 2 park combo ticket which allowed us to visit the Zoo and River Safari.

While the Zoo was a pleasant experience, the River Safari has been a disaster. While getting in the ticket checker asked us to go to the right to catch the boat ride.. We searched and wasted close to 30mins going up and down trying to figure out how to get there. There is absolutely no staff around to guide, no signage to lead people to the boat ride. So we went back to the entry point and asked again, and she said go to the right!!

Finally there came a gentleman who said that there is no entry from where we were asked to go. We were then directed to go around and walk for close to 1km to reach the boat ride.

WHY LIE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS????

On the way we saw Panda exhibits signage but no Panda!!
No one to guide, and no proper signage.

When we reached the boat ride, we had to pay for additional entry fee for the Amazon boat ride. I am not sure why pay again when we didn't find anything worth our ticket money.

Why lie to"
,,"""River Talk"" is especially nice.",5.0,,"The middle point of River Safari has a stage, ""River Talk"" show is held there.
One of the staffs is friendly talking about animals which live around the river.
For example, Iguana, Snake, Bird and so on.
The staff invites such real animals to the stage, and collects volunteers from audience.
The volunteers can actually touch these animals which the staff is holding.

You would remenber highly developped sophisticated city from the name of ""Singapore"", but the area where ""River Safari"" belongs is in wildy Nature and has many trees, wide river. The gap between the core of the city and the Nature would surprise visitors from foreging countries."
,,Not a bad trip!,4.0,,"It was fun. Get to see so many marine animals close up. Amazon river quest was fun but it rained so heavily so we were just amazoning under the rain. did not get to try the cruise either. Hence, make sure to pick a nice weather!"
,,So Many Highlights Including A Panda Bear Teaching The Difference Between Economy & Business Class,5.0,,"Family time *tick* Have fun *tick* Learn lots *tick* What a top quality facility and display of some of this planets fascinating creatures. So much to admire and learn from zookeepers, information and observation. Plenty of variation in the displays and then if you are ever so lucky you get to see a Panda Bear awake and eating, and another Panda sleeping up a tree and the metaphor and understanding of economy class and business class is created."
,,Amazing river cruise experience,5.0,,"On 30 Apr 2018, after our long wait for the heavy rain to stop, we had a wonderful river cruise at 5:00pm.

There were two river cruises. Both cruises gave us an eye opening of the wild life which we couldn't experience in our daily life.

Besides, gigantic manatees, we saw many other"
,,"River Safari - Mini Amazon letting visitor understand its values, contributions and peacefulness",5.0,,Excellent project and setup with comfortable setting for visitors and their kids to walk through and understand the amazing world and importance of Amazon we have.
,,Very pleasant afternoon,4.0,,"Informative and interesting, went with teenage Son who enjoyed it also. Fairly quiet midweek, easy to get around, lots of shelter from sun."
,,A different zoo experience!,5.0,,I went to the zoo with 2 elderly parents and 2 children. My elderly mother in law has bad knees but the zoo provided a complimentary wheelchair. The zoo is ramped so it is very pram/wheelchair friendly. Loved the river perspective of the zoo- it is so unusual but the animals so interesting! The Amazon River ride is a must- and well worth the extra ticket cost- my kids say that was their highlight! Great way to spend half a day- ideally come early when the zoo opens and you'll be done by 1pm to head off for lunch somewhere. Loved the pandas- great way to cool down and make sure you have the panda cuppucino afterwards!
,,Project Safari,5.0,,My twins needed to do a video clips about forest and the 1st place came to my mind will be River Safari. NO regrets of bringing them there and they enjoys it so much
,,Out of date,1.0,,"The aquarium part was ok, but boat rides were seriously dreadful. Toe curlingly awful! Worry about standards and enclosure sizes too."
,,Rain or shine,5.0,,Well kept and pleasant route leading up to the main attractions of the panda and manatees. Very appreciative of the shade all the way.
,,Great Way to Spend the Day,4.0,,"Received a complimentary pass to see this park with purchase of Singapore Stopover Explorer Pass. I was impressed with the park, it was beautifully set out and was easy to follow the path through all the attractions. You walk through one side, making your way to the free river cruise, then walk back the other side which includes the underwater aquariums which were spectacular. There were seats where you could sit and watch the marine life swimming and interacting with each other. Lots of animals that you could get up close to. Lots of displays and informative billboards. I was really impressed by the water station, where you could refill your water bottles with cool filtered water."
,,Beautiful park with tons to see,5.0,,What a great day spent at River Safari! I’d been to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari before but not this one yet and I’m so glad we did. It’s such a great park with tons to see. It is beautifully set out with lots of interactive displays. The pandas were our highlight of the day - I spent a good 30mins just watching the pandas eat bamboo. It was so special. I would highly recommend this park to anyone visiting Singapore with a love for animals.
,,Awesome Trip!,5.0,,"Me and my partner were amazed by this zoo. We saw different kind of creatures and learned a lot through displayed facts and trivia. Highly recommended for family or friends, especially to kids."
,,Comfortable outing with elderly and young children,4.0,,"Not overly crowded with mostly or closed to all sheltered walk way. The only complain will be the variety of animals without the Amazon River Quest is very limited. The ticket is without the Amazon River Quest so need to pay additional. Even if you willing to pay, there is height requirement for kids, 1.06m or so."
,,"Great experience, good for rainy days",4.0,,My family enjoyed the visit to the River Safari on a weekday. It was mostly sheltered and is suitable for rainy days. The staff members were friendly and helpful - they kept a couple of our belongings that we have dropped along the way. Thank you for your integrity !
,,Very exciting,5.0,,"River Safari is one of attractions in Singapore Zoo. It seems like fusion of aquarium and zoo, and I really enjoyed it. Main composition of River Safari is creatures in amazon, but I don’t know the reason why there’re some panda bears and red pandas. But here is the place you must see."
,,Ok,3.0,,Most of the animals were not there. But river Safari is close to zoo. So worth giving a try. Nothing great .
,,"Well laid out, interesting exhibits",4.0,,"The highlight is obviously the pandas, but the other exhibits are very well done and quite interesting too. A few tips:

1. Go on a weekday if you can - fewer people
2. Buy tickets online in advance to avoid line. If purchasing on site, remember that all parks use the same ticket counter near the zoo entrance.
3. Try not to do the exhibits in reverse order (don't start with the Amazon exhibit). While there's no issue doing that on weekdays, there is a bit of backtracking involved if you do them in the reverse order.
4. If you want to see the pandas up close, you may have better luck during feeding time. We were there at ~3 p.m. and both pandas were out front eating, giving us a great view."
,,Back for another visit,3.0,,"I returned again today, this time just with my son. He particularly wanted to go on the river boat ride. Although this is additional cost it is quite good value as you get to go as many times as you want. Fortunately after 3 such rides he decided he needed to go to the bathroom and that brought it all to a natural conclusion. The pandas are probably the highlight of a visit to the River Safari attraction."
,,Great attractions and Sheltered Journey,4.0,,"What we like most for River Safari is that the safari journey was mostly sheltered along the attractions. Different from zoological garden, my kids were not bake under the hot tropical sun. My kids love to visit the otter and panda sections. Lastly, river safari was really well maintained. Good jobs and please keep up the good works."
,,Great Experience - but could have been better,4.0,,"Enjoyed the boat trip - however, the water current flows the boat too quickly so you have limited time in front of the exhibit to spot most of the animals hidden in the foliage (even after going around twice!). This is constructive feedback as the experience could have been definitely better."
,,EXCELLENT !!,5.0,,"We definitely enjoyed ourselves!! Loadsa array of wildlife, will recommend y'all to go for the boat cruise & amazon quest."
,,Pandas are a must see,4.0,,"We visited the zoo, night safari and river safari and would recommend a visit to all these attractions. The river safari was our only opportunity to get a glimpse of the pandas, which was certainly a highlight for us. We could sit and watch the panda happily chewing on bamboo for hours. The river cruise was nothing special and allowed you to see the rhinos and giraffes from the zoo by water. The Amazon river quest was enjoyable and gave you an opportunity to see some animals up close."
,,Family time at River Safari,4.0,,"Highly recommended for family. One of our great places for family bonding. The park is very well maintained, clean, spacious and kids friendly. The Giant Panda Forest and the gigantic aquarium are still the main attractions for our teenagers. Love the short boat ride with family together."
,,Good size for toddlers (3 yr old),4.0,,"Not so many places inside the Safari to sit down and eat, let alone lunch. Suggest to either you plan this early to get to the cafe in the middle at lunch or plan it in the afternoon. Good size for toddlers to walk through, have a break, and get on the boat."
,,Knowledgeable trip,5.0,,Brings back memories of geography during school days. The aquarium is outstanding. Love all the famous rivers of the world. The boat ride was a bit too fast to watch the animals go by.
,,Good if u like water animals n birds,3.0,,This place is Opp to Zoo so you can cover both in one day. Both attractions require min 3-3.5 hrs time. River Safari has fishes and water animals n birds . Fishes are inside big aquarium.
,,Love it,5.0,,Had a lot of fun seeing the animals from all around the world. From panda to tiny crocodiles. The boat ride was fun. There's also water dispenser if u need to get more water for free. It's fun to see mixture of land animals and sea creatures like dugong and some fishes. Definitely worth going if u go to singapore.
,,Great experience and learning journey for kids!,5.0,,"Fantastic place, great views and so up close with animals. The staff were also amazing. It rained when we were in the Amazon river ride. We were drenched and when we finished the ride the staff came with towels and made sure we were all good, especially our kids. We were very impressed!"
,,River safari day-out!,4.0,,Fun. But not much F&B seating areas. push cart does not accept cards only cash to buy food/drinks. =(
,,Fun and educational half day trip,4.0,,"My daughter and I recently visited the River Safari and had a fun and educational half day.

The park is a land based/ walking tour of the most famous rivers from around the world. Each river attraction has information, pictures, plants and animals from the specific river area. The walkway is almost completely covered and there is very limited exposure to direct sun. There are even a few air conditioned exhibits along the way.

The best attraction for my daughter was the panda exhibit. The manatee aquarium near the end is also impressive.
Definitely worth a trip, but you only need 2 to 3 hours to see everything."
,,River Surprise at River Safari,4.0,,Visited River Safari with Hong Kong friends in town with a 6 years old child. Lots of fishes and other river mammals in tanks to see at this attraction. There were lots of monkeys in safe closures to get up and close to. Best moments was seeing Pandas Kaikai and JiaJia in their enclosure area. Get ready to walk around this attraction for 2-3hrs to complete the whole attraction. Lots of sheltered and air-conditioned areas throughout to stay cool.
,,Panda Bear,5.0,,"Caught the MRT and shuttle bus from Krahbi station to the park. Very easy to get to and from using this mode of transport.

Park is next to the Zoo, so would be easy to do both attractions together.

Park is well set out and the highlight was the Panda Bears, squirrel monkeys and Manatees.

Would recommend taking a snack as there is not really anywhere to eat inside. Starbucks is located just outside the exit and there are other eateries near the ticket office.

River Cruise was only about 15 minutes and was pleasant but not fantastic. We did not do the other boat trip as this was an additional charge and appeared to be for children as we did not see too many adults do this.

A nice way to spend a few hours."
,,Interesting trip,4.0,,Kids had fun. More highlights of the Zoo fr d boat ride would be better. Kids could only see d girrafe n rhino.
,,Good Day,5.0,,This is a very well looked after wildlife reserve. Could be called a fresh water aquarium. Well worth a visit.
,,Raise knowledge and recommend opportunities to experience,5.0,,"The park is not large but exquisite. The aquarium is clean, and the layout is very original.Our family likes Amazon drifting very much.There is a small touch pool, the staff is very professional."
,,There are better places to visit if you are on a short trip to Singapore,3.0,,"If you are on a short trip to Singapore , this would be one of the places i would suggest that you can skip. I assume that one would definitely visit the S.E.A aquarium and the singapore zoo, if that is the case you can skip this river safari. The only thing i liked in this place was the 2 cute Panda that they have. Other than that it was was waste of time"
,,Very good,4.0,,"In the river safari there are lots of animals for example pandas, fish, electrical eel and more. Also it’s has a roof but the roof is not on top of all the places that means you might get very hot. River safari is very hot and there are not enough fans but you might argue that there is an AC although the pathway doesn't have an AC."
,,Asia’s first and only river-themed wildlife park,3.0,,"It’s just outside the Singapore zoo. River Safari is Asia’s first and only river-themed wildlife park inspired by the world’s most iconic rivers.

The best was watching the giant panda, the largest aquarium and the ride on the Amazon River quest. Kindly skip the boat ride as it was too short and nothing special.

Recommended Tour Duration: 1 hour

Opening Time: 10 AM to 7 PM"
,,Great day out,4.0,,"I really enjoyed this zoo with the experience of wildlife and aquariums . The panda experience was excellent. Did not think much of the boat ride but rest of park made up for this . Otter enclosure was fun along with watching the graceful manatees .
Have now visited several times and enjoyed each time ."
,,Birthday outing,4.0,,My girl enjoyed herself very much whenever we visited any of the wildlife Parks. She loves the Amazon rides and the staff are very friendly and warm despite have to work under our humid hot weather!
,,Ricer Safari,5.0,,One of the best wild life attractions in Singapore it is better than the Zoo we relay enjoy the surrounding and the fish species at here. Amazon River Quest you must visit it one little boat trip here not much animal but it is enjoyable and the other boat safari is a just a boat safari if you had done a good boat tour plz do not do it. for me it's waist of time but other area are nicely arrange and super clean as you know bout Singapore is. we will definitely revisit this. please by tickets for tour agent it is cheaper than the stall here.
,,One trick pony,3.0,,"This is the quickest and least interesting of the 3 Singapore Zoo products. I would say 90% come just for the pandas. They are in a nice aircon exhibit and you do get relatively close with chance of a good photo. Used to be a fantastic deal when the pandas were part of the regular zoo.

The rest are pretty standard with various types of river fish and animals. The piranhas are another highlight along with a big crocodile.

The cruise on Mandai lake / reservoir is forgettable. The Amazon River cruise is really not worth the extra charge. Very brief with some sights of monkeys, tapir, capybara and a Jaguar of they aren't all hiding. We got drenched as the tour went on during a down pour.

So, if the kids have seen everything else in the zoo system and you really want to see the pandas then go ahead.

Ps. It is near impossible to get a taxi home if it rains. We have experienced this a few times. Luckily we have our own transport this time.

The rest"
,,Good experience!,3.0,,It was a nice experience.Panda and the giraffe exhibits were great. Other were nice as well. It does involve a lot of walking and keep at least 2-3 to cover the place.
,,Really well done attraction,5.0,,"My 15 year old nephew & I visited the river safari yesterday. Had a wonderful time seeing the giant pandas, white tiger, cheetah and other animals. The boat ride has a staff guide that points out the animals as you float down the river. We spent the majority of our time at the pandas and the sea otter exhibits. The otters were so playful and you can watch them from underneath a see-through dome. We really enjoyed this attraction."
,,Kmpressive,5.0,,Go midweek. We had no queues for anything. Walked right in. Don’t bother with the Reservoir cruise. Definitely do Amazon quest. Great for young kids as you see the animals up close. This is a welcome break half way through the zoo. You walk in one direction around the safari. It is so well laid out and informative. Not too big. Just right and we spent about two hours there. The pandas were a highlight!
,,Great addition to the Mandai wildlife attractions,4.0,,Got to get really close up to the squirrel monkeys in the enclosed area. The Amazon River Quest boat ride was slightly disappointing as quite a number of the showcased animals were taking shelter in the afternoon heat and not clearly visible.
,,Panda’s was the highlight,4.0,,Always picking a zoo when traveling with the children and this time we went for the River Safari because we wanted to see their Pandas. Really worth going there 🐼
,,Average experience with very poor boat rides,3.0,,"Boat rides too short and nothing special. In fact, couldnt even hear the commentary on the River Cruise and you have to pay extra for the Amazon one which is nothing special although more fun than the first.

And why are the Pandas in the River Safari and not the main Zoo Park? Perhaps so that visitors have to pay to enter in to a second park to see them.............????????"
,,Pandas were the highlight,4.0,,Visited here after the Zoo. Next door but quite different. Enjoyed the Amazon River Quest (twice!) but had to wait for the river cruise which was dull. Highlight was the pandas.
,,Pandas were my favourite!,5.0,,"Nice - mostly fish and water animals (as the name implies) but had a few monkeys and obviously the pandas! Only saw one panda and sadly the red panda was asleep when we went, but the panda Kai Kai (I think) was very active. The panda exhibit was chilled (which was a nice break halfway while walking through the rest of the park in the heat). Spent 2-3 hours with a group of young adults. Tried the starfish petting area, the river cruise (caught a glimpse of rhinos and giraffes from the zoo). Really nice afternoon here."
,,loved it!!,5.0,,"great place..!! its a leisurely walk and most of it is covered on semi indoors.. the river cruise is a 15mins cruise, a good time to sit and see the scenic views ahead not many animals to see though.. but its a pleasant ride.. A must do is the Amazon river Quest, that's alot of fun.. a 15min ride along a curvy and bumpy river ride but u get to see many animals on either side of the boat. kids below 100cm at strictly not allowed.
Panda viewing was great .... Kids had alot of fun touching the starfish etc.. Don't run through any of the wild life reserves take your time see, read and enjoy.. that's the while point. All parks are child friendly !!"
,,Intetesting,5.0,,Provide at least 2 hours to enjoy this attraction. The three highlights for this attraction are the two river boat rides and the pandas exhibition. The entire attraction is under shelter; therefore you do not have to worry about whether it rains or shines.
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,We went Monday afternoon and thankfully it was not crowded. Quite informative and educational. We zipped through in a little over 2 hours but would recommend 3 hours if you have the time. The highlight is the Pandas
,,So much to see and so well laid out.,5.0,,"Adults with or without kids can enjoy this amazing park. It is laid out so that the entire thing flows in one direction. There is a boat ride and pay the extra 5 dollars for the Amazon River Cruise because it was neat. We were there for 3 hours and saw everything. Well worth the afternoon. It is 95% covered, which was good because it rained most of the time. Lots of fans around if it is hot and/or humid. Well worth it for the Panda Bears, Spider Monkeys, and Manatees."
,,Calming and Refreshing River Safari,5.0,,"Love, love, love the River Safari !!! The highlight for me was the amazing Manatee exhibit. Just so relaxing to watch these gentle giants swimming so gracefully. You get to watch them at different levels based on the design of the tank! The red panda is also wonderful and usually so active but the sole red panda looked distressed at my last visit. Missing its parrtner?"
,,A good glimpse into nature,4.0,,"It was nicely grouped into 'zones' where we can teach geography to our young children. The pandas and manatees are awesome. You can also get up close to the squirrel monkeys.Go early and you get to see the otters dance around in their pond.

The Amazon quest was a little bit of a letdown, we didnt manage to see alot of the animals bit it could be bcoz its mid afternoon and very hot.

They also provide shuttle services from khatib mrt to the place for sgd1. Departs every 20 mins."
,,"Excellent, and not just because of the pandas.",5.0,,"We've been around numerous zoos, so we wanted to do something slightly different. In addition one of the main reasons for our visit was to see the pandas.

The “River Safari” is great. We thought it was very well laid out, and that the animals on display were a good mix of the “normal” and the more unusual (including several species, we've never seen before in a zoo). Leaving aside the pandas the manatees were the major attraction (absolutely mesmerising to be honest).

Now the pandas, they have a purpose build air conditioned enclosure. We've seen pandas in around half a dozen zoos throughout the world, and this is by far the best facilities of any. Maybe we were lucky, maybe we were willing to wait for 15 mins, but we saw both pandas extensively (primarily eating bamboo, but not just this).

We didn't do the boat trip, it seems somewhat superfluous, something that a number of other comments support.

I would add, that this isn't really a river safari, its a walk (of around 1km) through the various exhibits (many of which are in air conditioned enclosures – they feel the heat/humidity as well!)

If you only want a normal zoo, then the zoo ticket is probably for you, if you want something different (plus the pandas) this is the one to do.

Excellent, and not just because of the pandas"
,,Adorable Kai Kai & Jia Jia,3.0,,"It was my second visit to river safari and so glad to be able to see both pandas face to face. During my first visit, I only saw the backview of one and the other panda was nowhere in sight. Both pandas look adorable, lazing there, eating their bamboo and leaves. Despite their laziness, they will move away when the sun starts shining on them. The enclosure is air-conditioned and very comfortable in Singapore’s hot and humid weather."
,,"Interesting,Informative and liked the flow of layout",4.0,,"Our first time to do the River Safari and found it interesting and kept you on the look out for what was around the next corner. Loved the variety of animals on the walk, on the river though there is very little to be seen, nothing to keep your attention. The information and displays were very good and the staff we encountered were energetic and enthusiastic. I loved the variety of Panda bears, they are oh so cute. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Good place to go with Kids,4.0,,"- We went to River safari (mainly for our small grand child) and enjoyed it. We booked the ticket on line (combined ticket for Zoo and river Safari)
-The boat ride in the river is not great and was just a simple boat ride without much to see during the ride.
-The other attractions were very good; Various large size fish kept in huge tanks was a sight to see
-Of course the main attraction was 'Jia Jia ' and 'Kai Kai' the two famous Pandas kept here. When we went (Jan 2018) it was not not very crowded and there was no waiting line .There is also a small red Panda in this area.
-We did not take the Amazon River Ride ' as we had a small kid with us.
-Many interesting varieties of fish, turtles, and various other animals are kept nicely in the safari.
-Very well organised,informative, and an enjoyable place to go particularly for children.
-One among the must see places while at Singapore, with kids."
,,A very interesting and informative visit,4.0,,We took the MRT to Khatib and the the shuttle bus (S$1) to the River Safari and got there as it opened. Included in the entrance are walking trails where you see animals like primates and manatees (underwater and above) and a reservoir boat ride where we didn't see any animals at all. You pay extra for the Amazon River Ride but it's worth it as it's fun and there are lots of animals to see. We took the ride twice as they weren't very busy. Children have to be a minimum height for this ride. Because we arrived early we almost had the place to ourselves and were able to get on the Reservoir boat and Amazon River rides straight away without queuing. We were there about 2-3 hours.
,,Great Afternoon at River Safari,5.0,,The Pantagonia Mara was something new to see in the Squirrel Monkey Forest:). It was a nice afternoon and even though it was during the local school holidays..it was not over crowded which made it a very pleasant visit. Great walk through at River Safari.
,,Here for the pandas. Reservoir cruise was boring.,4.0,,"As its name suggests, the River Safari is a river-themed zoo and aquarium, located between the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari. If rivers do not fascinate you, there are two pandas located in the River Safari (which was really the main highlight for me).

1. Themes

The River Safari's attractions are categorised by major rivers of the world. For example, there are zones named Mississippi River, Yangtze River, Mekong River etc.

You can see animals such as catfishes, alligator snapping turtles etc. in tanks, both small and large.

Leaving aside the Giant Panda Forest, one of the more impressionable zones was the Amazon Flooded Forest. Here, we got to see, amongst other animals, the manatees and giant river otters.

The manatees are large animals and it was quite a sight seeing them swim. As for the pair of otters, one moment they were sunbathing on the bank, the next moment they were diving into the water demonstrating their excellent swimming skills.

2. Pandas

Of course, the pandas deserve a separate mention. Do note that it can get pretty chilly in this section as the bio dome is kept at a cool 16 - 24 degrees to simulate the pandas' natural climate.

The first animal that you see upon entering the Giant Panda Forest is not the famous pandas, but the red panda. At first sight, the red panda looks nothing like the lazy black and white pandas. This particular red panda was very active and hopping from one branch to the other.

Although we did not manage to see the famous pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia the first time we walked past their enclosures, we waited for a while before walking back because there was no way I was going to miss seeing the pandas at the River Safari.

It was exciting seeing the pandas in real life.

3. Reservoir Cruise

There is a Reservoir Cruise which you can board for free. They suspended the cruise when it was raining and resumed it when the rain stopped.

This was a cruise along the upper Seletar Reservoir and honestly, boring. We got to see a giraffe and rhinoceros at the ride. The guide also passed around some giraffe poo which attracted some curious looks from tourists. I would rather they skip passing the giraffe poo around because most people were either not interested or did not know what it was.

It was a nice, slow boat ride, where we got to enjoy some breeze. Other than that, there's nothing much to the reservoir cruise.

4. Amazon River Quest

There was also a Amazon River Quest right next to the Reservoir Cruise. It costs S$5 per adult and S$3 per child. You can purchase your tickets at the Boat Plaza. The signboard states that you should be prepared to be wet.

It was a good thing we were there on a weekday because there was totally no queue. There were a few mini roller-coasteresque drops but nothing too frightening. We sat in the middle and did not get wet but do not know whether those sitting at the front or back would get wet- if this is a concern, you should speak to the guides before purchasing your tickets. This gave some thrill factor to the River Safari, although rather insignificant, as the ride was short.

If you do not take this boat ride, you would not be able to see some animals, such as the Caribbean flamingos, capybaras, black howler monkeys and jaguars etc. Some of the animals had gone into hiding so we did not see them.

5. Food

The price of food at Mama Panda Kitchen is pretty decent and reasonable. I tried the Chicken and Mushroom Bamboo Rice ($9.90) - nothing too gourmet, but decent. The Panda Chocolate Custard Bao (S$2.90) would also delight children.

6. Planning your trip

The walkways are covered so this can be a wet weather activity (except that you may not be able to sit the rides if there is bad weather).

That said, there are a number of activities which are scheduled at certain timings. If you want to catch those, I suggest that you download the map which states the timings of these activities.

There are hydration points around and you can save the earth and money by bringing your own water bottle.

As it may be slightly cold in the panda dome, do bring along a light jacket if you are not comfortable with a temperature of 16-24 degrees."
,,Wildlife and aquarium and Amazon log boat ride fun,4.0,,"Went mid afternoon to the River Safari via a coach pick up from hotel. Unfortunately driver was late, drove very slow and we got there half an hour later than meant to, hence our time was cut very short at the end. Probably better to organise own way there to send time and not be rushed. Needs about 2-3 hours to see all. The Amazon log ride is fun. The other boat ride was totally not worth it as saw nothing! Really enjoyed the aquarium and the monkeys. Good day for a younger family more than couples."
,,ok,3.0,,"If you like to see the Pandas and have to beat some time do it. Be careful that they do not charge you for the rather boring ""reservoir cruise"" (says ""ride"" on the ticket), rather do the Amazon River Quest instand. Tickets therefore can be bought insode for 5 S$ per adult."
,,Amazing to see the Pandas,4.0,,"My reason for booking the river safari was the opportunity to see the Pandas, it was a fantastic experience to see them, they are beautiful animals. I wouldn't bother paying the extra for the boat trip as there isn't much point as you are on the lake maximum 15 mins and all you see are trees, there isn't much point to it and should be free."
,,Perfect trip,5.0,,Me and my kids really had alot of fun. We loved the amazon boat ride. Bt unfortunately tge birthday boy was under the height limit and he could nt go.
,,Very educational,4.0,,"Nice place for young kids. Hardly see any zoo or safari with river theme.the boat ride was a disappointment. We were so excited to see the panda but they were hiding , can only see the butt."
,,Don't miss Amazon river quest,4.0,,Very beautiful and informative time about rivers and it's habitats worldwide. Particularly best is Amazon river quest which is ultimate
,,Not as good as everyone says,2.0,,"We were looking forward for the trip but it was a big disappointment. Not much to see and the cruise is basically a 5 minutes boat ride with nothing to see and no fun.

Without telling us beforehand, they actually charge us for another ride. The amazon ride. Good way to ask for more money.

Was it a good ride? Not really. Overall, it was a big disappointment. Won't come back for the second time"
,,Nice place,5.0,,"This place shows you the life of all kind of sea animals plus the animals live near the sea and The Panda, I go there especially to see the panda."
,,Unexpected great day out,5.0,,"I really enjoyed my day at the River Safari and would recommend it to anyone.

Booking tickets online was easy, and we took advantage of discounts for young people and senior citizens.

Upon arrival, the systems had been designed well to read the bar code from a phone screen without any problems.

The River Safari is easy to navigate around with clear sign posts and easily recognisable staff.

We found plenty to see and talk about, but the highlights were the pandas (and their aircon!) and the free boat ride

We wanted to go on the Amazon River Quest but there's a minimum height for children (1 metre I think) but one of our group was 4 and just a little below that; I was pleased to see this rule enforced for safety reasons."
,,Much more thsan expected,5.0,,"The name ""River Safari"" is very misleading. You can go on a short cruise around the lake (and see almost no wildlife), but the main attraction is the walk past many underwater tanks, or aquariums, almost a mini ""SeaWorld"". Then on to see many animals in a zoo - like experience. As all the walkways are covered, it's an ideal trip in the rain. You could easily spend at least 2 hours here.

One of the highlights for us was seeing the two Giant Pandas.

If you are going on the Night Safari, this is an ideal tour to take beforehand."

,,Wildlife experience along the river trail,5.0,,The atmosphere makes me feel like I'm along the river in the wild. We get to see animals that are really living by the river that we may not notice at a glance. The keepers are friendly and the overall experience is awesome! Definitely will visit again.
,,"Educational, relaxing, wet weather ok",5.0,,"The River Safari is right next to the Singapore Zoo. If you are planning a two-day trip to the zoo, you can spend the second part of your second day at the River Safari. I believe 3-4 hours at the River Safari will suffice, unless you are the type to read through everything in great deal.
Signages are written in simple language, suitable for children.
There is also a touch pond, a river cruise ferry ride (included in ticket price) and an amazon river quest ($5 for adults and $3 for kids) - a simple boat ride that lets you view animals , comes with 3 small slides along the way, minimum height 1.06 m.
Many areas are sheltered, some enclosures are air-conditioned. So if you encounter wet weather, this is a good place to spend the day.
Although there aren’t any shows to watch, as compared to the zoo, there are some animals encounters where you can get up close to the animals being showcased."
,,"A bit different, worth a look",4.0,,"This is separate from the main zoo, and mainly features fish and some marine animals and animals that live by the rivers. Divided into different river areas it wasn't always the clearest to follow especially if you're with children who don't want to stop to read all the info boards. The boat ride around the reservoir is nice and relaxing but you don't see that much, it's about 15 minutes long. The Amazon ride is worth the little bit extra you have to pay.
* The Giant Pandas are a highlight, as are the Manatee's.
It felt a little bit like a way to get extra money from tourists, if you get a Four Park ticket it's worth going, but if you're short on time it's the least exciting of the zoos."
,,why the need to seperate from Singapore Zoo?,3.0,,"I have seen the SIngapore Zoo many times and i am dissappointed with the river safari. If the highlight are the pandas, then why didn't we see them? i same one peek from the ""cave"", stayed a bit at he branch and then went in again. the other one was a no show. we saw lots of fishes, some croxs, a small anaconda, some monkeys too. but that's it. some of the animals were previously found in the main zoo. this place can be seen 2 hours tops. food was expensive. so few to see for 30 sgd. the plus was the complimentary wheelchair for those who has mobility issues."
,,it was amazing!!,3.0,,"it was fun especially if you go with the right people. went there twice with different group of friends. altho the first visit was alittle disappointing as the pandas were asleep, the second visit was amazing as my main purpose was to see the pandas and fortunately both awake & get to see them."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Located just beside the singapore zoo and night safari, this place is a must visit and more safe for wet weather conditions."
,,Amazing and Unique Exhibits! Includes Pandas!,5.0,,"This review is for the River Safari, 1 of 4 parks comprising the Singapore Zoo.

The River Safari is a unique type of exhibit. Think of it like an aquarium, except it also includes the river bank and the plants and trees above the water - from all over the world. Most of the exhibits are stunning - they allow you to see both the life IN the water as well as on the banks. I spent about 2.5 hours and I wish I had more time to read all the signs and learn more about the different rivers.

The River Safari for some reason includes pandas. The exhibit is unique - it is indoors, air conditioned, and you kind of walk through/over the enclosure, so you get a lot of panda viewing opportunities if they're awake/active. On the day I went, the panda was quite playful - walking around and climbing around a big tree branch.

DON'T do the the River Safari / Reservoir Tour. I spent 40 minutes in a hot line to get a 15 minute boat ride around the reservoir and saw ZERO animals. Super disappointing.

DO the Amazon River Quest, which is the only way to see some of the animals such as the Jaguar."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,"Clean, good organization, good service. Panda is there, so cute, we like him very much and believe the other kids will be happy to visit the zoo, Amazon river safari is a good idea but very few animals, it will be a great journey with more animals."
,,Excellent attraction to Relax and Enjoy,5.0,,"River safari with cruise was one of the most enjoying and relaxing time with family. Furthermore, visiting Pandas were a very rare and excellent life experience."
,,Great mapping,4.0,,The trail laid out for the visitors are great. It was done in such a way one can never missed out any exhibit or highlights.
,,A Must Do,5.0,,If it was to see the two pandas alone it would be worth it. But there is so much more to see. 3 hours is neded Our 6 year old son was just tall enough to be alowed on the River Amazon Boat Ride. If he had not been allowed it would have been a big dissapointment to have to cope with as a parent.
,,Great trip,5.0,,"This is walk through various fish & reptile displays and includes 2 boat trips. We thought the resevior tour was disapointing, but the other boat trip was great. The hi-light for us was seeing the Giant Pandas!! All of the animals have lots of room and live in great enviroments."
,,Enjoyable evening,5.0,,"Visiting the panda sanctuary is the best part of the experience. Also enjoyed the river cruise, but missed the Amazon part due to having a toddler."
,,A must visit if you are in Singapore,4.0,,An exciting place to visit when you are in Singapore. Take your camera with you. Such a nice experience if you spend a half day here with your friends and family
,,Don’t waste tour time!,2.0,,"It was totally not worh it, boat ride is really boring, if you want to use river safari you have to pay more! And you will find out about it only later after you bought ticket, someone says that is worth for the pandas, well yes we saw pandas, pandas back, they were sleeping so we saw almost nothing."
,,Was worth the visit.,5.0,,"We spent a morning here, don't waste your time doing the boat trip, that is a complete non event, to be honest could not see the point of it, so glad we didn't have to line up for it or I would have been rather annoyed. The Amazon Cruise is a lot more interesting and work doing. The spider monkeys are adorable so time it for the feeding. All the feedings are good, as was the little talk which was both informative and entertaining. Its beautifully maintained and clean. We had an unexpected bonus of some monkeys up to some monkey business!! haha."
,,Good collection of fish,4.0,,First of all you need atleast half a day to enjoy this place. We landed there to see the anaconda being fed a chicken which was totally cool to watch. The amazon river quest is a boat ride and a number of animals can be seen on both sides of the river. The stingrays in the aquarium are magnificent. There are huge hippo kind of mammals is huge aquariums. We went there at their feeding time and it was awesome to watch them. They let you touch starfish and crabs under supervision. There are two pandas enjoying their naps in the safari.
,,Not quite as good as the Zoo,4.0,,The River Safari is nice but not quite as good as the zoo. The Pandas are an obvious draw card. The manatee tank is exceptional. The giant otters are awesome. Found the ride pretty underwhelming which was a shame because it obviously cost a bomb. Glad it was part of a package deal.
,,Always enjoyed it,5.0,,"I like the River Safari because it is a place that is completely sheltered, so that no weather (unless a tornado or something) will affect you. Well, not 100%, if you are reading this, River Safari, there is one part with the LARGEST Crocodile which requires you to stand in the sun (or rain) and I had to miss that because it was raining very heavily. I only saw the tail of croc from very far away. A shelter will be nice. Just a suggestion.

The rest of it, there are fantastic fishes, some pretty huge. Most of them I am very happy and feel really relax watching them swim and spending a day to chill. However, let me make another suggestion here. There is a tank with huge fishes, I can't remember, but there are african arowana I believe. There is definitely something wrong with the tank. I saw all the fins of the fishes bitten and torn. I suspect there are fighting (maybe due to over-crowding?). I suggest you take a look at it and make some change. No point to make them suffer for our enjoyment.... Shelf them apart or something if necessary. It pains me to see that.

But other than that, all is cool. The pandas are happy and feeding away when I was there and I think the climate control must had been quite some effort, especially in a tropical country like Singapore. I also enjoyed the panda buns, although the price is a bit on the high side, but its nothing to be surprised about at a tourist spot.

I must mention the manatees because that is my favorite spot and I literally can spend the whole day watching them swim (or kind of float effortlessly), feeding and playing. It makes you realized there are still great creatures like these sharing our planet with us and we need to do what we can positively. I had donated quite a bit overseas in the conversations for manatee and visiting the River Safari makes me feel its all worth it. Truly majestic creatures. I wondered if swimming with them is an option, without introducing stresses and all. If it is, I am really interested.

A great day and I think if most people think the River Safari is like a zoo, well they really need to come experience it to understand it."
,,Do not miss this if you go to the zoo,5.0,,This attraction is next to the zoo and so much quieter. We enjoyed the 15 minute ride along the river to see the wildlife. Then the canoe ride by the side of the animals. The best exhibit for me were the delightful giant pandas. It is fun to visit and quite a bit of shaded exhibits from the sun.
,,Terrible toilet condition,1.0,,"I came on a sat afternoon 2pm with my family. Visited the toilet with my toddler. Diaper changing room’s diapers bin was full. Fine. We went to the public toilet, family cubicle. Condition was as bad and smelly. Bins were not cleared."
,,Nice system,5.0,,"Love the walk here, very easy, enter point A and exit point B. No other way, just follow the ""trail""."
,,Getting to know freshwater ecosystems,4.0,,"With its entrance right beside that of the Singapore Zoo, the River Safari is a smaller park that also focuses on wildlife, but in a themed way: the wildlife of rivers. You enter the River Safari at one end and follow the path (which is covered all through, thus making it possible to do on a rainy day—something we were glad of, since it rained all through the day on the day we visited).

The path traces the ecology of several major rivers of the world, through—of course—specimens of the marine fauna of the area—along with other interesting bits of information (like trivia: the Amazon, for instance, dumps as much water in the sea everyday as the Murray—Australia’s largest river—dumps in a year). The rivers that form the focus of the River Safari include the Congo, Mississippi, Ganges, Nile, Amazon, Mekong, Yangtze and Mary.

As you walk along, you see all manner of interesting creatures, both in the water and out: electric eels, stingrays, piranhas, tiger fish, emperor tamarins (monkeys so named because their drooping white moustaches resemble the whiskers of Chinese emperors); spider monkeys (these have their own enclosure, the Spider Monkey Forest, which you enter after making sure you’ve packed away any food and drink); and more. There are turtles, there’s a special section where you can touch starfish and horseshoe crabs (after and before washing your hands at the wash basins beside this!), and there’s a huge tank with lots of manatees and other massive freshwater fish and mammals.

Two other attractions are part of this: one is a fifteen minute boat ride over the reservoir that lies beside the River Safari; the other is the Amazon River Conquest. The latter, on the day we visited, happened to be closed, so we were told that we could use the S$13 for it that was part of our park ticket to buy anything of equal value either at the souvenir shops or the River Safari’s own eateries (not the external eateries, like Starbucks or Ben & Jerry’s). This we did, purchasing a cute book about giant pandas for our toddler.

The river cruises were delayed for a while because of heavy rain, but once the rain eased off a bit, they restarted, so we went on a cruise. This is a short one—a little too short—but it’s still fun.

All in all, an enjoyable experience, and informative as well. Plus, since it isn’t as huge as the zoo, it’s also easier to do and takes less time. And—unlike the zoo, which is open to the skies in most places—this is covered, so can be done even when it’s raining."
,,Go to see the Pandas & the Amazon River Quest,5.0,,"Upon entering the premises- it looked like another version of SEA Aquarium at Sentosa, I was glad to have read reviews so I knew what we needed to see/do.
1. See the Pandas (made me super happy!)
2. River Safari Cruise - 15 mins ride. Nothing exciting but we liked the fact that you can see some animals in the zoo while cruising. We didn't have to wait for the boat as we went on a weekday. Don't go on weekends.
3. Amazon River Quest - 10mins ride. Aside from the pandas- this is probably the highlight. It felt like cruising along a rainforest while you spot some of the animals like the Brazilian tapir, jaguar etc.

You can do this in 2.5 hours so it's best to go around 2-3pm before you proceed to the night safari which is right next door."
,,"If you somehow got the tickets free, then go",3.0,,"Made up of mainly fishes & fishes & fishes
Main protagonist ( THE PANDAS )
Followed by what 2nd best the huge manatees.
2 kind of cruise available
-River Safari Cruise
Boring 15mins ride, I would say ride if your legs are tired but waiting time 20-30mins most of the time
-Amazon River Quest $5/adult $3/child>1.06m
10mins ride, if you paid to come in just pay the extra $5 to ride this. This is what deemed by many as the ‘main attraction’

Good place to relax is Amazon Flooded Forest basically a dark cave-like with limited seats to enjoy views of manatees, catfishes and other fishes again

Only one restaurant inside which sells mostly Chinese food (non-halal) because of the panda. It is kind of like a panda theme restaurant with minimal design and some limited cute panda buns, latte and souvenir cups.

As the river safari, zoo and night safari are all located near each other (5-8mins walk), there are plenty of food options outside these parks.

Could be potentially boring to kids as well as there are no child’s play areas, big majestic animals and animals shows.

Go to only the Zoo if you have limited time in Singapore. 6 hours required at least for Singapore Zoo whereas the River Safari can be done in as little as 2.5hours."
,,Great view,3.0,,I have opted for night safari & river safari too wherein I ended up with some same sort of experience So I suggest either of them to save time & money cause they both give you the same experience
,,Fantastic collection of creatures.,4.0,,First-time experience at an international zoo so was awed by the variety of creatures on display in their almost natural habitats that must take quite a lot of maintenance. The manatees and pandas were the main attractions but I also liked the reptiles especially the interactive sessions with keepers and trainers. A half day required to see everything; tiring but worth the time and money.
,,Aqua Life,4.0,,Most important thing is to make enough time to stay in reading the information provided by the info bulletin boards/posters and make the tour more meaningful.
,,Fell in love with manatees,5.0,,"Just a stunning day out. I'm not really a 'zoo person' but this was exceptional. I got to experience animals I'd never encountered previously, such as pandas, but the manatees were mesmerising. I just couldn't tear myself away from them. Staff were wonderful and animal areas were outstanding. Best day out. Highly recommended."
,,Worth it if you've already done the Zoo and Night Safari,5.0,,"We had already done the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari on a previous visit. So we decided to give the River Safari a go and it was fabulous.

There was a rapid ride that I didn't expect and quite a bit to see. There was also a good gift shop. Everything was accessible for a stroller and it filled an afternoon."
,,Pleasantly Surprised,5.0,,"This was our 1st trip to RIVER SAFARI. I must say that my family and I was pleasantly surprised that it was such a nice place to visit. We had a wonderful time there and were very impressed with the displays,the set ups and also the flow path of moving along as we visit from start to finish was very well thought out. Will definitely recommend to all new visitors and we will be back soon to bring more family members to visit the place again."
,,River Safari,4.0,,"Do both of the River Safari. If you are reaching Zoo in Morning, Do zoo first and River safari and night safari."
,,River Safari,2.0,,"We only visited the night safari and the river safari, because we thought these two are the most interesting attraction out of the 4 zoo. The river safari turned out not to be the best choice we made. For the interesting part (Amazon, which you can see on most of the pictures) you have to pay an additional fee! Not even included in the price... I don’t recommend this attraction unless you‘re really keen on visiting every zoo in the city."
,,Great displays but won’t fill a full day,4.0,,"As with the other Singapore zoos it is great. Smaller than the rest it didn’t fill the full day. We went from 10 until around 2.

The giant river otter and manatee area was a favourite. We lover the Amazon river ride too. Our son is mad keen on Jaguars so we paid to do it again. All of the other displays are really well done. I don’t know why the only way you get to see the beavers was to be around for a show at the end of the day.

Well done Panda area too. Much better than anything else I have seen in Asia."
,,Great day out with a relaxing and lovely boat ride,5.0,,"This was our first visit to the River Safari with the kids and it was great! It's an easy stroll around the park and you get to see Pandas close up too! They also have 2 boat ride options, both of which were fun- one is more like that of an amusement park (amazon river quest) where you're in a ride-type of boat and you go through different small areas where you try to spot the animals and the other is like a lovely relaxing river cruise (river safari cruise) where you pass by Singapore Zoo so can also see the giraffes from there! I found we enjoyed this more than the Night Safari as it was much less crowded and easier to walk around. The animals are different though so worth getting the Park Hopper pass to see all the different zoos!"
,,Lovely,5.0,,"A great add on when visiting the Zoo. Worth the money, the Panda's where so cute and the way the park is set out is great as well. I got the 2 park hopper, so I could go between the Zoo and the River Safari. It is well set out and a nice way to spend the day. It will be good in 2020 when they will have one big park which will include the Zoo and this."
,,Average - why not just one zoo?,3.0,,Average - why not just one zoo? - to me it should be part of the main zoo. You need to go here to see the Pandas - only filled a around 2 hours and we spend some time eating a snack for dinner. Food was very average and was expensive for what it was.
,,Nothing fascinating,3.0,,Its just next to Singapore zoo but Nothing fascinating about it as you can see animals from far off only
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,It is in the same vicinity as the zoo ... A very different experience though .. some exotic river animals of the world are here to be seen .. There is also a cruise where you get to see a lot of animals from the nearby zoo .. a must visit
,,Pretty Good!,4.0,,We enjoyed ourselves at this park for the most part. The boat ride is worthless.....they play a recording that includes rhinos but that part was under construction. The river ride is nice however we were told that even though there is no one waiting to get on again we had to exit the ride and walk all the way around to ride again. Strange rule. The pandas and manatees were our favorites!
,,Amazing and an escape from the Singapore heat,5.0,,"This was a truly wonderful experience and we saw creatures that we have never laid eyes on despite visiting countless other zoos and aquariums around the world. A wonderful, simple to follow layout with almost all of the ‘up close and personal’ enclosures undercover, so rain wasn’t an issue. We enjoyed this experience far more than the more famed zoo next door and would certainly advocate for River Safari as a relaxing and eye opening way to spend a few hours. Highlights: manatees tank, otters and anacondas."
,,A nice family day out.,4.0,,"I bought my tickets via Qoo10 Singapore website or apps at sgd 20 per adult and sgd 12 per kid. It includes entrance fee as well as the Amazon river quest cruise which is chargeable. In all, I paid only sgd 64 for a family of 4 for a day out at River Safari. If u were to purchase the same tickets at the counter, it would cost u sgd 116 (sgd 30 per adult, sgd 20 per kid, sgd 5 per adult for river quest cruise, sgd 3 per kid for river quest cruise).

Redemption of tickets were easy.
The staff at the river safari were very helpful too.
So I would highly recommend u to purchase ur tickets via qoo10.

Honestly, it is a pretty small park. U can finish the whole park within 3 hours if there is no long q for the free cruise (which is a complete waste of time) and the amazon river quest cruise.

Bcos the free cruise is a complete waste of time, I would suggest to skip it. Heres why. If u r lucky, u will get to see from afar 2 animals from the Singapore zoo - rhinocero and giraffe. Otherwise, u get to see only the giraffe. Other than that, u see mangroves. I wasted 15 mins queuing for the cruise and another 15 mins for the ride looking at the difference between a human hair and a giraffe as well as an upclose and personal look at the giraffe's poop.

I personally would rather spend more time on the shows as well as the river quest cruise which is situated right beside the free cruise.

Although the ride is a bit fast, u can always q again for a re ride. Q clears pretty fast so I went for my second. I could go for the third but it started to drizzle and so I left. My kids had the best time at this station.

The park is very well kept. Aquariums are clean and clear and it's very informative. I've learnt a lot seriously...

We stopped by the panda restaurant for their signature bun. $2.90 for a bun and I think it's reasonably given its size and cute appearance. Taste wise... erm... I don't like it.

I thought the food is not as expensive as compared to the normal standard of Singapore given that this is a tourist attraction. However, stay away from its coffee. It's sgd 5.50 for a cup of black coffee with sugar. I might as well get my dose from Starbucks located at the entrance.

All in all, I enjoyed my day at the park but would not go back again any time soon.

Cheers!"
,,Perfect even on a rainy day,5.0,,"When we arrived the zoo, it was pouring. But we are glad to find out the river safari has a completely sheltered walkway. The experience with the fishes and manatees was great. We saw one of the pandas climbed down to chew on bamboos. Super adorable!"
,,Family outing on a rainy day,4.0,,"The park is relatively smaller compare to the main zoo. However, it is mostly under shelter which helps to keep you away from the sun and rain. On the other hand, the day when we visited River Safari, it was raining heavily. Both boat rides were cancelled."
,,good safari must do,5.0,,"Singapore having so many safaris mist people would be in two minds weather to do or not.
but i liked it.so did our kids.
specially the panda enclosure .jia panda.
the boat ride was good wirh informative talk audio guide.
however the amazon ride was best thrilling and fun for kids.
must do activity in singapore"
,,River Safari,5.0,,Great experience to view and know about a number of aquatic species and great to see how well they are kept there in a natural like environment.
,,"Fun visit, even on a rainy day",4.0,,"Best sections were the manatees and the river ride, because you could see the fish and animals up close.
The pandas were a disappointment though as the male was curled up and asleep while the female wasn't in her pen at the time of our visit. (Heard the best time to visit the pandas is around 4 pm when it's feeding time but we were there around 2 pm)
Unusually for a zoo, the walkways are covered so you can see most of the attractions without getting wet even during a storm."
,,Had a good time,4.0,,River Safari is for those who like to see the creatures of the sea. Children of all ages are very much going to enjoy this experience.
,,Enjoyable afternoon,5.0,,"Bought the 2 park ticket promo for my family which include River Safari and Singapore Zoo. We spent the morning in Singapore Zoo before heading over to River Safari. It was great fun, the exhibits were well spread out and everyone just wanted to see the Panda. Will visit again if there is another promotion on."
,,Very Excellent..i enjoyed every second.. beautiful animals &sea life.. very enjoyable,5.0,,"River safari is worth visiting.. it is a truly a fun way to realize that sealife is so beautiful & unique..River safari maintains the beautiful aquariums ,which i treasure in my hearts.. Go there with a positive mindset & you will receive those great happy vibrations! Thats how i fwlt"
,,Staff didn't take initiative to reduce the queuing time,3.0,,"Your staff at the river safari did not the initiative to quicken the queue at the petting station. I suggested to them to allow the next group of visitors to wash their hands first while existing visitors were still at the station, rather than only wash their hands after the previous visitors had left. This would save time for everyone as the queue was moving very slowly. Unfortunately they chose to ignore me and continued with their process.

Also when I feedback the barrier for the queue had dropped which resulted in the queue extending outside the station, the staff once again ignored me"
,,Well organise exhibit with good shading outdoors,4.0,,The exhibits route is well organised though I was surprised that it can be completed in 2 hours (was expecting a bigger area). Good balance of indoor and outdoor space with nice shading areas so it was not too hot. Was lucky to see both pandas!
,,River Ride,4.0,,"Nice round trip down the river as you see and learn about plants and animal habitat around the zoological park. Well covered subjects and artifacts about the various water animals, their origin and survivability in the current environment."
,,Great concept with logistic hickups,3.0,,4th time at the safari. Queuing for the show was messy. It caused us to miss the train which stops 1h hour before closure.
,,Not what you expect!!!,3.0,,"When you hear a name River Safari, you think that you will spend most of your time riding a boat. But, 95% of all spent time you will walk and only few minutes it will take to ride a boat! And even not on the river) there is no river, it looks more like a lake. Nevertheless, they have a really good zoo inside. But, people honestly don’t like to be fooled by the fake marketing."
,,Did not let us in,3.0,,"We bought the tickets for all the experiences together in river safari, but was not allowed to take the boat ride because we were late. They let us shop in the souvenir shop for the cost of the boat ride."
,,Great safari,4.0,,"The river safari adjoining the zoo is a small place. The amazon river quest was interesting. The boat ride was nice. It was a bit fast so not easy to spot the animals. The pandas, manatees were all great."
,,Great day out,4.0,,"We visited on Tuesday 2 January. We took the Red Circle to Khatib and then the Zoo Bus that leaves every 20mins. (Note the Zoo bus does not come up on the Citymapper App). We arrived about 10.45. We headed straight to the Pandas as we thought it might get crowded later on. There was zero queuing and we could stay as long as we wanted. We then took in a show (which the kids really like), went on the River Cruise which wasn't that good in terms of seeing any animals but was very pleasant in terms of having a nice sit down and relax. We then went on the Amazon River Cruise (extra fee payable) which was like an amusement park log ride. Again, zero queuing, and because it was so quiet they offered a re-ride for free.

We then went back outside the zoo for lunch (options are a bit limited) and then re-entered to walk around the zoo again more slowly. My kids loved it, but they really like aquariums. We left at about 4pm. A great day out if you have younger children. The manatees are very impressive and the walk through monkey exhibit was also great."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"A nice activity to do with young children. It wont change your life as some people are expecting and thus the bad reviews, but it is something that you will spend a couple of hours with pleasure."
,,"Great to see the Pandas, otherwise disappointing",3.0,,"We went especially to see the Pandas which was excellent. They have their own climate controlled large enclosure and while we were there, they were walking around and eating.
The rest of the zoo is ok, but if have just come from the main zoo next door, we found it a bit of an anticlimax. Get the tickets for the river float ride though, a good way to see the animals and rest tired feet"
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"We had a great day here as there's lots to see particularly if you're a lover of wildlife. They have Pandas which initially were sleeping (don't they always) but later we decided to go back and they were both very active, eating a fine lunch of bamboo and moving around a lot. Very worthwhile seeing. The park and grounds are very clean and cared for as indeed are the animals. A lovely day out."
,,Better,4.0,,It was much better then the first time i went. my son loves it there. Will definitely go again in days to come.
,,Better than expected.,5.0,,"I found the River Safari more interesting that the zoo. It is a fair bit smaller, so not as far to walk. There is plenty to see such as the giant panda, the red panda and the pool full of manatees. There are all sorts of other wildlife through out the park as well. The boat ride does not go for long, but it’s something different, and they do pass animal exhibits in the zoo.
There is one unfortunate side and that is the rude visitors. The staff don’t have to put up with people with poor attitude because of things like the rain. Be nice to the staff."
,,Couldn’t be worse than this,2.0,,"We have been to Singapore a number of times and like other attractions were really excited to go to this recently expanded attraction adjoining the zoo.

The river safari is a misnomer. There are a lot of exhibits in this attraction.

There is a 15 minute cruise which is rubbish to say the least. All that the river cruise is all about sitting in a boat and go around the river. The reptiles, animals they expect you to see are so small that you wouldn’t see them even otherwise. So all in all, it’s not at all worth it.

Yes, then there are exhibits with a lot of fishes and marine animals from rivers all around the world. This is definitely good and educational.

The pandas are good to watch. At first you may not see them because they are in their den. But just be patient and they will come out. Watching Kia Kia eat bamboo was amazing. The red panda is super cute. Best time to see them is they are being fed. Ask any staff for the time.

The pandas are the only reason to give a 2 star rating."
,,A must do,5.0,,We loved the River Safari! There was so much to see and do with a great variety of animals. The Amazon ride was a wonderful surprise and my kids loved it. Staff were helpful and friendly.
,,Great fun and educational,5.0,,"Great experience, covering the major rivers and wetlands of the world, as usual with Singapore, greatly presented, family friendly, exhibitions, displays etc. certainly worth a visit, and as for the panda bears, well thumbs up, they put on a great display."
,,Could add more varieties of aquatic creatures and attractions,3.0,,"Overall experience is good, description of various aquatic creatures is sufficient. However, the number of aquatic creatures and attractions is not sufficient to justify the price of tickets.. one could finish visiting this attraction in less than 2 hours.. if only this could be improved further.."
,,Pandas and manatees,4.0,,"The manatees have been moved from the zoo to their own huge enclosure here so if you are looking for manatees, they are here! Also pandas. If you get a chance, you should definitely talk to the panda keepers; they have a lot of information to share about the pandas and the attempts to breed them.
The safari ride was fun. Like a mini Jurassic Park ride (Universal Studios) with animals. No babies or pregnant women allowed on the ride (we had both in our party)."
,,Worst of the zoo attractions.,3.0,,"The River Safari is the poorest of the Singapore Zoo offerings. The manatees did save the rating being even lower and this is the only way you can get to see the zoo pandas and polar bear.

The first part of the visit is devoted to the various river themed aquaria. Unfortunately river fish are not a interesting as the marine counterparts and therefore it is a little lacklustre, particularly if you have seen crocodile in the wild.
The actual safari 'cruise' takes place on a glorified theme park ride, starting with a water splash. The trail is too fast and there is little time (if any) to spot the animals being described.
The latter part of the visit was markedly more interesting and you can watch otters playing with stones in their enclosure (and underwater), plus you get to meet the zoo's pandas (if they interest you at all) and the aged polar bear. I always feel polar bears have no place in zoos, particularly in the tropics, but this one is well cared for and appears happy and despite arthritis has outlived natural members of the group. It is doted on by staff and has its own air conditioned quarters and bed to help the aching joints!"
,,Lovely visit on a rainy day,4.0,,"80% undercover so the pouring rain wasn’t an issue, the only negative was the rain meant boat rides were not on so we missed seeing a few of the animals. The manatees and otters were great! The pandas were sleeping which was disappointing after a 30 min line up."
,,Waste of time,2.0,,It is really weak in comparison with other places at the zoo. Too expensive for the content. Boat tour is a shame for the zoo. I think It should be skipped.
,,Pandas!,5.0,,"A must go to place but only because of the pandas. The reality is that you are probably going to come here right after a visit to the zoo. Hence, in all likelihood, you will be tired. Also the only real reason to visit this park is the pandas. If you understand that and accept it, you will not be disappointed. When we went, there was no wait to see the pandas and you could spend ample time in the panda enclosure. We even got to see the reclusive one!
It is quite clear that the pandas have been strategically placed at the River Safari and not the zoo in order to entice you to visit both parks. As there were no lines (as is typical at zoo panda exhibits) I would recommend that you visit. Try to visit in the morning or early afternoon to beat the crowds."
,,"Honest review,",3.0,,"As the name suggests we were expecting a safari on the river. This is not the case.

The river safari consists of a lot of walking round displays and a short 10 minute boat trip which is not worth the 1 hour queue.

The first half of the River safari is not very exciting, it has lots of displays of fish and a long walk through them. The long walk leads you to the panda enclosure which is good. It was big and the panda is always close. The river safari is next, the 1 hour queue was not worth the 10 min boat trip where we saw two animals from the zoo and a large tree. The walk back to the start was better with a lot more large aquariums that went over head and more exciting animals, for example otters and big fish.

We did not pay extra todo the amazon river cruise, I think it should be included in the price of the normal ticket as the other cruise was very poor."
,,Interesting for Children,3.0,,Best features include the panda and the short but interesting animal show. The ride along the pretend river is of limited interest except for children. A pleasant afternoon excursion but recommend do not combine with Night Safari on same day unless your endurance level is high.
,,"Well featured river animals,",4.0,,"The visit was good and interesting, but food choice is limited to panda restaurant, a more varied offer would be better"
,,Lovely day out,5.0,,"Had a great visit here with two children aged 5 and 7. The exhibits are interesting and all presented at a height that small children can see! The walkways are all covered to protect you from the sun and rain and everything seems really well thought-through. We had a treat with the giant pandas as one of them was very lively, climbing trees and rolling down hills. The kids were entranced!
The Amazon river ride is a few extra dollars but well worth it. You get to see lots of monkeys and birds really close up and the ride itself is fun with a few splashes! We also enjoyed the live shows where the kids got to stroke snakes and lizards and see capybaras and cranes.
The manatees at the end were also great. All in all a really lovely visit. We got round in about two hours but that’s just right for a child’s attention span and energy level. We paid $77 for two children and one adult (booking in advance online) and I thought it was good value for money."
,,Awesome Experience,5.0,,"The place was well-maintained and the sea animals really left us, especially the children, in awe. It's also a very nice experience to ride a boat and roam thru the river of the zoo."
,,Great visit with young children,4.0,,"The children had a lot of fun discovering the forest aquarium animals, the crocodiles and of course the pandas. This part of the park is completely covert and teh park is perfect to visit on rainy days too."
,,Fun Experience with loved ones,4.0,,"The river safari was a great place to spend time with the family or with loved ones, although smaller than the zoo, it was still worth going and can be completed within half a day where it leaves you time to visit the other parks or spend the day somewhere else. Adding a few more exhibits would be nice where more interaction or play time would be great as well. The shows could also be of a greater scale in order to compete with the other parks but overall worth visiting."
,,"Giant Pandas, Manatees, Huge Fish and Giant Otters, what's not to love?",5.0,,"We went mid-week on a particularly overcast and rainy day, which turns out to be a very fortuitous time to go. Most of the ""big"" attractions in there (the amazon river quest, the pandas and the river safari) had elaborate crowd channeling devices in place, as if they expected huge lines and decent waits. However we didn't have to wait to see anything and pretty much everything is under cover, except the two rides, but some judicious timing with short lines made that a non-issue.

The giant fish are a sight to behold, the tanks are enormous and there is ample above and below the water line viewing to allow you to take in the full majesty of the critters.

I loved watching the antics of the otters and would have happily spent hours there, but there was so much more to see.

The giant pandas appear to be quite content in their air-conditioned abodes, munching more or less non-stop on bamboo and the red-panda with his over the walkway branch between enclosures was a delight.

The manatees share their space with some truly enormous fish but that doesn't appear to bother them in the slightest, the baby seemed to take delight in crashing into some of the staid old fish cruising around. (The fish were less happy about the whole affair ;-))

The only creature that didn't appear to be fully content in it's enclosure was the polar bear, maybe he/she needs a buddy?

The Amazon River Quest is a neat little amusement park style ride with a english only commentary about the critters you see as you go. The river safari ride itself was relaxing I guess, but unless we were really unlucky and missed everything it wasn't worth the effort. You'll get a much better view of the few animals it shows you if you visit the Singapore Zoo itself.

The food here is crazy expensive for Singapore, food court style food at 5 times the price, but it's at least tasty.

There are a bazillion deals and sites and coupons available for visiting this place, so do a little research before you go and save some cash on the entry price to offset the food :-)"
,,Awesome place for family,5.0,,"This is my 2nd time to River Safari, 1st time was the event during Halloween! Clean, fun & awesome place to go with family. The food at the restaurant was good & price reasonable. The amazon quest ride was an experience that my kids & I will not forget."
,,River Safari,5.0,,"The Singapore Zoo does not disappoint. We attended the River Safari exhibit recently and were very impressed. We opted for the Amazon River ride (and additional small fee) over the complimentary River Safari. It was a great experience and I would recommend. The zoo is clean, spacious and the staff are very friendly."
,,Simple attraction,3.0,,"Its a small attraction, can be completed in less than 2 hours. The main attraction is the Panda from China but we only saw one out of two. The rest are mediocre exhibitions. Maybe should visit as filling time between Singapore Zoo and Night Safari."
,,Freshwater giants,5.0,,A place where you can visit some of the freshwater giants.... amazing place especially the amazon pond. Look out for the animal show schedule - dont miss it.
,,Not as interesting as the Zoo.,3.0,,"The place is quite well covered thus will eliminate the hassle should it rain. The interesting part was the Dugong and also the Panda. Other than that there are nothing much to see. The river cruise was boring as you will just in the boat for 5 minutes with nothing much to see. We did not ride the river amazon quest, maybe that will be interesting. We still prefer Singapore Zoo !!"
,,dont go,1.0,,"please dont go here. not a worth at all. same things in zoo. walk a lot is required. safari is useless. you will have to wait for 45 minutes minimum and the safari will just give you a ride for 10 mns.
the best part is the great panda. that's it."
,,"Nice place, but hot environment",4.0,,"Nice park, many variation of river fishes, cute pandas, affordable snack and food stalls. Some areas arevery hot,should provide canopies. No praying room, fortunately the staffs were very friendly and helpfull. They help to provide staff’s praying room."
,,Well done!,5.0,,"Took the children and other friends to River Safari and had fun, enjoy the beauty of the park and our children and us understood how important is to keep the world green.

Enjoy the Pandas as well as to see the big Polo Bear!!!!! Food options not too much inside but very clean and well organize."
,,Nice place of interest,3.0,,"It is a good place for a family outing with young children or senior. Most of the animals could access with shelter, thus quite a pleasant place in a place for all season."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"This was probably one of our best 'zoo-type' experiences! Unlike the regular zoo next door this place has shaded pathways and air-conditioned areas to duck into when the humidity becomes too much.
Enough exhibits to see and take an interest in, the pandas where the absolute highlight of the day - getting so up-close to them was unbelievable with no screens, no barriers etc.
The River Safari boat ride is a brilliant concept, the other boat ride is pretty much a waste of time (just a quick circle on a lake with nothing to see or do).
The manatee tank is awesome and it is well worth attending one of the informative shows where they give talks about the species etc.
Try and catch some of the other talks they give around the property - they put on a little show where you can touch some of the smaller animals etc."
,,Fun-filled adventure at the RIVER SAFARI,4.0,,"I and my boyfriend has so much fun in our visit here. We encountered several animals along our way. Wish it didn’t rain though cause we haven’t got the chance to try the river cruise. nonetheless it’s a worth visit.
PS. Try the AMAZON RIVER CRUISE."
,,A beautiful experience,5.0,,"Everything about this attraction was beautiful. The manatee tank is one huge and a beautiful tank that is well maintained and worth seeing. Also the giant panda forest is best place to see and experience.

Unfortunately, it rained the day we visited and could not take the cruise and river quest."
,,River Safari visit,4.0,,The River Safari like the zoo and the night safari is very well organised and informative. So great to see wild life up close. The safari boat ride that you paid an extra $5 for was fun but the river cruise itself was quite boring. The whole complex is well worth the visit especially with children.
,,River Safari,5.0,,"An amazing experience. We enjoyed watching Pandas, Indian Ghariyal (Crocodile) Polar Bear, various underwater fishes, river cruise and many more to see. We finished our tour in just over hours, think Singapore Zoo would
have been wonderful to add on.
The staff was helpful. Will be back soon."
,,Great,5.0,,"We were at the zoo and decided to go on the river safari for what it was I think its too expensive but it was lovely to see the dugongs and the beautiful fish. The cruise on the river was lovely but for me bring visually impaired it was difficult for me to see what was on the banks from the boat, and as the m a n was talking the rude people on the boat made it impossible for us to hear
Please turn up the volume on the boat as you as are describing what is on the bank because not being able to see it would have been nice to be able to know what to look for. Over all its a must see but too expensive"
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,Very nice place to visit with young children. Only thing is not many choices of eatery place inside the area. The only Chinese restaurant to foods not attractive. Easy to get water refilled there.
,,Excellent safari by the river,5.0,,It was a perfect compination of nature and technology. A very large variety of spicies. It was a very interesting and enjoyable experience!!
,,Loved it though Amazon River Quest was closed,5.0,,"It is one of the Best Places i have seen in Singapore .. My reason to visit this place was Panda but after seeing all i realised that this place will hold a special place in this trip.. Like touching the Starfish , Watching beautiful giant manatee, penguin, Snakes, Crocodiles Etc."
,,Upgrade in progress,3.0,,Only got to see 1 panda and the red panda is out on “vacation” with no notice when booking the tickets. The cruise was also quite boring as it’s quite short and nothing much to view.
,,Nice attraction in Spore,4.0,,"Been here last Saturday, Overall it's great and the kids like it so much, especially the Panda but too bad, only one Panda available during that time. Missed the Red Panda show caused it's only started on 10 Dec 2017."
,,River cruise,4.0,,It would be great if the river cruise view can have more to see as it only one small round and also very hot. Hope to see the improvement for our next visit.
,,Overall good compare to other place of interest,3.0,,"Good experience for frist time visit,however need continually extract visitors,may additional more ideas like having games and feeding shows time ."
,,Safari Trip,4.0,,"Did the Safari pm with Night Safari after.
Had light lunch in food court near gates, great value, cooked fresh, very good
Safari experience was good but thought the lake boat ride was underwhelming with not much to see.
Paid extra for the rapids ride which was more fun and more to see.
Yes would recommend to anybody."
,,Awesome day,5.0,,"We all had fun. Brought my Son and his classmate. I was suprised how organised the attractions are. For us visitors, it was a good feeling of being in the shed most of the time and great ventilation too. Keep it up! Good job RS!👍🏼😊"
,,Guest Relations Officers Went Out of Their Way,5.0,,Went to River Safari on 23 Nov 2017 with my grandniece. She loved it and still loves it! I got lost. Couldn't find my way out of the Amazon section even though there was a rather large EXIT sign. Two Guest Relations who were on their way to lunch led us out. So nice of them.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"Its very different than the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, really worth the visit. + go in rain or go in shine and you are fully covered, the safari is 80% covered. Really great for kids who love marine animals!"
,,Limited Experience,3.0,,"with the experience that we had, it was overpriced. kids under 7 should get free access. cost saving for the adult. another eatery like MCD inside will be great or starbucks quickie inside near the cruise will be great"
,,A more manageable encounter with animals,3.0,,"If you’re looking at visiting the zoo but not too gaga about covering all the species, the River Safari is a much more comfortable alternative to the Singapore Zoo. It has air conditioned areas in some of its exhibits to give you a break from the heat. Since it focuses on just the animals found in the major rivers of the world, it’s not too big and so you can finish it half the time or even less than the time you would spend in the Singapore Zoo. If you get too tired and are not in a rush, there is a cruise within the area to get some air and just chill and relax. The panda exhibit is a plus. And don’t miss the river ride. It’s like a theme-park ride in the forest. Thrilling enough at the same time educational and interesting. It’s enough experience for those with smaller children and maybe for the older citizens.

But if you want to explore and see more, the Singapore Zoo would be a better option."
,,If you are going for the boat ride don’t bother - however ....,4.0,,"There is a giant panda which you can only see at the river safari... this was pretty cool ... they also had a manatee exhibit which was excellent. Lots of tanks with large fish etc ... boat ride was a waste of time apart from the fact you got to sit down for 15 mins - kids enjoyed it and liked the spider monkeys and giant otters which are lots of fun.

Take your own water - expect to pay $$$ for ice cream etc"
,,A subset of Spore Zoo,3.0,,My kids love Zoos. We've visited Singapore Zoo and River Safari 3 yrs ago. We repeated River Safari recently because years ago the river cruises weren't opened yet. I have to say this time around it seems rather boring. No new displays/animals or activities were on at 11am+ when we arrived. The Amazon Quest boat ride was the most enjoyable and that was the peak of our visit. The standard river cruise (bigboat) is super boring (sorry) and I don't see the point of having it at all though the serene view and gentle breeze allows one to relax for a bit. Glad we saw the manatees again as their habitat tank is the most mesmerizing
,,good,4.0,,"I had little regret due to red panda park is closed for mainteinence during my visit. anyhow, i still enjoy the whole visit journey"
,,Fun,4.0,,I love to see cute lazy panda bear. Most of the time i was taking pictures with my families rather than watching fishes or animals they display because they aren't active for some reason and seem to be sleeping all the time. But ..... Amazon Flooded Forest really can impress me.
,,Love the boat ride!,4.0,,Would love to see more attraction/animals at the River Safari though! Some activities and play area for younger kids will be great!
,,creatures never seen before!,4.0,,This was a really good attraction. Saw creatures that I never knew about. Even had jaguars & the manatees were lovely. They have 2 pandas which you could just sit and watch all day. Probably a morning visit would be better as some of the animals were obviously hiding from the head when we went in the afternoon
,,nice to see you panda,4.0,,its surprise while seeing panda.nice boat ride.surely you dont need more then 2-3 hours but day time safari experience cant be mis.
,,Pleasant experience,5.0,,I went to the zoo followed by river safari. The place has more shelter and it's suitable for children on stroller or an elderly on wheelchair.
,,Clean and well thought out concept,4.0,,"The river safari was a nice treat to venture into expecially when it is a cleverly designed park that maximsed the land and intergrated itself with the Mandai lake. It was worth paying extra to see the animals in closer view too. My fabourite enclosure (as with most visitors, i reckon) was the pandas! What a marvellous sight to see such a majestic creature in close promixity!"
,,Addition to the Zoo. Slightly short.,3.0,,"The River Safari is one of the 4 parks in Mandai. At 30SGD the park is slightly small to visit along. Additional 10minute river quest ride can be purchased inside the park at 5USD, but can be re-visited. The other river cruise is slightly boring. Only 1 panda can be seen during our visit on 6 Dec. Recommended to combine with Night Safari or Zoo."
,,Wonderful place marred by Erroneous Ruler in Amazon River Quest,3.0,,"You will expect no less from one of the Top Zoos in the world. The River Safari offers a good mix of indoor and out door attraction to cool you from the heat and at the same time, immerse you in the tropical heat of the wilderness. The close encounters with some of the Amazonia River Monkeys was an experience that is both enriching and at the same time, ""cute"" for the family.
One attraction did leave a scar in my trip this time around as my Son was looking forward now, that he has grown taller - during the last trip he was only 90cm. We have measured my son at the doctor for this trip and he stands at a good 108cm and thus we purchased the tickets. However, when I reach the Amazon River Quest site, we were stopped at the door and was told that my Son was not tall enough. When asked politely for the reason, we were shown the height ruler at the side and it has a marker to denote the minimum height requirement. It was obviously higher than 1.06m!
We did not create a scene, being law abiding people, and walk away disappointed. We took the River Cruise instead, much to the disappointment of my Son, who queried why is he not allowed entry after he has fulfiled his promised of eating his meals regularly, studying hard and also exercising to grow taller. I could not answer him. It was truly a disappointment as this was meant as the first stop of his Christmas tours leading up to the big Xmas party that we have planned."
,,Nice place,5.0,,Very good experience in river safari boat ride and cruise . Best natural environment eco-friendly place. Honeymoon couple super place to visit River safari.
,,This was ok but overpriced.,3.0,,"The kids had fun with the animals. They loved seeing the Panda's. The boat ride was very boring, nothing to see! Too expensive for us. We will not go back."
,,Steep price to see Panda,3.0,,The highlight of River Safari is Panda enclosure but rather small section of the bigger part of the zoo.
,,Underwhelming,1.0,,"We booked an afternoon tour here as the description seemed to indicate a River Safari experience, gliding through different riverlands by boat, how wrong this was.

This as just a poor aquarium that has a 10 minute mini water ride and the Giant Panda enclosure. There is a River Safari boat that takes about 20 minutes but this only sails up and down the lake and not past any animals.
The layout however is quite good but you could easily do the park in 1 hour. The Amazon boat ride is a disappointment as this takes you quickley passed any animal enclosures at a speed with no time to savour any moments or even capture on the camera. The 3 drops are tame and do nothing to enhance the experience.
Young children will probably enjoy the whole experience but it is but poor for adults. The only redeeming features are the Manatee enclosure and the Panda's (when they are out). Even the Red Panda enclosure was closed. The walkways are mainly covered so will protect from sun and rain."
,,PANDA MEET,5.0,,Well this is the place where you can get to see the massive Panda .. This is the highlight of the river safari .. do not miss it at any cost .. It is a decent affair .. you also get a chance to sit in a cruise and have a river sruise .. you see some animals while on the cruise .. The only problem is they are in very small enclosures for their liking .. woul like to see them move around more freely .. Tha amazon boat ride is a highlight
,,A nice place to walk arouund,4.0,,"It's smaller than I expected, and I can't really see any animals from the River Safari Cruise, and it's too bad that my child is too small to take Amazon River Quest ride, so I wouldn't suggest it as the first choice to experience Safari parks. However, if you've visited Safari Zoo and Night Safari, and still have spared time, it's nice to walk around and enjoy a free afternoon"
,,Great place,5.0,,our 5 and 1 year old loved this place!!! esp boat ride. Amazing sea creatures to see and can learn about saving the earth during the show.
,,Brief interaction with Panda,4.0,,Main attraction of the place is kai kai..and jia jia the pandas..though only seen kai kai..the amazon river safari was also good but very brief and fast.
,,Mixed feelings,4.0,,"The River Safari is undeniably well-run but after this, my first visit, I can understand the lure of a Safari in the wild.

The fresh water fish and reptiles exhibits were intriguing and the group tour extremely informative. It's not every day that one gets to see what creatures lurk in the Mekong and Amazon rivers! Some of them are really enormous!

The pandas were really cute but I kept imagining that it was someone in costume!

We took the Amazon quest boat ride which was an additional small fee. It was a really quick 5min ride but worthwhile if the animals aren't hiding from the heat. You are allowed to go on the ride as many times as you wish.. so we went twice.

It was on this ride, however, which I encountered one of the saddest displays... it was the regal jaguar pacing up and down the maybe 80m length of its enclosure. First time round, we oohed and aahed... but it didn't take long to realize it seemed so trapped.. the top of the enclosure had metal fencing about 2m high overhead. Claustrophobic for an animal capable of great speeds and swimming prowess.. and used to roaming square kilometers of land.

Of course, probably born captive, it would never have tasted such freedom, but would it not be in its very DNA to leap, sprint and hunt? But tragically, it would probably not survive long if released in the wild.

My 6year old asked me who takes it out on walks and runs!

Ditto the manatees in the huge aquarium near the exit. The tank is big, but is it really big enough for all those huge beasts? I just hope the manatees have the memory of a goldfish.

So, as a tourist attraction, the place is great... interesting, clean, worth a visit for families.

But as an animal lover and maybe one wont to anthropomorphize, I find it a little depressing and will not be planning another visit."
,,Comfortable for kids,4.0,,The River Safari is a comfortable day out with the kids. It doesn't have the glitz or crowd of the Singapore Zoo but the pace is perfect for those with kids under the age of 5. The pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia were a huge hit with both our 20 month old and the 4 year old. We couldn't do the Amazon boat ride since the older one was shorter than the minimum requirement. The cruise wasn't anything great but the breeze was delightful and the glimpses of the rhino and giraffe pepped us up for the next day's zoo visit.
,,Great family fun.,5.0,,Very interactive and educational visit for children as well as adults.Enjoyed the river cruise especially the amazon boat ride.
,,Don't take the River Safari Cruise,1.0,,The aquariums are awesome; then... you get on the the River Safari Cruise... a useless view of the reservoir that is conducted in a very hot aluminium boat with up to 45 of your closest friends and gushes the virtues of what you could see but don't. Save your money and skip the cruise!
,,Perfect Family Outing,5.0,,"It was a rainy day and we were so glad that River Safari was nicely sheltered!! We managed to walk along the sheltered path, looking at all the amazing exhibits and keeping ourselves dry! It was also kids' and elderly friendly as we had no trouble pushing our stroller (or wheelchair) around. We will definitely visit again! :)"
,,Must see,5.0,,The River Safari is a excellent attraction and combined with the Night Safari they are both a must see when visiting Singapore. I would highly recommend
,,Greatest adventures @ River Safari,5.0,,Amazing and awesome adventures @ River Safari. It was our first time in this kind of adventure and the whole family love it... Truly worth going... ☺
,,Too few real animals to be seen,3.0,,"The river safari, boat ride was a disappointment especially when I brought a foreign guest from overseas. Not much river experience and too few animals."
,,Awesome Trip,5.0,,River cruise came with the ticket price which was quite good. Free performance from Nov 18 to Dec which my children enjoyed quite a lot especially for the performance River Tales.
,,This was probably the place where I geeked out the most!,5.0,,"While strolling through the grounds you'd be surprised by the myriad of breeds they have and all of them seem to be taken care of appropriately. All of their habitats seem to be in pristine condition and the water in all of the tanks that I saw were as clean as they could be.
I couldn't be happier when I visited this place since I love fish, but this review isn't biased towards that affection. They take good care of their fish as far as my amateur eye could see.
I highly recommend this place to all people of all ages especially ones who have an interest in freshwater fish.
Good job."
,,Had a great time/interesting exhibits,5.0,,The exhibits here focused on marine life in various river habitats from all over the world so I was able to see and learn about different types of marine life. I arrived late in the afternoon and spent about 2 and a half hours wandering through. Some of it is indoors but the majority is outside and with fans it can still get quite hot. There are 4 parks in the same area but I'd recommend doing them over 2 days as it would be a long hot day to do all 4 at once. The oanda exhibit was toward the end here but unfortunately one was closed. I was still able to see tye male and female pandas hanging out which was great. I would recommend a visit here.
,,Disappointment,2.0,,"River Safari is not worth the time or money to visit. Other than the Monster fishes, the rest were much of a waste of time. The river cruise was big disappointment and more like a ride around the lake!"
,,"Fish, fish, fish & Panda!",5.0,,Wonderful experience with beautiful aquarium & open area to view the panda! We also enjoyed the river cruise in the tropical river!
,,Wonderful exhibition; very educational and showing life in the World's great rivers.,5.0,,"As Kris Flyer members we got an immediate 10% discount into the River Safari; a great start to a day that was only going to get better. Singapore cleverly has its Zoos all starting from the same place so you can take your pick of which you want to visit; make sure you have the River Safari at the top of your list. Most comment surrounds the presence of the Panda, however the Safari offers so many other animals, many of them unusual, to excite the visitor. There are myriads of different fish species and monkeys, sea-cows, playful otters, the anaconda, electric eels and much more. A river cruise takes you past the rhinoceros and giraffes residing in the Zoo next door; the Amazon River Trip displays the Anteater, Peccaries, colourful birds to name just a few. One of the highlights of the Safari was the way information was presented to the visitor, both describing the river being displayed and the life around it. It was clearly presented, colourful and brief enough to keep readers interested. Too often we saw parents drag their children passed the information displays instead of encouraging them to read and learn - for some a lost opportunity. The Safari precinct was well sign posted, there were plenty of rest places, cafes, toilets and easy exits if needed. The staff were always helpful and friendly. Another must see in Singapore."
,,Many animals of river to see,4.0,,"I like the Amazon River Quest but it was too fast , so I was not managed to see the animals . The giant panda , kai kai is so cute but can't see Jia Jia .

Question for management : Why I went twice in this November but I can't saw any red panda , so disappointed !"
,,Panda was the highlight but no much else to see,3.0,,We went here after Singapore zoo to see the pandas. Only one panda was on display but it was still amazing. Other than the pandas there isn’t much else to see. We didn’t do the river cruise as it was too late and extra money but it’s basically just what you see in the zoo anyway. Ideally they should move the panda to the zoo.
,,Excited to finally see it,5.0,,Great experience and would definitely do it again. Kids enjoyed every minute of it. Some animals where a little shy and didn't come out but still worth it
,,Worth it for the Panda,4.0,,"If you, family, friends etc are fans of fish and amphibians then this is the park for you. Having previously visited the Zoo and Night Safari I thought this was the weakest of the three. However it's well worth buying the multi-park ticket as then effectively your River Safari entrance is free, and it's the perfect size (1-2hrs) to combine with a visit to the Zoo, right next door.

Whole park is very nicely laid out around a creek/inlet of the reservoir, the best bit, and worth the entrance, was the panda enclosure. Although undergoing renovation at the moment (red pandas not on show), you can still see at least one of the pandas in a very nice, relaxed and unrushed environment."
,,Life on the River,4.0,,"Experience :-

This is a 3-parts re-visit review to the Zoo, River Safari and Jurong Bird Park (while doing new lens test as a Photography Enthusiast). If you are Park Hopping (discount bundle), please feel free to check out my other relevant reviews and hope it may help.

""Life on the River""

River Safari is a river-themed hybrid of Zoo and Aquarium that aims to present some of the habitats around the world such as Amazon Forest, Nile, Mekong River and etc.

While the Park attempts to fuse all of the above together, this is usually done on a more informative aspects through pictures and message - As a third time visitor, I did hope that they would have been able to bring more specific specimens in or introduce more new enclosures (that don't involve rides) to suit the theme. To be blunt, I believe (and judging from Visitor's response) most would be here just to catch a glimpse of the Pandas, which is good - and bad as it limits the potential of the park which can be so much more.

Tips/Advice:-

1) As per my visit on the 12th Nov today, the Red Panda exhibit is closed till 26th Nov for upgrades, fyi.

2) Preferred Time of Visiting? Week day is recommended to avoid the crowds (both tourists and locals) and It is good to visit at exactly 10 am (when it opens) and having the Panda exhibit all to yourself for that few moments.

3) Admission Fee? Its $30 for adult, $20 for child and usually some discounts will apply when you buy via Online for Locals. One should consider the multi-Parks special (check out the ParkHopper Special) to enjoy a decent discount

4) Location : it be best to take Buses here (for example, 927 from Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange, or 926 from Woodlands to name a few), they operate late into the nights to accommodate for visitors who may have stayed to visit the Night Safari

5) Preparations : Definitely wear comfortably (shoes and clothes) and also study the weather precipitation beforehand.

My sincere suggestions for the Zoo/River Safari:

1) I do hope as part of an ongoing effort - Wild Amazonia (Amazon River Quest) can be made accessible by foot as well, if even partially. At the current moment, it is a ride based experience which is fun and good but often so rapid that we will capture little to no details/content.

2) As part of the Park Hopper bundle and experience, maybe you can look into covering the costs of transports between Zoo/River-Night Safari to the Jurong Bird Park which as of now cost between $4-6. I do think the cost of transport is marginal as compared to driving the crowd flow to visit Jurong Bird Park too, which is currently awkwardly situated away from the 3 other parks. I believe the gesture of waiving the Transports cost to Jurong Bird Park will for 1) boost traffic heading to Bird Park due to the ease and cost of transferring and 2) encourage people to buy 4-parks Park Hopper bundle.

As always, do refer to my Photos for visual and thank you for reading."
,,Amazon river cruise!,4.0,,"Amazon River cruise was really cool however it was too fast, I felt I couldn't see the animals and enjoy them at the speed we were travelling
The walk thru Monkey enclosure was really cool, I liked that you could potentially get really close!
The Panda bao bun is cute and reasonably priced, a must if visiting the River Safari
The river cruise I thought was pointless, we briefly saw the top of a giraffe and otherwise it was just a lap around the basin."
,,Average,3.0,,A good relaxation between zoo and night safari if u are opting all in a single day. Consists of river safari and Amazin quest. Dont miss out the shows and 7 rivers.
,,Best safari,5.0,,"During my visit to Singapore, i made sure i experienced the river safari. It was a great experience going through the river, watching the animals and listening about the habitat of those animals."
,,A happy blessed trip to River Safari on 4/11/17,5.0,,"We had a happy and blessed trip to River Safari with a group of senior citizens. During the visit, we were very glad that there are a lots of chairs for the seniors to sit and rest. we enjoy seeing the Giant Pandas
and various kinds of fishes, crocodiles, and wild animals. We also like the river safari cruise."
,,"Good time in the ""wild""",4.0,,"Aiming to alert people to wildlife,animal protection and ecological awareness this place is both informative and fun to visit glad I came!Keep up the good work for animal and human kind"
,,Five Stars hotel with 3 stars service,3.0,,"suggest to make it more interesting, not really attractive overall excepted panda. we like the amazon quest, can get more facility like this let visitors can feel the adventure."
,,Very interesting Place,5.0,,"Lots of fresh water species. Totally different from other zoo type attractions. Wasn't sure about the Amazon River Quest, but really glad we did it. Well worth the extra. Panda's! Who doesn't like Panda's? Great way to spend 3-4 hours."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Must join guided tour! I have been a few times but it was the first time my kids and I join the guided tour! New discovery and we learn something new! Do join the show too! children can touch various animals! my kids really enjoyed themselves!
,,Worth your pocket,5.0,,Definitely better than sea aquarium if you fancy fresh water fish. More close up and less noisy too.
,,Excellent outing for families with little children!,4.0,,"We are a family with 2 energetic children! They are 3.5y and 14 months.

The River Safari is one of our favourite outing spots. As the tickets a pricey, we save it for Super special treats.

As the walkway is covered, we are sheltered from sun and rain. This is useful if the children are have been expecting the outing all week! The set route is useful if someone lags behind. However, it may be a bit frustrating for those who only want to go to selected areas.

Our favourite spots are the Panda Bears and Squirrel Monkey Forest. We have been lucky to catch both Pandas in action on our past 2 visits.

The restaurant after the Pandas is a strategic stop point where we enjoy eating the Panda steam buns before heading to the cruise on Seletar reservoir. We were fortunate to have 3 giraffes looking at our boat as we drifted by!

All in all, a wonderful outing with fond memories. Look forward to the next one!"
,,Omg,5.0,,What a absolute awesome awsome awesome attraction a definite not to miss we had the best time the variety of things to see and do were brilliant one of our favorite attractions a must for everyone i dont want to spoil it so just plan to do it you wont be disappointed
,,A river zoo...,5.0,,"This zoo has got very unique differentiator where it has brought all kind of river and Amazon stuff together in one enclosure. The place has also provide river boat rides and very educational for kids and even adults.

One special enclosure is the panda section where they are two real pandas in singapore right in the river safari. My kids love this and keep wanted to go back again."
,,Even better than expected,5.0,,"Originally went just to see the pandas and Amazon boat ride but thoroughly enjoyed all the exhibits as did our 4 yr old (except the boatride as ended up being 1cm short of the required 106cm height). There were a few creatures from Octonauts and we recounted episodes as we went. A great place for a hot day, most was under a covered walkway and there were fans and air conditioned areas. Single route means you don't have to navigate and can move along at own pace. Huge tanks with manatee and giant see otters were amazing. The panda Chinese food outlet had good nutritious food and little packaging which was in line with message to reduce single use plastic and very refreshing. Panda theme was a novelty for our daughter."
,,Good,4.0,,"Highlights of the river safari are the Panda, red Panda and Inuka, the polar bear. 3 hours would be enough to visit the entire area. There is a river cruise for an extra fee which is good too. Keep the map handy so that you don't miss out on any shows especially the polar bear's."
,,Good learning journey in river safari,5.0,,Well organized. Not too big not too small. Can get new knowledge every time visit river safari. Not too tiring and not too hot. Very relax and joyful trip in the park. Thumb up!
,,Singapore Zoo RIver Safari,4.0,,"Fantastic way to relax as the kids go gaga on fish and animals. The river cruise is a bit of dampener as we were expecting otters, and other river inhabitants. Overall ... overawed!!"
,,"Fun, fun, fun!",5.0,,We loved looking at the giant pandas and the gift shop was amazing! We went on both boat rides and the Wild Amazonia was a hit with the kids. The ice cream shop was good too. Would definitely go back!
,,Diwali visit,4.0,,"a bit costly, considering that you need to pay additionally. Giant panda is the main attraction, worth a visit. Boat ride is too short."
,,My River safari Tour,4.0,,Very important because very informative site for understanding fresh water fishes who living in many Zones. I would like to suggest the voyaging time of Amazon river cruse should be increase.
,,River Safari,5.0,,"It really a great place to visit, the most I like are panda area and flooded forest. Definitely I will come back again."
,,Great Fun,4.0,,"Compared with other zoos within Singapore, there are more air-conditioned areas. There are also more fun rides such as river boat. Each gallery is also quite spacious. Animals are eye-catching e.g. huge catfish and cute (panda, of course). The panda buns also lift our spirit midway through the journey. Overall, great fun, comfort, and enriching experience for young & old."
,,"Poor, to say the least",2.0,,"It is a disaster. A complete one way disaster. So all they do is take you on to a boat, and take you along the edge of the zoo. The Singapore Zoo is along the river and thus you can see the animals from the other side albeit those which you have already seen from inside. Whew. Is that it? Well pretty much. Nothing much to even mention."
,,River safari Singapore,5.0,,Enjoyable experience. Will definitely make another trip there. Amazon River Quest was fun. River cruise was a little too short though
,,Lovely time at the River Safari,5.0,,"Well designed, lots of animals to look at, a relaxing river cruise, lots of shade, guided tours.. I enjoyed my time at the River Safari. Great for families or anybody who likes a day out without enduring too much tropical heat. The 3 highlights for me, were the giant Mekong fish, the seals enclosure and the manatee aquariums. So fascinating."
,,"small, No need to spend much time on it",3.0,,"It is a small park that no need to spend so much time on it. About 1 to 2 hours is enough. The boat riding is the most amazing part in the Park, and the restaurant Panda mama is very good. She had good Dim Sum and is relatively fair price!"
,,Unique Safari,4.0,,River Safari is a unique way to see and explore the zoo. located just next to singapore zoo it has a feel of a rainforest.
,,Good tourist & education destination.,4.0,,"Good place to take your toddler to learn about the animals around each region of rivers. You can walk along indoor pathways. The panda restaurant serve the good taste of food & snack and good place to take a break. Panda zone is good and make the trip is more variable. The only disappointed was the river cruise activity, only 15 minutes cruise and nothing to see, only giraffes."
,,Nice & Relaxing Trip,4.0,,"Ample sheltered areas, and Hyflux water dispensers conveniently located throughout. The River Quest boat ride is short but entertaining! The complementary river cruise was boring though."
,,Review,5.0,,"It wasn't crowded on the day of visit. Exhibits are well maintained. Saw river rangers or keepers attending to unwell fish. Good job. Amazon river quest is fun. Mama Panda Restaurant food selection can be abit limited. Overall, had a great time!"
,,My favourite wildlife park in Singapore!,5.0,,"What's not to love about this park? It's well-maintained, mostly sheltered, has a touch pool, a relaxing cruise, an exciting boat ride & plenty of exhibits to look at! Am amazed by how the waters in all the aquariums are so clean & clear! The cooling panda enclosure is a great respite from the heat too. At the end of our journey, there was a short demonstration on the devastating effects of plastics on wildlife & it encouraged the kids to reuse, reduce & recycle. We had so much fun learning & discovering here. Definitely a must-visit for families!"
,,our first time to River Safari,4.0,,Kinda prefer River Safari over Zoo. Area not as big tho but very much sheltered. The Amazon River boat ride was Great but pity is a little short however my kids and myself had a Great time!
,,Nice way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"The river safari allows you to explore the exhibits at your own pace, and is sheltered from the sun and rain. The only exception is the actual river safari boat ride which costs extra and whisks you by animals that aren't otherwise visible. I would recommend purchasing it online with your ticket. Though it would be nice if it was possible to see the animals without taking the boat."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"I visited River Safari in Oct 2017 and thought it was really great. I had read mixed reviews online but thought they had some really cool animals there. Yes, the pandas are the highlight but I also really liked the big fish and the monkeys.
The way the park is organised is really well done, lots of information everywhere and well presented. Panda-themed restaurant also really good. It gets pretty hot but most of it is in the shade.
The only issue is getting there, from the city I had to catch two trains and a bus, which took over an hour - but it's cheap."
,,Enjoyable River Adventure!!,4.0,,Great experience visiting with kids! Sheltered walkway and fans make visiting river safari under Singapore sunny and rainy weather very pleasant!
,,"Informative, educational and fun",5.0,,"One of the best attractions in Singapore. It was enjoyable for all of my three children 10, 8 and 3. Shouldn’t miss this one for family with young children."
,,Nice boat rides,5.0,,"Must visit the panda bear, very cute. And eat the panda bear buns, very nice. Do take both boat rides. For amazon river quest; if you want to take again, just tell the staff and they will direct you to turn right for another ride at just 1 ticket cost. We took it 3 times at just 1 ticket cost. Roughly spend 2 hours. Overall: boat ride and panda bear exhibit is very worth the visit."
,,It was amazing!,5.0,,We have spent at River Safari about 3 hours. It was very interesting and at the same time not much to be exhausted. We have seen a lot of rare animals and fishes. Our little daughter (almost 2 years old) was very excited seeing panda and polar bear swimming in the pool!
,,Good fun,4.0,,"Wide range of animals, nice enclosures. Good value for money when booked with one of the other safaris. Boat trip was a bit rubbish"
,,"Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari - all in one day",5.0,,"A review on River Safari (I've done separate review for Singapore Zoo)

We bought 4 in 1 ticket package on the spot at Singapore Zoo. After spending 4 hours or so at the zoo, we walked to River Safari - only 2 minutes walk.

Size wise, it's a lot smaller compare to Singapore Zoo and just the one route to follow. Most of the River Safari walkways were undercover which came handy when it's raining.

River Safari covered all the famous rivers of the worlds; Congo, Nile, Ganges, Mary, Mekong, Yangtze, Amazon.

We bought the Amazon River Quest tickets on the spot but just as we about to start, it rained cats and dogs. The staff were very kind to informed us if we'd like to proceed the 10 minutes quest which was outdoor, no under cover areas. We waited and cancelled as the rain lasted 2 hours. The tickets were credited towards the restaurant (or the souvenir shop). We opted for the restaurant, we had chicken ramen, beef ramen, chicken nugget and panda bun - the meal were tasty but not cheap. No $2.80 meal here ha ha!

Our favourite were the Giant Panda and Amazon Flooded Forest. Amazing!"
,,Not Advisable,1.0,,River cruise is really bad - no animals are seen and there is nothing to see. It is a waste of time so better to avoid it
,,Panda was the main attraction,5.0,,River safari starts with the aquarium and then it has animals that can be viewed without any fencing like small monkeys in enclosures. River cruise was a waste of time. Amazon river quest was a different experience which is charged differently (SG $ 5 per person). One must see that. Panda was the main attraction for us. Two pandas were there. Dont buy photos from professional photographers outside panda enclosures they cheat you. Beware of the girl who was selling photos when u exit panda enclosure. Rest it was a very good experience.
,,"If you time, visit it",3.0,,"From the 4 parks, this was the less exciting, the Amazon River Quest does not worth the money, mostly when you have to wait a lot for it. The other three park was Ok, in this only a few things to see."
,,"If you have covered the zoo and night safari ,you can skip this",3.0,,"It's a good place.Can spend about 2-3 hrs easily...
However I felt that the zoo was much better...some of the animals in the river Safari were overlapping with the zoo...So my suggestion is to spend the day in the zoo and then do the night Safari later..."
,,Pandas and so much more,5.0,,Really good experience at the river safari. Paid the $5 extra for the little boat ride which was excellent. The highlight of course was the Panda bears but overall the park was excellent and offered many excellent animal experiences.
,,Not much to see,3.0,,"Not much to see besides the the Giant and Red pandas, monkeys, sea otters, manatees and other freshwater animals due to small area. Went there for 8 hours and make 4 rounds seeing the same thing. Small animals like frogs cannot be seen in their enclosures. Animals also hard to see on both River and Amazon cruise boat rides."
,,An escape from the world,5.0,,"We went there not expecting much. We just wanted to visit the place since it has been around for awhile. The overall experience was great! Throughout the journey, there were many information boards that taught us so much about the wildlife all over the world. It was really rewarding being able to be a little closer to nature, especially for us city dwellers who rarely have the chance to escape from the concrete jungle we live in."
,,Great Family Outing,5.0,,"I have visited the River Safari before but this is the first time when all the attractions were open. I brought my son to visit the River Safari and while this was not his first time, was just as excited to visit the place as if it was his first. The River Safari also provided learning opportunities for him. All round, it was an enjoyable visit and a great way for father and son to spend time together!!"
,,River Safari on a Sunday,5.0,,"I've avoided going here for almost a year now based on the fact that it's almost in Malaysia (ok, a bit of an exaggeration) but by car, it's not very far at all and truthfully, even by MRT, the transit time shouldn't be that bad (under an hour to get back to Harbourfront).
You can easily spend half a day here. The boat rides are nice, a bit short, but you are able to ride one of them a second time if you let the staff know that you want to repeat."
,,River Safari,5.0,,"Exhibits are beautifully presented, while knowledgeable and friendly staff are available throughout."
,,Highlight is the Panda Pear,3.0,,Went there about a day at the Singapore Zoo and it was interesting but the highlight is the Panda Pear. Easy to get around through
,,Quite ok,3.0,,"Rank 4th among night safari, sing zoo, jurong bird park anf river safari. Better feeling if you go to the SEA aquarium at Sentosa."
,,Ok but too expensive,3.0,,"Ticket, food and beverage is too expensive. Should provide more trolley for kids. Staff generally friendly."
,,great time!,4.0,,"My kids enjoyed very much especially at the amazon ride and playing with the very playful otters. However, the park is too small where there is not a lot of animals and fishes."
,,Leisurely educational zoo trip!,5.0,,"The pace was just right even with young kids in tow. Many explaination of the animals and their habitat, supported by multiple viewing angles for most of them."
,,Singapore Zoo - River Safari,5.0,,"A great zoo with the animals in great enclosures for them & viewing for the public. Covered walkways & fans provided comfort from the elements.
The boat ride was great to see the animals and the ability to have another ""go"" was also great so you could see what you missed the first time.
A brilliant day out for the family."
,,"Nice, relaxing afternoon",4.0,,"We visited this park before night safari and was a good choice. The park is well maintained, easy to follow the experiences. Amazon river quest is fun and the giant pandas are very cute."
,,River and boat safari,5.0,,River and boat safari lovely place to visit. Must see the pandas ! Need atleast 5 hours to visit this place. A must go !
,,River and boat safari,4.0,,With the river safari there is a boat safari to see animals it is totally worth the visit. Must visit the pandas. Atleast keep 5 hours for this visit. Very entertaining for children and adults. Must go !
,,Excellent,5.0,,Very nice and friendly support crews... we feel species are less... we request to add more species on river safari family.
,,First visit,5.0,,"First time visit with our younger son but it was my wife which was more amazed especially with the big fishes. Myself, I preferred the panda exhibit. Have lunch at the restaurant in the zoo. Although food are okay but find it a bit pricey especially for the cup of drink which is easily $5 and you can keep the cup. But give us a choice which I believe will be cheaper if we are using normal cup."
,,An good place for visit with young kids,5.0,,"As a Long term resident of singapore , we never got an opportunity to visit river safari till date . Recently we came to know the tickets for kids are waived off for this month , hence we took the plunge of visiting river safari yesterday .

This park is located right next to Singapore Zoo and night safari . To reach the same mode of transport will work .

The park has a open atmosphere and is not as crowded as Singapore Zoo or night safari , hence giving good experience .

At the entry we start with Mississippi River trail where we get to see alligator snapping turtle , alligator gar. Then we move into Congo/ Nile river trial the main attractions are African dwarf crocodile, tiger fish , Congo tetra, giant puffer fish . The next we move onto Ganges river where we get to see a huge Indian ghariyal. We quickly criss river Mary of Australia .

We then enter the giant enclosure of Mekong river , where we get to see giant Mekong cat fish, giant stingray . The enclosure is massive and is wonderful.

Then we get to see the main attraction of the park is the giant pandas , they are named Jia Jia and Kai Kai . We have never seen this majestic creatures before , so we were thrilled to see them and were struck in awe of these creatures.

We then went on both of the boat rides , which was very pleasant and finished it with the amazon animals .

We thoroughly enjoyed the visit , was slightly shorter than we expected , but was over all a fulfilling experience ."
,,Nice experience; don't opt for the laser show ride,4.0,,The river safari at clarke quay is a fun experience. Well maintained boats by WaterB. Though too many stoppages. The ride with laser shiw is unnecessarily overpriced since the laser show is by marina bay and not by the river cruise companies. So how can they charge higher. Great ride experience in the night.
,,Take your time,4.0,,Go here before the night safari. Give yourselves at least 4 hours to slowly wander around this very interesting water world. Go for a free boat ride on the reservoir then go on the Amazon River ride. Great fun. Many places to eat or drink. Take your own refillable water bottle and fill it at one of the many free filtered water stations. Save the World from plastic pollution.
,,Boat ride and meet the panda,4.0,,"Only amazon river ride is good, panda were amazing, cruise boat was not so good, nothing much to view in cruise boat."
,,Enjoyable tour,4.0,,"I’d done the zoo and night safari last year and hoped to complete the river safari in the future. Taking the tour this afternoon I had two hours in which to complete and return to my tour bus. It may sound a bit quick, and were I a family with young kids keen to explore and understand all before them it would have been an ask, but as a solo visitor I even had time for shopping and Starbucks.

There were a lot of tanks to view, I quickly passed these, stopping only briefly and reading the text. What was more interesting was the pandas, many were paused here for a gander.

There’s a food area directly after the pandas before you cross the water for river boat rides. Our ticket got us the amazon boat ride, you get a bit of a splash ride, my first such boat ride, and was a bit of fun. The ride was a bit quick and sunlight made it difficult to effectively photograph animals on the 10 or so minute ride. Wait times can be long, I was lucky and only waited maybe 10 at most.

If I was choosing between the river and night safaris I would definitely say the night Safari hands down as I would do that one again."
,,nothing special,3.0,,"Various river-related themes were good. Pandas were not proper theme with river. River cruise was bad. Nothing to see on the boat, noisy engine and gas made me angry."
,,Only worth for the Giant Panda,3.0,,"Some attractions were nice, like Manatees and giant otters, but not really worth spending the time and money. It's basically built to monetise on the Pandas, over what could be done by housing them with the rest at zoo. Not recommended."
,,Exciting day of adventure for the kids,4.0,,My 4 year old son had a great time. He enjoyed watching all the different types of fish and enjoyed the boat ride. He also loved the pandas. We were a bit disappointed that we couldn't go on the Amazon safari as that seemed liked a big part of the park. Still quite enjoyable overall.
,,good for a few hours,3.0,,Visited the river safari mainly because we were at the zoo and had some free time and never had time to visit the river safari last year. Got to see the manatees and one of the giant pandas but was not as impressed with it in comparison to the zoo or night safari which is maybe why it was quiet when we arrived. The river quest was closed for maintenance when we visited so there was a lot we could not see in the amazon rain forest area.
,,Was very good,4.0,,A little boring. Food was great at mama panda. Amazon boat ride and pandas excellent. Kids liked it but got through park in about 2hours. We ended upgrading our 2park pass to the 4park pass. And took the kids to the zoo as it had water park to play at while we waited for the night safari.
,,Family day,5.0,,Very good. Keep this up. The only down side was that the ferry ride could install some fans for ventilation to cool down. Otherwise everything near perfect.
,,Rainy day in River Safari,5.0,,"Excellent day spent in River Safari. Very impressive! I bought tickets beforehand, it was cheaper and no lines."
,,River safari trip,4.0,,"Interesting displays of river related species. Would be even better if there are more animals to complement the main focus on fishes. Complimentary cruise could have a better route and programme, instead of just a reservoir boat ride. Overall an interesting park that differentiates itself from the zoo and night safari."
,,A very pleasant trip to River Safari,5.0,,"I think if bring young children there, it is advised to bring some fresh fruit / snacks for him and the rest place at River Safari is very nice. Everyplace got fans and wooden benches, the family can have a good rest if feeling tired."
,,Ticket is expensive,4.0,,"it is good to bring with child to the zoo. however, the zoo is not convenience to reach, and the ticket is expensive for such a family: parents together with 2 child and one maid."
,,Rides pointless,2.0,,"Got to see the pandas and manatee which is great.. Both rides saw nothing at all (pointless), was told could go back later with stamp went all way back and one guy let us thro to the waiting area then when we got to the front was told stop re rides 30mins earlier.. So all in all a lot of money just to see few fish"
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,It’s a good experience to do river safari. Such a cool place to spend few hours and take some great shots of wild animals.
,,Great Family Excursion Destination,4.0,,I loved river safari better than zoo because it had a lot of sheltered area. And it is not huge to take entire day to explore. ONly short coming is the lack of restaurants. there is only 1 restaurant in the river safari.
,,Cousin to Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"This is the first time I visited the River Safari, which is just next to the Singapore Zoo. It is much smaller in size compared to the zoo. It is a fixed route, with covered walkway, takes about 2 hours to explore.

Being a river-theme park, it is divided into many sections – Congo River, River Nile, Yangtze River, Mekong River, Amazon River, etc. There are many informative exhibits explaining the many sea creatures and animals living along the rivers. I would think the Panda bears and manatees are the major attractions to woo visitors.

Overall, it is an informative and pleasant visit. Recommend to drop by after visiting the Singapore Zoo. Best to purchase both tickets online to avoid the queues."
,,"Truly a Must Do, Panda & Manatee",5.0,,"We did the River Safari as part of our Zoo Pass and this was a fantastic choice. The walk along the trail with large aquariums filled with such an amazing variety of fish and wildlife is just the start. Then you get to see the Panda area with both Red and Giant Panda. The River Safari is not worth the effort or the money, Do the Amazon Quest instead. Make sure you do not pass by the Manatee area, located behind Starbucks.
This was a great way to get out of the heat. This is an amazing aquarium with some beautiful large fish (Arapaima, Red Tailed Cat Fish) and a family of Manatee. Seeing these Manatee from the underwater viewing areas was wonderful. Do not miss the Giant River Otter underwater walkway."
,,comprehensive setup of exhibits,5.0,,"The River Safari is a very comprehensive setup of exhibits, allowing visitors of different language backgrounds to understand the exhibits."
,,"Well maintained, good variety, some areas a bit too small for animals",3.0,,Good trip to do with kids and explain them about the different animals. Some areas the animals have enough space not to feel sorry for them. Other were very small and kids notice some animals were not happy.
,,Must watch!,5.0,,"Excellent outing with family. My son thoroughly enjoyed it ! The attractions are really interesting, informative and well planned. When in Singapore and traveling with kids, don’t miss this attraction."
,,A little different from what I thought but ok,4.0,,"We went to this River Safari last Friday late morning. 2 Adults and 2 young children aged 3 Years and 5 Years old. It was an impromptu trip and the queue to buy the tickets was horribly long! We queued until a part where there is a sign showing to skip queue and buy tickets. Only to realize we can just buy online... Luckily I went to buy it online and skip the queue halfway...
River safari, in my mind I was thinking of the boat ride, walk via near the river etc. But then it a mixture of all. And the most surprising thing is that we get to see the panda which I though in the Zoo.
We skip the boat ride as my 3 years old is not above 1.05 meters or something. Overall it still quite an enjoyable outing with my family as we went during the 1 paying adult with 1 complimentary child promo for this month October 2017!"
,,River Safari,4.0,,"I visited the attractions with my family and 4 young children. It is a very good place to educate the young children on the animals especially the pandas from China, SiChuan. The young children have so much fun with the sea aquarium. We adults have a good time with the animals too.

There is a panda cafe and personally, I find the food and pricing are overrated. However, this is a tourist attraction thus do not expect much."
,,Fun for my 5yr old,4.0,,"Great part is the occasional A/C areas like the Panda zone.
Most of the walk areas are covered so you're protected from the sun generally...frankly an important consideration.
The line for the ride seems to be very slow (even with very few people, it took quite awhile), but ultimately, my child really enjoyed it and I got some great videos of his expressions as we went through the ride.
There is a Starbucks at the beginning which was awesome...got my ice americano and I was good to go for the rest of the day. :)
Overall, definitely go back again."
,,I love river safari,5.0,,This was our first time to visit River Safari. My kids loves this place so much Especially when they visited Panda Session. The boat ride was fun & amazing. We definitely will visit again soon.
,,Highly avoidable. Misleading name.,2.0,,"The river safari is more of a 10 minute boat ride along the periphery of the lake. No animal sighting except a couple of giraffes. Post the ride we realised that there was always no chance of us seeing any animals as the lake is surrounded by thick foliage that prevents any animal visibility.
Do the zoo. Avoid river safari."
,,Nice place,5.0,,Very nice place. Kids love it. Iy was raining heavily when we were there but was so glad that the park was sheltered throughtout. Just hoping there will be a halal eatery in the future!
,,Enjoyed the unique display of rare species,4.0,,Love much of the experience being displayed especially the rare species of fishes from small to big fishes. We just wished that the Amazon river quest is free since the ticket is already quite high especially us as foreigner.
,,Just one time!,4.0,,Amazon river quest is really fun and engaging when you pass by different species of monkeys. I didn’t find River safari boat ride great as you just take a simple boat ride in the river. There is a running commentary. But it’s more general as you can hardly relate to it while in the middle of the water. It’s juts very normal nothing extra ordinary.
,,"Very fun, informal and relaxing afternoon",4.0,,"The river Safari displays different rivers of the world in a beautiful setting. It gives a lot of interesting information which I enjoyed. You walk past huge aquariums, terrariums and ponds always next to the lake.
Highlights: Giant Panda, Giant Otters, Amazonas River Quest (though very small cages, which is disappointing. They should rather focus on small animals there like monkeys, the jaguar had a super small cage), Manatees and squirrel monkeys.
Downside: small cages at Amazonas River Quest and the very long queue at the boat trip which was included in the ticket. Though it was not crowded you had to wait more than 20 min."
,,Not bad but was expecting more.,3.0,,"Visited on a weekday afternoon which meant fewer visitors to jostle with.

Some things we liked:

- Informative exhibits and beautiful tanks to view the creatures.
- The manatee and giant otter enclosures were great, providing a good variety of perspectives to view the animals from.
- The Squirrel Monkey Forest was also really good, the monkeys are very active and lively. Observing these animals up close without a barrier makes a very different experience.

Some things we didn't:

- We went on a day in which the Amazon River Quest was closed for maintenance, which was a bad move in hindsight as that meant we missed out on a good quarter of the park.
- We were also disappointed to find that some of the animals listed on the park map weren't there.
- The park was also much smaller than expected, which did not justify the price.
- While we did manage to get a glimpse of one panda, the video feed that was supposed to show Jia Jia in her quarters looked to be pointing at a random corner in a lab. Feels like the River Safari was built specially to house the pandas; they didn't exactly fit in with the theme of the park but were made to be the star attraction."
,,River Safari,3.0,,"It's so funny to see one of the panda keeps on eating while the other one keeps on sleeping. Also, Inuka the polar bear is also entertaining especially if he's being fed."
,,Enjoyed it!!,4.0,,"This is place is really good for slightly older children in general due to the walking and heat. But is really fascinating to see all these creatures from the river from different parts of the world. We couldn't see the Panda much only a slight glimpse. Enjoyed the cruise. fascinating to see the huge fishes, sting rays. crocodiles and many more. Really good."
,,"Great, especially for the pandas!",4.0,,"We were expecting to be on a boat but actually the safari is mostly on foot. It is essentially many aquariums each representing the water life in different big rivers around the world. Well presented and interesting. The manatees were fascinating. The real bonus of the visit (and actually the reason we went) were the pandas! They have one red panda and two giant pandas which are absolutely adorable!! We were lucky enough to watch them eat, which is absolutely fascinating! There were not too many people there when we visited so we stayed longer than one hour watching them. Wonderful!"
,,Do not skip the River Safari!,5.0,,"This place was amazing. There were so many animals to see. They have designed it very well so that you can see the enclosures and animals easily. Getting around with a pram was easy too.

The manatees in particular were absolutely mesmerising. You can view them from different levels - above the water, walking down a ramp to see them swimming deep under the water.

We also really enjoyed seeing the pandas."
,,"Quite a lot to see, be prepared to walk a lot",4.0,,"Be prepared to walk a lot as unlike the zoo, there is no tram service, and everything that is good to see is laid out along the path (so basically there is only one path). Honestly, the animals here are not as interesting as in the zoo. The River Safari consists more of fishes, monkeys, the Panda, and the Red Panda. Tried the river boat once and will not try it again. It is a pricey short ride and I didn't get to see much. It's more for the novelty of taking a boat ride. Kids will still like it, of course. You can probably spend 2 - 3 hours here but probably not much longer, as compared to the zoo."
,,Brilliant place for kids,5.0,,The place is not too big so its good for toddlers whose attention span is short and good for older kids to go 2 rounds. Very educational.
,,Enjoyable & Interesting Attraction,4.0,,"This attraction was set out very well with easy to follow covered paths, interesting information boards and great viewing windows. It was fascinating to see and learn about the creatures that inhabit many of the world's great rivers.
Many highlights including the fun to watch Giant Otters and seeing the elusive and adorable Manatees. The baby Manatee was very cute. We were very fortunate to see the Giant Pandas being active (our taxi driver said each time he'd been they were either sleeping or in their dens).
I think the name of this attraction can be slightly misleading, initially we thought there would be a lot of boat travel, but really only a 15min circuit trip around a reservoir with jungle coming to it's edges & no real sightings of animals. We took it as an opportunity to sit down, relax and enjoy the view. Overall a very enjoyable and interesting attraction, would recommend."
,,IsLa's Panda!!,5.0,,"The place is really great even if we come here often. Have a lot of covered walks so even if it rains you won't get wet. The main attraction for this place, I think, are the Panadas. You may be luck enough to spot the Panada out. Kids love this area as they can learn a lot from what type of animals are there. Be sure to bring extra clothes for your kids as they might get wet for the long walks. While you are here you can go also to Singapore Zoo just a few meters away. One tip is to go there during weekdays as not to crowded."
,,kai kai superstar,5.0,,the real great aytraction of river safari is the couple of giant panda: kai kai the male and jia jia the female. she is shy and she loves to stay alons most of the time. he is bubble and outgoing. he had a lot of permomers for us eating playing jumping and yawning. for my children kai kai is the best memorie of singapore s holiday
,,nice walk,3.0,,"compared to when it first started, must say that there have been improvements made. however the panda reserve is pretty much extremely crowded especially during weekends or holidays. too noisy to really admire the pandas. other than the pandas, the amazon forest ride is the other must try ride. but its only by the ride which is additional ticket, you cant walk. the normal cruise usually included with the entrance ticket is really something you can skip."
,,Very good,4.0,,"A great activity that you can do when it rains as it is all covered. A great way to learn and educate kids about rainforests, pandas, crocodiles and many different ecosystems. Boat ride was ok but not amazing. The additional ride on the boat (extra fees) was very good. Do this before heading off to the night safari"
,,Awesome 👏,5.0,,"Kids & adults will have so much fun. They will also walk a lot
The panda house is a must. Don't give up & return one more time if you didn't manage to see her in your 1st round. Also the amazon boat is amazing. Don't miss it."
,,Not worth the money,3.0,,"Was attracted by the posters about the boat riding so I brought my family there for a visit. It turned out that my kids were too young to go for the adventure boat tour, and the free boat ride was quite a disappointment - it was merely a ride around the reservoir and we had to peep into the animals in Singapore zoo (but there's no guarantee if you can spot them). The marine part was still worth seeing and the area was under air conditioning, but it was hor to go through the rest, and I'm not too sure why the panda were not placed at the Singapore zoo instead. It feels like someone wanted to place a bit of everything in the river safari, but it rather confused the visitors of what was the main exhibit."
,,Truly living up to its name as a river safari,4.0,,"A less humid and pleasant experience compared to the Singapore Zoo, with sneak peeks into the lives of 2 pandas, Kai Kai & Jia Jia. Great that the boat ride is now included in the admission ticket. Kids enjoyed the experience."
,,"Just Ok, nothing more.",3.0,,We were expecting some excitement like the other attractions in Singapore but what was offered by this is just an Ok experience. Even though the attraction is named as River Safari no river cruise was included to the ticket price! So you have to buy them separately again going through a queue and waiting for almost 30 minutes to get in to Amazon boat ride is not justified at all. The Amazon boat ride is just too boring and lasted only a couple of minutes. The only cool thing my kids enjoyed is looking at the panda and we were wondering why the panda was not in the zoo but in the river safari.
,,Really great,5.0,,Great fun place the pandas are amazing!!!!!!!!! Recommend paying a tiny bit extra to do the boat ride it was really fun if you visiting the zoo this is right next to it definitely take a visit too the river safari.
,,Not value for money,1.0,,Biggest let down of trip to Singapore. River cruise - massive line up for a 15. Min trip. If you are lucky you might see a giraffe. This is not a tour I would recommend.
,,Book tickets online,4.0,,"First step- book tickets online. It saves both time and money because of separate smaller queue for collection of tickets and discounts of around 20%.

Second - carry water and hats though a lot of the exhibits are indoors. The safari takes you through the great rivers of the world in a thoughtfully planned path.

Third - children and adults will both enjoy this place if they know what they are going for - it is a river safari not a safari on river - at the end you will leave the place knowing a lot of interesting facts about the great rivers from around the world.

Fourth - cruise or amazon boat ride? We chose amazon boat ride as the other reviews advised us to. The river cruise is just that - a cruise in the river, or so I read in the reviews here. The amazon boat ride is a short fun extra to experience a bit of what comes to mind when one thinks of ""river safari"".
Fifth - the pandas are great - because they are in a big air conditioned enclosure - means we get a much needed respite from the heat and get to spend time admiring the bamboo eaters.
Finally - a great way to spend two hours. It is better to visit in the second half of the day to avoid the extreme heat that we experienced between 1 pm to 3 pm. While leaving we wished we had arrived at around 4 pm. The views of the river and the animals are great. Overall a very good way to spend time away from Malls in Singapore."
,,Another great place to visit.,5.0,,"The River Safari is a long walk, about 3 kms. (There are mobility Scooters available )
It is well worth the visit with fish aquariums, Panda bears & Show & Tell exhibits.
There are fish from all over the world, some are quite big, a really great exhibit.
The boat ride is just that, a boat ride nothing exciting.
Well worth the visit"
,,A highlight,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the River Safari (more than the Night Safari). See lots of really unusual animals and in a different way. It took us about 3hours to see everything and it was a leisurely easy walk through the park. Buy a park hopper pass to save money. We did this the day after night safari, and we pleased we split up the visits so we were less tired and enjoyed the both more as a result.
The River ride (included in your ticket) was a bit disappointing. However the Amazon River Ride ($5 extra) was outstanding especially seeing the jaguar. At lunchtime on a Monday there was no queue.
Other highlights included the red panda, giant pandas and squirrel monkeys. You can also peer through to the polar bear enclosure at the zoo."
,,Nice but rather as appendix do the zoo and not stand alone,3.0,,"Good concept, but lacks to my pov the exitement of the zoo. The river cruise is quiet boring. The ""rafting"" doesnt justify the ques (on a weekednd)"
,,The panda's were the best!,4.0,,"River Safari coupled with Singapore Zoo makes sense and is cost effective. The RF by itself, I think, falls short of meeting expectations.97 The boat ride around the lake is a total waste of time! Although, as you exit the area, the underwater animals are unique and well worth viewing. I would give the combined activities 8 out 10! MAKE SURE TO BOOK TOGETHER!"
,,River cruise,5.0,,"Great way to see nature, animals and river landscapes while cruising the river. A safe conducted cruise will give wonderful views of nature along the River."
,,"Big aquariums, Amazon river quest",3.0,,We enjoyed the Amazon river quest ride only. But it is not included in the fair and a big queue with waiting period of around one hour. The river river cruise is not good. For each river there are big aquariums with the animals can be found in that river. Watching giant panda eating bamboo was a good experience. Kids will enjoy 3 hours there.
,,Just Ok :),3.0,,"If you have seen night safari then you can go for river safari once.
Since it has some new things which you wont find in Night Safari.
The best part is the boat ride where you travel by boat to watch animals .
If you have not white PolarBear in life then this place is must for you .
Overall a good time spend but i recommend Singapore Zoo is better than Night or River Safari."
,,River that didnt flow to my heart at all,2.0,,"This is my 2nd visit
Apart from the large tank (indoor) and some special species, honestly the concept is still not strong enough for me. Most importantly, the tickets don't come cheap..
Not sure why pandas is not in the zoo of sg instead?

While it has 2 types of rides, both didn't wow me at all
Views of animals on the adventure ride need you to be sharp and observant in order to capture the animals fast

Put your money somewhere else!"
,,Good to Visit - Not as good as the Zoo - Expensive,4.0,,Review by Dr Sim. Good to visit but not as good as the zoo. Enjoyable walk. Does not feel as big as the zoo. Tourists can visit this after they visit the zoo and night safari. A bit expensive. Regards Dr Sim
,,Nice Park,5.0,,We enjoy this lovely and exciting place.Feel good while watching Panda eating the bamboo. We enjoy the boat ride
,,Pandas !!!,5.0,,One of the highlights of the river safari were the 3 cute pandas. We watched them for a good part of an hour seeing them feed on the bamboo sticks A must visit
,,"3 Hours of Impressive, Enjoyable Stroll",4.0,,"This was our second visit to the river safari. Our first visit was several months after the park was initially opened and the Amazon river (& ride) were still not ready.

Although our 2nd visit, we have thoroughly enjoyed the 3 hours spent here.

To be able to see the aquatic animals of the major rivers of the world close up and learn a thing or two was amazing.

The big bonus was the close up with the red panda who seems to know how to stop and pause fir photo shoot (kai kai was sleeping and jia jia resting indoor).

And the enclosure for the squirrel monkey !

The whole park was very organised and professionally managed.

Would recommend anyone passing Singapore, especially with young kids to visit at least once..."
,,Love the River Safari!,5.0,,"Loved the trip there, amazing opportunity to see the fishes and other animals upclose, as well as some of the feeding. Brought my own food and snacks as was warned that food stalls on the inside may be a little pricey. Staff was also very polite and helpful, great service."
,,Impressive if you have the stamina,4.0,,"The river safari highlights some of the great waterways of the world and the species that inhabit them. It is rounded off with a river cruise where some of the zoo animals can be viewed from the water. Having done the zoo trip beforehand, our legs were begging for mercy and it partly spoiled the experience."
,,Enjoyable with some specific highlights,4.0,,"Visited River safari today. Another great exhibition for the zoo. A wide variety of animals including many fish species, pandas, monkeys and more. The river cruise which is included was a bit boring and there isn't really any wild life to see ( they suggest you might see lizards and frogs which give how far out on the lake you are is doubtful).

The Amazon river ride is well worth the extra (or you should just purchase the four park hopper which is fantastic value and includes this ride). You move quickly but they give you the option to ride again if you didn't get a great looks.

We visited on a Wednesday morning arriving at 11 am and spent 2 hours here. It was quite quiet at the time."
,,Not really a river safari,4.0,,"Calling it a river safari is very misleading as the river safari lasts ten minutes. I would be more inclined to call it a zoo or aquarium.

You get to see pandas, polar bear, giraffes, monkeys and lots of sea creatures by foot. This was a good day out but not what we were expecting as we were expecting to see all of the animals whilst in a boat."
,,Company Outing,4.0,,"Colleagues and I really enjoyed our visit. The variety of fresh water species is amazing. How they themed each section by the world's we'll know river is enjoyable as it is educational. Thoroughly like this place, will bring my friends here again."
,,Put this on your list when in Singapore,5.0,,First time to this attraction. It is a must for the family as it has everything for all to see and experience. Paid $22 with Hotel and got discount price. This river Safari is great and make sure you also see the Amazon Rain Forrest exhibit included in the price.
,,A different experience,5.0,,The river Safari is such a unique experience that it's definitely worthwhile to visit! We walked round in about 4/5 hours including both boat rides before going to the Night Safari. There is lots of information about the animals and the different rivers of the world. River Safari does a great job in promoting awareness about these beautiful species and how we can help to ensure their survival.
,,Great way to learn about water inhabitants,4.0,,This place is located just next to Singapore zoo and is a great attraction for all group of people. This place also offers a river safari and also amazon boat ride. I found the boat ride better as it takes you through a narrow tunnel of water with animals on both sides of the bank. The ride is for 10 mins only but worth it. You need to purchase separate tickets for this ride. River safari also allows you to get a glimpse of the great panda. This place is different from the SEA aquarium in Sentosa as it offers different species of animals along with different rides
,,Informative & leisurely,3.0,,"We found the River Safari to be a well designed & interesting circuit giving an insight into the aquatic inhabitants of the worlds rivers.
You could do this at your own pace and the boardwalks were mostly covered from sun & rain.
The motorised river safari was relaxing & languid but could have showcased the Zoo animals a bit better... maybe trimming some foliage to enable better viewing.
We enjoyed the concept of the Amazon quest but most animals were sleeping when we chose to visit.
All in all a pleasant experience."
,,Learn about river ecosystems,4.0,,"River Safari takes you through the various river ecosystems around the world, introducing the animals that live in and around the rivers. There is a particular emphasis on conservation, reminding visitors to protect the environment.

The two adorable giant pandas are definitely one of the highlights of the visit. No queue when I visited on a weekday afternoon.

Takes about 2-3 hours if you stroll through the various exhibits and rides. Sheltered most of the way and still possible to visit while raining. Definitely combine with a visit to the Zoo and Night Safari and spend an entire day in the Mandai area."
,,Interesting but wanted more....,3.0,,"The river safari in itself was great travelling up the river and enjoying the enclosures was a treat. Take ur walking shoes and water bottle to make it easier and more enjoyable. It was well organised. You can easily do this and the zoo on the same day. We were a little disappointed with the internal boat ride that you pay extra for...very few animals seen, although information was interesting. All in all a good ecperience."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Its a must do while in Singapore. Different rivers with their respective aquatic life is amazingly presented in this attraction. Touch pool was especially cool. And jelly fish area is a must visit.
,,Outdoors but glad it was mostly sheltered,4.0,,"We visited the River Safari after a morningn at the Zoo next door.

It was almost 100% sheltered all the way with a scattering of air-conditioning, so it was enjoyable to explore.

Saw some animals that I've never seen in my life! The kids definitely enjoyed it. There was a long queue for the river boat ride (there are 2 different rides and we took the one suitable for younger kids). Skip the ride, you won't miss much."
,,Not overly impressed,1.0,,"I did the tourist thing with the family to this well advertised park, but it didn't live up to expectations with insult thrown in telling me we had to pay for the Amazon Boat ride in addition to the admission fee.

The river cruise was only realistically a short 15 min trip around the lake showing some animals from the zoo next door. To be honest I don't know now what they were trying to pitch as the message/purpose of the river cruise.

The restaurants outside of the park in the main area need to be clearer in their advertising that they all close at 6pm. However, there are restaurants by the night safari park but again it wasn't clearly stated which is frustrating when you have waited patiently in a queue to be told they are not serving any longer.

So overall disappointed."
,,River Safari with 3 kids,5.0,,"This was much better than we expected. As everything else in Singapore, it is well organised, well controlled and in perfect condition. We thought that we would do the River Safari as we have done zoos before and thought that we would try something different. There is a lot of interesting information to read and most of it is in English and there is a lot around protecting our rivers. It focuses on the world's biggest rivers and there are numerous water tanks showing all kinds of fish from piranha's to Asian crocodiles. Most of the tanks are quite spacious and laid out really well. Some of the fish are HUGE and amazing to see. The other benefit of this trail is that you see the pandas half way around and they are a delight to see. After the pandas there are toilets and refreshments. You then walk across a bridge and can get on the river cruise on the pier down on the left. It only takes 40 at a time but runs regularly. You get to see some of the animals from the zoo such as giraffes and elephants (if you are lucky). There is another mini boat ride that you can do near there but you have to buy tickets. It is very cheap and worth doing as you see a lot of other interesting creatures. Walking back you see other animals and our favourite was the monkey cage where you walk amongst spider monkeys that leap from branch to branch. As an added bonus, you get to walk through the acquariums and some of those tanks are bigger than my house! So much to see, so fun to do and both adults and kids loved this trip."
,,Very Good,4.0,,River Safari is a part of the Singapore zoo complex although one has to buy separate tickets for it. The most interesting part is the Amazon River quest wherein one gets to see the animals up very close. Great thing to do with family and kids.
,,Good set up,4.0,,"Can be done in just a few hours at a leisurely pace, which includes the River Safari Cruise and Amazon River Quest. The great thing is that there is only one path to follow, which is almost totally sheltered, so you are pretty much guaranteed to see every display. Even though it is a river safari, there is a panda display. The panda enclosure is fantastic."
,,Super interesting if you're into zoos and stuff!,5.0,,Worth a visit! The pandas are really adorable and it's the best part of trip cause that area is air conditioned! Both the boat rides were fun and informative too
,,Better than expected.,4.0,,"We went next door to the River Safari after visiting the Zoo. We weren't sure what to expect but it was pretty cool. There are a huge amount of fish and fresh water life here along with some Pandas. There a cool little boat trip that takes you around some animals that live near or rely on rivers for their survival and also an animal show where you can view up close and even pet different birds and reptiles. Our kids 7, 9 and 11) enjoyed this venue and it's absolutely right next door to the Zoo....2 minute walk."
,,Worth it!,5.0,,"If you go to Singaoore, dont ever miss this place. You will see the funny panda there. You will ride a boat to see the animal. The olace was really worth it to visit."
,,Something different from the Zoos and Underwater world,4.0,,"Include if you had time but this quiet different to the Zoo, Underwater world and Night safari. Panda are the best thing here."
,,Include if you have time - otherwise not,3.0,,"We spent around 2 hours here (from 5 to 7 pm). Since we arrived quite late - we combined this with the Night Safari - it was very easy to get around. No crowds. On the other hand, not many shows or viewings. We did get to se the pandas and other animals, and we touched the crabs and sea stars. Some in our group took the river tour, others (including me) the Amazon quest. If you're only going to do one, I highly recommend the Amazon quest - this was one of the highlights!"
,,Pandas and more,5.0,,It was a beautiful and relaxing visit. The two pandas were so great to seem. The Manatees was cute and the views of all the living creatures from seven rivers of the world was extra special.
,,River safari next to Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"Interesting aquarium styled attraction, with various river systems such as Amazon well represented.
The River Safari also has some animals including the beautiful red pandas as well as the giant pandas.
Boat rides available which were interesting and provided enjoyment for the children.
Finishes with a walk through monkey enclosure with very small monkeys"
,,RIver Safari,4.0,,"Overall a very good experience spoilt by duplication of some animals in the main zoo as seen from the boat trip on the lake. The ""tracked"" water ride through enclosures was however fun as was seeing manatees in the big indoor tank. Good views of the pandas too. One huge crocodile on show."
,,Singaore river safari,4.0,,"I thouroughly enjoyed my time at the river safari. It was completely different than i thought it would be. The exhibits were excellent especially the equariam which had an assortmentent size fish. The trip on the reservoir wasn,t much for the time you had to que and didnt see a fish. Boring for younger children. We did the 3 attractions in one day, very tiring. Staff were very helpful and a number of places to eat."
,,Weekend Activity,4.0,,The cleanliness and good design of the river safari building is very welcoming. The animals kept very well and healthy. Animals from Amazon can be seen here as one of the highlights same like manatees. Enjoyed the weekend at River Safari
,,Good Initiative !,4.0,,"This is new kind of initiative and definitely interesting. Must visit it to experience it. Lot to see like the Amazon Quest, Panda Exhibit and much more. Lot of efforts to make this new attraction. Its damn cheap if we combine all 4 parks tickets we get around 50% discount."
,,Good experience,5.0,,"A nice place to visit! So many animals, fishes to see A good boat cruise A nice place to spent your day"
,,Good place to visit.. Amazon crest was crazy,4.0,,It was great experience seeing live Panda..sea creatures.. all age grp enjoyed a lot..River safari was OK and can be avoided But Amazon crest was crazy..must go I have taken coupon of all 4 places hence tram and amazon was free to us
,,Good,3.0,,Visited River Safari on he same day as our zoo trip. They are right beside each othe and got a ticket bundle to save money. The only reason we wanted to do it was to see the pandas. It is well set out and you are navigated through the displays. Boat ride and Safari River ride ok - it was nice to sit down after a big morning at the zoo. If you have the time do both in one day. I wouldn't necessarily go there just for that.
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Loved it. Really informative and fun and very cleaver my done with the small / distinct separate river system exhibits from all around the world.

Heavy emphasis on conservation & sustainability.

Panda exhibit was amazing. We saw both out & about. Really special.

Free boat trip is a bit crap, to be honest: 10 minutes around the reservoir.

Additional Amazon experience is worth the money.

Best of the lot...the dugongs! Massive aquarium holding these majestic creatures. Could have watched for hours."
,,A Refreshing Venue on a hot day,4.0,,"We purchased an all inclusive 4-Park Hopper which included the two river cruises in this park. We decided to do the Amazon Quest twice as it’s over so quickly you don’t get enough time to have a good look at the animals.

We enjoyed watching the languidly feeding Pandas and would’ve loved to see the Red Panda moving about but it was happily snoozing up in its nest.

The reason we decided to do this first and the Zoo second was because we’d heard that rain was more likely in the afternoon and in the event of wet weather the river cruises are halted with no refunds issued."
,,Average. Head to the Zoo Instead.,3.0,,"I am an a fan of visiting places like the Zoo however I was pretty disappointed with my visit to River Safari.

Honestly, it could have been much better and I was expecting more of the ""River"" experience to view the various parts of the attraction.

Most likely you will spend an hour or so in here. Food is overpriced (this is normal. Same goes to other local attractions). Crowd is manageable.
Still, it might be worth your time if its your first time visiting.

On a side note, just head to the Singapore Zoo instead."
,,My baby enjoyed it,5.0,,"We visited the River Safari with my 6.5 months baby, and she loved it! Though the weather was hot, it helps that this attraction is sheltered, meaning rain or shine you can still enjoy it. Some parts were air conditioned, some were open air.

Most important to note for parents bringing their infants, there are plenty of nursing/diaper changing rooms available, at every toilet area, makes it very convenient for us. Point to note there is no hot water in the room so bring your own thermos flask.

My baby enjoyed looking at the fishes the most so we will be back for more in future. There is a height limit so we didn't take the amazon boat ride, the free river cruise is available to us but the weather was too warm to bring baby on board.

You can complete this place in about 2 hours. Great for new parents like us."
,,Simply educational.,4.0,,The place have different species of fishes plus the 2 pandas as one of the best attraction. Recommended for parents for environmental awareness for their kids.
,,Surprising Cool place to visit,4.0,,"In a hot country, this is a cool place to visit to go near to the animal! Kids like to ride on those fake crocodile, bear etc! The kid enjoy it, we also enjoy it!"
,,Recommended,5.0,,Very enjoyable stroll. Highly suggest the amazon over the river cruise because the former will allow you to see more animals like the adorable capybaras while the latter is scenic.
,,Average,3.0,,"The park is well kept and well layed out. It's really cool to be able to get so close and walk around with the lil monkeys jumping around you. However the river boat ride is too fast. You don't get a chance to see all the animals. Also sad to see the animals in small enclosures too. Still recommend going though, especially for young families."
,,A mixed bag,3.0,,"The amazon safari ride was well worth it and is included in the price paid for the River Safari. However, the river safari boat ride itself was a waste of money. Fortunately, there were a number of aspects to the River Safari experience which meant that the one boat ride made up only one element. The price of the experience was worth it if you factor in everything. The one thing that really bothered me was the Panda exhibit. I thought it was cruel to have a timid and shy animal in an enclosure with noisy kids racing around and unintentionally upsetting it. It also looked out of place in a zoo located so close to the equator."
,,Wouldn't bother,1.0,,"I was really disappointed with this. They advertised a river safari so I was expecting to be in a boat the whole the time but that wasn't the case. You walk round and there is a 10 min boat ride at the end.
The zoo and night safari are much better"
,,Boring,1.0,,"Our tour company had booked the River Safari and Singapore Zoo trip for us. The Singapore Zoo was an amazing experience and probably by far the best zoo I have ever been to.

The River Safari, however, was meh. The cruise itself was boring and didn't see much of anything while on the cruise. The pandas were dead tired in their exhibit and just laid around looking quite sad. I get it though, it was how I felt since this river safari was so boring."
,,River Safari,3.0,,"We only had time to do the River Safari. I was expecting a ""boat based"" experience, but that was only a very small (and disappointing) part of the experience. The River Safari is focused on aquatic life. It is mainly a walking journey past lots of glass enclosures containing all sorts of fish and water-dwelling creatures. I expected a much more natural setting. The giant Pandas form a part of the journey, although somewhat out of context with a river/water based experience. The cruise part was a big let down. Just a bunch of visitors sitting in a small ferry boat, motoring around a lake-like setting, with a few giraffes and water birds on view in the bushes along the shore. My advice for visitors to the Singapore Zoo would be to see the main Zoo before contemplating the River Safari."
,,A look at the rivers of the world,3.0,,"This is a unique concept that doubles as an aquarium. We purchased as a part of the 4 parks for 69 SGD. The ticket price included the River Cruise. The River Cruise was disappointing, as the boat takes you along the back of the zoo, where you can barely see the giraffes, rhinos and elephants and then makes a wide turn and then back to the dock. The highlight of the River Safari was seeing the Giant Pandas exhibit. The exhibit included a male and female panda and a red panda. The female panda was ""shy"" and prefers the cage instead and supposedly could be seen on the CCTv. She must have been sleep, because we didn't see her."
,,Great Place for observing water animals,5.0,,"There're a lot fishes from Amazon River, SEA Rivers, etc and also a Mega Water Tank for dugongs. We also like to see Pandas as we amaze with the design of the place.
If you plan to visit Singapore Zoo and River Safari at the same day, I recommend to visit the zoo in the morning and then River Safari in the afternoon to avoid hot weather."
,,Great Place for Family with Children Holiday,4.0,,"+ Plenty of interesting animal but most of it is fish
+ Highlight of the zoo is the Red Panda dan Giant Panda (come around 11 am - 12 pm, if you are lucky it time to feed them, if not you'll only see them sleeping)
+ A very clean zoo
+ Informative and helpful zoo guide and staff"
,,It's indoors!,4.0,,"The river safari is smaller than the zoo, but you would still need at least about 2-3 hours to enjoy the exhibits.
There are lots to read and learn about the fishes that we don't normally encounter in our daily lives and to read about the role rivers play in the whole ecology.
What i really like is that it's mostly indoors and sheltered, which makes for a good stroll with kids and they won't get antsy quickly.
The pandas are like a distraction from all the fishes, but they are adorable :)

There's a ride within River Safari, called Amazon Quest. $5 for adults, $3 for kids. unlimited rides. I thought this was quite worth it, although it's a small circuit, but it's fun for the kids with some animals for the camera-clicking adult.

Been twice, will go again."
,,Plenty for 'River Monsters' fans,4.0,,"If you're a fan of the TV show 'River Monsters', you will love the River Safari, and there are plenty of interesting critters to see even if you don't know an arapaima from a goonch (yes, our family are fans). Some of the larger and in some cases rarer creatures include the alligator snapping turtle, giant salamander and Mekong giant catfish. The manatee exhibit is very good, and the panda exhibit allows visitors a good close look at the pandas without a glass barrier. One tip, though: do not pay the extra S$11 for the Amazon River Quest, which is just past the halfway point of the park. It's not the money I object to, it's the fact that the boats in which visitors ride move too fast and therefore do not allow a decent look at the exhibits along the waterway. The 2-for-1 Park Hopper deal available online from the Singapore Zoo is good value if you have slightly old children. We visited the River Safari before stopping for a meal and then viewing the Night Safari. If you take that approach, the Park Hopper deal gives you the second park for only about $30 more than the full price of the Night Safari."
,,Decent if you love fishes !!!!,4.0,,"We thought it would be a safari on a boat but it was not . Boat is just a small part of it.

River safari is located next to the zoo and brings in fishes and wild life near rivers from around the world . It takes about 2hrs. Two highlights are 1) penguins which are at the end 2) Amazon River cruise which showcases wild life near Amazon River .

I suggest to do this attraction with the zoo. Don't go there just for this."
,,Great experience for a good 2hr stroll,4.0,,Really enjoyed the thematic of the rivers across the world. Very informative in the exhibits shown and the animals were interesting to see as well. The river quest was worth it for 5SGD.
,,Pandas and apache gunship saved the day!,3.0,,To be honest this place was a bit of a let down after heading to the amazing zoo next door. The highlight were the pandas and also an apache gunship helicopter that flew past from the next door military base.
,,Easy breezy,5.0,,"Took an uber to 80 Mandai Lake (river safari) same place as SG zoo & Night Safari. I thought we were going late at 4:15pm but it was just right as it was not too hot. My nephew really enjoyed seeing all the river animals, aquarium, manatees, rays, a leopard & panda viewing on site!
Bring bottled water & a fan as it gets pretty hot! Worth taking river quest ride just so you get to see the flamingos, tapir, kapibaras etc. All in all fun! If you have the extra energy (since you're already there) proceed to night safari after! Singapore residents currently get 15% off if you buy tickets online!"
,,The animals are so sad,3.0,,This entertainment center is clean and well organized but the animals are sad because they are being imprisoned even though they did not do anything bad to humans.
,,Quite small and not very interesting,3.0,,Some animals you already see it in zoo. People come here to see the panda but sometimes the panda is not there (either sleep or doing some medical checkup). The boat ride is quite fun but it cost SGD5 per person
,,Great couple of hours,5.0,,"Check out the river safari. Great aquariums with lots is different fish. Panda and polar bear great to see and cool down in as well.Don't bother waiting in line for the boat cruise at the bottom of park. Waste of time. Just saw water and bushes, no animals, only 15 mins.also the other ride that you line up for was just ok. Nothing special.we did this park with the zoo and night safari in one day."
,,Become like a child again!,5.0,,"The whole River Safari experience is absolutely fabulous! It is a river-themed zoological park and aquarium located between the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari. The exhibits are very well presented and well laid out so you don't miss anything as you amble through. All the creatures are visible and accessible and some of the aquariums are on a remarkable scale. The Manatees in particular are awesome to see in surroundings that mimic their natural environment! As part of the River Safari we were able to view the Pandas which was very special indeed. Again, both pandas were easily visible and feeding when we visited. The Amazon River Quest 'boat' ride is particularly exciting and children would absolutely love it! There is also an opportunity to take a short boat trip on the Upper Seletar Reservoir! There are numerous opportunities to eat along the way as well at reasonable prices. This was a really fabulous day!"
,,Awesome Manatees Exhibit,4.0,,"This is my third visit to River Safari. The Amazon River Quest Boat ride was a fun experience. Online purchase of tickets allow Singaporeans to get 15% discount and foreigners get 5% discount. Early visit is recommended even during the weekdays to avoid large crowds. The Red Pandas are more interesting to watch althought the two Pandas, Kai Kai & Jia Jia are always popular with all visitors. Definitely a fun outing experience for families and friends."
,,Worth the trip,4.0,,"I ought to choose river safari instead of Singapore zoo since I would love to see pandas, manatees and polar bear. Though you could also see mr. polar bear at singapore zoo but mr and mrs Panda can only be seen at river safari."
,,Awe for first-time visitors,3.0,,"We brought some friends who have never been to the River Safari on a Sunday in mid June. It was not that awfully crowded. We had an elderly amongst us. Fortunately wheelchair could be easily requested from the customer service.

It was a simple walk through the sheltered park. The variety of river life on display was vast and captivating. All of us enjoyed it. The highlight was the pandas. We were lucky to be able to catch one of them awake and eating. The other was asleep. Well, of course the other enjoyable thing was that this area is air conditioned, so a good change from the hot weather outside.

The river cruise was just a leisurely 10-min cruise out onto the waters and back. Nothing very spectacular. The other boat ride which we had to pay was more exciting. Go on it to find out.

The rest of the route back was not to bad, continue viewing the river life. My friends who had never been there before found the place interesting.

Overall experience was so-so.

Parking there for a whole day is reasonable. But you probably need only about 2-3 hours and you can finish walking around the whole park. Food in there is nothing to shout about and pricey.

I think if you have friends visiting, the zoo is a more fun place to visit. Need more time for that. But the river safari is weather-proof- rain or shine, you can go! It is also wheel-chair friendly."
,,What an amazing day,5.0,,"The River Safari sounded pretty good when we read about it and for S$21 a person, seemed quite reasonable. But wow, talk about value for money! There is so much to see and do, it took us over half a day. Starts with a walking safari looking at a number of major river systems in the world which was simply wonderful. Saw so many wierd and wonderful fish and learnt so much about the various river systems. Then first of all, the red panda, followed by our first sight if the black and white panda. So cute. Following this a river cruise observing natural wildlife and some of the animals in the zoo. Then down to the Amazon River cruise which in itself was great, but seeing jaguars and pink flamingos (that looked more orange than pink) up close was something else. Enjoyed this so much, went back for a second ride. Then to end the day, a walk through the spider monkey enclosure. All in all a simply wonderful outing, one that I would highly recommend. And for the S$21 charge, now that is what I call value for money."
,,Interesting but nothing much,3.0,,"It's a zoo but with a different concept. Interesting attractions such as the polar bear, panda, and all sorts of fresh water fish.

If you've been to S.E.A Aquarium, and Singapore zoo, this place is a bit redundant per say, however, what you see here are mostly, fresh water creatures, with the exception of the Polar bear.

The actual river cruise was a 10-15min cruise on a very short distance, nothing much to see, but the White rhyno's, Giraffe, some birds - all these are if you're lucky enough to spot them. Otherwise, nothing special.

A bit disappointing to have to purchase the Amazon river cruise ticket separately, as it's already inside the River safari location, why does it need to be a separate purchase?"
,,2nd visit,3.0,,"Came back here for a second visit, a few years after the first. This time we have an annual pass to the 4 parks so it makes sense to use it. River Safari really isn't that special though. A few interesting fresh water fish, some pandas and boat rides and you're pretty much done. The zoo is a better bet."
,,average,3.0,,not much inside. only takes less than 2hours until see all the animals. take bus for 1-2hours ride to the river safari.
,,Awesome Kai-Kai and Jiah-Jiah,4.0,,1. Two giant pandas are main attraction of River Safari. 2. Squirrel Monkeys are very good. 3. One big anaconda is also attraction of this place.
,,Panda perfection,5.0,,Our reason for taking a longer lay-over in Singapore was to see the pandas at river safari and we were not dissapointed at all. What a fantastic experience! The whole river safari park was a great experience. We ended up spending about 4 hours there to really see and experience all the park had to offer. Great variety of fish and animals and presented in a fun and educational way.
,,Fun,5.0,,It was tiring but worth it. I didn't see any shuttle inside the River Safari wo we had to walk. My kids were fascinated with the pandas. We had a good time.
,,My 5yr old simply loved this place,4.0,,"Being in Singapore for many years, this was our first visit to River Safari. The climate was pleasant as it had rained the whole of previous night.
The place is full of marine life. Have been to SEA Aquarium many times (my daughter is an expert at sea creatures through books and the cartoon series Octonaughts). This place was similar in many ways and yet had some things unique.
The walk along is not taxing. If u have young children and elderly, it's very easy to take them along. The only issue we had was the restrooms. There is one at the entrance and the next one only after visiting the Panda.
I will strongly recommend this place as it's value for money. Btw don't compare this place with zoo and night safari. It's animals vs marine life.
Visit the Panda kitchen and taste the ""Panda Pau"" (Red bean and Chocolate Custard flavours). The Giant Panda Cappuccino is good too."
,,Doesn't really worth your time..,2.0,,"..if you are on short trip in Spore.
The panda's den is the one reason you may really want to see the whole section of the zoo and is clearly set in this area for one good reason.
Don't expect much more from the huge water tanks and info boards about earth's most famous rivers.
The River safari on the ferry is probably the most disappointing part of it.
Try Lochness (boring!) ferry cruise with a better chance of sightseeing.
The ferry dock is also set unreasonably far from the entrance to make you lose some more time walking around..."
,,"Cool exhibits, but I prefer the Zoo and Night Safari",4.0,,"The River Safari houses a huge variety of wildlife that you would not see in a typical zoo, from prehistoric types like sturgeons to the mesmerizing manatees to what were undoubtedly the star of the park, the pandas.

Unfortunately those were the few highlights for me as I am not terribly fond of fishes (and trust me, there were loads of them). The river cruise was calm and relaxing but was essentially a ride in a reservoir, while the Amazon River Quest boat ride was cool but finished way too quickly for the extra money paid.

Another downside of the park is the lack of affordable & tasty food options.

Both the zoo and night safari are better value, in my opinion."
,,Purely for Kids,2.0,,River Safari is purely for kids less than 10'year old; boring experience for others. Lot of tanks and deferent type of species: routes named after rivers ! Giant Panda is the only interesting option. Amazon river experience is decent considering the Flamingo and tiger ! I ended up liking the Squirrel Monkey in the end !
,,Small but interesting park,4.0,,"Best thing about the River Safari is that you can still visit it during a downpour. Most of the park is sheltered. I like the focus on aquatics although some of the tanks are a bit small and overcrowded.

An easy park to visit, take your time at the exhibits, best being the manatee exhibit. You"
,,Half a day trip,3.0,,"If u are a fan of wild life, go ahead & explore. Lots of fishes though, the animals like monkeys are in cages. I'd say it's cheaper than Sea Aquarium, with huge tanks & such. There is a 10-mins boat ride along the reservoir - this one is free.

There's the River Cruise Amazon; the boat ride (although it is like the main attraction) isnt worth it. Especially if u have to pay for the ride. I'll pass.

U may want to catch the 2 pandas; kai kai & Jia Jia. It can be a long wait but the viewing is merely less than 10-mins - no talking allowed. Only whispers as it might causes stress to the 2 pandas.

Food wise - non-halal is available in the river safari. Halal ones are outside. Snacks n drinks are a bit pricey. It's advisable to bring a water bottle and refill them up from the water stations."
,,Park hopper attraction,4.0,,"We were two families with kids aged 7 and 10. We stay in sg while our friends were visiting us for the first time in SG. The pandas steal the show along with the fun amazon ride which everyone enjoys. The boat cruise is relaxing though not recommended if you have limited time and a number of things to do.
If you are a visitor I would recommend the parkhopper ticket and finishing all 3 attractions - zoo, river safari and night safari in the same day - preferably a weekday when the queues will be shorter. Start with the zoo, cover the morning shows followed by the afternoon feeding trail - don't miss the hippo, giraffe feeding which the kids love. Move onto river safari after a quick lunch for walkabout seeing the pandas and doing the amazon ride. Have an early dinner and do the fire show along with the first show for creatures of the night. Some of the later shows get full. Once exhausted, sit on the tram and do a full round.
There are vegetarian options both at the zoo and at the night safari so food should not be a showstopper to keep you going."
,,Amazing River Safari,5.0,,"Really had a wonder time at River Safari. Its truly a different experience from traditional Zoo. With so many kinds of unimaginable species there. All you will feel is ""WOW"". There are still so much to be learned. Will definitely be back."
,,A great time with my family here!!!,4.0,,"From the city center, it takes about 15SGD - 20SGD to go by taxi to the River Safari and it is really fast if you use this mean of transport. But it will be cheaper if you book Grabcar on Grab. Besides, you can take public buses or MRT, it will be economical.
River Safari is a great zoo and suitable for family, kids, students to come and learn about marine life. In all, it has many interesting things, just find out on its website.
There were 3 things that I was really impressed at this zoo:
1) Lovely pandas, wide and useful information about pandas, the souvenirs were cute.
2) Some big 3D pictures about wild life that you will spend more than 15 minutes to take photograph (act so deeply) and post it on Facebook.
3) Friendly and helpful staff. They always smiled and volunteered to take photo for me.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
,,unique exhibition of large river habitats,4.0,,"Very interesting exhibition of life in the largest river systems of the globe (Mississippi, Amazon, Nile, Yangtze and others). Never seen anything comparable and I've been in many zoos and aquariums around the world.

Small drawback: The provided information is quite minimalistic, but hey - there is always wikipedia if you want to know more about the animals you are watching. i.e. bring your smartphone with data enabled."
,,Zoo,4.0,,"New river safari , highly recommended to visit in singapore , many river zones such as amazon , makong and others"
,,Just love the cute cuddly pandas!,4.0,,Pretty average zoo/aquatic centre until you see JiaJia the panda. Just watching them eat bamboo in close up is worth the trip. Had a great time here. Mostly cool inside and few good spots for photos..
,,Average Place and can be skipped.,3.0,,"Normally after visiting the Zoo , you will come to this place. Except Panda you do not have much of things to see here. Even if you take boat tour , it is paid and we thought it is not worth to do that. Normally River Safari is included in your combo ticket so you visit it. But if have to buy ticket separately , not recommended to but it.

If included in Combo ticket , Visit it to See Panda and take some cool air."
,,Excellent activity suitable for all ages,5.0,,"A visit to the River Safari is recommended. Animals & aquatic life kept in clean, well-maintained enclosures. The opportunity to get up close & observe the many species of fish, birds & animals was fantastic. And being able to see the pandas was extra-special."
,,Pandas and Manneties,5.0,,We loved the River Safari along with the touching and feeding sessions. The highlight was the Panda room from where they could be seen in close proximity. The aquarium at the last was truly wonderful with unique animals. Pls time your travel as per the animal interaction itinerary.
,,Very average attraction,3.0,,"With high expectation, we went for this safari. Very very average. The river cruise was a waste of time. The Amazon River Quest just about saved the day. The pandas and jaguars were sleeping in the shade. Skip this safari if you are on a limited time trip."
,,Excellent,4.0,,"Planned to spend an hour here. How wrong we were.

Excellent exhibits with so easy to go around seeing the various HUGE aquariums. Unbelievable to see some of the size of the tanks and the size of the fish. Really well presented.

Pandas were in a lovely exhibit and so close to see as was the huge polar bear.
Big boat ride ok, river ride very good, especially so close to the flamingos and a walk through the monkey cage incredible."
,,Different concept,4.0,,I like the way they have put all the river/water based animals. Do not bother to go on the boat safari but do visit Amazon Quest. You just need couple of hours only for this. Club this together with Singapore zoo for a day.
,,No,2.0,,This is a waste of time except to see the panda. Inside this Amazon Quest which has to buy separately is little bit good .I hope to avoid this
,,Panda is the star,4.0,,"I love seeing fishes and marine creatures, but having gone to the S.E.A aquarium the day before, I was a little underwhelmed by this. Its close to the zoo, so if you have time to spare you can come here. The Pandas and Manatees are the star here. If you do plan to do this, do choose to go on the amazon river quest as it gives a different perspective of looking at the marine creatures. It will be a fun ride for the kids too.

Top Tips:
- Do the zoo in the morning and the river safari in the afternoon, as most of the river safari is enclosed, it can give you good respite from the heat."
,,Children will enjoy it,4.0,,"Enter this place and u can see aquarium along the way. From small fishes to big, beavers, and crocodiles. Dont forget to see the panda. They were very cute but i only see 1 giant panda there. The panda is sleepy so she do some funny things and then sleep again hahaha. There is 1 restaurant inside the place, and a foodcourt in front of it. For a young child, this is very exciting place."
,,Great attraction places for tourists and locals! Great rides!,5.0,,"Great tourist attraction places as well as for the locals! Get to see many kinds of sea creatures and different kinds of fishes! What brought me to this place many times is because of KAI KAI & JIAJIA! They are the only two pandas in the river safari! Great place to visit as the environment is very clean and they strongly encourage people to be environmental friendly as there will have lots of recycling bins around the river Parks! They also offer rides for visitors to visit more animals! However, there will have additional charges thus I strongly advise visitors to get the package which includes the ride so it will be cheaper! They also have shows available at different timing. Staffs are very knowledgeable and every animal station you visit, there will also be board which states information of that particular animal you see so as to have a better understanding of its origin. Great facilities and live-demos are also provided! Great place for educational tours too! Last but not least, the map which was provided was very precise and easy to notice!"
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Good collection of animals, Amazon river experience was extra $5 which they should have included it in the ticket , other than that it was nice but too quick to spot the animals and very short trip,make sure you redo the amazon river trip as its free for redoing and you can spot more animals the second time. The other River cruise is free and its just a scenic short 10 min cruise nothing great with this cruise. Panda was an amazing thing to see. The aquarium with the manatees was also nice."
,,Wet day,3.0,,"It rain in Singapore and you need to plan for it but this safari was a little disappointing.

We fidget to see a sleeping giant panda but most of the other animals were sheltering from the rain

The river boat ride is something out of Disney and as you can not pause the ride you can miss your window of opportunity to see nature as you glide past.

The highlight for us was seeing the family of manatee which I would have paid S$ 10 for and not the S$ 53 the half day trip cost.

You may do this at a more realistic cost if you are willing to use public transport."
,,Kai Kai and Jia Jia,5.0,,"Home to two China Giant Pandas, Kai Kai and Jia JIa. Different rivers to explore such as Mekong and Amazon. A good educational trip for families with children. Well done."
,,Best day,5.0,,"We chose the best day to go to the river safari, it was very quiet and the weather was not to hot. Will do it again"
,,One vist is enough,4.0,,You can enjoy with your kids. Its not an outstanding place but you can go once for experience. Hardly a ride of 20 minutes but charges are high in comparison to it. DO see KI and KA Pandas.
,,Thoroughly enjoyed the River Safari,4.0,,"Made our own way to the River Safari from Clarke Quay MRT Station, by train and then bus took 40 min cost approx $2.00ea return. Very easy and convenient and overall CHEAP!

Did River Safari before Zoo to avoid crowds worked well. Saw both Pandas real close and some Piranhas. Kids (aged 10 and 8) loved the River Quest raft ride, an exciting fun way to see some animals. Got up close with some monkeys. River Cruise only one boat was going had to wait approx 20min could have left that ride.

Not a huge park easy walking and done within 2 hours. Easy."
,,Excellent,5.0,,It's a very god experience to visit the place. My little kid enjoyed it very much to see many fish & panda. Well organised & clean.
,,Just one of the many zoo parks in Singapore,3.0,,"I was initially excited about visiting the River Safari which is the newest zoo/park amongst the various few in that area of Singapore. I have been to both the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari, both of which I thought was amazing. I have also visited various aquariums in different countries. (which I highly feel the River Safrai more closely resembles) I feel that other than the fact they throw in a few more exotic fish and Amazonian species (very few) I didn't find it extremely amusing. The boat ride was different and probably the only thing that was worth mentioning. This boat ride is also not included in the entrance fee and is payable extra inside the park.

The ride is about a max of 10 minutes which takes you through parts uncaged encounters resembling that of the Night Safari and parts where you are looking through glass. We also arrived late and did not had a chance to catch any of the shows which might be the reason we found it a bit dull. The shows at the other parks were definitely parts of the highlights.

I would say come visit if you have some spare time after the other parks. But you would be better off visiting the other ones right next door."
,,Not worth the price tag,3.0,,"We bought the combination Singapore zoo and River Safari ticket (about $50 each).

The zoo is definitely worth a visit but the River Cruise does not justify the hefty price tag.

Following the zoo which is full of animals, the River Cruise seemed rather on the sparse side and there was little to see.

The majority of the most interesting animals (particularly of the mammals) can only be viewed by purchasing additional tickets for the Amazon River Quest ride $5 per person). Even then seeing the animals is entirely dependent on your party having the good fortune to sail past when they are at the front of their enclosures (a chance significantly depleted by the tropical downpours of Singapore).

The park is well designed and could make for an interesting day out but it's not a patch on the zoo and at the moment, not worth the additional price tag."
,,Interesting but not fantastic,3.0,,"lots it was under cover thank goodness and we did see lots of interesting animals/ fish etc, (yes we saw the Panda!!) but the wait for the first cruise was ages..for as someone else mentioned to see nothing..then when we got off found the other cruise not running not sure why as the weather was ok (not raining) so that was a disappointment. It was good and worth going to but I probably wouldn't wait or pay for the cruises."
,,"Long walk, little to see",1.0,,"People take this 15 minute 'cruise' to relax, but it's 1/2 kilometer to get there and 1/2 kilometer to return to the zoo, a taxi, or a bus. So, you walk 20-30 minutes total to experience a 15 minute boat ride. There is an almost constant recorded message describing all the wonders of the lake, but nothing to see."
,,"Walk, walk, walk",3.0,,"The exhibits are interesting and one gets to see huge freshwater fish. I particularly like the Mekong and the Amazon river a lot.
The Pandas are of course at the centre of attention in a cold exhibit area. The river quest is not meant for children under 1.06 metre. Directions are not too clear at River Safari but there is really only one direction and so to get to the River Quest, one will still have to walk a long route, pass the Panda, to cross the river (on the only crossing bridge there), to get to the river quest and the America Beavers.
There is no tram rides so a PRAM is a necessity is bringing young children as the walk is very long.
I wish they would build another bridge from the first exhibit at entrance so one can do a short cut directly to the River quest.
This park has toilet seat covers with children seats (at the Panda restaurant area)."
,,Great experience. My kid loved it.,5.0,,"I have a boy who loves animals but doesn't enjoy seeing them in cages or close quarters. The river safari was a great option. I also have another boy who likes animals but doesn't want to spend an entire day in a zoo, so this work out very well. The major highlight for us was the Amazon river ride. It's not included in the admission fee but it's worth the extra money (as the other free ride is not much of anything), and you can jump back to the ride for free. We waited an hour or so and took this ride again (for free, they stamp your hand) and were able to see some animals which were out of sight the first time around. Also, the walk in area with the monkeys is a lot of fun. We got to see many of them very close."
,,Worth it in conjunction with zoo ticket,5.0,,Great undercover location to wander if it's raining or super hot especially. Manatees are an absolute highlight and a must see. Great baby facilities for discrete breastfeeding and changing. Don't necessarily do by itself and do with a zoo visit for a full day (49 SGD for both).
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Loved this experience, especially in comparison to the actual zoo also. Extremely relaxing & soothing. Vast array of animals & freshwater life. In my experience, even better than sea aquarium at Sentosa (different, yes, I'm aware). A very very pleasant & happy experience overall. Well done."
,,Kids love it,4.0,,"We have visited Singapore Zoo couple years ago, but just recently we visited River Safari. We stroll down the river with the boat so we could see some animals (mostly from Amazon forest) on our left and right side. Very interesting"
,,"Better than expected, recommended",5.0,,"Arrived just after 10.00 opening and besides a couple of school groups was very quiet which really made a difference. We wanted to visit animals but didn't want a whole day traipsing around a zoo so chose the river safari. It's essentially a trail with a bunch of fish tanks along the way with animals and fish from various river Eco systems as you go, sounds boring but we found it quite good and it's not something I would normally enjoy. There is a 15 min short boat ride included as well that goes past the actual zoo so you see rhino, giraffe etc. you can pay $5 for another boat/flume type ride that also goes past a bunch of animal habitats such as monkeys, leopard, flamingo etc. also a good panda enclosure worth mentioning. we took uber from orchard rd which was about $16 each way and I guess spent 2-3 hours on the walk itself. If you want to see some interesting animals and aren't really into the whole zoo thing this is a good alternative."
,,Worth to visit,4.0,,We personally prefer singapore river safari than singapore zoo.cozy and quite organized.got two pandas inside besides the animal in waters.we also get an experience with smal boat and can see few animals along like jaguar etc.few restaurants available.we only got chance to try one restaurant near pandas exit.dont forget to try panda's pao.so cute and delicious at the same time.over all river safari worth to visit.
,,Good family outing.,4.0,,"We visited the Riverside Safari on a Sunday, we arrived at 10:30, queued to get the tickets for Riverside Safari. The queue was rather long and took approximately 20mins.
Tickets were sold at the main ticketing booth so you are in the same queue as visitors going to the zoo.
Riverside safari was not as busy as the main zoo.
Tickets cost S$30 for the entrance and another optional S$5 for the Amazon cruise.
It was interesting, however, the ride lasted only 8 mins.
We visited the Panda enclosure, the pandas do not look very happy.
We went into the river cruise which was a tranquil 15 min ride around the reservoir.
We had 'panda' bau ( bun) and coffee.
Soft drinks comes in a souvenir cup costing S$5.
There is also a huge aquarium showcasing many types of sea life.
All in all, it was an interesting experience.
Tickets and refreshment cost approximately S$200 for a party of 5.
The whole experience lasted 3 hours."
,,A wonderful glimpse in to the marine life from major world rivers and their basins,4.0,,"River Safari, sandwiched between the famous Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, houses one of the world’s largest collections of freshwater fauna, with over 6,000 animals including 40 threatened species and is worth a visit not only because of ""Kai Kai"" and ""Jia Jia"" - the two Giant Pandas and probably the most famous animal attraction of Singapore - but also for a variety of fresh water but rare animals you can see there.

If you look at the map of River Safari, it clearly has two parts - as you enter on the left you've animals from major rivers of the world except Amazon and on the right, it's all about Amazon, which makes sense because of the diverse animal life the Amazon river has to offer.

The fresh water animals which I was really impressed with while moving from one river to another were the ""Alligator Snapping Turtle"", ""Alligator Gar"" and the the weird looking ""Mississippi Paddlefish"" from the river ""Mississippi"", the ""Giant Puffer fish"", ""African Dwarf Crocodile"", ""Congo Tetra"" from the river ""Congo"", the ""Bottlenose Mormyrid"" (Elephant fish), ""Tiger Fish"" (Piranhas of Africa) and ""Giraffe Cat fish"" from the river ""Nile"".

The pair of ""Indian Gharial"" (Ganges Crocodile) in the ""Ganges"" river aquarium were really massive - the biggest I've seen. The ""Mud Skipper"" (which can live both on land and water) from ""Mary"" river, ""Mekong Giant Cat Fish"", ""Giant Siamese Carp"" (the largest of all carps and national fish of Cambodia), ""Giant Freshwater Stringray"" (discovered only about 20 years ago), ""Elephant Trunk Snake"" from the ""Mekong"" river and the ""Chinese Great Salamander"", ""Fire Bellied Newt"", ""Big Headed Turtle"" and ""Sturgeons"" from the ""Yangtze"" were again some of the aquatic life I've only read about but was very excited to see them live.

After visiting the seven rivers, we came to the ""Panda Forest"" to see ""Kai Kai"" and ""Jia Jia"". Though we've seen lots of pictures/videos of Giant Panda and off course our beloved ""Kungfu Pana"", but I didn't expect the Pandas to be actually that big. Time yourself with their feeding time, to get the best of the Giant Pandas. However as you enter the ""Panda Forest"", unless it is sleeping you can't miss the more elusive in the wild - the ""Red Panda"" continuously tottering around from one tree branch to another.

Coming out of ""Panda Forest"" and picking up some souvenirs we crossed the lake water inlet and reached the other side and went for the ""River Safari Cruise"". This boat ride on the lake actually lets you relax and take glimpse of a lot of aquatic birds and even the animals from the other zoos near the shore of the lake, like we spotted the Asiatic Elephants which were not part of ""River Safari"". However if you are short of time, you can skip this ride as it doesn't have anything extra to offer.

Finally moving to ""Amazon"" river, the first attraction is the additionally paid ""Amazon River Quest"", which is an expensive boat ride through the Amazonian jungle themed park and we got chance to see the Kapybaras, sleeping Jaguars, Crimson Ibis, Spider Monkey. There are other animals and birds also along this boat ride, however the boat moves too fast to be able to spot them. Either the zoo authority should reduce the speed at which the boat moves or they should allow the boat to take double or reverse turn so that visitors have more chance to spot some of the rare animals which are kept here but can't be seen while walking across the zoo. Taking photographs is also difficult so we opted to take video.

Out of the ""Amazon River Quest"" as you walk along, you find variety of Amazonian animals, some of which we've hardly heard the names of, like - a pair of ""Jaguarundi"" (a wild cat smaller than a Jaguar but much larger the domestic cats), ""Green Anaconda"" or the ""Silver Arowana fish"" - which can be up to 1.2 meters, are able to leap out of water to snatch prey from overhanging branches. You can catch them in action during feeding. Alas we missed the opportunity.

While walking along, you'll find the entrance to ""Squirrel Monkey Forest"" which is optional, but I would recommend you to go inside as they are really a funny lot and there are probably more than 30 of them kept in the open space and the adorable ""Squirrel Monkeys"" will walk past you or swing on top of your head. Watching the mischief of these monkeys from close quarters is a real treat and will give you ample opportunity to take photographs/selfies with the ""Squirrel Monkeys"".

The last destination is the ""Amazon Flooded Forest"" which has number of exotic aquatic animals like - ""Black knife Ghost fish"", ""Mata Mata"" (turtle), ""Electric Eel"" (which is not a true eel and can generate electrical charge of up to 600 volts), ""Red-Bellied Piranha"", ""Arapaima fish"", and finally ""Amazonian Manatees"" (or Sea Cows).

We spend around 4 hours at the ""River Safari"" and really had a good time. Couple of things which we felt could have been better are, of course one which I mentioned earlier - increasing the time or slowing the speed of the ""Amazon River Quest"". We also found the size of the aquariums or enclosures of some of the animals are quite small and should be made bigger, like that of the ""Indian Gharials"" or ""the Jaguarundis"".

If you've visited the ""Singapore Zoo"", ""Jurong Bird Park"", ""S.E.A Aquarium"" and the ""Universal Studios"" and still have half a day to spare, then I'll surely recommend you to visit ""River Safari""."
,,Maintenance super,4.0,,"Very gud maintenance...But nothing so attractive... It's like combination of aquarium , zoo and bird park...I think all remaining creatures are put into this ..
There was river Safari cruise .Just 10-15 min ride.. Waste of time.. u see little view of rhino , giraffe from cruise ...Which was kept actually in zoo...
Boat Safari is another waste of money... Instead of river Safari it s better to visit zoo, bird park , aquarium and night Safari ...."
,,A great (wet) day at river safari,5.0,,"It was a rainy day throughout our visit here but with the covered walkway it wasn't too much of a problem. We still enjoyed ourselves thoroughly with many great exhibitions of exotic fresh water animals. The red panda was not in the mood for an audience while we only managed to see Kai Kai the panda for less than 5 minutes.

Our favorites were the manatees, giant Mekong catfish and sturgeons. Keep an eye out for the baby manatee - too cute!

It seems there were some boat rides and cruises but with the downpour we didn't manage to go on any.

In general the place is great - things in great condition, clear and well kept tanks and aquariums, animals in plain sight (mostly).

The bathroom is definitely one of the cleanest and most beautiful with garden and natural light source incorporated."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"Obviously a focus on rivers and their occupants, but the River Safari also has Singapore Zoo's Giant Pandas. The 15 minute cruise on reservoir is OK, giving some unique views of the zoo, but the theme-park style Amazon River Quest was great, as were the giant aquaria, one with otters swimming overhead"
,,Better Than Expected,5.0,,"We did the River Safari and Night Safari on the same day spending approximately 3 hours at each. The river displays are basically giant aquariums but just brilliant in appearance. Make sure you do the extra boat ride...much better than the lake ride where you are lucky to see many animals. Get your tickets online.
One tip....most cafes had almost run out of food by the time we finished this to do the night safari next (6PM). We ended up with KFC!"
,,Nothing much to see,2.0,,"There is nothing much to see here, not much animals or fish. Its just boring, we didnt enjoy ourself. The place is also small and some of the fish or animal enclosure quite cramp, the animal only got small space to move around. Singapore Zoo is much much better!! Go singapore zoo, dont go river safari, dont waste your time."
,,Waste of money,1.0,,"Went to the zoo (great) and was suggested by the sales person that the River Safari was good because it had heaps of other water animals. We did the zoo first, and 80% of the fish and water animals were already in the zoo, so was repeated in the River Safari. If we had of know that would not have bothered paying extra money for a double up

Once we were in the River Safari, the other 20% of water animals could only be seen by paying EXTRA for a river cruise. Was very disappointed with the River Safari."
,,Plenty of wildlife to see,4.0,,"There are two boat trips covered, one on the river which lasts about 15 minutes and a water ride which takes you around some of the wildlife. Lots of marine life to see, we got to see one of the pandas and had a lovely time walking around this area. There weren't too many people when we were there which made it very pleasant to walk around and see the wildlife, lots of marine life and manatees. You can buy a multi day ticket which gives you entrance to several of the areas but given the heat and humidity doing several might be tiring. We spent 3 hours in the River Safari and then did the Night Safari which was enough for us as we had spent a combined time of circa 7 hours going around them both at a leisurely pace."
,,Great layout for any weather!,4.0,,"This was so great to walk around, there was no map needed you just followed the path and the entire route is undercover so whether it was high sun or heavy downpour (like we had) it didn't affect your visit one bit. We loved seeing the pandas, otters and manatee. We missed out of the river cruise due to the weather but it was still an enjoyable trip. Allow 1.5 hours to casually stroll around or 2-2.5 hours if you plan to include to boat cruise and ride."
,,Pandas did not appear too happy,2.0,,"Don't get me wrong, the rivercruise was good and we did this twice (second time free), as was the boat trip which is good if not only for the rest and a sit down in the heat as we had visited the zoo in the morning. Squirel monkeys were great as well.

You do get to see the same animals a few times in all parks, but it seems to work well.

I am no animal expert, but the issue I had was with two pandas - one giant panda was out and clearly did not want to be and was pacing back and forth to his door of the enclosure. I got the feeling it was out just for the visitors and that did not make me happy.

We then walked a wee bit further and saw the red panda - it also looked distressed and was pacing back and forth on his tree - maybe he was just exercising? I am no expert as I said, so hopefully they were both happy. Didn't see any issues with any other animals."
,,"Giant Panda, Otters, Manatees....fantastic place!",5.0,,"This was our favourite for our Singapore city stop over of Night Safari, Raffles, Gardens on the Bay....superb

The aquariums were fantastic - massive some of them, including the otter enclosure and the manatees - huge aquariums and the walk ways under cover so doesn't matter if its raining or super sunny

Add in the Panda experience and this catapults this zoo into a top world attraction

Great value at £40 for an adult of you buy online ahead of time and get a combo ticket for the night safari as well..."
,,Very educational,4.0,,"We used public transport to get to the River Safari from Orchard Road and it is so easy . It takes around 40 minutes by MRT & Bus . Our SIA boarding pass gave us 10% discount off the entrance fee. The River Safari gives an Educational Journey through 7 of the great River systems of the world , highlighting the creatures that live in , on or near these rivers. I also highlights the stresses these River systems are under due to the influence of man . There is a short boat ride around the Lake included in the admission and for an extra $5 an amusement park style boat ride through a river system where you can see some of the most endangered animals . It is very Educational ."
,,More like and aquarium than a safari,4.0,,"Very similar to an aquarium with a different layout and fish etc from 7 different countries. Does not take long to complete the park, around 2 hrs so I would suggest combining it with other attractions in the area such as the zoo or night safari."
,,"While not as many exhibits as the Zoo, still worth the visit",4.0,,"Quite a nice thematic experience of the many rivers of the world such as the Nile, Yangtze, Mekong, Mississippi and Ganges. The touch pool was a bit small and had a long queue but other exhibits were well designed. I love the flooded Amazon the best. We skipped the included cruise because it merely went around the reservoir. The amazon rainforest ride was more interesting but to charge an additional fee was a bit too much. I would have rated this 5 stars if it was included in the ticket. The rainforest ride was nice, especially for children. Overall a good experience. There is a lot of walking though but the Panda enclosure is quite well situated considering you'll need some form of air conditioning by the time you reach it!"
,,The pandas are wonderful!,5.0,,This was our second visit to the park. The first time was in 2013. It still looks new and very well maintained. We mainly visited to see the red pandas and giant pandas. Their enclosure is amazing and it's great to feel so close to them as they are not in cages. We also enjoyed the huge water tank with the manatees swinging around so graciously. We bought a combined ticket for the zoo and here which is really good value.
,,"Good, but recommend spending more time at the Zoo",5.0,,"Amazing place! For kids, teens, and adults alike! :)
Recommend spending a day here for the Zoo, River safari and Night safari.
Look out for timings of the shows/exhibits on the website. And save money with the ParkHopper Plus pass.

The river safari lasts for 15 minutes and it takes another hour to go through the remaining exhibits. It is definitely interesting, but I think they will in future increase their collection."
,,Beautiful Experience! The river safari ride could be improved a lot!,4.0,,"The location is beautiful! Very informative and knowledgeable experience.

You get to see the Pandas who are adorable.

I would have given a 5 star review. But the river safari was disappointing. Bit too overrated. They just take you on a boat around the water for 15 minutes and show you glimpses of white rhinos and giraffes placed in the zoo which you will see better up and close at the zoo itself. They're just visible from the boat. And then pass around a specimen of giraffe poop amd hair. They could maybe make it more informative. It was very boring."
,,Broad daylight robbery,1.0,,Paid $30 for nothing.The map was big but the actual number of exibits was small.The cruise was a slow moving one and not interactive.Most of the animals could be seen in the zoo or the SEA Aquarium.The Amazon Quest ride was bad as well. Recommend not going to River Safari.I suggest going to any other attraction in Singapore as they are a 100 times better than River Safari
,,Waste of time & money,1.0,,The Singapore zoo is excellent. Don't bother with the river or night safari. The boat ride on the river goes for 15mins with nothing to see.
,,Good for family,5.0,,"We spent there for almost 5 hours. The river safari is not quite big but you will definitely enjoy and have fun there. I found that it is a great place for family, for both old and young (my son is 2 years old).

The Amazon Quest is fun. It is a 10-minute boat ride with about 10 people sitting inside the boat. You will have a closer access to the animals during the ride. However, only kids with above 106cm of height are allowed for taking this ride. You may consider joining river cruise which is free of charge. This is a 15-minute ride with 40 people sitting together and is safer for even small kids.

My husband is so excited when he first saw polar bear in Singapore! Also, the panda!! There are 2 pandas in the river safari, namely Kai Kai and Jia Jia. They are just so adorable ... You can't missed the panda restaurant selling the cappuccino with panda image on the milk foam and their signature red bean bun comes in the look of panda.

You may take a stroll at the monkey forest. If you are lucky enough, you may have a chance to spot the monkeys walking in front of behind you! Also the crocodile farm, the giraffes, elephants, hippos, jaguars, flamingos, and many many more.

The river safari opens from 10am to 7pm daily. If your body do allow, you can continue exploring at the night safari which is just next to the river safari.

In conclusion, this is a good place to spend at with family."
,,Good to follow on after the Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"Was a lovely day to follow on from being at the Singapore Zoo. The main attraction for us was the Giant Panda's but we only saw one and he/she was out and about feeding so you go a lot of time watching. The place was clean and the river cruise was nice and relaxing although we didn't see any wildlife was nice anyway. The Amazon River ride was great but did go a little quick and because it wasn't busy we were asked if we wanted to go again which was nice. It's a really nice afternoon, thoroughly enjoyed it and perfect for after the zoo!"
,,Enjoyable and informative,5.0,,"We had a great time doing the River Safari.........they even let us go twice on the boat with no extra charge. We could have stayed there all day, it was so peaceful ans calm, and the personal were very helpful."
,,Weather couldn't dampen our enthusiasm,5.0,,Lots of rain the day we visited. Majority of the attractions are roofed so no fear of getting wet. PLENTY to see and the displays are really well put together and interesting. Can see a few singapore zoo animals too. We were very lucky to spot a water monitor lizard swim up ahead of us on the boat trip. The amazon boat trip was ok but couldn't catch a glimpse of the jaguars. The red panda and pandas were really wonderful. Otters were in good spirits.
,,Don't lose your time and money,1.0,,The zoo part is ok. The amazon river tour is a joke. 15 minutes on a reservoir where you don't see any wildlife. How can this thing get 4 stars ??
,,Interesting and educating,5.0,,First time seeing the river safari and it was very interesting. There are just so many variety of fishes and river life creatures on display. I like that they took the opportunity to educate us on keeping pets. Most owners of terrapins or fishes tend to just throw them away in our local rivers without understanding the impact it has on the ecosystem! Being able to see the panda is such a treat and the boat ride is really cool because you do get to see the giraffes and rhino on the banks of Mandai zoo next door.
,,Family Attraction that is good for a child educational tour,3.0,,"Broken up based on geographical theme i.e. Nile versus rain forest. What is interesting is that huge aquarium where you can get up close with the animals.
The primates are close enough for you to view their behaviors. Feel for the pandas as based on their behavior they are seeking for privacy. Forget about the rides as it is a waste of time"
,,Great activity,4.0,,"Great activity not too big and can be done in 3 hours. I went this friends with a pram and is very pram friendly not like some other places, although we didn't get to go on the river safari as you cannot do this with babies or young children but you can ride on the river cruise."
,,Loved it - great fun and not crowded,5.0,,"I'm so glad I decided to come here as well as the zoo - it was great. There was still plenty to see and do, but it was so much quieter I almost had the place to myself.

The Pandas were all I went to see, and I wasn't disappointed. I got to see both Pandas and the Red Panda was lovely too. There was also a nice variety of other animals to enjoy.

The river cruise was great fun, and a similar water log ride that was shorter in length but just as much fun, getting to see all the monkeys around the river.

Absolutely worth a visit, add it on to the end of your Zoo visit!"
,,River themed zoo - Best part is pandas!,3.0,,"We came here as part of an organised tour and got the impression it was a river safari. It is not. It is a zoo/aquarium with the a river theme. The highlight and best part was the pandas and would say it was worth it for that
The actual ""river cruise"" was awful and you see nothing. Waste of time. Actually do go on the Amazon river trail boat - some good animals here.
Did the whole park in 2 hours.
Would only recommend due to panda viewing - this was amazing!"
,,Educational place and unique experience,3.0,,"What will you get to see?
Panda (Jia Jia & Kai Kai), they are adorable and playful.
Exotic, giant fish in huge aquarium is amazing...
They categories into few rivers (Yangtze river, Mekong river,...etc)

Because of the waiting time (90 minutes) so therefore we didn't take the river cruise even though is in our ticket package. Understand from the recept the river cruise is more on scenery. But we pay additional $5 per person for the boat ride-indoor (the ride is about 10 minutes). The ride is a little too fast, cant even spot the animal in time.

You can queue to touch the star fish.
Check-out animal feeding times...
It was my first time see the Archer fish to shoot the food (worm) down from the hanging container.

There is restaurant in the River Safari, selling red bean Panda steam bun, coffee, noodles and snacks."
,,"Nice zoo, not crowded",5.0,,"Went on a Monday early-afternoon. We loved the panda enclosure, there was no line and we had plenty of time to watch him eat and wander around. Lots of interesting fish and other animals; we didn't do the boat tour. The path is mostly covered, which is good as there were a couple sudden downpours during our visit. It would have been nice if both zoos were together as one park though. I didn't like having to choose between seeing pandas and polar bears during our short stay."
,,"A fun family activity, enriching experience for kids",5.0,,"The first thing that deserve commendation is the layout. The two routes available both covers all attraction and at the same time disperse human traffic. The routes are sheltered all the way, which is perfect for both hot and rainy weather."
,,An added bonus,4.0,,"The pandas and aquarium were outstanding. We enjoyed the river safari very much. The only disappointment was the river ride, it is an additional cost and it takes you past the enclosures so quick that you don't get to see anything."
,,"Not big, just good",5.0,,"We visited several times to river safari. It's a cool place to go with family or friends. There are 2 cute pandas from China, and also we can take the small boat to have a 15mins tour on the river. Of course there are so many varieties of animals. Food inside is quite expensive."
,,excellent trip,5.0,,"Just next to the award winning Singapore Zoo, River Safari is a pretty innovative concept, that takes river widlife to the forefront. You get to sit on a river boat and go through different major rivers like the Amazon or the Yantze and get a close look at the animals that lives in these habitats."
,,A great day out!,5.0,,"The River Safari was a great day out. Based around different rivers in the world, you get to see the wildlife that makes these rivers their home. The absolute best part of the River Safari zoo is the Giant Pandas. They are so adorable and nicely posed for us up trees etc. They are housed in a fully air-conditioned enclosure which is actually like walking into a fridge/freezer so it is lovely to go into on a hot and humid Singapore day (every day!)"
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,"The animals that you will see will totally be different than your typical zoo, since most of them are aquatic animals. They have a few places where you can touch and interact with the animals like starfish, and if I'm not wrong, you can even see a Panda feeding session. Come around 2 ish so it's not so crowded and hot."
,,disappointing,2.0,,"In Singapore you normally get value for your money or above expectations, but not this. Most things are a bit old, even the Panda areas are poor. A simple ride through an old fashioned zoo is also outdated. It has nothing to do with safari. Maybe suitable for education for children. Take the night safari or the zoo, so much better!"
,,Finally got to see pandas!,4.0,,"We saw mixed reviews about the river safari but finally decided to go for it based on a positive review from a few known sources. It is definitely worth a visit. The animals are displayed very well & one can spend loads of time at some of them such as the big aquarium where there are Mekong catfish & sting rays in addition to other interesting fish, at the alligator exhibit where the alligator was very active and kept snapping at the tourists or my favourite..the giant pandas. There were 2 of them, one was just eating the whole time & the other kept moving around & sitting here & there. The red panda unfortunately was asleep when we went. There is also a theme park ride called Amazon river quest which was lovely. The one thing we should have given a miss was the River safari cruise. The board said it would be a 40 min wait. We thought we will give it a shot & waited. It took 80 mins before we could board one of the 2 boats that were taking tourists on the 15min ride. (There were 2 other boats parked but no idea why they were not being used from the start. One of them started being used when we came back from the ride). The cruise itself was a big waste of time. We were taken along the banks of the reservoir where we could see animals from the zoo next door...the giraffe's head, the rhino from its enclosure etc. Those we got to see up close at the Zoo itself!"
,,Unique,5.0,,"Although the Zoo is the main attraction, the River Safari is a unique insight into river habitats and their wildlife that is rarely explored.
The facility is easy to walk around and full of very informative information boards. The Pandas are worth seeing but not the highlight (I preferred the Himalayan Red Pandas), but for me the Manatees were my favourites.
We did the River Safari before the Zoo, but either way, be prepared for a very long day if you plan to thoroughly explore both."
,,Wheelchair friendly park.,5.0,,"Went with my mil who was on wheelchair. The whole park area is wheelchair accessible & fully shaded/covered. Toilet is wheelchair friendly too. Few restaurants available inside the park. Clean environment especially at the panda air-conditioned area. Worth the visit with wide range of animals, fishes & reptiles."
,,Not your average zoo,4.0,,"I had a great time in River Safari because the animals are so unique
Many animals that I never seen before in my life so it was so fun

The queue of the boat was so long. It's not worth it
The boat just make circle and you just see glimpse of animal from Singapore zoo

Panda is the main attraction to me personally"
,,I saw the Pandas,4.0,,"Our purpose was to be able to see the Pandas and spend time if we wanted to. We went on a monday morning, arrived about 9.30 and were amongst the first ten or so people to enter as the gates opened at 10am. We headed straight to the Giant Pandas with the plan of going back through the other animals later. We were the only ones there and both Pandas were actively moving about and eating. After about 20 mins we went over to the boat dock, waited about 10 mins, then had the river cruise. We didn't do the Amazon riverquest, just went back the way we came to the Pandas again. This time 1 was already asleep with his back to the viewing area however the female was still moving about. There still were only a few people there. Perhaps monday morning is a choice time for visiting. It was definitely busier by 12pm. I have to say we also enjoyed the Manatees and would recommend this as 2nd to the Pandas. Take the time to go underneath and view them, it is also cooler!"
,,Not bad,3.0,,"I am so glad I read the tripadvisor reviews about this place before visiting. My husband wanted to go here but after reading tripadvisor we decided to go to the zoo first and then to here. That was a great idea. If we had only gone here we would have been a bit disappointed.

The river safari is you walking along tanks made up of fish etc from different area of the world. It's ok....

They have a boat ride that costs $5.00 (you can purchase tickets beside the ride) Wait time was 10mins and you are basically going on a boat ride like a theme park with animals beside. Some are impossible to see. I am not sure if I would do the ride again.

There is another boat ride which apparently takes you around the lake. The wait time for that was 2 hours so we didn't do that one. But it is free.

Highlight for me and the things that made it worth it were seeing the pandas, Manatees and Arapaima"
,,Very Good... It's a mixed bag!!!,4.0,,"River Safari at Singapore Zoo is very good and it offers the following all in just one place...

1. Zoo, a close look to certain animals
2. Giant Panda forest with pandas and red pandas.
3. Aquarium with big viewing pools and a under water tunnel. (Tunnel was under maintanence during my visit though)
Thanks
4. Boat ride through the Singapore river to see some animals.
5. An adventure ride at Amazon River Quest

Worth spending money. Realised Best value due the money spent.

Plan for at least 4 hours."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"The River safari is well worth a visit! It is different from the ZOO as you see animals which cant be seen in the nearby ZOO - pandas, and water animals. The safari is unique as you learn a lot about the biggest rivers on the earth. Some aquariums are really big. Specially the one with manatees - they are so beautiful! And there is an attractive fun ride with a boat on which you pass beside some animal enclosures. Fun for old and young!"
,,"Expecting more actually, but quite great",4.0,,"I recommend to book the ticket via online/ trusted travelling agency, which will give us a cheaper price and saving time rather than buying at the venue. I was kinda afraid at first after reading so many reviews about having such a long queue to exchange the booking printouts but actually, they had this ticket print machines so we only need to scan the barcode on the booking printout to get the real ticket. I suggest to come here around 9-12PM to avoid lines, and too many tourist. The exhibitons were nice and neat, but i was kinda expecting more from the place. For panda shelter, it was well built and on the day i visit it, i only see Kai Kai, idk where is Jia Jia :)
I took the river safari cruise (include in standard ticket) which is soothing, and along the 15min ride, we could see girrafe, rhinos, few birds and watchout for wild animals too, i've saw a monitor lizard swimming in the river :D
The other best thing is the Amazon River cruise which is additional with SGD5/person. We get in to the boat for 6 people like in amusement park, riding throughout the ""amazon jungle theme"" with its cute like the capuchins and also dangerous animals like leopards!! I love it!!
It has restaurants, toilets, and also souvenir shop, and free drinkable water dispenser. Dont forget to bring hat, drinking bottle and wear your sunblock."
,,Best Part is the PANDAS but the rest is not very entertaining,3.0,,"We LOVED THE PANDAS here and there were some Rhinos which are a rare sight but the rest of the River Safari was not nearly as exciting and did not have nearly the number of animals as the Night Safari. The River Safari is a walk along some aquariums, a short ride on a boat past the rhinos and a short flume ride by some small animals and a couple of big cats (which was exciting). The River Safari, Night Safari and the Zoo are on connected properties. The Night Safari, which does not open until 7 pm had more animals and has a tram for nearly the entire trail as well."
,,Expected More,3.0,,"It was a little disappointing. There weren't much to see. The short boat ride - was just a boat ride! There weren't much to see except for one or two zoo animals and the scenery. However, the giant panda saved the day."
,,Fabulous!,5.0,,"I was a little nervous since some of the reviews are mixed. I'm glad we added on the river safari to our zoo day. The panda were a must see! My girls had never seen them before so we spent a lot of time just checking them out. The monkey area in the river safari is a lot of fun too! We didn't have a lot of extra time, so we didn't do the actual boat part."
,,Really well done!,5.0,,"We pretty much discovered this park by accident when we were offered it as an add-on when we bought our entry tickets to the Singapore Zoo. For only an extra $16 on top of your $33 zoo ticket, this is a no brainer.

The park introduces you to the wildlife which exists in many rivers around the world (Mekong, Amazon, Nile and rather oddly the Mary River in Queensland, Australia).

The exhibits here on the whole feel much newer then the neighbouring zoo and are very well presented.

Not entirely sure why they feature in a 'River Safari' park, but the giant panda exhibit was perhaps the highlight. Not only for the pandas, but for the 20 degree climate controlled exhibit area!

Towards the end of the park the 'flooded Amazon' area was quite fascinating as it explains the difference between the wet and dry season in the Amazon rainforest.

If the person selling you your Singapore Zoo tickets tries to ""Super Size"" you to include the River Safari ticket, grab it with both hands. You won't regret it."
,,Not my favourite place,3.0,,After spending all day at the zoo and having a 7.15 pm booking for the night safari I was really disappointed when I arrived. Felt like it took longer to get off the river quest than the very uninteresting ride. They did have one or two good displays and if you have a multi park ticket probably worth the quick look. But no way I would pay much more. Shame bird park is not closer because that is worth a look. The park and river cruises finish at 6pm and then the wait to the night safari was epic.
,,fantastic - especially the pandas!,5.0,,We visited today and really enjoyed the day. The panda sat for ages happily eating bamboo while we sat just a few feet away. The monkey enclosure was also great fun - so lovely to be up close to the animals. Very easy to get a taxi to and from the Zoo.
,,Great for families,4.0,,"It was a rainy day and we were unable to visit the Zoo or bird park(beside river sarafi). Luckily for us, the River safari has sheltered walk way covering 95% of the park except for the squirrel monkey viewing area. As such our trip wasn't wasted and we had a good time with our son admiring the giant fishes and animals there. The pandas are almost always sleeping so don't expect to see them playing or you'll be disappointed. We enjoyed watching the giant cat fish, manatees and giant stingrays the most. There is a 5% discounted price for local and free entry for children under 3 according to the cashier."
,,Greatly informative Safari,4.0,,"This was a really good tour, the boat ride was a little disappointing, but otherwise saw lots of really interesting wildlife up close."
,,Perfect place for families,5.0,,"from the name, you will know that this place which exhibit animal from the river. not only that they have 2 gian panda and the best is the amazon flooded forest."
,,Excellent Attraction in Singapore for all ages,5.0,,"This would have to be my favourite of all the 4 Park Pass attractions in Singapore. 4 Park Pass included: Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, River Safari and Jurong Bird Park. I could spend hours watching the Pandas as the River Safari. A ride on the lake in a boat and mini a River Rapids ride was fun too. Great for kids and adults alike."
,,Wish it was longer!!,4.0,,"River Safari is an attraction which is convenient to walk about. Its trail is linear and easy to navigate. You also get to sit on the River Cruise for free (15~ minutes). The cafeteria at the panda enclosure sells really good panda buns. Must try!
The flooded forest was really awesome as well. I loved the atmosphere there."
,,Excellent family day out,5.0,,"Perhaps our favourite Singapore Zoo experience. It had everything ... superb range of wildlife (including the wonderful pandas), a fun boat ride on the lake and a great river boat ride with mini rapids and some terrific animal displays.

The restaurant near the entrance / exit was also a great place to end the day with a fresh fruit platter and pot of jasmine tea."
,,A fancy Aquarium,3.0,,"Words are often misleading. When I heard and read about the river safari, I had thought that its gonna be a ride in a river however the cruise was just a 10 minute thing (and we didn't even see a single animal). Most of the safari has to be seen on foot and its a pretty long walk. I would definitely agree that their collection of river animals is great. And of course, their pandas! However, not exactly what I had in mind.
TIP: Buy their pass for all four safaris combined. Much better!"
,,Perfect Boat Ride Experience!,5.0,,"Our family enjoyed visiting this attraction. River Safari Cruise is a boat ride for about 15 to 20 minutes. There's a tour guide in every boat. You have an option to either take the Chinese / English Speaking group. Once we alighted the cruise, there's an eagle who was freely flying in the area. His handler was feeding him and we managed to took photos of the eagle.

The panda is really cute. We spent a good few minutes watching him. The area of the panda is spacious so I don't feel bad for him.

The Amazon River Quest is the main highlight of the park. It's a good 10 minutes ride and a must try!!! It's not part of the admission ticket so you must pay extra SGD5 per adult which is worth the price."
,,Water safari,2.0,,"Paid to see animals as per ""safari"" style only on water. Boat ride only covered one third of the lake and only saw rhinos and giraffes but at a distance. Should had called this adventure as boat ride on lake. There were other creatures to see but you had to walk in a zoo like environment to see them. That could be done under one fee in the zoo rather than as two separate fees to see animals"
,,Rivertopia,5.0,,"River animals big and small,
you will not miss any, you will find them all.
If you are tired, take a boat.
it is for everyone, young and old.
The duration is neither long or short
but it is of a perfect sort.
The land trip is definitely wheelchair friendly,
so give the workers smiles if you see them and give them plenty.
The pandas are adorable when they lie about,
so make sure you do not leave them out."
,,Don't Bother if you have to Wait,2.0,,We had to wait 30 mins and were very disappointed. You don't see anything that you can't see from the bridge.
,,eXOTIC AND RARE RIVER FISH AND WIDLLIFE,4.0,,"enjoyed the trip with my wife! with the giant panda as the added attraction~ We enjoyed the restaurants with th epanda thme, witht he coffee and breads! The covered areas help you not be get too dehydrated in the tropical sun! we enjoyed the very big aquariums"
,,Serene surroundings and interesting animals around,4.0,,"The River Safari is rather out of the way (same as the zoo and night safari), I took bus 138 from Ang Mo Kio MRT station to the attraction which took about half an hour. This attraction was not as packed but it was also because I visited on a weekday. I was mainly excited for the Giant Panda Forest and boat ride (MUST DO'S/SEE). The pandas, KaiKai and JiaJia were so adorable! It was so nice observing and just seeing them roam around and eating. There is even a panda themed cafe that serves cute panda paus! The attraction is very clean and has both outdoor/indoor areas. The tanks there are really huge got me all ""WOW"".

*Side note: this attraction is not as big so 2-3 hours would be enough to explore the whole attraction. And I really think this attraction is great for couples (date idea) and children (space to roam around and explore)!"
,,Worthwhile trip though not exactly boat ride throughout,4.0,,"First of all River Safari is a showcase of habitats of the rivers in the world, that would mean they set up different exhibits as similar as possible to the actual rivers.

So it wasn't a boat ride to see all the exhibits. It's half By foot half by boat at $5. The boat ride was too short but able to resit, just avoid crowded days. We were lucky on the reservoir boat ride to see the elephants! Other than that I thought there were more rooms of improvement to this reservoir boat ride. Note: 2 different boat rides, reservoir and Amazon.

We took the Teahouse sampler set which was very decent with the Pork Bone soup, taupok, goh hiang, char siew, roasted pork and one entire pot of tea! Not fantastic quality but really edible and rather delicious. Definitely worth the price!

Feeding times were in a smooth motion no need to rush here and there. We spent 9.40am - 12.30pm there!

Things are expensive there so rather get the entire package experience:

Admission
Boat rides
Meet the beavers
Teahouse sampler"
,,Give yourself time,5.0,,"This was amazing and great for the kids and adults.
The place was full of different animals from all over the world. The information that was given opened the eyes of my daughter and wife and showed how important what we do today will affect tomorrow.
Staff were helpfully and placed in areas that gave facts to the public about the displays.
We did this tour with a tour company which only gave us just over an hour and half to see everything due to a couple that were late. I would strongly suggest that you have a good 2-3 hours to give you enough time to see all."
,,Misleadingly named attraction,3.0,,"The name of this attraction, along with the advertising, led us to believe we would spend much of our visit in a boat, floating past different aquatic and land species. However, the majority of the visit was on foot. That being said, it was very interesting to begin with and we did learn a lot about different river habitats around the world. We also saw many different species during our walk, especially some big alligators and some cute little monkeys. Sadly, the pandas were not easy to see and didn't look well cared for. The highlight for us was the manatees, such amazing creatures and fascinating to watch - you can spend a long time with them. The included boat trip was disappointing, just a 15 min trip around a lake with a few glimpses of storks. We had to pay extra for the more interesting little boat trip which took us in a canoe around a short route, past flamingoes and a few mammals. All in all, it's a pleasant, but relatively expensive way to spend a couple of hours."
,,Not quite what we expected,4.0,,"I expected this to be a long boat trip but it's not.
There is a short 15 minute boat trip but don't expect to see much more than a glimpse of the giraffe from the neighbouring zoo.
What you will get is a nicely laid out path around mainly water dwelling creatures.
The many aquariums are excellent & you will see some amazing fish also Otters & many other creatures.
There is also a cool enclosure housing a giant panda.
For an extra $5 there is a very short ride taking you past monkeys and a panther enclosure which is worth doing.
Allow a good couple of hours for the whole thing which is mostly undercover so rain won't be a big deal."
,,River Safari,5.0,,"Beautifully laid out and great for children in general, although not sure why there needs to be such a high hight restriction on the river experience - its no rollercoaster!"
,,Small add on to Singapore Zoo,5.0,,"River Safari is right next door to the Singapore Zoo and is more of an add on activity to the Singapore Zoo. It doesn't take as long to go around and clearly the highlight of the River Safari park is the Panda enclosure. The Pandas are extremely close. We paid extra for the Amazon River Quest flume boat ride which was okay, but would have been a little better if the ride was a little slower. Sometimes it was hard to spot the animals which was made harder when the boat was moving fast. Again the surroundings and the enclosures were all very clean and well maintained. The Manatees are also a delight to see and a cool respite from the heat."
,,Good experience,5.0,,Worth spending time . Provide real time experience of sea life. mostly all kind of sea life can be experienced..especially jelly fish .
,,truly amazing,4.0,,Its stunning experience i had i would really recommend to everyone specially family to travel. Its really amazing place to explore
,,worth upgrading singapore zoo ticket,5.0,,"The last time I visited Singapore the river safari was in planning stage so I decided to give it a look. We decided to therefore buy the 3 park pass (zoo,bird park & safari) which also included tram rides in zoo. the river safari is very well set out with it designed to filter you through the attraction without having to double back like in some zoos. it features exhibits with local marine life of famous rivers around world eg congo ,yangzte,amazon Mississippi rivers etc.. the panda exhibit is great even though the star of show was sleeping. the highlights for me was the huge indoor aquarium called the Flooded amazon forest with the manatees swimming around. it was breathtaking. the boat ride featuring the jaguars was a bit hit or miss but only went for 10 mins with no line so its worth checking out."
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"My kids love fishes and they absolutely love this place . The place is very sheltered and cooling so is suitable to visit even during noon time. The river ride is so so in my opinion but kids enjoyed it. Food and drink is a little more expensive so good to bring some light snacks for kids

It is definitely worth visiting together with the zoo"
,,Great except for the Photos,3.0,,Nice place to go. Enjoyed the panda and river ride. Only problem was when we they printed our pictures. They told us we got everything but they didn't print the one with the Panda mascot. My son loves his picture with him too bad they didn't print us a copy saying they printed the other pictures and cannot print anymore. Talked to the manager but he only saved 4 pcs of pictures with the panda on the free disc that comes with the pics. Spend a lot to get all the pics but frustrated because they don't know any customer service considering we spent a lot.
,,River Safari,4.0,,"We've been to a lot of zoos so we opted for the River Safari option. It was a different take on the zoo and it was very interesting to learn about different inhabitants in different rivers around the world. We really enjoyed it! Definitely worth a visit. Although, I would say prepare for queues/book tickets online and bring a packed lunch."
,,Pure Fun for Families with Kids,5.0,,"Non-stop fun for families, especially for families with Kids. The Giant Panda Forest was lovely. The Manatees were so beautiful and graceful to watch. Above all...it is fun as well as educational for kids of all ages."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We had done most of the major attractions in Singapore and decided to go to the River Safari. I was pleasantly surprised. We didn't have children with us, but we really enjoyed it. It got better as you went a long. The monkey enclosure was great because the monkeys came down close to us and we were able to get some good photos. The little boat tour was short. Didn't see much, but it was nice to relax and take a little tour of the river. There was another boat tour that was worth the small extra charge for. The staff were unorganized when they were trying to even out the weight and we had to get out of the boat and go on the next one. The aquariums were interesting. The otters were playing with a walnut and amused us for quite a while. We took our time at the large aquarium with the manatees. They were very friendly, coming up to the glass when we got to the top. The Giant Pandas were really cute too. Worth a visit in my opinion. We booked our tickets in advance and saved a few dollars."
,,the best,5.0,,"it's amazing, you can see the different river animals alongside with amazing natural scenery of Singapore, it is amazing for kids and teens as well as adults."
,,Good day out,4.0,,"We decided to catch the train then bus to river safari it was easy recommend doing this way. Experience different ways much cheaper than a taxi ride. It cost us approximately $4 each way. So easy can't get list.
Lots to do there walk around go on boat ride watching animals lots of photo opportunities.
Walk through an underground section where fish are swimming all around you.
Pleanty of information to read.
Good way to spend a few hours.
If you want you can then go to the zoo and later the night safari.

But we did like this place. Enjoyed the zoo more but this came a close second"
,,One of the best Water Park,5.0,,Amazon Quest is the best activity. We were late so be mindful all the activities will be closed after 6PM.
,,A Pleasant experience!,4.0,,"It has a nice theme covering flora and fauna of major rivers of the world. Best experiences here are watching the Giant Panda, Boat cruise and Amazon boat ride. One must visit to experience these three things."
,,A nice walk around highlighted by Panda,4.0,,This is one of the other attractions associated with the Singapore zoo. You need to purchase a ticket and it is based on the great drivers of the world and the associated wildlife. Lots to see and read about. The reservoir cruise is a nice relaxed jaunt and the theme park styled river cruise is a 10 minute bit of fun and a chance to see some animals along the way. It is basically a giant loop track that takes a good couple of hours to go around. The highlight are the two panda. Lots of people but great photo opportunities. Another must do.
,,"A good experience, but not as good as Night Safari",4.0,,"Whilst I find the Night Safari next door better, this was still something interesting to do with different animals up close.
The team there really are great with customers. I would recommend making sure you join the river trail talks and feeding as they give you a chance to get up close and personal and find out really interesting information about the animals.
We had a really hot day and there weren't many people there which made it better for our family (2A, 2K - 10 & 12)
The river cruise (included in the entry price) was a little lame and the novelty of the boat ride wore off with the kids pretty quickly (even though it is only 15 minutes).
The Amazon river cruise was a little extra (S$5A S$3K). You can go several times but have to exit and rejoin the queue. This goes for around 10 minutes and was just too fast to enjoy and you couldn't see many of the animals (but this could have been the time of day for us)
The Panda's are a highlight (and the exhibit is refreshingly cool away from the heat) and the Otters are amazing to watch when they are swimming.
Overall, a good family half day. We went online and got cheaper tickets which I would recommend - along with spending time at the zoo also as it is a fair trek out of town."
,,Too many fishes,2.0,,"I was expecting zoo and not aquarium. Except the Panda, Tiger and a few more animals, nothing special."
,,Excellent Service,4.0,,After a bumpy organisation through a hotel concierge the staff at the river safari looked after us incredible well to resolve ticketing issues - front counter staff member Balqis was especially helpful! Many thanks.
,,"Nice concept of a ""zoo""",5.0,,"Every experience to the River Safari is always different for me. A new concept to how animals are displayed and grouped based on the rivers that they are commonly found. Covered area, and a guided path to walk through all the exhibits. Animals are different from the Singapore Zoo, so one should visit both if possible. There are 2 rides that will appeal to young and old. Must go."
,,Linear,2.0,,"Perhaps the biggest problem I have with the river safari is that there is no decision making left to the visitor. There is a pretty much set path that you follow that takes you to the exhibits, the space is designed such that you dont even have alternate paths."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"I was there with my nephews when we visited the zoo. The tickets include a free boat ride. Queuing for about 15 mins to take the boat ride but it's a waste of time. There's nothing much to see and boring ride.

It'll be a good place to visit during hot weather as most of them are indoor. So if you plan to visit Zoo & river safari, you may plan to visit river safari in the afternoon and morning or evening to the Zoo."
,,Disapointed,3.0,,"The animal i can see only giraffe and rhinos,can not see closer too.Too bored,sleepy in the river and wasting time."
,,Interesting and educational,4.0,,"The park is very well laid out with covered walkways for you to explore the various exhibits and river systems. You can see the animals up close, and the highlight is the pair of pandas (Jia Jia and Kai Kai). You can take the 15-min slow boat ride to catch a glimpse of the animals at the Singapore Zoo next door, or try the Amazon cruise. Food options are available but a little on the expensive side."
,,"Surprising, informative and diverse",4.0,,"If you visit the singapore zoo, please visit this place too. It is so amazing and full of creatures that you rarely will see like the manatee, gharial and the giant panda. The giant pandas are in a chilled dome and it was so surreal actually seeing one for the first time.
Please be informed that Singaporean weather is notoriously fickle and it can rain torrentially in a matter of minutes so always pack a raincoat or umbrella. Because of rain many of the rides close. Also it does take two hours to see the park so visit these places near noon so that they coincide with a visit to the night safari"
,,Time waste,2.0,,There is nothing to see in this safari river ride is of 15 mins slow biat feeling sleepy not a single animal is spotted tiring ride they have nothing to show just wating your time by making u stand in queue
,,A wonderful surprise,4.0,,"This place was a present surprise.

It's designed around the various river systems of the world with the decor and animals set to match. You can literally walk through every major river system of the world in one park.

There's a little cruise around the natural reservoir that the park backs onto, allowing you to see some of the Singapore Zoos animals. And the Amazon cruise was good, but a little underwhelming. Good thing it only cost $5 otherwise it wouldn't be worth it.

If you can, try to come here."
,,River Safari and zoo,4.0,,"Excellent half days outing with all you could want. Designed for children and very educational, the River Safari has lots to offer including a pair of pandas seen quite close up. Booklets and notes for childen from quite a young age. Not too expensive and with plenty of clean toilets and water fountains for all. Suitable for all ages though there is a lot of walking i but it is pleasant and well arranged. Food strategically placed at the centre of the Safari with limited but quite reasonabe food. some queuing on busy holidays but not for too long. The boat trip gives an option of a fast flat boat or a log flume type boat through the forest. Animals can been seen up close. An excellent outing for children and highly educational."
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"We've done this one after the Singapore Zoo and I have to admit that even though it is still a nice experience (we stayed for about 3 hours and were not bored) it was a bit disappointing.
- Animals were not as spectacular as in the Zoo (and we could hardly see the pandas).
- River cruise was a 30 min queue (though 15 minutes was displayed) for a very quick cruise around a river with no animals to see except the ones from the zoo

Maybe the only interesting attraction was the Amazon Cruise (with additional fees).

Not sure I'd go back..."
,,the standard zoo is much better! river safari is just too small,3.0,,"pros:
- unique experience for offering a boat tour thru river and mechanical boat tour while seeing animal thru amazon quest
- you can see panda and red panda
- you also can see dugong, giant cat fish, alligator fish, small anaconda
- giant aquarium to see dugong and another river fish

cons
- the river boat tour not showing anything besides few girrafe and rhinos further away at the zoo. that is nothing more! while we need to wait nearly 40 minutes to get the boat!
- the amazing quest should be fun because we can see animal closer. but during my trip we're not seeing many monkey here. while the trip is just too short.
- you need to pay extra to get amazon ride!
- there are certain height limit for your kids before taking ride on river cruise and amazon ride
- walking thru river safari feel much shorter and smaller than regular zoo
- there's a section while we can walk and see the monkey closer. i dont see many monkey available. not sure if that because we came at daylight (around 1pm) or not many monkey available in park
- there's only 1 restaurant available inside river safari. they're offering chinese food"
,,A Unique experience of major rivers and their habitants around the world,5.0,,"It is a very compact exhibit, and takes not more than 2 to 3 hours to finish, so it can be done along with the Zoo during the same day. The aquariums are massive and give a very good up front views of various river fishes. The key highlights would be the Giant Panda in a frozen building, amazing to see one in a zoo, and the Indian Gharial crocodile in an aquarium separated just 3 inches away from you, and the green anacondas at almost touching distance. We thought there would be a boat ride going through the park, but it is actually all walking / walk-in exhibits. There is a boat ride in a large pontoon in the adjoining fresh water lake (singapore's drinking water reserve), but it lasts only 15 mins and mainly just a float around with some interesting trivia on the plants growing on the sides of the lake. Definitely a must see to complete the Zoo experience."
,,Wildlife Worth Visiting,5.0,,"I'm somewhat appalled by some earlier reviews saying that there is nothing much to see here except for pandas. Errrr, if you are not interested in wildlife at all, then you shouldn't visit the River Safari at all - BUT there is definitely a lot more to see here, apart from the pandas.

The river otters are a lively and playful bunch; the dugongs are graceful and extremely viewable from the underwater exhibits; there are jaguars and crocodiles and anacondas; the arowana feeding time is very interesting to watch (these are large fish that leap powerfully out of water to catch their prey); and the sturgeons (pre-historic fish that dates back to the dinosaur era) are quite a sight to behold."
,,Kids loved it,5.0,,We have spent the whole day there with family. Kids loved it alot. And for the first time they fell in love with animals as normally they get bored of the zoos. The ride on boat was the best part.
,,Only place to see Pandas in Singapore,4.0,,"Despite being in Singapore for a long time now, the giant Pandas are still top draw. Bringing you from North America to India to China to Thailand, most exhibits are drawn from all over the world. But at the end, the giant Pandas are still the ones that attract the most crowd and you can see why after spending 30 mins observing them. Worth every penny you spend just for them."
,,Very nice Safari,5.0,,"From the all safaris, we have chosen to visit the river safari. I can not compare with other safaris, but this one was very nice even it was hot. The river cruise and the amazons were very nice. It has lots of waterlife animals in the indoor. So that you will not feel the temperatures."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"Better than expected. Other than the cute pandas, there are many other interesting animals. The park is part sheltered part outdoor, which make it easy to explore in our hot and humid climate. The tickets for the Amazon River Quest was worth it."
,,Pandas are a must see!,3.0,,"We covered this as part of the park hopper plus package - honestly had the package not been such a great value, I would have probably skipped river safari. I am glad that I didn't! The star attraction are the two pandas - kind of ironic considering this is the River safari.
it features different river systems of the world, but honestly unless you are a marine biologist or a person with extreme interest in fishes, it's kind of hard to differentiate after a point in time. The boat ride that was included in the package was meh. The Amazon River quest was an interesting way to look at the animals, but nothing that I would go out of my way to experience."
,,More indoorsy and boring compared to the Zoo,4.0,,"Just next to the zoo and opened a few years ago , this ""river safari"" is smaller and (thankfully) half was indoors with AC fewer atttactions and certainly less impressive than the zoo sibling"
,,Unsatisfied about the photo booth,4.0,,"My first time visit was in October when we went for the Halloween event. We had such a great time and so brought the children here again on Dec
Able to ride the Amazon River Puest more than 1 round. We took 4 rounds of rides to see all animals as they were hiding. My kids had enjoyed it.
There is a wall separated between Kai Kai and Jia Jia. Compared with other pandas in China, they looked sad and bored. Are they happy in Singapore or feel stress on conceiving?
The 4 wallet size photos from the photo booth which I purchased $30 were cut without the border below. Half of our bodies were gone and my kids can only seems with their heads. The assistant replied wallet size is like this kind. I wasn't't being highlighted when I made the payment and requested reprint. So I accepted the photos without the logo of River Safari at the top. Please have a good alignment on the size of the photos. I feel unworth and regretted to purchase the photos.
I give 4 stars because of the Halloween event organised by Safari Boo is good."
,,For young children,3.0,,"Cheaper & easier to buy ticket online. If you need map, you need to ask from the staff when you enter. They only give when request.
mostly see big fishes, turtle & those that live in water...
only thing to look forward is Panda. Paid extra for the Amazon River Boat Ride, only saw jaguar sleeping, capybara & flamingo.... cant spot the monkeys at all. You can go for 1 more round, just exit at the right you will see some staff there and get them to stamp on yr hand to re ride."
,,Tourist trap but otherwise okay,3.0,,"It is pretty much a tourist trap if you are not interested in Panda. If you are, then just treat the entry fee as a fee to see Panda (and nothing else)."
,,Beautiful park,4.0,,"Took the kids there in combination with Singapore Zoo which is right next door. Great layout, easy to walk around and lots of covered pathways which provide relief and shade on hot days. Aquariums were all excellent and beautifully maintained. Pandas were a highlight. The included boat tour was a bit boring but the kids loved the Amazon one which was an extra payment. Manatees exhibit was fabulous. Probably not a full day - best in combination with one of the other neighbouring parks."
,,Tourist trap...,3.0,,"Trust me, if you are not a giant panda fan, you can easily give it a skip. It's an ordinary aquarium, that has been clubbed with the giant panda enclosure to entice tourists.

Small, and does not offer any thing significant. This, along with the night Safari, are biggest disappointments of Singapore."
,,All things river plus pandas to boot,5.0,,Great attraction thats nicely paced and sheltered. All the attractions are very well made and well suited to their individual animals natural habitat. The panda enclosure is also amazing and is far superior to the famous chengdu panda enclosure.
,,Wheelchair friendly,5.0,,"Went with my mil who is on wheelchair, no problem at all. Toilet for wheelchair available too. All walkway is covered with shades, no problem with rain. Whole area is clean, shady & spacious. Interesting fishes especially those in the giant big tanks. Love the pandas area too, cooling environment, clean air & no smell at all."
,,Fun outing for young children,4.0,,Great for young kids. Educational and relaxing. Place is well maintained. Comfortable with shades and aircon (considering Singapore's weather). Older children may expect more activities.
,,Interesting New Attraction,4.0,,"My wife and I visited this place the last time we were in Singapore, it was a very interesting attraction. We were able to see water-life from the major river systems around the world. Well Done Singapore."
,,"Omg yesssss, pandas!!!!",5.0,,"This was a highlight of going to Singapore itself!!!! There was plenty of fish to see and turtles, but we came to see the pandas and were not disappointed!!!! Definitely would have liked some more time to explore here as we arrived late, but definitely will be coming back."
,,"Some good, some not so good",4.0,,"Located next to the Singapore zoo, and the Night safari, this attraction is something new and different.

I didn't really know what to expect though. What's a river safari? Do you walk or ride down the river?

Well, first of all, this park is located in north part of Singapore, kind of away from downtown. There's no easy way to get here, and you need to take a combination of subway and buses, or two buses, to get here.

For the most part, you walk through this attraction. You follow a path that shows you some animals you may encounter through different continent's river systems. It's not very comprehensive. You just see a few animals here and there. Near the end of going down to the lake, you go into a panda exhibit. Now, this was something different, and worth the price of admission if you have kids who love panda. Instead of watching them behind glass, here you can see the two pandas from a bridge overlook. Depending on what they are doing, you can get an up close look at them. Since it's air-conditioned, it's also a nice respite from the heat.

After that, it's a 5-minute walk to the lake front, and you can wait for the boat ride on the lake. Now, this is totally boring. Except a glimpse or two of animals in the Singapore Zoo, this ride doesn't really show you much. If your legs are tired, I supposed it's a good break.

Next to the lake/reservoir boat ride is another optional boat ride. This one you have to pay, and it claims you can see jaguars. Well, we didn't see any jaguar, or half of the animals they claim you could see. You wind through this tiny stream on a boat, and hope you can catch glimpse of some animals. This was kind of a disappointment.

At least the last part of this was kind of interesting. You finally end up in a large building, with a large tank. Similar to an aquarium, you see some supposed fresh-water animals. Beavers are kind of interesting, and manatees are big and slow moving.

Overall I would say it's a mixed bag. There's enough walking that I'm not sure I would do this and another attraction on the same day."
,,Make sure you visit the River Safari,5.0,,"In case you like nature and animals make sure you visit the River Safari! It’s entrance is right next to the entrance of Singapore Zoo so better plan visiting both on the same day as they are away from the city and it’s quite a long ride to get there. You can also reach the placi by one of the hop-on hop-off routes. Otherwise taxi ride is the fastest way to get there.
It’s also worth to take the boat ride there (normally there is an additional fee for it). You ca see lots of river animals plus a red and giant panda. The sunk forest is actually the largest sweet water aquarium we have ever seen – really impressive!
We visited the place with iVenture pass so admission was free for us, including a 30 min lake cruise and the boat ride."
,,Too small to be a standalone attraction,3.0,,"Late in November 2016 I visited the River Safari for the first time. I had heard good reviews of the place from friends so I was looking forward to spending a day here. But the place proved to be somewhat of a let down because it was simply too small. The place can easily be covered in under 2 hours if you have a mind to.

While the panda exhibition was interesting and the Amazon boat ride added a somewhat theme park feel to the place, the place just didn't feel like a complete, coherent attraction that could stand on its own. It felt like the place was pieced together from excess animals that could not fit in the zoo just next door.

The saving grace was that with such a small park and less visitors we got to do more animal interactions than we would have elsewhere. But all in all, you wouldn't want to come all the way to this remote location just for this River Safari."
,,Good for rainy/very hot seasons as park is mostly sheltered,3.0,,"Went on Sunday mid-noon where the park was surprisingly not crowded. We did not start with River Wonder entrance but instead went by the Flooded Forest way and made our way to Amazon River Quest which we did once we arrived. Good thing was, there were no queues for the River Quest, however was surprised that we have to pay for the 10 mins ride (SGD$5 Adults, SGD$3 Child).

The most thrilling part for me personally was when the boat had to be ""lifted"" to start the ride. For a 10 mins ride and with the limited number of sightings, I am not sure if it's worth to pay. Comparing to the rides in the Zoo, Bird Park, Night Safari - even though we have to pay extra for those rides, the duration was longer and we have the option of hopping on and off the trams. For the boat ride, the sightings were limited as what is there, is there or isn't. The habitat was man-made and looks quite small for these supposed 'free-ranging' animals.

When the boat 'quest' ends, the staff said we can get a stamp on our hand for a re-ride which we did because we did not see anything much in that first ride, which was about 12.30 pm...perhaps nap time for the animals. We took the ride again at about 3 pm where waiting time states 25 mins but we waited for only about 15 mins. If the queue had been longer, I am not sure if I'd wait again to experience the limited number of sightings.

For the River Cruise, great that it was free and quite scenic. No expectations for that ride for me but I thought it'd be great if it was a live commentary.

We were around the Yangtze River exhibit when my 6-year old needed the toilet. Without a map, I thought of just finding a toilet around the Rivers of the World exhibits. So we passed by Mekong River, the touch pool, Mary River, Ganges River, River Nile and we still could not find a toilet!! We passed by Congo River and I realized we were already back at the entrance where we have no choice but to exit and go to the toilet outside the entrance. After looking at the map, I was really surprised that there really were no toilets at the River of the World exhibits! And it is quite a looooong walk!

I read in the FAQs about the food options in River Safari. As I require halal food, I read that ""All food ingredients for all F&B outlets in the River Safari come from halal sources. However, most outlets are not certified halal because alcohol is served."" But I checked out River Safari Tea House and they served 'Char Siew Platter' and 'Teochew Bak Kut Teh' - which I am very sure they are pork, which is non-halal. So for those who need halal food, do visit the other dining places outside the Singapore Zoo instead (KFC Restaurant and Ah Meng Kitchen)."
,,Not so great. Boat rides are average,3.0,,Didn't much enjoy this place. Its average and especially if you are visiting the night safari or zoo then don't bother to visit.
,,Great display!!!,5.0,,"It has a great variety of display. Basically shows you all the several great rivers if the world and it inhabitants. The key highlights is the panda and you get to take a river cruise along the river. Great for kids...do bring extra water n a fan. Humidity is very high now 32 degrees sun.

Over all enjoyed it.

* note
If you are taking a bus back from the safari to town. You need to buy them online earlier. I wanted to take a bus to Bedok. But was told I need to buy the tickets online prior. Well it was not mention on the board to buy online. Anyway we took uber back which is much quicker."
,,Not up to our expectations,1.0,,"Took the multipark option when purchasing tickets and chose river safari and night safari.
But disappointed with river safari.
Should hv gone for singapore zoo.
River cruise was pointless as it brings u one circle around the lake. Bad luck but nothing could be seen of the elephants or any of the other three POI.
Amazon ride was also disappointing as Jaguars were asleep.

But if you have not been to any type of these rides or safari, then , maybe its ok for you.

The plus side was the pandas.
That was good."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"The visit had been eye opening for us, as the river habitat is not something you normally see in the zoo or water theme parks anywhere. A good visit for family with children, younger and older."
,,Post-exams,5.0,,"Amazing showcase with nice cooling facilities. Everyone was here for the pandas but im here more for the water rides! There is two types. Relaxing one going about mandai river. The fun packed adventure one in a small boat with water splashing at you, bringing you around.. ""the wild"". The eatery is not too bad and is bigger than Zoo. Of course still pricey but its alright."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,Good for visit even on a hot day as most of the walkways are covered. Good collection of marine life. The Giant Pandas are a must see. the Amazon River Quest is quite worth the money. You can take it twice at no additional cost if you dont mind queuing for it again. The visit can be finished in 3 hours (if you dont read every description in detail)
,,Superb visit,5.0,,"Had a very nice day at the River Safari beside the Singapore Zoo, so many animals and fish to look at. Loved the pandas, they were so cute and looked like they really enjoyed the place. We also took the boat, we did not see much on that, but it only took 15 minutes so was a nice break from walking."
,,Dinosaurs and a 'celebrity couple',4.0,,"Both the Singapore Zoo and River Safari are holding a dinosaur themed trail 'Zoo-rassic Park' till March 2017. There are large dinosaur animatronics on display at both the zoo and RS plus info boards comparing some of their animals to their prehistoric relatives. If you go on weekends, you can participate in their activities.

1) Trail : Complete a trail to earn a badge

2) Live and preserved animal specimens displayed near the entrance, alongside a fossil finding activity.

3) Craft activities near the boat plaza, my kids made a snapping turtle keychain, a scratch art bookmark and a little finger puppet...very nice and good quality crafts.

(2) and (3) are only available on weekends till 18 Dec, and till 4pm. I assume the trail can be done on any day throughout the week.

The trail makes the walk through the park a bit more purposeful and informative. A must-do for dinosaur fans. The animatronics are quite realistic and scared many kids, and impressed many adults based on the ooh and ahhs.

We also opted to participate in the 'Meet the American Beavers' special experience. You have to purchase additional tickets for this, and they bring you to the beavers' enclosure which is near the boat plaza. Kevin, our guide is very passionate about his job and interacted so easily with Justin and Selena (the beavers, not the singers). He shared with us a lot of interesting information about the animals and patiently answered my children's non-stop questions. We also got to feed and stroke them (their fur is so sooofftttt). Undoubtedly, this is a bit of a money-making venture for them but it was a good experience for us.

The river cruise is now included in the admission. It's just a slow ride on the Seletar Reservoir. When the cruise first started it used to include a zookeeper segment where they showed us specimens but now it's just a boat ride. You may be able to catch a glimpse of some of the animals at the Zoo and some native wild birds.

The Amazon River Quest is a more worthy ride although catching the animals is a real hit or miss. But if you're lucky, you can catch the giant anteater (only at RS) and the very beautiful leopard in a stunning enclosure. But the boat doesn't stop so if you might miss them if you blink."
,,"Combine with Night Safari, worth for the Pandas",4.0,,"If you combine with Zoo or night Safari worth going.
All three are located close by and to avoid the transportation best to combine all 3 but can be tiring, so can split into 2 days if you have time.
Definitely the attraction are the Pandas, hope you are lucky they are awake, when awake they are pleasing and cute to watch.
The river cruise is complimentary, get a 30 Mts rest with the cruise, do not expect much.
Amazon river ride , please by additional tickets.
If you are going to go to all 4 Parks please buy the park hopper to save on tickets.
Amazon ride is something children will enjoy."
,,fantastic place,5.0,,beautiful raver safari . while i see animals im very happy even when i saw panda its really special time in my life . i will try to come again next year . amazing place i love thsi place.
,,"""Panda"" Safari",3.0,,"A must-place to go if you want to see a panda, or you a crazy fan of Kungfu panda, like my kids. The name is river safari and we expected to see a lots of fishes there. However, they have less than some aquariums in Dubai. Moreover, the ride is so boring because we can't see any animals there. Some of them still sleeping or out of my eyes. The most interesting place is Panda zone. Unluckily, he was still sleeping at that time."
,,A great place for all!,5.0,,This is probably the second time that I've been to the River Safari and its still a fun and enriching experience for me. The place is much smaller than the zoo and thus is easier to navigate around. The highlights of this place are the pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia. I too enjoyed the Amazon River Quest and the cute Red Pandas!
,,A nice place with different theme,5.0,,"River safari is near Singapore zoo. This is a nice concept (created artificially) where you can see animals which live along and inside river and sea. They have two Pandas which are very cute. You can visit this place just to see those pandas. You will see different small fishes and large fishes, alligators and crocodiles, birds and other animals which lives near a river. You will need max of 3 hrs to cover entire area. There is also a boat ride which we couldn't take as it was already houseful for the day. You can plan for Singapore zoo, river safari and night safari on same day as they all are in the same place just next to each other."
,,Cute Pandas,5.0,,"Only about $20 by taxi on Saturday morning, River Safari was recommended because of shelter afforded from sun and rain. Paid extra for short Amazon River boat ride, loved it."
,,Serene and educational,5.0,,"The River safari is beautifully constructed and the was interesting from the beginning with beavers and manatees near the entrance. Although the walk to the Amazon River Quest took a while, the view of the reservoir was very pretty and the line for the ride was very fast. The ride itself was short and fun, with close-up encounters of animals along that ride. Very excellent addition to the zoo!"
,,A good 3 hours of fun,3.0,,"We visited the river safari as a group of adults, senior citizens and an infant. We spent around 3 hours at the river safari and were able to cover almost everything in that time.
We took a taxi to the river safari and got dropped off at the zoo entrance. The river safari entrance is a stone's throw from there, so quite convenient. We followed the park map in an anti clockwise fashion. Spending 10-15 min at most sections would be more than sufficient. The conceptualization is very good, although sometimes you feel very less space has been devoted to the animals. There a couple of viewing decks along the path to help you get a better view of the lake. If you're not taking the safari (we couldn't because we were with an infant), then you'd need to cross the lake using a bridge to view the other half of the park.
There are a couple of eateries and restaurants inside the park and they've provided benches at quite a few places for resting (considering you've to walk a lot). The whole park is stroller friendly with numerous diaper changing rooms. However, there's not much scope to let your infant down for crawling anywhere.
Overall, spending 2-3 hours here would be more than sufficient I'd say. One could go there around 2-3PM and then continue on to night safari which is what we did."
,,It's with Plantiful animals and lots of fun.,5.0,,"River Safari is a good zoo. We are happy to see plentiful animals by walk or by boat. It's made me like stay at an amusement park. We can very close to see animals and we had lots of fun in it. Especially, if your family have child or elder they would be very happy and enjoy this place."
,,Make your own travel arrangements,3.0,,"This tour was advertised in Tour East's brochure found in our hotel. It was advertised as 3.5 hours including travelling time. The pick up was at 1.20pm. That took us to a central meeting point in Chinatown where we waited for 30 minutes on a bus with the air con turned off. The it was another 40 mins to the River Safari. We only got 2 hours to do the whole attraction. We missed out one of the boat rides because we did not have time. We bought some of the professional photos at the attraction, but because they took about 10 minutes to print them I was about 10 minutes late for the bus. They were about to offload my friends who had got to the bus because they would not wait any longer for me. I complained because we had waited 30 minutes at the start, and they were not happy to wait 10 minutes for me. As opposed to apologising the guide made some excuse about having to be on time at their next pick up. We were still back in the city with 30 minutes to spare before their next pick up. Also it was advertised as a guided tour. What that meant was we had a guy on the bus talking to us. Once we arrived at the attraction we were on our own.

However, seeing the pandas was an amazing experience. Don't be put off River Safari. Just get there by taxi and avoid ""Tour East Singapore"" at all costs."
,,Great place to spend half a day!,5.0,,"My family and I finally decided to visit the River Safari and it sure didn't disappoint. We had bought our tickets online so were able to enjoy the 25% residents discount, which was nice, as we found the admission price slightly steep for a relatively small place (as compared to the zoo for eg). However, after our visit and seeing how everything was well set up for both visitors and the animals, I have to say the price is well worth it.

The route to take to visit the place is well marked out, so visitors won't have to waste time trying to figure out where to go. Most of the visitor routes were well sheltered so it was quite comfortable walking though the various areas. There was a nice mix of animals, all in their natural habitats.

The highlight would have to be Kai Kai and Jia Jia, our adorable pandas. I've only ever seen pandas one other time, at Ocean Park in HK, and was expecting to see lazy, lacklustre pandas and being rushed through the viewing area. Instead, we were allowed to stay for as long as we wanted and were charmed by the energetic Kai Kai who moved around his enclosure munching on bamboo leaves before moving on to search for other snacks. Jia Jia was less mobile, but looked adorable, snuggled against a tree to enjoy her feast of bamboo leaves.

After that, we followed the recommendation of other reviewers and skipped the cruise, opting instead for the Amazon River Quest. We sure didn't regret the extra $5 each that we had to pay. It allowed us to see the animals really up close. The only disappointment was that some of the animals were hiding when we went by. But at the end of our ride, we were asked if we wanted a re-ride! Of course, we said yes!! And on the second round, we got to see some of the animals we had missed earlier.

The aquarium area was also excellent. As you walk around the area, you can see the sea animals at different levels. Personal favourites were the playful otters and gentle manatees! To end off, there is a squirrel monkey forest where one can be immersed in their natural habitat and see numerous monkeys right in front of you with no barriers.

We also picked up a few nice and not overpriced souvenirs at the souvenir shop! Some things to note: as beverages and food are quite pricey inside, it is advisable to bring along your own snacks if you get peckish along the way. Additionally, if you want to be able to take your time and get great photo opportunities without the chaos of a crowd, do go early in the morning (when it opens at 10) and on a weekday, to avoid the peak periods. However, all in all, the River Safari was a great way to spend our morning. As a Singaporean, I have to say that I'm proud that we have created another world class wildlife reserve. In future, I won't just be recommending the Zoo to my overseas friends - the River Safari will also be on my list of recommendations!"
,,A very different take on aquatic nature!!,4.0,,"A must see, specially if your going to be doing the night safari too.. While you can do all three (river safari, night safari & zoo) in a day. it can get tiring specially if you have small kids.. The Zoo is a regular one, so my choices are the river & night safari. Book on online sites to get cheap deals & avoid the hassle of queing up after reaching there.. Klook is the best & offers good deals, except that you pay in US$ instead of SG$). THe Panda park is the highlight & a must do!!"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Very interesting and well worth the visit. Suggest you go by taxi or public transport as doing it with a tour company, you spend as much time on tour buses as at park. Lots of educational information around. Loved the Pandas which were on view eating. You need to allow time to walk around whole site. Do visit the nursery/info centre. Boat rides OK but a bit quick and hit and miss if you actually see any animals. However the rest of the park makes up for this."
,,Not too bad..,4.0,,"We had the Park Hopper ticket and so we went for this in the evening.. try and plan to reach a little early. There is a boat cruise where we saw a Jaguar and some endangered species.

Loved the different wild life showcased from different rivers.. including the Mekong, Yangtze and Ganga...

There are two giant pandas.

The park is well sheltered and so you can visit during the day in rainy weather and sunny days..."
,,Borinh,2.0,,"Really boring experience... $70 for 4 park ticket, this was the worst of the 3 we visited (zoo and night safari). We did the boat cruise which was particularly dull (no animals to see). Lots of fish to see if you like that sort of thing. Worth doing only if you have some time to kill before night safari"
,,Interesting park showcasing wildlife from different Asian rivers!,5.0,,"Went there with high expectations about Kai Kai & Jia Jia only and didn't really expect that much surprise! Really fascinated by what the park showcases - different wildlife from Asian rivers such as Mekong River and Yangtze River and underwater animal species at an aquarium - apart from the two pandas. Apart from that, the park is well sheltered, which means there's not much of a headache during sunny and rainy weathers."
,,Not as I had hoped,4.0,,"I looked forward to this river safari, and I am sad to say it did nothing for me, the 15 minutes on the ""boat"" was of little real value. The overall experience was good."
,,25 minutes of my life I won't get back,3.0,,The river boat cruse included as part of the park admission is just a 25 or so minutes waste of good time. The rest of the park is very good the water ride that you pay extra for is worth the extra. Instead of the cruse spend the time in the panda enclosure.
,,Great place for families,5.0,,"Wonderful place for locals and tourists. The guides are friendly and knowledgeable. Lots of opportunities for family photo. You will need to bring your own bottle as drinks are rather expensive inside. The amazon river quest is a must try as you get to see animals along the 'river'. The stars must be the 2 panda bears, jia jia and kai kai. Trip is worth every single cent and will go there again."
,,Recommended for an enjoyable family visit,4.0,,"Managed to see the Panda - the main attraction. There are few other animal coves but the other main features include very well done aquariums and a boat ride.

As expected, everything is very well organized, clean and safe. I visited with my wife on a weekday so it wasn't very crowded and I enjoyed stroll, was a good and a quick getaway from the usual routine."
,,Definitely omit the cruise and walk the River Safari,2.0,,"The river cruise comprises of a ten minute loop of the lake and is basically viewing a few obscure animals from the zoo itself.

In the distance you may see a giraffe or two, a few rhino’s and a couple of elephants, (bring your zoom lens).

Most disappointing, was the fact that the elephants were chained by the legs in a small clearing so you could view them.

They were clearly distressed and trying to pull the chains to free themselves while the keepers were hiding nearby.

Having participated in many wildlife cruises throughout the world, I can honestly say that this is not a true river cruise, but more of a charade.

This pretence should be an embarrassment to the zoo and is a travesty, perhaps even cruelty, to the poor elephants involved.

By all means, viewing the aquariums and other parts of the zoo by foot is far more pleasing, but omit this artificial cruise."
,,A great half day activity to combine with the zoo,5.0,,"We got the multi park ticket and came here whilst waiting to feed the elephants at the zoo. It's a really nice park for a wander and seeing all the different river environments and the animals that live there. The highlight is definitely the pandas which you don't find everywhere so are worth the effort to see! At first they were hiding round the back but then one came out and it was really nice to see.

There's a free boat ride where you go on the lake and see some of the zoo animals from the water. Then you can pay extra to go on the ""log flume"" which isn't really a log flume, it has a couple of timid drops but you don't generally get wet. It's a really nice idea to go through the animals enclosures on a boat and it's a nice relaxing way to do it. It's also cool to go through the jaguar enclosures!"
,,Excellent,4.0,,"Very informative, well displayed and very interesting. It held the attention of young and old! The rivers of the world were excellent. Unfortunately one of the pandas was too shy to come out in the open. The section on the Amazon was outstanding in every respect.
The only negative was the electric boat ride. With a boat full of school children it was impossible to hear softly spoken commentary. Don't bother with the boat ride !"
,,Great on a rainy day,4.0,,Our visit to the River Safari was on a rainy day so we were worried we would be drenched by the end. However we were surprised and delighted to find the whole park is undercover! This is a fantastic fresh water aquarium and is great for all ages. Easy to walk around and can complement with the Zoo and or Night Safari on the same day. I felt sorry for the poor pandas because despite the staff telling everyone to stay quiet there were still children screaming and running around. Was disappointed that the River cruise was an extra cost after already forking out a lot to go to all of the parks. Overall a great park
,,Very Cool,5.0,,"A very nice attraction. we loved the Amazon Quest ride. We had a light rain so it made the ride so much more interesting. Very cool animals and the Scarlet Ibis is almost close to touch. A very cool Jaguar was also on display.

The best was the Panda attraction. The male was fast asleep. the female was not in the open area. flash photography is not allowed in the Panda enclosure.

Online ticket purchase is advised. Do some research to find special offer site that have cheaper tickets."
,,"A compliment to the main zoo, plus some water based rides",4.0,,"One of three zoos within walking distance of each other (main, river, night). This river safari operates next door to the main zoo, and contains many of the aquatic species you would expect to see, as well as those that ride in rainy season type countries. Be sure to check out the river ride, as well as the lake boat tour."
,,Worlds best Fresh water aquarium,5.0,,"If you were ever a fan of the show River Monsters I highly recommend this park.
All the animals on the show are on display here.

If I had to fault River Safari it would be on the boat ride in the park. Would've really loved it if the ride was significantly slower. A huge amount of exhibits along this ride took time to find the animals and there was unfortunately not enough time because of the speed of the ride.

all in all loved the way this park displayed there exhibits. The giant river otter, panda house, Mekong river tank and Chinese alligator were my highlights. park staff were all vary friendly in helping me get pictures of some of the animals, the talks were some what drab though.

All in ll a GREAT park !!!!"
,,Long Weekend,5.0,,This is an excellent area to take the family covered areas ensure sun and heat are kept away as much as possible - well run and some great exhibits - Panda's and Amazon are the best for us as a group - very interesting
,,Did not see the panda,3.0,,"I suppose the panda are a huge draw for people coming here. So you can imagine my disappointment when I did not see them. They do have CCTV to show you the panda and the tv screen is small. (As attached in the photo.)

Oh well... the big fishes are nice but overall you tend to walk a lot more before seeing anything interesting."
,,Nice way to pass a few hours,4.0,,"The river safari was pretty enjoyable! The layout is great and very easy to get around and see everything.

The Amazon river quest is good, it goes a little fast so it's hard to see the monkeys and other animals....but you can go around a second time if you wish.
It's mostly indoors too so if it rained it wouldn't make much difference!"
,,Went for Halloween boo and it was a boo,1.0,,"1st time going to river safari and was maybe the wrong choice.. Went for the Halloween special and it was packed.. Huge queues for everything so could not really enjoy the experiences, show was sold out so it was either stand and wait another hour or go around the rest.. None of the normal attractions were open so could see fishes etc but not any off the other animals

Is a nice set up in terms of cleanliness and information on the rivers and the Eco systems

Will have to maybe give it another go as we regularly visit the zoo which is fantastic

Real shame just seemed they went for volume and revenue then a quality event... Even all the restaurants were closed which is unheard in Singapore"
,,Right pace for kids,4.0,,"Traveling with a 6 year old, this attraction provides a good pace and mix of exhibits for us if compared to the larger Singapore zoo. The shaded walkways gives a pleasant stroll amongst the heat and humidity of Singapore. The main attraction was the pandas.

Lunch at the restaurant after the panda enclose was good and well timed to feed the hungry horde. Cruise was good for relaxing but can be skipped without spoiling the experience. This park gives some glimpses of the animals in Singapore zoo such as the giraffe and polar bear.

Too bad a large section of the park was closed when we were there."
,,my least favourite of the three zoos,3.0,,a bit disappointed by this park - it did not help that the park closed earlier than planned for a kids party. i did not get the point of the boat trip either. the only exiting thing is that i got to see a panda
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Nice place with different river animals. Different from the zoo.
Highlight of the place are the pandas.
Unfortunately when we went they were all asleep. But my 3 year old still enjoyed it.
We couldn't do the boat ride cause of height restrictions for my son.
The place is laid out very well. It's just one path you have to follow so it's easy and not confusing like the zoo."
,,Nice day out!,4.0,,"I was taking my 8 year old god daughter out for the day and she wanted a boat ride and suddenly I thought of the River Safari Park.
It would be the first visit for both of us. I bought my tickets online outside the park as it's cheaper for Singapore residents but when we went in 5 minutes later we were told that the boat ride called Adventure Quest was unavailable as the exhibit was being upgraded. Odd that I was able to buy tickets for it when it was unavailable. I had to get a refund of $8 from the shops or F and B outlets.
The park is well arranged and we enjoyed it! I was able to teach my young companion about different rivers in the world and she enjoyed seeing the unusual fish and other reptiles. Of course seeing the great panda's is a highlight! Then we took the other boat ride and could see the giraffes and zebras in the zoo as the parks are situated next to each other. The monkeys were interesting and the huge freshwater aquarium was impressive! We 'met' the iguana lizard and the keeper was good enough to take pictures for us. That meant that we didn't need to buy any other photo's from the park. We loved the giant river otters! They were so active! Probably the weakest link are the F and B outlets! They are really expensive and just not that great. Cheaper and more choice would be a great idea!"
,,What a great afternoon thunderstorm and all,5.0,,This attraction is a must see! I loved the set up and the unusual animals (crocodile was crazy big). The Amazon river boat was fantastic even though you don't see all the animals it was great fun. Unfortunately a massive thunderstorm came through and we couldn't do the main river boat. They had Halloween decorations around the park. Allow 2 1/2 hours plus. And bring a camera. Even when it rained the park is mostly sheltered by the walk ways and indoor attractions.
,,Halloween for Kids @ River Safari,4.0,,"Firstly to clarify that my review is purely on the Halloween event (A Merry-not-Scary kids event) that was held inside River Safari which I visit on 23rd October 2016.
The event was well organised with generous sponsors and fun-loving mascots.
On the right of the entrance was an event hall with games for kids and a photo booth which my family and I enjoyed taking photos with Halloween props. Although I thought the hall should be able to accommodate more game booths, the space is comfortable for families to move around.
Inside the River safari, we are greeted with many roving characters like the Unicon (which gives wishes), big lip , etc that offers ""treats"" for kids and my kid loves it going around collecting his treats and having photograph taken with them.
Along the way sponsors like Vitagen also gives out free drink for everyone and also Marigold for free ice creams. There are also other activities for the kids while inside the park like the arts & craft corner, game booth etc.
Probably it was for Halloween event, the panda enclosure was closed. Some of the exhibits was quite cool especially the Alligator from India that looks like a pre-historic creature and the manatees which is quite huge. At certain time slot, they also have mermaids show which wow the audiences with their dances in water.
Overall I find the event is really family oriented and suitable for kids.
I encourage parents with kids to be there !"
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"Visiting River Safari was an excellent experience. Located near the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, it provided and showcased a wide range of animals and birds never seen before. From manatees to otters to pandas to crocodiles, it hosts an excellent variety of creatures."
,,The newcomer facility in hottest Singapore,4.0,,"River Safari is very newly facility to Singapore since it has opened only in 2013.

You could see various kinds of river, ocean, and water animals which may make you cool.

Especially, a manatee vs dugong fight is awesome, but we couldn't see it, because of out of season.

Moreover, you can meet Panda & Monkey in here which should be none of related to theme of River Safari."
,,Interesting attraction,4.0,,"This is essentially a themed aquarium. The majority of the attraction consists of large tanks featuring major river systems. There is also a trip around an amazon forest - this is shorter than I expected, and 'boat' travels very fast."
,,Awesome water life!,5.0,,"A wonderful place to watch underwater life upclose. The exhibits are awesome, the place is well maintained. The amazon quest was closed on the day we visited, but we were able to do the boat ride on the river which was not a great experience. It basically showed the bank side view of the zoo exhibits like the giraffes and the elephants. All in all just a simple cruise on the lake."
,,Could be better,3.0,,Just a extension of the singapore zoo felt better option at SEA aquarium. River safari cruise is just another boat ride with sighting of zoo zebra and elephant back enclosure.
,,Day out at River safari,5.0,,"Located right next to the original singapore zoo, ample parking available. Exhibits designed and located along a shaded pathway. Half way point of the circuit is the panda exhibit. Good time for a break at the restaurant too. Scenic view from restaurant. The amazon forest exhibit is the last before exit. One of the best in the entire safari! See the sea cows underwater with the Amazon fishes up close. Mesmerizing just watching them swim around. A must visit if visiting the zoo."
,,Excellent not just for pandas !,5.0,,"Naturally everyone will go mainly for the pandas (red panda included) but there is so much more to see than that . I appreciate it's done in a style that mimics us being 'in the river' itself . If you had to choose between this or the RWS sea exhibit , I would recommend this instead as you get a richer experience."
,,Visit for the pandas,5.0,,The pandas Jia Jia and Kai Kai are the cutest animals you will see in Singapore. We went straight to Panda enclosure when the river safari opened at 10am and spent good time at the Panda enclosures. It wasn't crowded then. After that we went for the amazon river quest and did it twice back to back. The river safari boat trip was a waste of 15-20 mins. We finished River safari by 1 pm because we wanted to visit the zoo after that. It was little rushed; would have liked to spend some more time there. Its a good one with many kinds of fishes. We went on a Sunday but surprisingly there was not much rush..also because we had a parkhopper plus ticket it was a breeze everywhere we needed a ticket.
,,Quick visit.,4.0,,We visited the river safari quickly before the night safari tour with four children aged between 7 and 13.We rode the Amazon cruise late in afternoon and it well worth the extra cost.There were no lines at this time and we saw many animals up close .It was a highlight and amazing. We raced to see the pandas and they were well worth the visit. The grounds are pretty and well kept. Try to by combo tickets or tickets online as you will save a lot.You only need a few hours to visit or less.I would not go unless you also doing the Amazon cruise.We enjoy it.
,,Highlight is NOT just the PANDAS!,4.0,,"The ship ride is quite cool, sailing down the river and trying to catch for those river animals. Of course Jiajia and Kaikai have their appeal but personally I find the red pandas more interesting.
As I'm not a river creature person, all the fishes elude me, so the zoo is actually more appealing to me.
For fishes, I personally think the SEA aquarium is more interesting!"
,,It's cheaper when you buy the 4 parks in 1,4.0,,"River Safari is a great addition to the Singapore Zoo and maybe you'll take two-three hours to roam around the place plus the complimentary boat ride after that is about 10 minutes not to mention the waiting time as it differs from time to time, ours is about 20 minutes. If you are into fish and other water animals, then this deserves a visit. The kids will definitely enjoy as well as the adults. This requires half the walking compared to Singapore Zoo and it has the famed Pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia. Consider buying the stuffed toy Pandas if they are on good offer, I got mine for my girlfriend for S$89/each instead of S$150/ea."
,,Chilled out park,4.0,,"If I'm honest we only really did this park to see the pandas which were undoubtedly the highlight however it was a nicely laid out, clean park to visit that was a lot quieter than Singapore Zoo itself.

Similar to our experience in Singapore Zoo though, one of the main highlights of the park, the Amazon River Quest, was shut. We were probably only in the park for about an hour to an hour and a half but it made a good time killer before catching our evening flight."
,,Great Time witch Giant Panda,4.0,,The family spent great time in the river safari specially at boat trip and panda You can see many kind of fish seal turtle and monkey The amazon trip closed for a month so you can have gift from the shop for your money
,,Awesome...,5.0,,"I was a bit bummed initially since the Amazon River quest safari was closed the day visited. We instead got onto a pretty lame and under whelming river boat ride.

It's what we saw post that makes this place deserve a 5* . Of course Master Shifu (Red Panda) and the two Giant Pandas were the highlight. Unbelievably cute and awesome. Also, they had a pretty awesome under water aquarium with all kinds of animals that live at the bottom of the ocean like sea cow, manatees etc. The Rivers of the world exhibit which showcased fish, plants and mammals from the 5 largest rivers of the world was pretty awesome and highlighted environmental damage humans are doing to these ecosystems. Coming originally from India, was really sad about what is happening g to the the Ganges that feeds nearly half a billion people in North India. Literally poisoning with Industrial pollutants and human remains going unfiltered into India's most awesome river emanating from high up in the himalayas.

Also, sad about Congo and Nile.

Just go. It's awesome. Just don't go for the boat ride. It sucks. Everything else is awesome."
,,"Giant fish, turtles, and pointless boat rides",3.0,,"Crazy big fish, prehistoric looking crocodiles and turtles make for a good couple hours - a quarter of the animals were inaccessible (can only be seen by small log flume things which were closed), and the ""River Safari Cruise"" was a pointless waste of time; you spend 30 minutes queueing for a ten minute circle around an empty reservoir whilst the boat plays angsty teenage music which was weird.

But yeah, big fish. Kinda cool, the main Zoo and Night Safari are much better though, I felt."
,,Killed a few hours before the night safari,3.0,,"Our visit was part of a special Parkhopper Pass ticket (which was extremely good value - ability to visit 4 parks in a 7-day period) and we decided to combine this with the night safari. Unfortunately a part (what turned out to be quite a large area) of the park was closed for maintenance - but as compensation we were able to use our entrance tickets as part payment in the shop or F&B outlets. It was a pleasant walk round the park, some good exhibits. The Panda viewing area was great. 2 large areas for each panda - at the time one was sleeping, one was active - meaning you could spend as long as you wanted watching the animals.
The river cruise was a complete waste of time! The only good thing was it was 15 minutes reprieve from walking!! The Amazon river cruise was closed so we missed out on a large part of the park. The squirrel monkey walk through was good fun with the monkeys scampering around you through the trees and even along the walkway handrail! Seeing the manatees in a large tank made a change from other parks where they are kept in small areas. Might visit again - even if just to see the bit we missed on this visit."
,,Waste of time and money,1.0,,"Generally poor. A few fish, a few animals and a dreadful boat ride round a lake. Nice pandas and nice manatees. Don't bother."
,,Good Trip for the Family,4.0,,"River Safari is just beside the Singapore Zoo and we opted to go here because it will need shorter time for us to have the tour and we had to go to other place in the afternoon.

It was worth the trip. The kids (and adults) loved it. Big fish aquarium, closer look at the panda, sneak peak of the polar bear and most especially the animal tour (forgot the name where we paid separately). We've seen unfamiliar animals roaming while on the boat."
,,Amazon quest the best,4.0,,There are 2 boat rides. The River cruise and the amazon quest. Skip te river cruise. The amazon quest was very good. Loved the unexpected flashes of water as the boat goes down a little slide. It was really cosy and they let you repeat it if you liked it. When we went the second time. We spotted a couple of animals up close. Go on a week day if possible.
,,"Ok, but not great",3.0,,"This is the newest area of Singapore Zoo and was being built the last time I was around. I was very much looking forward to the river Safari as it seemed to be something a bit different. However, it just seems to be an extension of the Zoo. Animals still looked after and great views but what did annoy me was that we had to pay extra money to go on the boat ride! I was not informed about this when I booked my tickets and also the way that the River Safari is promoted I was led to believe that being on a boat ride was the majority of the attraction. In fact the boat ride was about 5 minutes long and moved way too fast so you couldn't really enjoy the animals. Like I say, it wasn't awful in anyway but I just think that they should make sure people are aware that it is not a boat trip and if you want to go on this part then it costs more money."
,,Boat ride is such a con job - Amazon River Cruise only thing worth it,2.0,,Just completed the river safari today. Overall the experience is average. The Boat ride is such a horrible experience. Complete waste of time and is a disaster. If you are thinking of not doing Amazon River Cruise which is still ok other stuff is horrible
,,Singapore River Safari,4.0,,"One of three animal parks adjacent to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari.

This park is obviously ""water"" themed and has many examples of large water creatures including crocodiles, manatees, a polar bear and lots of very large fish in big displays.

Oddly enough the main attraction is the panda bear enclosure.

The big failing point is the actual ""river cruise"" which was a complete dud! The Amazon River Ride was much better.

Attending this park does allow you to pair it with the Night Safari, but I caution families with young children that Singapore's heat can be very draining and make for a long day. I would aim to arrive at the River Safari after 2pm if you're planning the Night Safari afterwards.

Taxi from Orchard Road < SIN$20.

My high light - the manatees"
,,Disapointing,2.0,,"Bought a 2 park pass – the Zoo and River Safari and wished we only bought tickets for the zoo as the River Safari was a waste of time.

First half is mainly pictures and sets – like Universal Studios or something, with some fish tanks. Then there are the 2 pandas but only one was out but the big tank enclosure with the Manatees was good.

It began to rain heavily so we didn’t go on the River Cruise but it actually didn’t look very inviting anyway.

A very disappointing experience."
,,Nothing special.,3.0,,"Visited river safari as my kids were keen to see the giant pandas. There were only 2 pandas, and they were both in separate enclosures. However, only Kai Kai seems to be around. Jia Jia keeps hiding in a very depressing looking den. You can sometimes see her on a CCTV, what she is doing in her den. I think Jia JIa is suffering from anxiety and boredom. It would be nice to see the two pandas interacting rather than individually, Did not go to for the river cruise or safari boat ride because of bad reviews. Mekong river exhibit was pretty cool. Kids got bored after a while and we left. I reckon there are better panda exhibits around the world. Verdict : Give this attraction a miss."
,,River Safari,5.0,,"Excellent place to visit it was a great experience and thoroughly enjoyed by our family, highly recommended attraction suitable for the entire family"
,,Nice park but not compared to the others,3.0,,"We visited this park as it was part of the 4 parks for the price of 2 deal we toke. This park was actually a bit disappointing. Although it was nicely setup, the actual river cruise whish is included was very lame. If you are lucky you see a head of a giraffe from the zoo but for the rest you just see the water reservoir. The other ride in the park you actually have to pay for which in my opinion should be included, especially because the park does not have much else to offer. The ride itself is also very lame, and if you have seen the Zoo this boat ride is very disappointing, at least that is the opinion of my kids and they are very excited about the smallest things. I would not go to this park if you have the option of the Zoo and night Zoo next door,"
,,Giant Pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia,5.0,,"Went to see the giant pandas and fell in love with them! It was feeding time and we spent 1,5 hours watching the pandas from a very short distance. Not many visitors at the time (around noontime) - if you love pandas-go visit!"
,,Yay there are pandas,4.0,,"We visited the River Safari and the zoo in one day.
We loved this place, but especially the giant pandas, in fact that was our sole reason for visiting.
It was extremely hot walking around, but the exhibits were great.
Don't waste your money buying a ticket for the Amazon river quest. They said you might get wet but you didn't mind there wasn't really enough to see to justify the expense. The safari cruise while a nice ride dint show us anything except the back of the giraffe enclosure at the zoo. It was also incredibly hot!
Would highly recommend a visit though, if only for the pandas and the manatees.
We enjoyed the mama panda kitchen and had a really nice panda coffee and panda bun. They were great for Instagram photos."
,,A good learning experience!,5.0,,"Catching the red panda and the giant pandas are the 2 highlights of my trip to the River Safari! Seeing the manatees and otters playing in the water tops off the whole experience!

On top of that, the River Safari has interesting ""meet the zoo occupants"" sessions as well as well explained guided sessions - I attended the afternoon ones and found myself caught up in the wonder of the guide's story telling sessions.

A 3 hour experience that was well spent!"
,,Great place for animal lovers and explore global rivers,5.0,,"This place is the perfect place to explore rivers around the world to see the real animals along that rivers. But please don't make the name misleading you. This zoo also has other interesting wild life such as giant panda, anaconda, polar bear, etc. This park is also having an adventure train - a favorite toy for your kid and play over and over. To be frank, I like River Safari much more than Singapore zoo itself :)
Don't miss it."
,,Do the zoo instead - do NOT do this. 10 minute lame boat ride. No thank you!,1.0,,"What a waste of time and money. After spending a lovely day at the zoo and having breakfast with the orangutans (amazing experience) we decided to go on the river safari. I had heard some negative reviews and really wished I had listened.

It's a really long walk to get to a boat that literally takes you nowhere and you see absolutely nothing. I'm not kidding. The boat travels at a speedy 1km an hour and does a giant lazy turn in a river/lake? and you don't see a single animal or anything other than brown water and greenery. To get to the boat you must first trek a few kilometers past 1 million fish tanks so unless you're a fish enthusiast this is just added to the torture. The staff on the boat hand out giraffe poop to keep things exciting. No I'm not joking. ""We are on the River Safari, isn't this exciting. There are no animals or nothing to see so here's some giraffe poop you can look at because honestly, giraffe feces is more existing than this boat ride""....

Don't do it. Save your children and yourselves."
,,It's ok but I think it can be better,3.0,,"What's good:
The place has panda! Yay! However, only saw one panda while the other is hiding away inside so you can only see via cctv.

It's a nice simple place. Easier to navigate it seems smaller than the zoo. Some areas are with shade so you won't get too hot or tired and can bring small kids along easily.

There was a nice huge Aquarium and also tunnel to admire see creatures and fishes.

What's not so good is:
River ride is just 15 minutes and it wasn't what I would have hoped for.
River quest - separate payment inside if you'd like to try this adventure.
The first part of the experience was more like a tour explaining how other rivers are like with posters and pictures"
,,See Panda in Singapore,4.0,,"First time visit. Went on Sunday around 3pm. The place was easy to move around. No queue to any of the exhibit. There are different types of animals, fishes found in the river habitat. The best exhibit was the panda. Manage to see Kia Kia eating whilst Jia Jia was inside the shelter. River Cruise is complementary whilst Amazon River Quest is additional S$5. Not a big area and complete in less than 2 hours."
,,Enjoyed the Visit to this Attraction!,4.0,,"First time visiting this attraction in Singapore. It is a good size attraction to spend about 2 - 3 hours to go through the exhibits.

The place is set up as a loop so you'll likely to cover most thing as you go along the path. The main attractions in this place are the pandas and the few big aquariums showing the manatees and the bigger size fish.

The free River Safari Cruise is a simple slow and relaxing journey of the reservoir. The announcements about seeing the animals are kind of pointless as it only shows a small part of the few animals from the Singapore Zoo from the reservoir's side. You get to see a little close up sample of a giraffe's poo and hair during the cruise.

I did not go on the Amazon River Quest (need to pay separately for SGD5 per adult) due to the possibility of getting soaked (mentioned on the entry board).

Worth visiting this place. It is more value for money if you visit multiple zoos (Night Safari, Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park) together with this attraction with a multiple entry pass. There's also the yearly pass which is more suitable for locals."
,,Hmmmmm. .....,3.0,,"Hmmm.... heard all about it so decided to go today on the spur of the moment.... thought that there will be more to see but it somehow was abit disappointing... perhaps when they add more exhibits or better integrate the environment with the zoo it might be better? Still, if you are going to the zoo, it's worth to buy those combination park hopper tickets and drop by the safari to see the huge fishes and pandas :) the river cruise was ordinary (tis free!) but was a nice rest from all the walking around... had to pay $5 for the amazon quest ride (would have not mind paying if there are more animals to see and a longer journey - but the lift of the boat up to canal level was intriguing though)...so... final verdict is... Can drop by if you are going to the zoo or night safari - but not worth a special trip to visit alone...."

Great value at SGD5 per adult ( this is in addition to normal entry fee) and go round as often as you want ! We saw different animals on our 2 trips. Suggest give yourself at least 2 - 3 hours. Quite a lot of walking.
,,interesting approach to show marine and river animals,3.0,,The river safari shows the animals living in several major rivers of the world. It is nice to see. The animals do not always have much space.
,,Is it worth visiting River Safari- it really depends.....??.,5.0,,"This is a very unique ""World Rivers/Forests concept"" attraction. It is different from any Zoos, Birdparks or Aquariums anywhere.

It showcases exotic & weird creatures/wildlife from 8 different prominent Rivers/Forests from all over the world, including the mighty Amazon.

Many of these Amazing Creatures seen here cannot be found in any aquariums. So there is UNDOUBTEDLY a huge difference between River Safari & S.E.A Aquarium!

Here you see at 'close up view' - a number of deep sea ""ancient creatures & weird looking monsters."" Including the Giant Pandas. One usually gets to see such exotic creatures only on TV documentaries, as they are found in deep rivers or forests.

The huge Amazon Piranhas are really awesome. Have seen piranhas in other aquariums but not this Huge! Piranhas has an awesome reputation & nothing beats seeing a whole school of Huge piranhas this close staring at you when you get close- just a few inches away separated by a thick glass.

How many people in their lifetime can or will the opportunity to go to the great Amazon River/Forests to see these amazing killers? Or even to the other rivers/forest?
EVEN if they do, its impossible to see piranhas in their natural habitat - THIS CLOSE!

So is it worth visiting River Safari?

1. YES:- if you want Quality "" ie the chance to see so many such weird & exotic creatures/monsters from all the major rivers/forests all in one place- & close up. All at a small price of less than S$30.

2.NO:- if you want ""Quantity"" becoz this place is not that big like the zoo. Less animals, less exhibits = lesser value for your ticket prices.

For us, its an experience definitely worth the small entrance fee.

Btw, the Amazon River Quest boat ride is not worth paying an extra $5. It's a 10 mins mild ride. Nothing much except for few animals & most are sleeping or not in sight. Skip this."
,,Great. In fact Better than The Zoo!,5.0,,"I got a dual ticket including River Safari and the Zoo. But I seriously spent more time at the River Safari, because It is sheltered and It offers something new as compared to the zoo.

There are the main exhibition as well as 2 rides right near the middle of the park. One of them is Free and really quite a waste of time unless you have never been on a river ride, without seeing animals. Because of the route and distance, it is almost impossible to see any animals. But its Free though. The other ride is a paid one with SGD5 topup. That is ok, a stolen concept from Theme Parks, and In fact exactly the same as the one at Universal Studio featuring dinosaurs (fake) instead of animals. But however, It is quite Fast and they tried to cramp too many animals into that one ride making It hard to see them all. Let alone catch on ALL (on camera, Pokemon Joke). But you are offered a second ride if you can just wait a little. However, the getting off and getting on kinda turned me off though. But still a pretty good ride. I would recommend doing this at least once.

Other than these, there are the lazy pandas which is just like any other pandas if you had seen them before. Just wondering why would the panda be placed in the River Safari instead of The Zoo. Maybe its a marketing and $$ thing. But since I have seen pandas so many times before, I can fairly say this is Not one of the best one.

Now, despite ALL the negative, once You get to the magestic Manetees right at The end, you will find it ALL worth while because of the great tank and The graceful giants. You can always spend more time here watching them swim and feed.

Overall it is a great experience but transport might not be easy. Do check out their website for options and discount before going down!"
,,"Giant fish, cute pandas",4.0,,Highlight to me is the pandas but it was also interesting to know and see the different fish from different rivers around the world. Was especially mesmerized by the giant fishes and manatees. Would have spent more time sitting there admiring them if not for the kids rushing to see the next exhibit.
,,Creativity+ With The Inspiration and Makings Of This Zoo,5.0,,Visited 09APR14 I am in awe of the makers of this Zoo. I am in awe of Singapore Zoo and the vision they saw of how it can be expanded in such an inspirational way. River Safari and the exhibits it offers are outstanding. It's NOT just another zoo - it is another learning experience presented in a brilliant way. With sincere thanks to the makers of this we had a wonderful time.
,,Excellent and Amazing,5.0,,What can I say if this was in the UK it would be treble the price and overcrowded. It was a joy! Great aquarium's to look at as you walk down to the river safari and even see the Panda enclosure with a Panda there 10 metres away eating some bamboo and the River safari although short was superb. If you are in Sing def worth doing!
,,Very enjoyable trip,4.0,,"We arrived that at 1030 in the morning after breakfast. It is very easy to get there as we took bus 138 from AMK interchange. The journey took 30 mins to reach the location.
We started immediately with the Pandas visit as the time was the least crowded and can get a better view on the Pandas. There were two feeding sessions at 1130 and 2pm where u can see pandas eating in action. Apparently morning session is easier to see both of them as the female one will sleep in her dorm after the morning session and you only can see her through camera. The panda place is well organized and maintained, it is open concept unlike the Hong Kong Ocean Part one, you will find you can see properly the panda and take better pictures.
Another part is the River Quest where you can see leopards more closely and some small animals, don't worry if you missed it because you can re-ride the boat many times.
Another must visit place is the feeding time for the Manatees and Monkeys, they are so cute! And the explanations are good too.
And don't forget to try the Panda Pau if you want to take some photos although the taste of the Pau is like ordinary bun.
It was quite an enjoyable trip and it is suitable for all ages especially if you want to let children gain some knowledge about river animals and life."
,,Good experience,5.0,,"Place is quite small compared singapore zoo but nevertheless, there is alot of exciting activities in there for all ages."
,,Miss it if you have been to Aquarium,3.0,,"The only difference between River Safari and Sea aquarium is White Panda. River Safari's main attraction is white panda and Amazon River quest, which is not included in River Safari Ticket. You need to spend 5 dollars extra if you want to enjoy Amazon river quest."
,,Good place but a lot of walking.,3.0,,"River Safari is good but not great, from the name we thought it would be on a boat but there's a lot of walking.

The park in itself is very nice and has a lot of animals but the cruise we went on was quite slow and we couldn't see any animals except the giraffe.

There was also another river ride which was a lot better but again very few animals and our 10 month old wasn't allowed on it.

We were told that this is better than the night safari but then I can't say as we didn't go on the night safari.

It is located right next to the zoo so I would recommend that if you want to do river safari, do it on the same day."
,,Great for place for children,5.0,,Free Ferry Ride. Double ride for the amazon quest... my kids love it..great place for kids.. can go three attraction at 1 place and that is the zoo and night safari and its all located at the same place..ticket sold separately or in package...
,,ONLY FOR THE PANDA,3.0,,"I had heard from one of our friends that you can have a look at the panda so had been for this option.
There is nothing much to do or see here otherwise but it is in close proximity of other parks such as Singapore zoo and night safari"
,,A fantastic experience,5.0,,"I have heard about this attraction and have wanted to visit it , the best thing in the attraction is the Amazon river ride , but it is unsuitable for younger ones ! A big disappointment . The Panda exhibition is alright ."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"We booked a combo ticket for the Zoo and River Safari online. The entrances for both attractions are side by side which makes the river safari a must do if you are going to the zoo.

The river safari is a semi indoor/outdoor aquarium that also houses some non aquatic animals. Towards the end there are two boat rides, the river cruise and the river quest.

The cruise is included in entry price and is just a mild boat ride around the lake. There's little to none wildlife to see and throughly underwhelming.

The river quest ride is slightly more interesting, the route is littered by wildlife on both sides include a leopard and flamingos. It is much more interesting than the cruise but too short in my opinion.

The River Safari is well designed, with a set path so you can see everything and then plonk out at the finish line. The highlight, as everyone else has mentioned, is the panda exhibit. They have normal and red pandas there and they are ridiculously adorable.

There are also petting exhibits where u can touch and play with some of the underwater creatures. The whole thing took us an hour and half but could've been longer if we weren't so tired from the zoo and hot weather.

Definitely worth a visit if you're going to the zoo!"
,,Briefs about important rivers and their ecosystem,4.0,,This would be a very good visit especially for children to know about important rivers throughout the world.
,,Nice place but ...,3.0,,"The River Safari showcases the different wildlife found in rivers around the world. There are alot of huge fish tanks with some amazing fish. You will see the Mississipi Paddlefish, snapping turtle, giant catfish, pirahnas and more. The part I enjoyed most was the Squirrel Monkey enclosure which you can walk into, and watching the manatees. There are also giant otters, crocodiles and tortoises.

Many of the smaller animals were hiding and late in the afternoon, the Giant Pandas were no where to be seen. There is a small section where you can touch the starfish and corals.

This park is alot smaller than the zoo and unless you go on the boat rides, you will be done in less than 1 1/2 hours. There is a free boat ride around the reservoir and another one which costs $5 where you are supposed to be able to see some animals.

I didn't find it as exciting here as at the zoo and I didn't see many of the animals. Nevertheless there were some very nice sections and you could sit there and enjoy them for longer. Try to get a combo ticket which makes it cheaper."
,,Panda's!!!!!,5.0,,"Lifetime ambition fulfilled to see Panda's! The zoo, River Safari etc are all in the same general complex, entry was very reasonable with a range of multi ticket reductions available. Was about a 40 minute taxi ride to the area from Orchard road for only $25. The zoo itself was clean, well organised & informative. When i finally made it to the panda's... woohoo! one panda was laying in the enclosure having a nap and looking like a star, the other was off in solitary due to possible pregnancy, but she could be seen via CCTV. The gift shop was surprisingly cheap (unusual for Singapore!) and food and drinks were available throughout the complex. We had a fantastic day, thoroughly recommend it."
,,Never miss to visit the Panda's,4.0,,"Just go around the place and visit the Panda's sanctuary. They are cute and healthy. I did not enjoy the boat ride but if you want to relax a little after the long walk, take this 15 minutes ride."
,,Nice but we did not like that much,3.0,,"River safari is considered to be one of the major attraction for tourist. However me and my wife visited this place after visitibg night safari, zoo and universal studios and we didnt felt this attraction really worth may be because of nany repeatative things.
They have created artificial view near mandai river comparing amaxon and other major rivers but somehow we found this attractio as average compared to other attractions in Singapore."
,,A mixed bag,3.0,,"Not really sure what to say about this. It's a new extension to Singapore zoo concentration on fresh water life.

To start with they had some truly enormous tanks with massive fish.

Then suddenly we were in an enclosure watching a giant panda playing and having lunch. I'm not sure why it was was amongst the fresh water fish but it was totally captivating.

Then there were some more aquariums with massive fish.

Then we got on the ""river cruise"" boat. It was pointless. I cannot imagine any age group from infant to pensioner finding it worth while. After reading out a list of 10 things we mustn't do, the guy pressed play on a pre-recorded commentary and the boat went for a 15 min lap of the lake during which we saw the top half of a giraffe.

The ""river quest"" ride was pretty good - we went round twice and there was loads to see. You don't get wet!"
,,Great attraction - really enjoyed the visit to the Panda enclosure,5.0,,"Visited in early May 2016.
Really enjoyed the visit and thought it was good value for money.
The way the animals are kept is exemplary.
Enclosures for just about all animals are clean and the animals look like they are enjoying the wildlife.
The Pandas are also well kept. The enclosure may not be very big, but there seems to be adequate space for the water/pond area, plenty of bamboo, controlled temperature/humidity, resting area.
At the time that I went, I believe the female Panda had undergone some kind of insemination in view of captive breeding. So she was not in the public's sight, but of course it was for the greater good.
The red Panda was also really cute and you'd be surprise at how close you get to it in the enclosure.
Just wish people (the loud tourists) would remain a bit quiet in the Panda enclosure and make less of noise so as not to disturb them.
River Safari is well maintained and value for money. Wouldn't mind going back next time.

Tips:
You may have fast food near the food court outside the various zoos they have in the area.
Getting a taxi there may cost you a bit of money given that it's quite far from the city centre area.
One of the budget-friendly ways to get there is by MRT and with a subsequent bus service leading to the zoo.
You may as well use the bus and then the MRT to make it back to your hotel afterwards.
The way to get there by MRT and subsequent bus service is well explained on the River Safari's website.
Had food at KFC after the visit. Was well within budget in that sense too.
Tickets purchased online come with a slight discount.
It was raining during our visit but that didn't stop us from carrying on with everything we had to do. The place is well sheltered just about everywhere. (Had ponchos but didn't need to use them)
Bring a good and well-charged camera and/or selfi-stick."
,,Great place to visit for the family,5.0,,"The place to visit for the family. Many big aquarium that houses animals, birds and fishes We enjoyed the ride along the river and also the amusement like ride along the safari."
,,Had a good time.,4.0,,"There are so many different things to do and select at Singapore Zoo. When we visited we only did the River safari and was totally worth it. As we have been to many zoos during our holidays and did not want to see the norm of tiger, lions,zebra....so we op for River Safari it was cooler too as the weather in Spore can be very hot. We saw lots of new mammals and discover new info.The highlight of the place is also the beautiful Panda and Manatee to name a few. Definitely worth a visit."
,,5-star hotel for panda and gigantic deep pool for manatee,4.0,,"The title pretty much sums up the highlights of the venue. The air-conditioned and spacious grounds for panda is impressive but pandas are unpredictable. Most of the time they hide. Their sidekick, the red pandas, are more active and can be seen roaming around the premise actively. The show stopper, though, is the huge water tank that five and six manatees are swimming in. They are strolling leisurely as if they were in the deep blue sea, bringing a sense of tranquility to the viewers around them."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We have visited many times as we are locals. It has a great atmosphere, you learn new things and enjoy. It has two boat rides which you have to book separately for. The pandas are the main thing to see but you should go in the morning."
,,Lovely n informative,5.0,,The tour is very informative and explains the great rivers and the marine life.. The two Pandas before you take the ride are a must watch !! You can touch some animals and a awesome experience...
,,Wonderful afternoon spent at the River Safari,5.0,,"I really enjoyed the River Safari as the place was well kept, well organized, clean and there are lots of river life to see. Highly recommend spending a day or two to visit the zoo, river safari and the night safari."
,,Pandas!,3.0,,"Unsure what to expect as we haven't been to anything like the River Safari before, it is spread out and theres lots of walking between exhibits. Walked around twice visiting the pandas we were lucky to see the female panda out as apparently she likes to hide away in her private room ( they have a camera so you can still see her). We also sat watching the Manatees for awhile as there was someone in with them as they seemed to enjoy the pats they were receiving and we were enjoying the rest and aircon."
,,Nice place,4.0,,Nice place.. must visit. Especially viewing big fishes through glasses and river boat were good. Polar bear is also good.
,,Great day,4.0,,Great place to spend with kids. Not too big. Just follow the route. Visit on saturday and not crowded. All done in about 3 hours. Love the panda. Amazon river quest is fun. We ride 3 times. Line up is about 10 minute. Paid $30 for ticket including both boat ride.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Should visit for the kids. Very well maintained aquariums and animals. Have tried hard to mimic the natural environment.
,,River Safari tour,3.0,,We have been to River safari. It is not much worth for the amount we are paying for that. We have to take ticket 2 locations at the main entrance and again before board the cruise.
,,Worth it.,4.0,,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable place to spend our day, even with teenage children. Yes, it is largely aimed at tourists and not particularly unique (bar the Pandas!) when compared to other establishments worldwide- but I shouldn't be snobby. It was kept wonderfully clean and had a diverse range of attractions.
.
I would recommend buying tickets online (purely to save some money).

I would have to disagree with some reviewers and say that actually, the boat trips weren't spectacular in comparison with some of the beautiful exhibits. The trip on the lake was fairly pointless; albeit relaxing after a lengthy walk.

P.S. You can't even escape Pokemon GO here- they seriously love it in Singapore!"
,,Not So Hot-except the weather,2.0,,"Considering that this place is 45 minutes out of town, it should be MUCH more interesting. I guess I was expecting AdventureLand and I got a rarefied aquarium. The concept is nice: walk through 5 of the world's most famous rivers. The problem is almost everything is in a cage or behind glass. There's not much that's ""natural."" I had a hard time imagining that I was anywhere but Singapore. I suppose the highlight of the park (30 dollars + transport) was the ""Amazon Cruise."" I had to wait nearly 50 minutes in spite of the fact that there was no queue because of a ""technical problem."" Loudspeakers kept blasting, incessantly, ""Attention, we are having technical issues. The cruise will begin shortly."" Once it began, it was entirely underwhelming. Other than some scraggly flamingoes and a tired capybara, I didn't see any animals, Amazon or otherwise. Trying to take a positive slant, I got some exercise walking around for 2 hours."
,,Great addition to zoo,4.0,,"We visited here, straight after the zoo as we purchased the online 4 park tickets which is the cheapest option.

The exhibits were okay, not as good as the sealife centre, but still good to do. We saw no animals on the river safari cruise but the Amazon River quest ride was great and we went on twice.

The panda exhibit was good, but if you are short on time, this is something you can skip."
,,"Poor, Tourist Trap",2.0,,"Only thing good was boat ride which is scenic. Earlier it was part of Zoo and you pay SGD 5 for one way or SGD 6 for unlimited ride on boat.
Now you pay SGD 30/- for boat ride, you reach there after a long walk seeing various displays which are not exciting and same as Zoo/Aquarium.
Not worth."
,,"Very informative & compact ""zoo""",5.0,,"Actually not a very big area. You follow a fixed route and you'll see everything along the way.
May be crowded at times, but generally ok.
All exhibits are well labelled and you cant go wrong.
Personally, I enjoyed the cruise around the lake. But the Amazon river ride was disappointing with many animals not sighted at all and the short ride."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,dont forget to take the boat ride and consider yourself lucky if you get to see animal show where they show you certain rare specie animals in open
,,Pokemon hunting,3.0,,Went on a Pokemon hunting trip on 9th Aug but returned in disappointment. Just common pokemons found everywhere. The walking tour in the park is just too boring. It's a one way trip into the park. The only fun is the River Safari ride and the aquarium where there's shelter and air con but the 3G/4G reception is bad there.
,,An interesting venue ruined.,3.0,,"River Safari is a new extension of Singapore Zoo. The concept is good with looks at the wild-life of the world's major river systems and the layout is thoughtful. However, there seems to be large distances between many of the exhibits, and in quite a few it was a case of: ""Can you see what we're looking for?""
However, our organising tour company, Tour East Singapore, were hopeless. We were collected from our hotel at 1305 for a nominated 1330 pickup, and our names on the passenger list were incorrect. We stood in the sun on an open street corner until departing at 1410. We arrived at the Zoo at 1500 and waited while our guide obtained tickets and an incorrect Zoo map. We were then sent out to fend for ourselves with no other information than if we were back by later than 1640 we would be left behind. We arrived back in Singapore by about 1730, but were dropped off at an alternate venue at our request.
So for a 5 1/2 outing we spent about 1 1/2 hours at the Safari; little return for $55."
,,"Highlight of the day, Pandas!",4.0,,"I was lucky to be able to see both pandas. They are really cute and only here for 10 years so better go visit them at least once! Also, the chocolate custard, panda 'pau' was really tasty. You can get it at the restaurant once you finish viewing the pandas.

The whole river safari only goes one way which is good so you won't miss anything!

However, was a bit bored looking at fishes. The highlights were the pandas."
,,Giant pandas are the highlight!,4.0,,"The River Safari is located very conveniently beside the Singapore Zoo and worth a visit as part of your day at the zoo. We had entry included in a 4-park hopper pass so excellent value.

The layout of the zoo means you follow everything in order, which is kind of nice as you can't get lost like in many zoos. The exhibits are really accessible-you can get up nice and close.

The highlight is definitely the Giant Panda and Red Panda exhibit-it was my first time seeing a Giant Panda and it was great how the boardwalk is up above the Giant Panda for optimal viewing. Unfortunately only one of the Giant Pandas was in the enclosure when we visited.

The aquarium was also excellent and there were so many dugongs and giant otters to see.

We had the boat ride included in our ticket but the wait was more than 20 minutes so we didn't stay and wait.

The River Safari is definitely worth a visit as part of a Singapore Zoo visit but I wouldn't travel that far out especially for it. 1 to 1.5hrs is plenty of time to see the highlights."
,,"Great facilities, interesting facilities !!",4.0,,"lovely set-up the free ranging spider monkeys are amazing! the boat trip is a little over rated, do go on the amazon flooded forest ride it is well worth it otherwise you will miss seeing some of the animals. Giant pandas alone are a reason to visit"
,,Amazon River Cruise,4.0,,"The highlight of the visit here was the Amazon River Cruise and the Pandas. We were lucky to see both Pandas and really enjoyed watching them. It was worth the trip just to see them. The Amazon River Quest also made the trip more interesting as we were able to see some animals that we wouldnt have seen had we not taken this. Definitely worth the extra $5. It was also enjoyable as the animals were on both sides so you dont just look in one direction. The river safari boat ride was disappointing as there was nothing we were able to see that we couldnt have seen standing on the deck other than the giraffes. It was abt 15 mins of just seeing the river.

If you want to pair this trip with the Night Safari, i think it will be a good idea. We went around 4:30 in the afternoon and by this time, the crowd has left and hardly spent time queueing in lines. We also got to maximize the experience because it was quiet and we ddnt have to rush going from one area to another. Pacing was really good. I also recommend to buy your tickets online for a discounted price. Make sure you bring the print out of the tickets as this is required to get in."
,,Fun family activity,5.0,,Have a great time here at river safari. There is also a giant panda here maybe coz the zoo next door doesn't have any more space so they need to stay here instead. Don't miss the river safariboat ride for extra 5 dollars.
,,Nice Park to Visit,4.0,,Nice park to see variety of sea animals. Key attraction is the 2 pandas from China and you can spot the red panda too in the same air con enclosure. It's mostly sheltered thus good on rainy days and hot weather too. Good information on the fishes and the place they came from.
,,Worth it for the cute and adorable pandas! :),4.0,,"I highly recommend a visit to River Safari just to observe the lovely pandas. Kai Kai the male panda was a bit sleepy and shy on the day I visited but Jia Jia the female panda was very playful and climbed all over the place and even ate some bamboo in front of her captive audience. There was an adorable red panda housed in the same part as the pandas as well. The lively otters were another highlight for me.

River Safari is well laid out and informative with fish and wildlife grouped according to which major rivers of the world they are from. The Amazon River Quest (an extra 5SGD for adults and 3SGD for children) lasts around 10 minutes and is worth doing to see the majestic jaguar, whereas the River Safari Cruise (also an extra 5SGD for adults and 3SGD for children) that lasts for around 15 minutes was a bit dull and you do not get to see very much wildlife on it.

3 hours is sufficient to cover every bit of the attraction as this is the smallest park out of Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park. For dining options, there is a panda themed cafe called Mama Panda Kitchen that does cute panda decorated buns but I did not eat here as I thought the prices were a bit expensive and heard that the food tasted a bit bland (although you would get a fantastic view of the reservoir if you ate here!). Give yourself plenty of time at River Safari to chill out and watch the lovable pandas! :)"
,,A must visit place for nature lovers,5.0,,"It is a heaven for the nature lovers, especially if you do love to see fishes and hate muds and rain. If exploring nature is not your passion, this will not be the right place for you. I had been there on Sunday and it was a bit crowded there. I think it will be better to visit on weekdays to feel more relax and chill."
,,Another great visit - recommended,5.0,,"We have been here several times. Having the combined zoo, river safari, night safari and bird park pass is helpful - very well priced and recommended if you intend on going several time a year.

This park entrance is next to the zoo. It is fully sheltered and some sections have aircon so this makes it a great choice for those who can cope with the humidity/sun or even in a rainy day.

It is very pram and wheelchair friendly with ramps everywhere for an easy walk.

This park is really about the different rivers around the world and the animals and fish who live in those ecosystems. It includes the Amazon, Ganges, Mississippi, Murray, Yangtze rivers, just to name a few. The main stars are the pandas, Piranhas, and the manatees.

Great for all ages and it's like an outdoor sheltered aquarium with some land animals like panda, monkeys etc.

Note the River cruise is free as part of ticket price and the Amazon cruise is extra plus height restrictions so young kids can't go onboard. Enjoy!"
,,Ok la,3.0,,"River safari is basically in a v shape, i would say 5 times smaller and less exciting as Singapore zoo, because you would do everything there is to do within 2 hours. There is also a set path, making it not exciting. Only good air con place is the panda exhibit. If choosing between zoo and this, choose the former."
,,"Water world, God's amazing creation",5.0,,"If you want to have a good feel of river and habitations around you get it in River Safari. It was educative and fun. At the end you experience a glimpse of the riverside around the globe. Many more can be built around this theme such as the flora, the landscape, the sound of the forest ..."
,,Nice Attraction place for relaxing and family out going,5.0,,Nice place to relax and observation. Clean and well maintained place/attraction. Worth to go and rest.
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,We enjoyed our visit to the River Safari. The exhibits are immaculate and highlight the need to conserve and protect our environment. Hopefully it makes people think about the consequences of their actions and change their behaviour. As unfortunately we need zoos to help save so many of the worlds endangered animals this is one of the few zoos I would visit in the world. The pandas and manatees were the outstanding exhibits at the River Safari. We were told we had to whisper in the Panda enclosure as shouting stresses them.
,,What a great day out!,5.0,,It was a fun and exciting day out with the family and children to visit the river safari. You get to see a lot of sea life up close and personal. A lot of great photos and fun for the all the family for all ages.
,,Seen better,2.0,,"Other an a relaxing boat ride there's nothing here out of the ordinary. It's a typical walk through aquarium with non too special creatures. Unless you haven't been to many of these I'd give it a miss as it's an extremely long walk.

Watch out for the weather. If it looks like rain then go straight away otherwise it gets cancelled."
,,Actually quite enjoyable,4.0,,"We decided to give this a try instead of the Night Safari in the end as we had been on a real safari we felt the kids would be a bit disappointed with the night one. This attraction fits the bill to while away a morning or afternoon. It has something for all with a good mix of seeing the fish/animals, touching them, learning about Eco systems, rivers animals etc & a couple of boat trips at the end. We really enjoyed the set up. Some may view it as dated but it served our purposes and we had older children. Can comment on the food as we didn't eat here. One tip is that most of it can be experienced even if it's raining so don't worry if the day you go is not sunny."
,,Amazon river quest is good,5.0,,It's a good place to have fun with kids. The panda steam bread with chocolate is so yummy. The Amazon river quest is suitable for kids.
,,ok to visit once,3.0,,"The zoo,river safari and night safari are all adjacent to each other and when compared to the other two this can be quite boring.The only attraction here is the gaint panda and the manatees. Can be given a miss if you have been to the zoo and the sea aquarium. But since this was combined with the 4 park pass we gave a visit. The boat rides can be a absolute bore which is actually the back side of the zoo and you can get a peek through the animals there. Atleast the amazon boat ride is lil interesting when compared to this but that has to be paid extra."
,,Singapore Zoo and river safari,4.0,,"Happy seeing the 🐼 panda and tried the cruise ship which is recommended to have some relaxation time, don't forget to visit Singapore Zoo. Be aware the taxi costs $15 more from 5pm onwards (peak time fee)."
,,Should had been part of the Zoo,2.0,,"To be honest, the exhibits are not all that bad. There is a good insight into the fresh water ecosystem and animals staying there. But the major problem here is the value: We had to pay extra to see things that should had been part of the Zoo anyway. Eg. The Pandas are part of River Safari instead of Zoo. The Boat rides are chargable too...

So if someone wants to see ALL the animals, they will need to pay double for Zoo and River Safari.

Not recommended..."
,,Suit for Children,3.0,,"a place that suit for children and family, you can see most of the ""fish"" at here, if compare to SEA aquarium in Sentosa, river safari is worth to visit. But the food there is quite costly"
,,"Not worth it, zoo still better",3.0,,"The park is much smaller than the zoo and you have less things to see. Half of it is fishes and fish like animals. There are no shows in this park. The only plus points are the panda, the cow sea and shelter all the ways."
,,Not recommendable,1.0,,"It's not what we expected.
We went with two child and two teenagers non of them liked it.
The boat ride was 15 minutes and we only saw a giraffe. Then the next ride was a 15 minute attraction only for seeing a few animals.
Don't waste money with this."
,,Loved this place!,5.0,,"Loved this place
It's is very new only opened in 2012
Feels very different Tao the other parks
It's a walk through park with a one way for all to follow which assists as it doesn't make it feel busy.
Shaded throughout from the intense sun throughout also.
Some of the tanks are truly impressive, but for me there were 2 highlights: the pandas and the amazon river quest.
The pandas were incredible in some amazing enclosures. Kaikai was out and about munching on bamboo but jiajia who is shy, was in her house away from prying eyes.
The river quest ride was fantastic with loads of animal to see in a beautiful setting.
Really nice food at mama panda also.
It was much quieter than the other parks which made it feel nice and relaxed

Great place, highly recommend!"
,,Utter waste of time and money,1.0,,"The River Safari is a big scam. All you are shown in the zoo from the other side! We were taken around the river for 15 minutes, and got to see the giraffes, rhino, etc from the river. In a true CYA fashion, the guide prefaced every statement with 'If you are lucky, you will see...'!

Save some time, and see something else!"
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,Another well laid out park with lots of information to read and follow. The Pandas were the highlight. River cruise was relaxing did not see a lot of animals but the commentary was interesting. The aquarium was brilliant did not expect to see such an impressive display of marine life.
,,Panadas,3.0,,JiaJia & KaiKai were the reason I wanted to visit River Safari. They did not disappoint as both of them were so cute! The red panda was so cute too!
,,Get to see my Jiajia and Kaikai,4.0,,"Jia Jia and Kai Kai are the reason why I want to visit River Safari. However, I did not get to see Jia Jia as she is said to be very shy panda. Other than the animals that live on land, we also get to see animals that live in water. However, it's a regret that we did not get to take boat rides as it was raining heavily on that day."
,,Watch them disappear,4.0,,"Purchased as a double park hopper with the zoo it included a river safari cruise. I arrived around 11 and the bus from the station takes a good half hour to get you there but right near all of the zoo related parks. The zoo suggested I do the safari first as smaller. Inside it was leafy and a well presented park with many large aquariums representing rivers from around the globe. At each display there were often friendly and informative staff. The pandas were out and the male rather active which was a treat plus a highlight the other being the huge manatee which I got to see at feeding time. The cruise was a very short wait and really a waste of time/money not one animal that was mentioned by the guide was spotted and often shed remark watch them disappear when they never appeared! The Amazon boat ride slightly better as the jaguar was window side. Over all enjoyable and got to see some beasties, didn't eat nor shop here. Fairly spread out but aircon and fans potted about the park so was tolerable and no steep inclines."
,,"If you have done the Zoo, then the River safari is Average..",3.0,,Don't waste time on the River Safari if you have already completed visiting the zoo as its just an extra expense and nothing really worthwhile seeing barring a relaxing boat ride for about 20 mins. Really not worth the money as the children and you would be really tired especially after a long day at the zoo.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,Pretty much a huge aquarium spread out over considerable walking distance which is hard work in the humidity of Singapore. Had to pay extra when you are in there to actually go on the fairground safari ride where you actually got to see some animals. The river safari as in the title was a 15 minute boat ride around the lake where you were lucky to see anything except water and bushes.
,,Nice place to hang around,3.0,,"We had been for river safari, which in literal terms is more of a boat ride than a safari...:( if one has visited the Singapore Zoo, then during river boat ride, same large animals will be visible and spotted... basically you are looking the two sides of the same coin... yes, i agree, environment has been created to showcase the ecological environment for major rivers of various continents and sub continents... Amazon river quest is little better... best part was the panda experience... i don't know why they are present under the river safari banner, but, yes, one of the rare sights to see panda in action in front of you is a different experience... my kid enjoyed a lot... she had lot more expectations from panda as memories from movie series Kung Fu Panda is very much live within her little mind... we spent almost an hour in there, as panda were being fed and were a little naughty in their activities... :) overall, average place to visit, must for panda, else maybe skipped if running short on time..."
,,Excellent combination with Night Safari,4.0,,"We booked a combo ticket with River and Night Safari, and had a great time.

The river safari was fine and not too big. It was a shame that some of the areas were closed when we got off the short boat trip at 6 pm. The staff should have told us to go right first.

But we enjoyed it, especially as a warm up for the night safari.

Takes about one hour."
,,Great Place for Family and Kids,5.0,,"Loved our visit. Its mostly indoors, so the heat is not a problem. The Panda's - Kai Kai and Jia Jia were great, kids love them. The manatees are a great attraction. Dont miss the Polar Bear sighting through a window. Look out for merchandise deals in the stores inside, and bargains at the Store beside the Lift/ticket check. Food at the indoor cafe is great and reasonable."
,,Fantastic day out,4.0,,"My friend and I had planned to go the zoo, however when we saw that the pandas were on the river safari we opted for it over the zoo. Who doesn't love pandas? The tickets were reasonably priced and there was plenty to look at. The highlight was of course the pandas, although there was plenty to see before and after. I've not been to many zoos but this one was certainly the best."
,,River cruise is a complete waste!,3.0,,"The name is a bit deceptive I wud say. One expects this to be a sort of ride thru the rivers, it's not. It actually is a showcase of different river animals/species found across major rivers of the world. The boat cruise is a 15min ride which is no different from any boat ride you would do in any lake in your own city. Good to do. But, if you have to choose between the zoo and river safari, go for the zoo instead and night safari for sure."
,,All about the pandas and manitees,5.0,,"The river safari is located next to the Zoo and features aquariums of fish from the worlds major rivers. Halfway round there is a sizeable Panda enclosure with two pandas and the manatee tank is the final exhibit. The ticket includes a 15 minute boat ride which is kinda pointless as there isn't much to see. It goes past the rhino, giraffe and elephant enclosures at the zoo so you might see them if your lucky. During the boat trip they pass around a sample of giraffe poop and tail hair so that may sell it to you if your a fan of hair and poop! There is another boat ride which takes you through some more animal enclosures but there is a minimum height requirement and our one year old was too small so we didn't go. Unfortunately that meant I missed out on the giant anteaters.

:(

I love those guys!

You get the impression the pandas are housed here solely to make the cost of admission worth it and justify the River Safari being separate from the zoo. I like aquariums but most of the tanks felt like filler between the pandas and manatees but they are worth the price of admission on their own. On the subject of tickets I would highly recommend you get the four park pass (zoo, river safari, night safari and bird sanctuary) which offers a considerable saving and is valid for a week from first use. Time wise we got to the Zoo at midday and by the time we had lunch and did the river safari the first entry of the night safari was just starting so you could do all three in one visit."
,,don't miss it,5.0,,"the river safari is a completely difference experience. it starts to build up on you slowly as you start exploring. we were very fortunate to see the polar bear swim in blue waters perform underwater display of its skills. the Amazon river experience for which you pay $5 extra, is awesome. you car taken on a boat ride, thru the amazon in open enclosures except for one- Jaguars. These animals though shy, make a majestic appearance, we were luck to see them right in front of the enclosure.The amazing species and display of animals from the amazon region is the winner. the next is the flooded amazon, which is out of the world. one can see the rare water cows, we went during the feeding time, and the entire water body was full of life. River safari is a must visit site in Singapore...don't miss..."
,,"Kai Kai, Jia Jia and the Manatees",4.0,,"What we like about the River Safari is the Giant Panda Forest and the Amazon Flooded forest. Seeing the Red Panda in action and Kai Kai and Jia Jia eating bamboos is a sight to see. The Manatees swimming in their environment is also something to look forward to. But there are lots more to see- crocodiles, turtles, fishes, monkeys, ant eaters, big and small fish, and the polar Bear! That is if it decides to swim in the water. Its like a glimpse of the Safari Zoo with lots of aquarium.

There are a lot to see, but make sure you read the signs and billboards along the way, its educational. And make sure you try their Panda Pau - red bean and chocolate are both delicious."
,,A day well spent,5.0,,"In our climate, being outdoors isn't always ideal. River Safari had factored all this in and you can walk around the entire place under shelter 90% of the time, unless you are on some rides. Yes, it's worth paying for the Amazon River Quest, just $5/adult, $3/child. Loved the themes throughout; Amazon, Mississippi, etc. The Pandas are delightful & oh-so pampered! My fave was the flooded Amazon forest for the manatees are.
It was a day well spent for my family!"
,,Good but can be improved,4.0,,Visited river safari with a few friends recently. not many things to see though. We love the boat ride.
,,Do it as part of the multi zoo pass....,3.0,,"Ok, so it's a nice attraction, wouldn't think it would take more than a couple of hours at most. If you get this as part of the Multi zoo pass, then that's value for money - not sure if I would have just done this on it's own. It's a good relax between the Singapore Zoo and until the Night Safari starts. Highlight is definitely the Panda exhibit - so cute! The river cruise that comes with the ticket price is pretty average - it's a 15min cruise around the river in a big circle and basically you see the animals from the day zoo - just from the river view. However, was a pleasant enough experience and if you're into sea/river creatures - then this is for you!"
,,Good relaxing stroll,4.0,,I came with my senior citizen parents and it was very relaxing. It wasn't as busy as the Singapore Zoo that day so we went in our own pace. We didn't see much in the River Safari boat ride but nonetheless it's de-stressing in the boat. My favorite is their huge aquarium with the Manatees and their Panda enclosure. The Amazon boat ride was short but I can imagine it'd be a good educational ride for kids. We also got the 20sgd photo souvenir.
,,It was okay,4.0,,We went to the river safari with a toddler and an infant. The place was quite nice... Very clean and well kept. A good place for kids to have fun.
,,One of the best things you can do,5.0,,"Built over a natural river, this zoo like safari is water based with creatures and animals found near rivers. Really innovative and such a stunning walk round. Really enjoyed this excursion, absolutely worth the visit. Our little boy loved it and you see some incredible things including crocodiles."
,,Nice alternative to the zoo and bird park,3.0,,"Nice place to chill out with creatures from the elegant dugongs to the elusive crocs to lazy panda jia jia and kai kai, it is another alternative place to go now that the underwater world has closed down."
,,couple of hours of nature,4.0,,"booked it online as a 2 park pass ,primarily wanting to see the night safari next door. We arrived at amazon park at 4pm Friday arvo no one was in the park so it was fantastic.A leisurely stroll looking at everything available and no queues. We had dinner in the tea house which was nice a lot of the menu was unavailable at 630pm and over priced.
we payed the extra few dollars to go on the boat quest which I think was the highlight of the park my son love it too."
,,A tremendous addition to the zoos,5.0,,Went and it was a reasonably quiet day. One of the two pandas was very active while the other was in her den. It is so different to the Zoo and the Night Safari so it was great to see a new addition.
,,AVERAGE FOOD,4.0,,Good place after the river safari - good food - good servidce - average food - absolutely safe to eat
,,It was ok but not worth it :(,3.0,,"It was a hot day, so looked forward to the river ride.

The river was murky and brown (expected as it is a river!) but we didnt get to see anything. However the guides were very nice and knew what they were talking about.

But overall it was basically just viewing fishes and some reptilians in the tanks.

For me, i wouldn't go again, but it was an average experience."
,,Uv gd,5.0,,It is one of the new attractions in Singapore . It is y nice to go with ur family and friends .i got day spend here
,,Great for young kids,5.0,,We spent ~4 hours and kids loved it (especially since it was organized around rivers they had seen only a few of). The Pandas were the highlight
,,A visit to River Safari,4.0,,"We visited on weekday. As not much crowd, we can visit in a leisure pace. Normally map is a must when visit places like zoo, because there are too many walking trails. But we do not need one here because the walkway can lead us visit the whole safari without missing anything. We took both the river cruise (complementary) and amazon boat ($5 per adult). I like the cruise as very relaxing when ""tour"" around the reservoir.

During the visit, we saw male panda lying on the ground and eat bamboo, while the female panda only came out a while and quickly went back to her cage.

Tip:
1) River boat ticket can be bought right in front the entrance to boat ride. As this ride fully depend on weather, so buy the ticket inside will be better as can confirm the weather is good.

2) mosquito repellent is recommended."
,,Overpriced and badly managed,1.0,,"Not Much to see besides being a scattered aquarium (as if Singapore didn't have enough already). Boat ride is extremely short and despite being a weekend they were only running 2 boats at a time. It's a very pricy park for you to wait for 30 mins. 2-3 boats were just sitting ideal, which I failed to understand. Overall Singapore has many good attraction and this one can easily be passed."
,,Trip to the River Safari,5.0,,"It was on April 2013,we decided to visit river safari. It was scorching hot and I didn't prepare sunscreen and hat,etc. Overall it was fun to see all the different types of sea creatures big and small...."
,,Good fun,5.0,,"Got to level with you, we missed out on most of the attractions. Missed the two boat rides because my beloved travelling companion developed an upset stomach prior to us getting there. I can inform you that the toilet facilities were both numerous and up to standard. What we did see was well worth it. They have pandas!!! Check your panda ticket, it's not always clear but you may qualify for a panda cup and a surprise at the cafe just outside the panda exit. Take your ticket it and ask. Also, don't miss the pandas. There are some photo people near the entrance and some people shy away. The photo people do not unduly hassel you so don't veer off. See the pandas before you cross the wooden bridge."
,,Informative about sea life but nothing outstanding,3.0,,We chose to do what is called the safari expedition tour i.e. Your ticket covers both the river safari and the night safari (not entrance to the zoo). One of the traps of doing it this way is that the river safari which you usually arrive at at 2pm takes only a couple of hours to complete. The tour guide doesn't go with you. They just hand over the tickets and give you the instructions. The night safari however doesn't open until 7pm which leaves you 2.5 - 3 hours with time to kill. Not an easy feat unless you pay the extra to enter the zoo area. The exhibits are very good and seeing a panda is always a treat but it's not guaranteed. The Amazon river boat is a nice way to go around but again because the boat is on a preset course by the time you hear the information you have either moved past the exhibit or not actually seen anything because that's not a guarantee either. The lake cruise spends 15 minutes on the water but unfortunately for us we heard nothing of the commentary due to some of the other passengers. The large aquarium at the end is well worth the look. Food options are limited at the river safari end. You are better off walking up towards the night safari end where there is at least more of a selection. Food is still quite expensive for the quality. If I had my time over I probably would forgo the river safari as part of a combined tour option and stick to either the zoo or the night safari.
,,NOt just your run of the mill aquarium,5.0,,"This is a different kind of aquarium because it mixes aquarium with boat ride as well as a unique kind of ride called the amazon quest. Dont miss riding on the amazon quest, its a different kind of experience"
,,Very informative,4.0,,"This june 2016 would be a second time me and my family visited this attraction, i must say, river safari provide a very informative explanation on various animal living in a river, and the fact that having a shelter along the attraction is very convenient, we don't worry if its raining. Panda attraction quite nice, but not very sure if panda lives along the river, as to my knowledge panda lives in high ground. Overall we had an enjoyable time there."
,,Not as attractive as other 3 parks,3.0,,"River Safari is the latest addition in the parks in Singapore, and we had bought a 4-park hopper, so we ended up here. The river cruise is nothing great, just a ride to rest your tired legs! The kids loved the panda enclosure, and that was where we spent most of our time in this park."
,,nice experience,5.0,,"the river safari is likezoo with river and then the cruise though is pretty lame but the whole idea of going on a boat ride is exciting, the boat ride on tracks is fun filled and the only thing to look forward to."
,,Different from the usual tours,4.0,,"Most package tours do not include this in their itinerary, but it is surely worth a visit. Highlight some of the major rivers in the world with animals from there. You can see Pirhanas, manatees and more.

The highlight of this place are the 2 giant pandas. You can view them up close and take pictures. Also, a river cruise (included in the ticket) and an optional (paid) Amazon River Quest add to the fun."
,,Fantastic choice to take your visitors,5.0,,"Some people may just not enjoy seeing earth's creatures and they can wait outside at the foodcourt for 2hrs. So you just need 2hrs or a little more of have small kids. The River Safari is not about the ride but more about the journey through the major water systems in the world. Singapore knows how to package an attraction.

Lots of water and some land creatures to enjoy viewing and read up on their profiles. Easy to take pictures. Main reason I love this place is that it's all undercover. No direct sunlight issues and no rain to worry about. It's the perfect any time tourist destination.

My favorite time is with the red Pandas and Giant PANDAS. There's a place to eat jist after that. There's boat ride in the huge lake which appears currently free. And there's the river safari man made ride which is nice but not really exciting as its short ride and not too many animals visible. You'd be lucky to see there resident famous jaguar.

The river safari remains on top of my list to entertain my visitors if they ok to appreciate the wonderful creatures of the world."
,,Panda & Red Panda!,4.0,,"Great place to see the uber-cute pandas and even cuter red pandas in Singapore! Like many places in Singapore, the place is clean with very organized layout. Other highlights of the place include the manatees and otters. It's very calming to look at the manatees swimming.

Amazon River Quest ride is just so-so. It's okay to skip that, especially if you do not want to pay the extra fees. River Safari is very close to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, so you could easily visit all three on the same day. Be aware that you have to buy separate entrance tickets (or a package) for all three though."
,,Family trip,4.0,,"This place is located just next to Night Safari. For some reasons it always creates some confusion with its larger counterpart SEA aquarium at Sentosa which started about the same time. This is divided into a few river based attractions based on the way the animals are clustered- compared to Night Safari/ Zoo the time to cover attractions are much less. Within 2-3 hours you should be able to cover all what it has for display. There are two river rides - children will love Amazon River Quest especially the splashing of the water ( note you have to pay extra SGD 5 for adult & SGD 3 for the children). There is a slower river safari also for 15 minutes which will cover the wetlands and will show some of the zoo animals like giraffe , elephants from some distance- for some reason the babies never liked it- though I found it quite good. Overall a good family outing with my parents, wife and the child - slightly overpriced (as usual like many Singapore attractions with SGD 30 for adults and SGD 20 for child though you get 25% resident discounts)."
,,Great for kids and the elderly!,4.0,,"We booked a trip to the River Safari just a couple of days ago and had an enjoyable time there. The River Safari is the latest addition to the Wildlife Reserves of Singapore and features the fauna and flora of some of the most famous rivers in the world - Yangtze, Amazon, to name a few. It was a bright sunny day, suitable for an outing like this because the River Safari is mostly sheltered so you don't have to worry if it starts pouring in tropical Singapore. Furthermore, the walkways are gentle slopes and do not force you up on steep steps with ample walking space. There are plenty of sitting areas along the path as well so it makes for a great visit for those who may not be as mobile, or for the elderly who needs time and space to walk. Part of the trip also include a 15 mins boat road. Hop on the barge and the captain will bring you around the reservoir. For your info, the reserves sit by the edge of reservoir and hence offer you an interesting sight of one of Singapore's water catchment area. Also, you can get a couple of glances at some of the exhibits at the zoo as well. There's another boat ride called ""Amazon Quest"" but this requires you to purchase an additional ticket. I did not ride this though so I can't offer my comments to it but sister says that it offers you a chance to view more exhibits by a boat and its an enjoyable ride as well. Boat rides are determined by the weather so pray and hope for a sun shiny day when you go to visit!

Tips:
1. Go on a weekday if possible. It means lesser crowd, and lesser jostling of space to view the exhibits. It also means less people queuing for food, tickets, etc.
2. When taking the boat ride (not the Amazon Quest), try to take a seat on the left of the barge (this should be on the Captain's left) as it offers you the best view for the exhibit."
,,"Beautiful, Serene Walk in the Park",5.0,,"First of all, River Safari & The S.E.A Aquarium are 2 different world with entirely differnt theme.
While S.E.A Aquarium comprised Sea Animals/Fishes, River Safari features Animals and Fishes from the Rivers of the World.
So it would be unfair to compare both Parks.

River Safari brought us to differnt parts of the World main Rivers, from the shallower Mississippi River to the Flooded Forest of the Manatees.

It was amazing to experience and explore the different atmospheres and animals, fishes in different habitats.
From small mammals like the mousedeer to huge Manatees, look out for Canola the manatee calf!

Giant Panda Exhibit is beautiful with the tourist favourite, Giant Panda Jia Jia Kai Kai, i felt that the red panda was the highlight of my tour, it is so fluffy and cute with the cute ears and face!
Golden Pheasant Exhibit was a little off the scale but the Pandas really brings up the experience.

The River Safari Cruise was not really an experience but being FOC, i felt that it was a great in a way where we can relax and recharge our energy while taking a scenic tour around Upper Seletar Reservoir
after half of the park conquered.

The Amazon River Quest was great, with exhibits at both sides comprising of mainly different species of primates, birds, jaguars etc, just a tab too fast IMO.

It would be good to read those little infomation boards along the way to understand the different characteristics of the rivers and animals and it would really be worth the 2- 3 hours visit.

Must Go :
- Squirrel Monkey Exhibit (Closed at 530pm)
- Giant Pandas Exhibit
- Manatee Exhibit
- Amazon River Quest (Not included in Ticket, $5)

Tips :
- Look out for the feeding timing where there are live presentators describing and demostrating the animals/fishes behaviours.
- River Safari is 90% covered with shelter so in case of rainy days, you can hang around the cafe for the rain to subside before going ahead with the rides when they resume."
,,Easy and relaxed,4.0,,"Went in the morning so it wasn't too crowded which we liked. It was an easy stroll around the area and we saw some interesting animals (red panda being a favourite). The river cruise was okay, but not much to see. Also, we went on the amazon cruise and it was nice to see some animals a bit closer and we were allowed on for a second ride because it wasn't busy. Overall, we spent a lot longer than anticipated and saw some cute animals."
,,A pleasant day out,4.0,,"The River Safari is a good place to have a relaxing day out. I really enjoyed seeing the panda Kai Kai (although it was sleeping soundly when we were there), the red panda and the squirrel monkeys. The entry fee includes a complimentary short cruise along the Reservoir, which was pleasant. We paid to ride on the Amazon River Quest, which was quite fun.

I don't know if we will visit the attraction again, but it is worth a visit if you have never been there. Having said that, if time is limited and you have to decide between this and other destinations such as the Zoo or Jurong Bird Park, I would recommend visiting those over the River Safari."
,,Singapore Zoo is better,3.0,,"I've been to Singapore Zoo last year and decided to try River Safari this year.

The River Safari Cruise (included in your purchase of entrance fee) is a slow boat ride that brings you along the coast of the Singapore Zoo to see the Giraffe and other animals that you would have seen (in better view) if you had gone to Singapore Zoo. We were not able to see anything else in the ride and to compensate, they circulated some specimens of giraffe like the hair and poo. Overall, underwhelming.

The Amazon River ride is a faster paced ride that brings you towards a narrow man-made boat course with animal shelters on both sides. Better than River Safari Cruise but not that impressive too.

Take note that you have to walk a very long distance to get to the boat ride. Factor that into your travel.

The highlight of this attraction is just seeing the pandas. I would rather recommend Singapore Zoo and SEA Aquarium for seeing terrestrial and aquatic animals."
,,A great experience,4.0,,Well set out with a great variety of river animals. Cruise is a little disappointing with not much too see. River boat ride worth the additional $5 although it moves quick and can easily miss the animals
,,Lots of fun and learning too!,4.0,,"My daughters of 12 and 10 yo had great fun there over the weekend!

It is much smaller than I expected (took < 2 hours to go round the whole park)but is well organized. It has covered walkways for 90% of the area, so bad weather is not really a problem, except that the river safari and river quest cruises are suspended. It is very clean too!

The animals are organized by the 6 rivers/ their habitats - Mississippi, Ganges, Yangtze, Amazon, Nile & Mekong. The cute panda, raccoon, lively squirrel monkey, salamander, colourful fishes, giant catfish, the big manatees which swim elegantly in the water (keep a look out for the calf too), the playful otter keep my daughters excited running from 1 aquarium/ enclosure to another...

In addition to learning about the animals, there is a lot of information about the rivers too. The longest river, the deepest, the biggest, mother of all rivers and so on.... We walked the park a second time as my girls want to find the answers to the quiz I set for them.... as I promise a gift each if they can get the right answers... : - )

The Chinese restaurant at the entrance is quite good too.

Some advices
- if you find a site too crowded, just move on to the next and come back later.... it Is a small park.
- go for the cruises first if the weather is not looking good
- take some time to enjoy the views too...."
,,Enjoyed visiting river safari,4.0,,it was so fun exploring the river safari and my baby enjoyed it the most as she is much found of fishes and she was so excited to see all these monsters of the deep to the cutest of the fishes will visit soon again
,,Well Organised,4.0,,"I live in Singapore so perhaps have the luxury of time to see more attractions at my leisure but I would definitely recommend river safari if you can fit it in.

Unfortunately as soon as we arrived the rain started and didn't stop until 3 hours later so the trip could have been ruined if not for river safari's cover that keeps you dry as you navigate the attraction. The ""river"" boat section was however affected by the weather and the trips were suspended whilst the rain poured down; disappointing but completely understandable. I plan to return again to do the boat

A large part of the excursion is aquatic based (as the name suggests!) and we were able to see catfish, storks and crab eating macaques. The most popular attraction is the pandas. We were all informed several times to keep talking to a minimum and no shouting so as to be respectful to the animals but there were still quite a few parents allowing their children to run and scream in this area; such a shame

The highlight of the trip for me were the giant otters, there were two youngsters playing in water with a rock and throwing it to one another, I easily spent more than half an hour there as was amazing to watch .

A really nice afternoon"
,,Love this place,5.0,,"My son who is not really animal lover, had just his mind after visiting River Safari. We did not see all animals like the normal zoo but here we were able to learn the uniqueness of the animals who live in water. Staff were helpful and friendly, superb facilities, the Panda and Amazon boat were amazing."
,,family visit,4.0,,"We really enjoyed this safari, although it is more of a zoo with a walk around the different rivers of the world, the boat trip wasn't much at all, just a quick circle round the bay, but the pandas were a highlight to visit for us, as were the dugongs. we spent our time and went on the boat ride safari don't the river which was fun."
,,"Relaxing place, easy stroll, no lines",3.0,,"I have been to the Singapore zoo before so I chose to bring my kids here. What I like about this place is it is not crowded but if you are a first timer in Singapore I would recommend you go to the zoo which has more interesting animals. The main attraction of this place is the Panda and aquarium section. There is also a boat ride which will just bring you around the man made lake and a river ride which is more enjoyable. Both rides came with our ticket which we purchased at Klook.com. Some tickets do not have the free river ride.

Overall, it is an okay place to visit esp if you do not like crowds. The are 2 restos inside if you get hungry."
,,Just see the main zoo or the night safari,2.0,,"Overall, I recommend just going to see the main zoo and the night safari (get this package instead of all the zoos). The only thing this place really has to offer are the pandas, squirrel monkeys and some decent water exhibits. We bought a package to see all the zoos in Singapore because they all have a good reputation. First off, avoid buying this package unless you want your trip to consist of zoo animals. The river safari is by far the worst of the Singapore Zoo parks (night safari, main zoo and even the bird park is better value). The river safari cruise is a short boat ride where you are lucky to see any animal. The exhibits are nice but you are not seeing anything worth the money you pay. The only unique things about this zoo is that it is river themed and has squirrel monkeys and pandas. So you are really only paying to see these things (the rest you can catch at the other zoos for a better deal). IMPORTANT to note that this zoo closes at 7pm BUT the exhibits for the pandas and the squirrel monkeys close earlier! It does NOT make sense...we went late to this zoo (as we had stopped by the main zoo first) and did not even get to see the pandas or the squirrel monkeys because they closed early! Not sure why you have an entire zoo open until 7pm only to close most of the exhibits by 5:30pm. The whole zoo should close at 5:30pm because once the pandas and squirrel monkeys are closed then there is not much you can see here you cannot see at the main zoo."
,,History of the Rivers Around the Wolrd,4.0,,This is a clean and very informative facility with wonderful insights for the visitors on the various river systems around the world. It is at least a 3-4 hour tour. Good to visit during the week and not at weekends.
,,A Memorable trip to River safari------,5.0,,"We visited this place a month ago.It was a memorable trip,as one can see many sectors and animals from many countries are settled under one roof in Artificial cum natural habitat.But do River cruise or Amazon Boat Ride as One can see Another periphery in Night and Singapore zoo"
,,Short outing with boat ride,4.0,,"You only require about less 3 hours the most to visit this place. Generally themed around the rivers in the world and the main attraction is the pandas. But we like the red bear. The river boat ride was nice and since there were not many visitors, they allowed us 2 rides. . Can skip the river cruise, nothing much to see from it.

We also saw the new mascot, Ganola."
,,Good All Round attraction for Kids,3.0,,"This place is located adjacent to the Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoo. Which is easily accessible by Bus.
Entrance Ticket is 30 Dollar per person and it includes the Boat Ride in the River but does not include the Amazon River Quest which cost additional 5 $. Enjoyed the rides u can see many sea Animals and also also u can see two Pandas which are very cute. Apart from many other aquariums inside it ,There is one very big aquarium where we can see Seals.
Suggestible to visit this place with Kids if not can skip it."
,,Unique Experience and Layout,5.0,,"I didn't really understand what this was. But basically it's a zoo based upon the major rivers of the world. There are some unique animals to see. My favorites are the red panda and the giant crocodile. I especially like how this is layed out because it's basically one path. Whereas the zoo can be hard to navigate because there are so many paths. We did one little boat ride for $5. It was ok. But overall, I really like this place. I prefer the zoo for others to see because it's larger and more unique. But this is a great place too especially if you enjoy zoos."
,,Interesting fresh water aquarium,4.0,,We visited the River Safari and enjoyed our visit. The fresh water fish nad animals were quite interesting and different from the usual salt water aquariums. We especially liked the Panda exhibits and the otters
,,"Nice small park, well designed. Not value for money, though.",3.0,,"We arrived about 11am, on a Friday that's within the school holiday period, and was surprised that the place was not crowded; didn't even have to queue up to enter the park.

The park was well designed: there's only one path through all the exhibits and it's mostly sheltered, this makes it easy for visitors. We took a leisurely walk and enjoyed looking at the exhibits.

The place felt like an aquarium, though, with most of the exhibits comprising of fishes. Some of the larger exhibits/tanks were really impressive. While there were adequate explanations for all the exhibits, we felt that there could have been more interactive displays to engage visitors; the only thing we did the whole time was to ""look"" at things.

The free boat ride (rather, the cost is already included in your ticket) on Seletar Reservoir was relaxing, though it was rather disappointing that there were no live commentaries (only a recorded one). There was a lady staff on board that was supposed to act as a sort of guide, but she didn't do much apart from handing out some sample animal hair for visitors to see.

The Amazon River Quest ride, which is a bit like an amusement park roller coaster water ride though much more gentle, costs S$5 per adult and S$3 per child. The ride brought us through various animal exhibits, but we passed by the exhibits so fast that we didn't manage to get a good look at most of the animals. It would have been better if they provide a way for visitors to walk through those same exhibits after the ride and have a closer look at the animals.

Food choice is somehow lacking in the park (perhaps due to the small size of the park): apart from the snack kiosk selling drinks and ice cream and chips, the only cafe within the park sells Chinese food (the other restaurant just outside the entrance sells Chinese food too!) And the price was extremely expensive too, with a bowl of noodles and desert and drinks costing S$18!

The park was surprisingly small, and we were done in less than three hours (walking at a leisure pace), and that's including time spent in the cafe ordering food and then having lunch, and time spent waiting for the boat rides.

Overall, we felt that the River Safari is worth at least one visit. Though the ticket price could have been less to make the visit more value for money."
,,Leisure outing for the family,4.0,,We went on Friday before school closed for the mid year holiday. Our family of 3 adults and 4 children reached at 10am and entry was a Breeze with no queue. There were different sea animals and fish from different countries. Some are huge and unique. It was an eye opener for first timer like me. There are some animals like monkeys and pandas as we walk along the trails. Before the enclosure to see the monkeys there is a kiosk selling ice cream. My suggestion is the kiosk should station after this stop because no eating is allowed inside. Those who bought the ice cream were asked to finish before entering the enclosure. By the way the entry and exit is the same. We can stop to rest and have a drink or buy some snacks at a restaurant before the boat ride. The free boat ride is about 15 mins round the Seletar reservoir. There is another ride which is included in the ticket price is a little more exciting. It's situated opposite the boat ride entrance. Tickets are priced at $5 and $3 for adult and child respectively. You can still get the tickets if you did not buy together with your admission tickets. There's height limit though so advisable to buy the tickets on the spot but may have to queue if there's a crowd. We had lunch at KFC before we left at 2pm. It was an enjoyable outing for the whole family.
,,The Singapore Zoo is better,3.0,,"I was expecting the see free ranging animals/fish or mammals but was dissapointed. You wander past lots of large aquariums and final come across your little boat. It similar to taking a ride in a theme past where you pass flamingoes, penguins etc. all in there little enclosures. The ride only goes for about 20 mins. Better to spend your money at Singapore Zoo or the night Safari."
,,Outing with special people,3.0,,"We (about 35 of us) had an outing to the River Safari last week. It was my first time to see the full safari including a boat trip. We started at around 11am and left around 2pm including a lunch stop by the water. There are some real plusses to this attraction. It is, like nearly everything in Singapore, very well managed and maintained. The super large fish and aquatic tanks are great. Manatees/Dugongs and fish bigger than people are a sight to behold. The challenge, presumably at that time of day (it was hot and sunny) is that many of the animals are missing in action. One of the giant pandas was absent. But especially on the boat trip (not across the lake but around an artificial river with rapids etc.) No monkeys. visible and quite a bit else hiding. The sleepy and beautiful jaguar was the highlight. One note for the more dynamic boat trip is don't take it if you have a bad back - there is some rapid acceleration and you will get bumped from behind at the end (it should be easy to fix this I would have thought)."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I booked this tour prior to leaving Australia, which was fine. However nowhere in the advertising or voucher did it state that the river safari was actually only 15 minutes and you had to spend the rest of the tour (around 1 and a half hours) on foot was only told this once we were underway on the bus to the event. The tour guides first words were ""The tour informaton is actually misleading as the ""river"" portion is only for 15 minutes"". I possibly would not have booked the tour as my husband finds it difficult to walk any distance. Having said that the tour is well worth going to see with amazing displays and the ""river quest"" is really interesting as yu have animals on both sides of the boat to look at. It takes around 45minutes to get to the safari as it is out at the Singapore Zoo area. picked up from the hotel at 1.30pm and returned at 5.45pm. Good value."
,,Fun time at a different sort of zoo,5.0,,"They have done a great job of creating a river experience. The areas are divided up amongst many important rivers of each continent, including animals, fish, and information not the eco systems. They have some very large tanks that include large animals like alligators and manatees. There's even a chance to see a couple of pandas. Well worth the fee; fun for family and friends."
,,Lovely experience,4.0,,"One of the things we enjoyed in Singapore was the River Safari.
It was originally meant to have a River cruise, the Amazon River Quest meandering along the perimeter of the River safari and it would have been wonderful in that climate, but the rains put a stop to it as the cruise was suspended the day to avert any calamities. The River safari is built along the river theme along major rivers of the world – The Congo, the Nile, the Mekong, Ganges, Mississippi, Mary and Yangtze. The sea animals that inhabit these rivers form a part of the exhibits in each of these zones.

The Congo River exhibit named after the deepest river Congo contains colourful fishes like Congo tetras, cichlids, puffer fish, the salamander, and few other fishes.
The Nile, the longest river has the African arowana, the tigerfish, and the catfish, while Mississipi (The largest river system in North America, that flows through 10 states and is the world’s fourth longest river) contains the alligator gar, the paddlefish and the snapping turtle.
The Ganges zone has 2 large gharials that are so huge and stationery that they look like stone statues. The Mekong river has the giant catfish, sting rays and the macaque and you can then walk into a massive underwater aquarium in the Flooded Forest zone with huge fishes swimming around you. There are seating arrangements for you to rest and just gaze at those large and predatory fishes swim around and it is peaceful to watch them a long time. Some of these are 3m long and weigh 300 kg. You can watch around 4-5 sea otters diving into the water and then onto the log like rafts to relax a while and then hop on to the land, run around there and then dive back in. They rarely stay still and spend all their time repeating this activity. There are magnificent manatees that swim around gracefully, doing twirls and spins in the water that you can watch for a while.
Once you have had your fill of the underwater experience, you can walk into the Giant Panda forest which houses the red panda and 2 cute giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia in their own separate open areas. They are a darling of the crowds as they look fluffy and adorable, while all they do is plonk themselves and munch on bamboo shoots ignoring the adoring audience.
All this is close to an hour of walking and so the next stop is an eatery, Mama Panda Kitchen, where we can enjoy some coffee under the clouds and some cute panda cakes.
We then cross over a bridge across the river that looks green and serene, into the squirrel monkey forest, watch a huge anaconda, and stroll through a tropical aviary."
,,Nice but of poor value,3.0,,"As an extra paid extension to the Singapore Zoo, i found this to be of poor value. It really should be just included in the price of the zoo, but instead is more expensive than the zoo itself. Poor value, but I enjoyed it more than the zoo."
,,Nice afternoon activity,5.0,,"We love Amazon Quest the most. Sit on a small boat that can accommodate up to 15 people. See wildlife along the river for about 10 minutes. The whole place is well organized. We come on the weekend but it's not crowded. Buy online ticket get 10% discount and we can just show the e-ticket from mobile phone, no need to print it."
,,"Other than panda and squirrel monkey, tithing great",2.0,,"Hi, If you want to see panda and squirrel monkey you can visit this place. Else don't waste your time. Ferry travel is total flop. You can see giraffe (other side of Singapore zoo) Able to manage my disappointment by seeing panda"
,,A Must Do In Singapore,5.0,,"We visited the Zoo on a Monday (buying the double pass) and came back to visit the River Safari on Friday. You could easily combine the two in one day as the River Safari is a smaller attraction, however it is a definite ''Must See''.
The park is sectioned into ''Rivers of the World'' and the varying creatures both land & aquatic that inhabit each area. It's a great way to divide the attraction and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
The highlight of the park no doubt are the two Giant Pandas, kept in their own cooler eco environment. Beautiful creatures that you just have to see in person.
The other highlights for me were the Squirrel Monkey forest (I could have stayed there for hours) and they frolick & play all about you and the manatee display.
There is also a free boat cruise on the Selatar Resevoir (well worth it) plus a paid boat ride through the Amazon Rainforest section (worth is as well).
Another beautiful park that does Singapore a great credit. My wife and I enjoyed it immensely and if you have children I'm sure they'd love it just as much."
,,River Habitat,4.0,,"Visited River Safari located at Mandai Lake Road. Bus service 138 from Ang Mo Kio bus interchange goes there(Nearest MRT is Ang Mo Kio MRT). Admission fee applies.

The thrmepark named River Safari because it characterised into 5 famous rivers in the world and the natural habitat for the living things to live in.

Example:
1. The Nile - The Nile crocodile etc.
2. The Amazon River - The piranhas etc.

However the main highlights in River Safari is still the pandas Jia Jia / Kai Kai. There's also a panda cafe that sells snacks.

There's a river cruise available at a fee. Not very big. Can be completed about 3 hours."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"I thought this place was great. We arrived right at opening time, and made a beeline to see the Pandas first as this was suggested to us. This was perfect, for nearly 10 minutes we were the only ones in the panda dome, and they were enjoying their breakfast. We got to see both of them and you see them up pretty close. Other exhibits were great too, loved the manatees and the squirrel monkeys where you get very close to them. The amazon river ride was nice, again we did this early as soon as it opened and weren't disappointed, we saw all the animals. I think maybe if you went in the afternoon some animals might not be as active so I can highly recommend going early."
,,Small with covered shelter,4.0,,"The park is not very big but mostly is covered with shelter walk way. I believe there is only 1 food outlet. Lots of place to rest your feet and enjoy the nature. Only manage to see 1 panda during our trip, abit disappointed. Overall is nice experience."
,,Great Animals and don't miss the Panda!,5.0,,Amazing trip through major rivers of the world. We missed the actual river boat ride because it was raining and got shut down but the rest of the park was great. And the pandas....they stole the show!
,,"A good walk, especially on a rainy day",3.0,,"I brought my family with 2 toddlers to the River Safari on a Saturday. The weekend crowd was manageable. The animals on exhibits were somehow related to the river ecosystems across the world. We also viewed ""Jia Jia"" and ""Kai Kai"" - the pair of visiting panda. The walk was not too long and was quite kind to inexperience parents like us."
,,Animals and exhibits are great - rides not so much,4.0,,"So the free river ride is basically a 15 min boat ride that gives you a glimpse of the back of the elephant and giraffe enclosures at the zoo. Nothing impressive but it was nice just to sit instead of walking after a long day of walking in the hot sun.

DO NOT PAY for the Amazon ride. We saw 2 animals in this ride. Paying for the tram at the zoo will allow you to see more animals. ""Look go the left and see a...."" There were no animals when we looked, except 2.

The pandas are cute, the red panda exhibit it particularly cool. It kept walking right over us.

The manatee tank was phenomenal."
,,The best fresh water zoo in the world and home of PANDA in South East Asia,5.0,,This zoo is using river as its theme. Animals from biggest and longest rivers from all over the world can found here. The zoo is clean and has man made lake used as fresh water reservoir for Singapore. You can sail with boat here and the tickets is included if you bought in a package. And also this zoo is home of world most loved animal in the world PANDA.
,,The Star of the Show - Panda,4.0,,"River Safari is located along with Night Safari and Singapore Zoo. The star of the show is the Pandas and the River Safari Ride. Along with it, you can see many reptiles and animals. It is a very interactive attraction and have many kids activities. Good to purchase the Singapore Zoo ticket for a whole day of fun."
,,fun and a great learning experience,5.0,,"You will get to see many exhibits that are themed to different rivers of the world. While any exhibit can be improved, our kids loved all of them, particularly our 3 year old. 4 months later he is still using his map and talking about the things he saw. From Alligator Gars to Aligator Snapping turtles, there is a lot to see. Also included are Pandas and birds. Lottsa different types of exhibits from eye level tanks to tanks you walk under or see in from the side looking up. There is also chance to ride a leisure boat out on a resevoir/lake or take a slow boat on a man made stream to view animal exhibits like Tapirs, jaguars and monkeys though there is an extra charge. Kids need to be at least 105 cm to ride the slow boat cruise down the stream. There is a lot of information in the exhibits but it requires you to read. They also have a touching pool with staff overseeing it. Staff throughout park were friendly and professional. We spent an enjoyable 4 hours here. Its a bit pricey and food isn't cheap so be ready for that. Not everything is covered so rainy days might not be a good day to go unless you aren't in a hurry and wait out the showers which usually pass quickly. check the local forecast before going. Also check for online deals prior to going."
,,Great to see the Pandas,4.0,,"We combined this with the Night Safari and knew we didn’t need the whole day here so arrived just after 1:00pm on the shuttle. The park itself is not as extensive as the zoo or bird park but is still thoroughly enjoyable to walk around. There are plenty of fish to see and it’s amazing how many funny looking fish I have never even heard of. The big aquarium right at the end is impressive with giant catfish and huge rays. The pandas are the next exhibit after the fish and this was a real highlight. We were lucky enough to have the enclosure practically to ourselves and spent ages watching the panda eat his bamboo leaves. What a treat! We went on the boat ride around the lake and paid $5 for the river quest, nothing too exciting but it was still fun and we saw most animals. We spent about four hours here before leaving the park, had something to eat and then headed to the Night Safari next door."
,,Not worth at all,1.0,,spent nearly 30 SD per person. useless. nothing to see. just fish and 10 minutes boat. need to pay again for a boat inside.
,,The Pandas are the highlight. The River aspect is a bit of a let down,4.0,,"We really enjoyed the River Safari, but that is due to our daughter being obsessed with Pandas. So she loved the Panda exhibit.

The path down the boats is well laid out and there are lots of animals to see.

The actual river safari is a bit of a have. The boats (both the River Safari and the Amazon Safari) go that quickly, that you only catch glimpses of the animals.

It would be a good add on if you are spending a day at the zoo."
,,Educational,4.0,,Friendly staffs. Professional. Educational tour. Nothing much to do here but be captivated with all the sea and water animal. Brace yourself for a very long but educational walk ☺️
,,Great place for kids. See the forms of life thriving in major world rivers.,4.0,,"River based wildlife park featuring all major rivers on the planet. Get to see giant water animals, turtles. Touch a Star Fish. Good place for young children."
,,Don't go in bad weather,3.0,,"Thunderstorms so everything was closed- the boat rides, the monkey/ squirrel forest. If you're going only to see the pandas you might be disappointed as they often don't even come out. Luckily we saw one for a few minutes before it went back into hiding. Not much else going on there."
,,Great chance for kids to see giant pandas in Singapore,5.0,,"River safari is the new wildlife park featuring river systems of the world. It's not a big park but I think it's a great size for young kids to see everything before they get too tired!

There are shows and even a short River ride which should be booked in advance to guarantee time slot. There are certain animals which can only be seen via the ride."
,,Second visit here! Love it!,5.0,,"Today I spent more than 9 hours to visit Singapore Zoo, River Safari follow by Night Safari. Almost flat. Worth going for River safari. Different experience. You and your entire family can see Panda -Jia Jia and Kai Kai in Singapore and of course not forgetting to go for River quest ride. You need to pay separately. $5 for adult, $3 for child. This is not inclusive in the River safari ticket. There is a 15 minutes cruise ride which offered Free to visitors."
,,worth the visit for red & giant panda,4.0,,"plan ur trip to be here for atleast 3 hrs..touch pool available to feel horse shoe crab and star fish..bio dome is kept cool and red panda / giant panda(kai kai & jia jia) seen here. golden pheasant was missing in giant panda forest. amazon river cruise - avoid front seat as u will be drenched,at times its too fast and its hard to see the animal properly. but amazon river ride is different experience. dont miss golden head lion tamarin and squirrel monkey. do not touch the railings in squirrel monkey forest.try kai kai and jia jia panda paus at mama panda kitchen. its SGP$2.50/pau. photograph charge is SGP$15 per photo and SGP$50 for 3 photos."
,,a great day out,5.0,,"A great attraction for young and old so much to see and most of it air conditioned. The shear size of the aquariums is in its self amazing and having the pandas there a real bonus, great job and not to expensive."
,,If it wasn't for the Pandas...,3.0,,"After going to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari numerous times, my expectations for the River Safari were set quite high...and were overall not met.
The entire park seems to be build around the Panda and Manatee exhibits, which were wonderful. But they are the only outstanding ones in the park. All others were arranged with large spaces in-between with information posters. Most exhibits were in such a way that small children could not see the animals.

The River-cruise in the park was a joke to be frank. We had to split up because they did not allow small children inside. It was too slow to be fun and too fast to see the animals that were placed next to the ""wild"" river.

Overall, I would recommend to go to the normal zoo or the night safari instead."
,,Nothing great,2.0,,"The River Safari is located along with the Zoo and Night Safari, but isn't worth the time or cost. First of all, it takes a bit of walking to get to the boat itself. The boat just coasts gently around the river for a short duration (~15 minutes, that's it). We only got to see some giraffes; nothing much visible from the boat otherwise."
,,must visit.change to close look at red panda and panda,5.0,,"Animal lover buys park hopper ticket zoo,birdpark and river safari park together cheaper.Riversafari the whole route with shelter .so even hot or rainny also no problem .wheelchair friendly.you can reserve wheelchair before your arrival.ticket promotion online purchase.
try the panda buns and bamboo rice.guarantee you enjoy the visit"
,,A good place to spend a few hours - the PANDA'S WERE AMAZING.,4.0,,"We'd been to the zoo, night safari and bird park on our last trip to Singapore so visited the River Safari after reading trip advisor reviews. It's certainly interesting with lots of amazing water creatures to see and learn about. The highlight of the day was seeing Kai Kai and Jai Jai the two panda's. We were so lucky as just after we arrived at the enclosure they both woke up and we spent an amazing period of time just watching them eat and laze around. They are not behind glass and I would say are around 6m (20 feet) or less away from you. This was truly the highlight of my holiday.

Before you go, plan your return back to Singapore as trying to get help on buses was very difficult and the line up for a taxi can be very long. Some taxi drivers won't take you back to Orchard Road they just refuse."
,,Disapointed,2.0,,There is nothing much in this one except the pandas which are the main attraction... Otherwise it won't worth a single star.
,,Have you ever starred a crocodile in the eye?,5.0,,"That was one of the highlights walking around River Safari, a tankful of, glass sided, water with 2 crocs in it with one of them hanging in the water looking at me, amazing and I managed to screw up the photo! Add the red panda, one amazing creature which you will want to take home (be quiet here) and a for real panda, the place gets better and better. Food at the local food stall before you cross the bridge was great and check out the polar bear. Do the Amazonia River Cruise ($5 each), while it is quick the animals are different, sit 1 back or more from the front and do not worry about water or rain coats, takes about 10 minutes. River Safari is located beside the Zoo and Night Safari and you can wrap it into an all in one ticket covering those locations plus the Jurong Bird Park or only 2 or 3 of the attractions. You need about 4 hours, taxis cost about $20 from the centre of town, easier than the train and bus."
,,Worth visiting at least once!,5.0,,"we went here because my husband loves the amazon and all fresh water fish. to be honest, the park felt quite empty. there were many areas that were filled with signs and info cards about the animals and sometimes some habitats were empty. but the reason why i gave it a 5 star rating is that the park really excelled in maintaining a good homes for the animals.

The whole experience was intuitive. The walk paths are easy to follow and there are a lot of things to read about the animals along the way. The park is clean and extremely organized. but be warned, since everyone is following along the same path, it can get crowded at some points.

We really enjoyed the area of the dugongs and also that of the catfish and stingrays. There were benches available so that one can enjoy watching the fish as they swim around. An absolute treat if you love fish and reptiles. Oh and make sure you check out the habitat of the pandas. The animals are really interesting to observe in their ""natural"" environment.

The cruise and the boat ride was okay, just to experience it but it isn't something i'd try again. But we did go around the park twice just to see if we missed anything. (We didn't).

Overall, we had a really pleasant afternoon and it is something we'd recommend to friends too. :)"
,,Interesting & easy to navigate!,5.0,,"Situated right next to the Zoo it's well worth the visit & you can get discounts to buy 2 or more entry's to the parks. You basically follow one route that takes you through the whole safari which has plenty to see. We only saw one panda from a distance & he was sleeping which was disappointing but the Aquarium area is fantastic & watching the Manatee being fed was really cool!
The boat ride was ok but a little too fast if I had to critique anything...there wasn't much time to view the animals we were passing.
Oh yeah & lots of very randy monkeys"
,,"Ok, but the zoo and night safari are better",3.0,,"Been a couple of times with our 4 year old boy to the River Safari. While we love the zoo next door, and would say it's worth visiting we don't enjoy the river safari as much as the zoo or night safari.

It's just not as engaging or interesting. There's the giant pandas but I've never really understood what the fuss about them is.

What's nice with younger children is that the route around is quite contained so if you have a few children to handle its a bit less stressful trying not to lose them than the zoo might be. However young ones will likely be too short to be allowed on the boat ride, one of the key features of the river safari concept so it can feel like missing out in that regard.

Recommend it but don't love it. If you only have time for one, do the zoo."
,,world class,5.0,,"A well thought zoo, i really dun like th3 idea of caged animals but some of these animals appear to be active and lively. A good option to visit even if it rains."
,,Great family Day!!,5.0,,"Our family just loved the River Safari. 3 hours to explore the entire park, great value for money. Amazon Boat cruise passing elephants, giraffes etc. was wonderful. This place is an amazing zoo and aquarium all in one. Great experience, would highly recommend."
,,So many wonderful creatures!,4.0,,"We went to the river safari on a school trip, the time given was only half a day, so we were on a fast schedule. We had the chance to see so many creatures, including pandas, in a quite right environment. only the polar bear was in a little bit sad spot, I wish they will give him a better place to stay. the river safari was very nice but too fast, it's a limited time to see the animals properly and fully understand their lifestyle.
Overall a nice experience, I am looking forward to go back and enjoy it with more time!"
,,Very informative!,5.0,,Allot exactly an entire day to enjoy this attraction. Lots of fresh water creatures to see plus 2 pandas.
,,River based animal fun - and there are Pandas!,4.0,,"We took the MRT to the River Safari, with option although cheaper than Taxi or tour, allow enough time. Our hotel advises us an hour and a half travel time and they were right. right down to the minute. We needed exact change for the bus ($2.20) and the MRT ticket machine (price varies depending on station of boarding). We enjoyed our trip through Singapore and arrived in time for opening. Well designed park, with each major river system highlighted. We saw the Pandas (both Red plus the black/white), took both the river cruise and the Amazon river ride. Both were informative and good for animal spotting. We saw the giraffes and elephants from the neighbouring Zoo on the cruise. The Amazon ride, we took during the heat of the day, so some animal opted for shade. We did see many more than we expected though. The dugong exhibit was good too. A long day if travelling the MRT plus bus with a family, please consider time and cost when planning your trip. The food court was good, we sampled the gelato after our lunch and loved it ! didn't even add toppings on offer."
,,The Best River-Forest Theme Park in Asia,5.0,,"If you want to see Singapore zoo, SEA aquarium, and good nature at one place, this is the place, River Safari. TRANSPORT: If you are budget traveler, the easiest way to get here from down via public transport is to take the MRT on the North-South (Red) line exit at Ang Mo Kio (NS16) and transit to connecting public bus services across the station via bus no. 138 to the River Safari about 30 minutes. ADMISSION : You can get 5-10 SGD cheaper admission ticket if you buy from tour n travel service or online via website include boat ride amazon river quest (admission ticket at the ticket office around 30 SGD for adult). MAIN ATTRACTION are 6 river theme (Mississippi river, Congo river, Nile river, Ganges river, Mekong river, and Yangtze river, you can view many kind fresh water fish with their history around the world include the biggest fish Arapaima!!), Giant panda forest (you can watch giant panda Kai Kai and Jia Jia also Red Panda in their home habitat!!) and Amazon flooded forest(you can view the giant river otter at giant aquarium!!). You MUST try Amazon river quest, this boat ride adventure is awesome (you can watch a lot of rain forest animal such as jaguar, flamengo bird etc). FACILITIES: If you travel with baby, you can lend stroller/ baby cart for 9 SGD or you can use your own baby cart at the park. There is baby room in the park and free drink water facilities. Some aquarium is indoor with air condition and some other outdoor with roof and big fan so don't worry if the weather is rainy or heat. If you are hungry you can rest and enjoy the meals at the River Safari Tea House or Mama Panda Kitchen. Overall River safari is a MUST SEE attraction in Singapore!!!"
,,Good Design of the park,3.0,,You should plan your trip well to cover the zoo and river safari. Its long walks but if you have been to similar places then there is nothing much around here. Kids will love to an extend.
,,Worth for Panda,3.0,,"Though we got tickets, we didn't go river ride as it was closed. But went it to see Panda, which was amazing. The animals and other aqua stuffs are the same that you would have seen in zoo and aquarium. We doubt on the safeness of visitors, as a large reptile was roaming around freely on 15-05-2016 after 6.30 PM. I noted it and found it very difficult to find help to inform the workers. There was no emergency button kind of thing. Also it was very dark as most of visitors didn't notice the reptile. The scariest moments of my trip."
,,Not very exciting,3.0,,We went for the amazon ride it was very short and not very great and very less animals were shown . But the displays and pandas were good . Monkey feeding is also ok
,,Better than the Night Safari!,5.0,,"For best experience, arrive before opening so as to avoid crowds and ensure that you get to see feeding time. It's pricey but well worth the money. It's out of the way but then again, so are the zoo and night safari, and there are several transport options anyway.

The park is wonderfully laid out in a circuit and each area is regionally themed. The park (including the bathrooms) were clean and tidy. Seating tended to be clumped in areas near vendors. Food and drink vendors are reasonably priced. Gift shops aren't very ""in your face"", thankfully. I think the park is suitable for those with limited mobility, and those carrying prams.

The exhibits were generally well-lit, with the exception of some of the indoor aquatics. Many exhibits are fairly open (meaning no glass between you and the animals). Highlights for me: otters, giant pandas, red panda, squirrel monkeys, manatees. The seasonal decorations for Chinese New Year were excellent as well.

If you are wondering if it is worth extra for the boat rides (River Safari Cruise and Amazon Boat Ride) then yes, it absolutely is. Seeing the elephants and jaguar from afar is amazing.

The park has a lighthearted stance towards educating people about the animals in the area, the amount of information is enough to hold your attention and is written for all ages. I'm glad the park frequently mentions conservation and the effect of human interaction on nature HOWEVER it doesn't tell people how they can help or prevent further degradation in ways that they can manage e.g. not littering, not dumping waste in waterways.

Overall, it's a fantastic park and I would be glad to visit again."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,A great way to spend a few hours and feel privileged to have seen a Panda. The boat trip was wonderful.
,,Pandas!!!,5.0,,We loved our afternoon here and did two laps of the park just to see a few favourites again. In particular the giant pandas which were just gorgeous! We were lucky to be here on a quiet day and could spend as much time in with them as we wanted without a queue to get in either. We also loved the aquariums and monkeys. The boat ride was a little disappointing although we did see the elephants and giraffes at the zoo. The river quest was a fun little ride but too fast to appreciate or photograph any of the animals on the way around.
,,Enjoyable experience....,4.0,,Its an enjoyable experience... i never seen that kind of large fishes... and i have impressed with river cruise and amazon river quest rides...
,,An enjoyable outing,5.0,,We spent most of the day enjoying the river safari and found it very interesting viewing the huge variety of animals and fish. The highlight was the panda bears. The red pandas were also very cute. The river cruise was also a bit of fun.
,,not worth the $$,3.0,,only the 2 pandas are worth seeing. besides that nothing much to see. a vast place which requires lots of walking and time wasting esp the boat ride..
,,Only if you have more time after visiting the Zoo,3.0,,Good for a walk but nothing much to see except for the pandas. We heard the Amazon boat ride was great but couldn't get on it as our children were too young. The height requirement is 1.06m.
,,Calm and interesting,4.0,,"This is a perfect attraction for a family day. You can combine this park with the Zoo. The area is very quite with spacious green spots and a lot to learn about life in the most important rivers around the world.
If you are expecting a day with great adventures, rocking roller coasters and displays of technology, this is not the place to go.
This is more an educational park. Dedicated to create thinking about the care of water supplies, fauna and vegetation.
We were in a family visit with our preadolescent son and he really appreciated the visit. We were moved about the facts regarding human kind disrespect and neglect of the environment. Most of the people go there looking for animals and action but they forget that the aim of tthe park is to rise the alarms about the abuse of the rivers."
,,A must place to visit,4.0,,"You get to see the replica of amazon forest immersed in water. I liked it as lot. Spent lot of time. A beautiful place with a lot of information to learn

Tips for visitors:
1. Do not buy the amazon river cruise if you are visiting the zoo. In your cruise they will show you animals of Singapore zoo.
2. Go to this place first and then zoo as the zoo takes a lot of time
3. Park hopper is always cheap. Go for it :)"
,,"Only need a couple of hours, but still interesting",4.0,,"We chose to do the River Safari first off, and glad we did. There were almost no crowds, so we could walk through all the exhibits.
It didn't take long to walk through, but it was still enjoyable.
We didn't take the free cruise that came with the ticket, but opted to buy the Amazon Safari ride. It definitely wasn't worth the money. You don't see much and the ride doesn't last long.

It was easy to do the River Safari, Singapore Zoo and Night Safari in one day. I recommend if you do that, to start later in the day."
,,"Good, but not Great",3.0,,"A good park overall, but nothing spectacular. The park takes you on a single path through the entire experience, past a variety of animals which are well cared for. The environment is good, and was nice to see some unexpected animals like the giant panda. The actual river cruise was a big let down - just a 15 minute journey around a pond, didn't really get to see anything, and was extremely boring. The amazon river ride, however, was great, getting to see a lot of varying animals up close - could quite easily do that ride over and over again. The whole park was done in about 1.5 hours, so was short, but OK to do if you were already finished with the Singapore Zoo next door. I wouldn't, however, make the effort to come exclusively for this zoo."
,,"Overpriced ""Panda's with fish"" !",3.0,,"The panda's were the best part of the experience and was very well done. The rest was just ""padding"" to fill up a walk around, also they charge an extra fee for the boat ride ($SG5) and the actual river Safari part ($SG5) with most of the animals ! To charge extra money when you have already paid ~$SG 20/person for effectively the Panda's was just terrible.

We are huge fans of the Zoo, but unfortunately this River Safari needs a re-think especially around the extra price charge."
,,Not worth it,3.0,,"If you are planning to visit the aquarium which is a climate controlled dont bother to visit the river safari, since the boat ride was pointless and the tour around the sea creatures areas in the humidity is very long, kids liked it in the beginning then were too tired."
,,Enjoyable day,4.0,,"We bought tickets from our hotel and also the SAEX bus tickets which made it cheap and easy to get to the River Safari. We went early and taking other Tripadvisor's advice we headed straight for the Panda's. They did not disappoint! One was eating and very sleepy but the other was so active, running about and rolling, climbing and generally making a real show of it! We have been to Chengdu and this was up there with that experience. We then made our way down to the river boat and log ride. We had tickets to both and chose the log ride first. It isn't very long but it was fun and we sat at the front and got a bit wet at the start (great on a hot day!). Some of the exhibits we didn't see as they must have been hiding which you can't get upset about as they aren't exactly caged. It was a bit upsetting to see the jaguar pacing but otherwise the monkeys and birds all looked happy enough. The boat cruise was uneventful but pleasant. We saw two giraffe and one elephant and some cranes from afar. Not bad but not exactly what we thought we'd see! There were no crowds at this time as we were early. We then walked through the rest of the exhibits and managed to catch the end of a feed for some monkeys. They sat right near us and ate, one jumped down right next to me and then walked down the footpath. Amazing. The other exhibits were very educational and had an environmental theme throughout. We really enjoyed the day."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Loved it! Saw many animals I had never seen before. Layout of park is interesting and easy to get around. Went on animal cruise and it was interesting. Really enjoyed the spider monkey forest and the manatee exhibition. Great fun.
,,Go after the Zoo,4.0,,"We went after we'd spent hours in the zoo, late in the afternoon and that was just perfect. There were no queues by that time and everything was very leisurely.
We paid the extra to go on the river safari which we loved, best ever boat ride. We were told that we'd get wet so we put our cameras in our bags but we didn't even get splashed and wished we'd taken photos. Perhaps it was because we were the only ones in our boat and it was lighter.

The pandas were worth seeing and we enjoyed the river cruise too which was very relaxing. We went the wrong way round everything but thought that actually suited us better.

The otters weren't out first time round but by the time we got back they were zooming around their pool. We went back back to see many animals (here and at the zoo) that were hiding or sleeping out of sight and were not disappointed."
,,Lovely!,4.0,,"We went to river safari during our family holiday and had slovenly time there...you et to see the panda bears upclose n it's lovely watching them chew on the bamboo and just nap!
The river safari has two boat options...we opted for the Amazon river safari which was lovely...the other one is just like a regular boat!
The Amazon river safari takes u in the middle of a man made forest sort of set up where if ur lucky ul find some beautiful birds flying above you we saw some rare birds fly above us which was exquisite!
Will highly recommend this place to everyone!
Must do!"
,,Worth a visit but needs more wow!,3.0,,"We were at River Safari, Singapore on the 27'th of March, Pleasant trip with 4adults and 3 kids with one being a toddler. Surprisingly comfortable and not too sweltering in todays humidity with many fans and a/c areas around the park. Some portions of the park is also shaded and some has cooling areas :) Nice setup unfortunately the displays should have more matured fishes, ie. a small wallago and goonch when it could be a monster fish? Nice planted setup with many schooling fishes too, beautiful colors but most (70-80%) of fishes can be found in petshops around Singapore and Malaysia. With their setups was expecting to see more matured tanks ie. a full cichlid community from tanganyika. Or being able to see a fully grown Bagarius! Sorry, being a fish aficionado was expecting a ""WOW"", Place has potentially, hopefully it'd survive till then :)

ps. where are all the pacus/peacock bass in the amazon flooded forest?! Not a single pacu seen throughout... :(

big pacu fan"
,,Impressive,5.0,,"The River Safari is designed in a loop so visitors can just go clockwise (or anti-clockwise like I did) around the park. The Rivers Of The World is at the beginning of the loop while the Amazon Flooded Forest is at the end of it. Since the majority of the crowd are at the other side, I have the Amazon Flooded Forest all to myself!"
,,Waste of Money,2.0,,"There is nothing much you see on the safari itself , all we saw while we were on the boat was giraffe(which are in the zoo) and elephants(which you also see in the zoo).
So if you have been to the zoo then i would not recommend river safari."
,,A Rip Off,3.0,,"Very disappointed with River Safari. If it wasn't for the Pandas it wouldn't have been worth visiting. The boat ride on the lake wasn't worth taking and certainly wasn't worth $5. We missed the second boat ride because we had already been charged an extra $5. for the lake boat ride and felt we had already paid enough. We felt cheated as, except for the Pandas, we only saw fish. Could not recommend as good value."
,,They have Panda's,3.0,,"The River Safari is one of the 4 ""zoos"" in Singapore, and in my opinion probably the least interesting. It's saving grace are the Panda's - which are pretty amazing. But if you want to see fish, I'd recommend the Aquarium at Sentosa instead."
,,Decent place to visit,3.0,,"We got river safari ticket for 28 dollars including boat ride. River safari name is misnomer as it is not really a safari in the river.

River safari is good and you can lot of animals. best one is pandas.

Boat ride is useless and happens only for 5 mins."
,,Small enough to finish it in half a day (or less),3.0,,"It's Singapore Wildlife Parks' newest attraction. It's also the most disappointing. With the word ""Safari"", you're expecting at least a Night Safari-style Tram Ride or enclosures that make you feel you're within the wildlife environment like the Singapore Zoo's. Instead, you'll walk through a covered path surrounded with aquariums featuring river fishes from different parts of the world. Of course, we are basing our expectations on the spectacular precedent set by the Singapore Zoo and their brochures, so we were looking forward to seeing river-dwelling animals (not just fishes) in a simulated natural environment - not just rows of aquariums which are disappointing especially if you're visiting River Safari after the SEA Aquarium in Sentosa. We did see animals in their simulated natural environment, only after paying an extra 5 SGD each in the Amazon River Quest attraction. The attraction can be considered the highlight of the park but given the general ho-hum level of the park, this should be included in the admission ticket. You can skip the River Cruise along the reservoir unless you really want to see the back of the Singapore Zoo.

To be fair, there are several impressively huge aquarium displays featuring the giant Mekong catfish and Mekong carp, the Amazon Flooded Forest and the out-of-place airconditioned Giant Panda enclosure. The Giant Pandas named Kai Kai and Jia Jia are well worth the admission but you have to wonder why they are inside the River Safari when their natural habitat are far from a major river.

There are restaurants inside like the River Safari Tea House and the Mama Panda Kitchen that serves a panda patterned red bean bun.

For great value, buy your tickets online and avail of their Park Hopper offer if you want to visit Singapore's other wildlife parks. Not only you'll get discounts (20% for Singapore-issued credit cards / 10% for Visa / Mastercard from outside Singapore), you'll also get freebies like a free tram ride in Singapore Zoo (worth 5 SGD) and the River Cruise ride in River Safari. That way, even if you're disappointed with the River Cruise, you won't waste money, just 15 minutes of your time."
,,Educational and Enjoyable,5.0,,"Although we live in Singapore, we visited this place for the first time only now. This place is a great place to learn about some of the great rivers in the world, their creatures, history etc. A lot of importance is laid on how and why they are getting polluted and destroyed by mankind.
While as an educational trip it is very well laid out, it has been well complemented by a few entertaining sections - the Pandas is a must see, the boat ride in the Amazon belt and the different feeding sections."
,,Stunning,5.0,,First time coming here. Our kids enjoyed the experience. Lots of birds and aquatic animals and very educational as well. The kids were also excited to see the 2 pandas. Try this and the Singapore Zoo. They are just beside each other
,,Interesting visit with lots to learn,4.0,,Great place to go and learn about the marine life of Singapore. There is tonnes of history to discover about such an unknown place. Would recommend to anybody visiting Singapore.
,,Good value but some areas need further developing,4.0,,"The mist disappointing part of this zoo was the river dwelling animals in the fiver themed areas with few fish and not a lot of interesting things to see in this quick walk through ramp area. Hiowever it was great to see the beautiful giant pandas and the 2 river cruises, particularly the Amazon River Quest where we saw lots of wildlife."
,,Very educational,4.0,,"First time I have been to this type of entertainment, very educational, enjoyed it very much especially meeting the pandas Kai Kai & Jia Jia"
,,River safari surprises at a high level,4.0,,"Booked this as part of the Singapore Duck and hippo package. The supplied bus took us there and back as it's a good half hour plus out of Singapore. Generally I don't like Zoos with animals caged and not free. The leopards were going up and down in their glass enclosure but we got to within three feet of a leopard. The pandas were the highlight for me and we got some great pictures. Overall a very big area zoo that is well maintained and kept. Lot to see and would recommend highly. As part of the package, price is keen too. Go for it."
,,Not that great!,3.0,,"As compared to the zoo and night safari experience. However after walking too much in the zoo area, the river safari experience was a relaxing break. We didn't really spot any different animals on the river safari...they were the same ones from the zoo area..just from a different side view. Kids might enjoy this safari."
,,panda is the main attraction,4.0,,"the giant panda was the main attraction . the river safari ride was nothing to write about we just saw some giraffe, no river creatures , the amazon river quest was interesting but you have to buy it tickets separately around S$5 . the boat speed is a bit fast ."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,The River Safari is a must see in Singapore. We travelled with a 6 year and we all enjoyed this attraction. If travelling with children the boat ride in the small boat is great but this has a height restriction. The day spent here was thoroughly enjoyable for all age groups and good value for money.
,,1 stop visit,5.0,,"Am amaze by the arrangement of River Safari. You have all in one, so you could skip the zoo :P. Lots of species fishes and animals.You will enjoy :)"
,,Covered wildlife attraction,5.0,,"So glad we went on the River Safari - it's so well laid out and easy to follow. I loved the boat ride, where we saw several animals as we glided by but my favourites were the otters and manatees. Jia Jia & Kai Kai were asleep, but there are still many other cute and cuddly animals to observe. The squirrel monkeys were adorable - they can sit so near you could touch them, but don't. Tips: wear sunscreen and insect repellent and have a poncho or umbrella handy as the weather can change. Also, on the boat ride, water can splash into the boat so have a waterproof bag to keep valuables dry. The boat ride also only operates in good weather."
,,Underwater wonder,5.0,,"We went on a Wednesday morning and unfortunately there were two groups of school children attending at the same time. This mad our experience a little rushed and noisy. The park is set out in the different major river systems of the world. Many types of river fish and animals. The highlights are the Red Pandas, Giant Pandas, Giant Otters and the Amazon River Cruise. The Amazon River cruise is an additional $5 ride but well worth it. The ride is in an amusement type boat that travels along a narrow river path. We were able to spot all of the animals along the way from Jaguars, different monkeys, birds, giant anteater and more. If you don't see them all the first time it is worth the $5 to go again. We were able to do a second round but didn't see all the animals the second time."
,,Educational trip,4.0,,"Learnt more about the famous rivers of the world eg Nile, Ganges, Amazon, Mekong and the life forms that thrive in them. Most Favourite are the sea cows, large otters exhibits. Also had a chance to see Kai Kai and Jia Jia the lovely China pandas in action. Nice trip for the young and old."
,,Absolutely loved it,5.0,,"On my previous visit to Singapore I went to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, but didn't do the River Safari. This time I managed to go on the River Safari and it was a wonderful experience. The highlight for me was the panda bears, but there are so much more to see and do. I will definitely do this again."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"We were not expecting too much from the River Safari, so I suppose we got about what we expected! We went to the zoo first, then about 2pm reached the River Safari. The River Cruise at the River Safari was included in our combo ticket, and was not very interesting. You could see the giraffes and elephants at the zoo from the boat, but not much else. The Amazon River we had to pay extra for. It was better than the other cruise, but the boat went too fast for you to see much of the wildlife en route.

The highlight, and reason we went to the River Safari, was the giant pandas. Both of them were on display, eating bamboo and we could have stayed for hours watching them! They are so gorgeous! The other highlights for us were the red panda, giant river otters and the strange manatees."
,,Don't compare it to Singapore zoo,5.0,,"Amazing! Pandas and sea cows all in one place. Awesome value and the chocolate pao from the cafe was very nice and cute (I almost didn't want to eat it.)
Lots of photo opportunities, the amazon river boat went a bit too fast but other than that you can take everything at your own leisurely pace. It's about $25 if you find the right deal and that is unbelievable value, especially for Singapore and for how long you can- and will- spend there."
,,It's very good to visit,5.0,,"We visited River Safari Singapore on march 4th 2016. We arrived there at 2 pm. It is located next to singapore zoo. We saw very big fish, we took ride a boat to see many animals, we took picture with panda..my son looked happy visiting river safari. He wanted to visit there again sometime"
,,Loved the Pandas,4.0,,"The river safari offers a lot more than you first think. It was very well laid out, with one path all the way. It highlights different river wildlife as you walk round, providing enough information without overloading you. Some of the aquariums are huge. We paid extra for the river boat quest, but felt this was not worth the money. However the park hopper combi tickets are good value for money. The pandas were the highlight and both of them were out and about, so we were lucky and spent ages watching them The little red panda was so cute. The river safari is easy to get to via the MRT and Bus, taking about 1.5 hrs inc."
,,Great educational and recreation place for the kids,4.0,,We visited here during our holiday. It was a great way to introduce the kids to the river system and wildlife of the rivers of the world. the walkway is under shade cloth so it was enjoyable for the kids. The displace was great to keep the kids engaged. The amazon boat ride was fun. The Panda exhibit was a real bonus that the whole family enjoyed
,,Very Entertaining Venue,4.0,,"Took the long cab ride to the ""Zoo"" and decided to check out the River Safari. Great exhibits of the most famous rivers of the world coupled with a ride on a river boat where you were able to see some of the animals of the zoo in their natural habitats. Worth the time and the money."
,,Bring your children,3.0,,"This is good place to introduce river wildlife from around the world to the children. It was like sea world but for river ecosystem. It might be boring for adult. It quite costly, about SGD 28 to enter the park and additional SGD 5 for boat ride."
,,Very enjoyable experience,4.0,,"We chose to visit both the River Safari and Singapore Zoo in January when we were in Singapore. I was with my 2 children 13&11. We have been to Singapore Zoo before and wanted to se it again because l believe it is one of the best zoos in the world. So we thought we'd visit the River Safari too. We were not disappointed. It was great fun. It is an expensive day out and the food prices are ridiculous but the zoos are so beautiful,to wonder around with lots of shade. With older kids you can easily visit both places in a day. We also caught Zoo bus from near Orchard Avenue where we were staying which was fast and easy. I would easily go back next time l am in Singapore."
,,Cute pandas and nice boat ride,4.0,,"This zoo is next to the big Zoo. It's only a fraction of the Singapore Zoo in size and mostly have fishes and other water based animals as its name suggests it. The main attraction is the panda and the really cute red panda. Though you can see big rays, manatees and other strange creatures and have a little boat ride on the lake which is really relaxing! Because you probably buy the combo ticket (3in1 or 4in1) you should visit the place. It's more relaxing after the busy Zoo. But if you don't have time for all 3 parks in one day (with Night Safari) don't force yourself to see it on another day, because I don't think it worth the lengthy travel and you can finish it in a few hours. Except if you really want to see the pandas. All in all: with combo tickets it worth the visit but if you don’t have time, don't bother."
,,Not worth of visit,2.0,,"We arrived River Safari with high expectations based on Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park. The park turned out to be a major disappointment. There is not much to see. Many of cages/aquariums were empty and there was just not much interesting to see. Pandas could have been nice sight, but they were sleeping- bad luck.

I cannot recommend this park to anyone. Instead, I recommend Jurong Bird Park and Night Safari."
,,For Panda lover,3.0,,"The visitor's trail is thoughtfully designed so that visitors will be able to cover all the attractions. It will take approximately 2 hours to cover the whole trail.

Having been to many zoos, including the one just next door (Singapore Zoological Garden), the exhibits in the River Safari is normal. The only attraction are the pandas.

The River Safari Amazon Adventure is not worth the $5."
,,A wonderful 3-hour fun morning with the family,4.0,,"The River Safari is a very well put together attraction.
Absolutely amazing land, tree and sea animals seen up close and personal: (esp the alligator!) the red panda was a real treat, Jia Jia and Kai Kai were not bashful at all; manatees feeding; playful otters...
We went on the boat ride (ticketed) which I thought was a bit theme-park gimmicky. The ride was a very short 10 minutes - we saw jaguars and capybaras, most of the other animals were 'in hiding'.
Most parts of the area were air-conditioned or sheltered so it was very pleasant even though it was a scorching morning. There were ample benches and tables/chairs for us to take a rest or have our food."
,,This is better than you think,5.0,,The amazon river ride is better than the other boat ride. Their are many animals you won't see at other zoos and I think this park is really worth going to visit.
,,Sea aquarium has more variety than this,3.0,,"This attraction doesnt compare well with other national parks like bird park night safari n zoo safari.it is built over a big space but not great variety that we would see in sea aquarium or underwater world of sentosa.
Plus boat ride was so childish as there was no great view at all other than seeing some animals from zoo safari. The adventure ride was better. The highlights are the pandas n the view of polar bear from one window panel, both of them thrilling to watch."
,,Really just an aquarium with pandas,3.0,,"The idea for this place is nice. And you do see many different aquatic animals, in a typical aquarium setting.

The River Safari Cruise is nothing special - you can glimpse of a few animals from the zoo, like elephants and giraffes.

The Amazon River Quest is a bit more interesting, but not amazing.

The interactive pen where you can walk among the monkeys is a highlight."
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"If you visit the Zoo then no reason to see this also. Then the extras that they have, 2 different things, one is like a boat trip on the lake for 15min which was totally ridiculous and not worth the money nor time, and then the Amazon river something was also nothing special so feel free to avoid it."
,,very good,5.0,,we had booked river safari via agent. It always better since we had not to stand in que. Safari was good. Do not take front seat without rain coat other wise you will be wet when rail hit water. over all experience was good.
,,Nice Getaway,4.0,,"Nice place to be with the family. Peaceful and Serene. Time required to enjoy the entire place is about four hours. While we were there, there was a light shower and it made the atmosphere excellent.

Suggestion would be to select a day that is not so sunny."
,,Panda! 🐼,4.0,,Very nice river themed zoo and aquarium. You can take a boat toor or just walk. Many animals and marine creatures in well-kept conditions .. And panda!🐼
,,"Relax, take a load off your feet",5.0,,"After a tiring walk through the Zoo amidst the heat, take your feet off and sit back and relax while viewing the great manatee's swimming around in one of this park's great aquarium !"
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"Went to the River Safari with high hopes, but is nothing compared to Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari. First of all, I'm not entirely sure why it is called River Safari, when the boat trip is actually around a lake (which you don't get to see much on, just some elephants and maybe a giraffe or two if you're lucky, but these are the same animals you may have already seen in the zoo). The river safari part you have to pay an extra $5 which is a rip off when you've already paid to come in. If you decide not to pay (like we did) that means that you will miss a large number of the animals because there is no footpath through that section. They are also supposed to have pandas, however when we went their enclosure was being cleaned so they were inside, and despite there supposedly being monitors to watch them when inside, these were also turned off. The only redeeming feature is the manatee enclosure and the squirrel monkey enclosure, but even they wouldn't make me want to go back. I would advise NOT to make a special trip here. If you do fancy going then perhaps tag it on to a day at the zoo. Trust me, you can do the whole park in about 2 hours. Overall, it is not worth the money."
,,Nice place,5.0,,The river safari was good. It has a nice collection of fishes from all around the world and you end up with a nice river cruise. The negative is it is a long walk to the river cruise.Can combine it with the zoo and night Safari.
,,Not accordingexpectation!,3.0,,River safari is nice to explore if you want extra time in hand.. it is not something exceptional to see.
,,The best zoo in Singapore,5.0,,"Compared to Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, river safari has the best concept. It has imported pandas from China.
The amazon boat tour is great although you may likely be disappointed as it often gets under maintenance. The bridge overlooking the river is beautiful and has a nice ambience. If you go at around 3pm on weekdays (except Fridays), you will be able to enjoy the park the most as it's the quietest time."
,,Great wildlife park!,5.0,,"We visited RS on a Wednesday just before lunar new year and it was very quiet. Which was great for us, and we had no problem getting around or seeing exhibits and lines for the Amazon River Quest cruise were non existent! Having been to Singapore Zoo & the Night Safari we were keen to visit this one. And id say, if you were short on time in Singapore and wanted to visit one of the zoos of aquariums, this is probably the one to do, as it is a pretty unique concept as far as zoos go and has a bit of everything- animals, fish, ocean mammals and birds. Best of all, it's all completed undercover! The park encircles a corner of the reservoir and so the overall experience is peaceful and serene! The rivers of the world exhibits are probably the least exhibiting or eventful although the Yangtze River aquarium is quite awesome with its giant catfish. The Mississippi River exhibit had information about beavers but none on display- that was probably the only disappointing part of the visit. The panda forest exhibit is incredible!! And you are able to get such an amazingly close up view of the two giant pandas! Although we could only see one red panda, it was very cute indeed! The panda pau buns at the mama panda cafe are a tasty and affordable novelty treat and definitely come recommended. The Amazon River Quest ride is an absolute must do and we really have to encourage River Safari to include this in park admission even if it means charging more as this, along with the pandas and flooded forest, really is a highlight of your visit to River Safari! Spend the $5, you won't be disappointed. This ride is really want sets River Safari apart from any other zoo we've been too!"
,,Good even on a wet day,5.0,,We spent a family afternoon going through the River Safari as we did not have time to go to the Zoo. Our 3 year old grand-daughter was enthralled. Her highlight was the crocodiles. Ours were the Pandas and the amazing large fishtank which included some of the biggest fish I've seen plus a number of Manatees. Never seen them in real life before. As virtually the whole route is under cover this is a good attraction for the family if it is raining.
,,Interesting concept,4.0,,"The river safari displays animals around the world, which are living near the major rivers like Yangtze, Mississippi, Ganges,etc. You can see the rare African tiger fish, mata mata, Chinese salamander, etc.

Most of the animal displays are located indoors or sheltered, so it is a great place to go when the weather is too hot or rainy. It takes about 1.5 hours to go through all the displays.

We had to pay additional fee for the Amazon river ride, which was located in the River Safari. This was a 5-10 minute boat ride, but there were not many animals to see. The entrance ticket to the river safari was rather high and we had to pay thid extra fee, which I found to be overpriced.

Overall, we enjoyed our visit to the River Safari."
,,Walking/river zoo,5.0,,"The way you expect this zoo to be set out and the way it is set out are different.
Its a mostly walking zoo with a river safari (10mins) and Amazon river quest for 15mins max (extra $5). Otherwise you walk and explore as you wish. It is mostly based around underwater animals, lots of fish/marine life to see. But its great as a different way to explore a 'zoo' and would still recommend to do it!"
,,Worthwhile but poorly explained,4.0,,"It is like the zoo with a river theme. There are some very cool large aquariums with manatees otters and catfish. There is two boat options as optional extras $5 each one is like a theme ride on a boat on metal rails in a water cannel through enclosures but it goes quite fast but very tame you will not get that wet if at all wet. You see leopards, big anteaters and tapirs. NB you can ride again for free just take right turn before exit and join the que again!!!! the other is a river boat cruise which i didn't do. take water with you as not many drink machines or water fountains.
Exhibits are quite spread out need to be able to walk a bit .
Definitely worthwhile if you have already done zoo and bird park before but it would be third option if you haven't done others"
,,A little different,4.0,,"This is a park with a difference, as it has a combination of fish and animals, but what makes it interesting is that everything is themed around the major rivers of the world, and the animals and fish which are in and around them. we also took the Amazon ride, which is a water theme park type ride and costs $5.00 extra, from the ride you get to see monkeys, and also Jaguars prowling on the other side of thick glass. Another pleasant surprise was to see Pandas, both normal and the smaller Red ones."
,,Water zoo,4.0,,"The Singapore River Safari is a special zoo focusing on animals living in or near the water. The recreation of the Amazonas river is particularly interesting as you actually ride on the river, the other landscapes are shown as aquariums and well-designed information boards. Changing from one landscape to another is sometimes not so obvious, you might not notice it when walking through. Some areas may not be so fascinating for smaller children as many animals are 'unspectacular' compared to lions, elephants (or pandas).
As many attractions in Singapore, entry prices are quite hefty and I found the add-on prices for the boat trips too high. But with somewhat older children, it's a must-see for the pandas and the jaguars, not speaking of the wealth of water animals presented."
,,Nice park,4.0,,Many themes available from mekong river to amazon river. a big aquarium for fish watching. Great for family outings. It is sheltered. Not hot.
,,River themed wildlife park,4.0,,"It was really Nice to explore the repositories for river living animals. Especially during the eve of cny to watch the lion dance and to pose with the mascots was a real fun factor. Next the weather was cloudy but the river safari is completely a sheltered one. More over umbrellas are provided when you opt for the River rides.
We came across the 2 zones - rivers of the world and wild Amazonia. Awestruck by the alligators,lung fish , Mekong cat fish and manatees.
Loved to see the giant pandas and the rare red panda.
With the ride I preferred the Amazon river quest where you can view the tapir , jaguar and capybara. The river safari cruise is where you can enjoy the nature but can spot elephants perhaps.
Overall we loved to see giant river otters and other river animals in the showcases resembling natural river banks."
,,Lots to see,4.0,,The highlight will definitely be the pandas. The short boat ride is pretty fun but comes with a height limit. Do check if your children are tall enough to take the ride before getting your tickets.
,,Well laid out park,5.0,,"Had a great day at the river safari. We had previously visited the zoo and would have done it again if time and little legs would have allowed.
The day we visited seemed to be quiet and we didn't have to que or wait to see the animals/enclosures.
Went especially to see the pandas and unfortunately only one was on view that day due to maintenance.
River cruise was very short, but it was nice to sit and get the breeze, got to see the elephants and a rhino from the boat as it skirts along parts of the zoo.( wouldn't stand in que to see it again, in my option)"
,,Save time and money for other parks,2.0,,"One can skip this. Can't compare with the Zoo or the Night Safari. Though it's just next to the zoo, you may save your time, money and energy for better options."
,,Active pandas,4.0,,A great attraction and much better than the night safari in my opinion. Very well done as an attraction and the day we attended the two pandas were very active. Great photos and other great things to see. A day at the zoo and followed by the River Safari might be a bit much even though they next to each other so I would do two visits if time permits. The zoo would be my priority as it is one of the best in the world but the River Safari is well worth a visit.
,,Very interesting and the path way is completely covered,5.0,,"Very interesting exposition. The aquariums are very clean. Can take amazing pictures. We didn't appreciate the river cruise that much. We like the path way which is completely covered. So you can do this activity during the afternoon, when there is a high probability of rain in Singapore. Please note the path way of the zoo is not covered. So better to do the zoo in the morning."
,,A good view of 5 river ecosystems,4.0,,"The River Safari has a good collection of animals from 5 different river systems and is conveniently located beside the Singapore Zoo. Be sure to get a ticket for the River Quest to view some of the animals on a weekday to avoid long queues. Be sure to bring along a water bottle, an umbrella and insect repellant if necessary."
,,Thank goodness for the Pelican,3.0,,"So, what can I say about the River Safari? Having grown up in Singapore and spread high merit for the Zoo to all those who asked about it, I unfortunately had not gone back for over 10 years, and of course new attractions had been developed and implemented.

With that said, I purchased a 4-in-1 pass to all of the parks for my girlfriend and I. Aside from the fact that their website would not accept my AMEX (where you get a discount) but the onsite counter would (full price), I was intrigued by the idea of a River Boat tour of the animals.

Safari River Boat Tour- not worth it at all. I was immediately disappointed by the fact I had paid to go on a circular tour of a tiny part of a river which merely showed me the back of the enclosures I had just paid to enjoy at the actual zoo (which provided better views). With the conductor advising all that we MAY see certain animals, I felt taken advantage of and came off the boat in a slight rage haha

HOWEVER, we then paid an extra $5 for the Amazon Boat Ride (as we had already paid S$120) and before entering I noticed a pelican with his trainers so naturally I wanted to go play with the 4ft tall feathery friend. Really glad I did, as it immediately made me happier and whilst talking to the trainer and discussing the birds personality, we were even shown the impressive stretching capability of his mouth (see photo below).

Once we ventured into the Amazon Ride, the log flume esc style ride was an alternative and enjoyable way to see the animals of the South American rainforest.

The above experience coupled with a large aquatic display with dugongs and giant fish and also a close up look and both the red panda and the super chilled black and white pandas was a delightful end to the River Safari.

Although I would not return (as I have now experienced it), I would recommend that people attend as it was a great alternative way of experiencing the animals.

ENJOY"
,,Good for family trip,4.0,,"We visited river safari at the end of 2015, mainly because we want to see famous panda Kai-kai and Jia-jia. We have been curious about this Panda since we see in the TV, process transfer these 2 cute panda from China. Overall I enjoyed my visit to River Safari, nice view, great collection of animal. Tips: Plan your trip to visit to River safari at fine/sunny weather."
,,Go walking - Boat ride not worth your money,1.0,,"The River Safari is adjacent to the Singapore Zoo. The easiest way you can reach here is by a cab, which will take about 30 minutes from the city. You can also reach here by public transport bus or by MRT NS-Red line and then a connection bus or cab.

River Safari includes a boat ride through Mississippi, Congo, Nile, Ganges, Mekong and Yangtze rivers. You can also see the Giant Panda Forest, Squirrel Monkey Forest and the Amazon Flooded Forest. Tickets can be purchased on-line or at the ticket counters at the Singapore Zoo or River Safari.

The Amazon River Quest is a 10 minutes boat ride for SGD 5, which features different types of fishes, alligators and animals living by the side of the Amazon River.

You may not view all the animals during this short boat ride. If you have enough time, it will be better to cover the area on foot, which will give a better chance to view the animals. Otherwise, the boat ride by itself is a waste of money. If you sit in the front row of the boat, you can get wet as the boat goes through some dips in the ride.

Other than the boat rides, you can see the world’s largest freshwater aquarium and the Giant Panda Forest and the Squirrel Monkey Forest.

The best part of the trip was the Giant Panda Forest. The queues are quite long, so better to do it in the morning as the park opens. You can also see the red pandas here.

Another interesting area is the Squirrel Monkey Forest, where you will find the squirrel monkeys all around. They are quite amusing and you can photograph them from very close.

I was very curious reading about the Amazon River Quest and the River Safari. It was very disappointing as we saw very few animals during the boat ride. Unless you do the whole area on foot, it’s a waste of time and money."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Before my trip to River Safari, the name gave an impression that we would be taken on a boat/cruise on the river and we would be able to see all animals during the travel. This isn't how it is though. River safari consists of 3 parts:

1. A walk that is named and divided by areas: Mekong River, Ganges River, Nile River. Sea creatures from these rivers are kept in aquariums accordingly. My favourite was the alligator in Ganges River! I will attach a pic of my sister standing with the alligator below. Also, along this walk, you will be going through Panda Forest. One red panda, 2 giant pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia. They were lovely! I was fascinated by the Red Panda so much! We only managed to see one giant panda as the other was sleeping

2. River Cruise. Be reminded that you need to purchase an extra ticket at SGD5 per adult for this trip. It is a 15 minute boat ride on the river, and if you are lucky, you may get to see giraffes and elephants from Singapore Zoo in this ride. We only managed to see giraffes.

3. Amazon Ride. This will cost another additional SGD5 per adult. Young children are not allowed on this ride. You are made to sit in a boat like thing that goes on a water track, very much like water rides in a theme park. You get to see different kind of animals along this ride, and again if you are lucky, you can spot jaguars on this ride. This ride is about 15 minutes as well.

The whole journey will take you about 3 hours. Overall, I enjoyed this trip well."
,,"Enjoy the day with River Safari, Zoo and/or Night Safari",4.0,,Enjoyed the River Safari then the Night Safari. Beautiful areas. Did all of the boat options. Areas to eat and relax because it was a hot day. Immaculate. We planned for the River Safari then the Night Safari. River closes at 7:00 pm and Night Safari opens at 7:15 or 7:30. We had a meal in between. Nice but long and hot day.
,,"Pandas, monkeys, sea cows!",4.0,,"It's hard to pass up an opportunity to see a panda. They have giant pandas as well as red pandas in a pleasant air conditioned environment. Enjoy the A/C because lots of parts of the park do not have it, so relish when it's there. The river ride was cute and kids would love it. Nice attractions.

My best advice is to not do this in conjunction with the Night Safari. It is just too much to do both and lots of boredom time in between the two. It made for much too long of a day for us in that heat. Plus, the lines at the night zoo were crazy."
,,Otters are awesome; river safaris are not,3.0,,"The river safari option at the Singapore zoo sounded fantastic. See the zoo by boat in the only zoo on earth with one, why not? Unfortunately the tour itself was mostly walking related, which would br fine if the boat trip was worth it in the end. The hostess was kind and friendly but you only get to see 3 animals, if you see them at all. The amazon boat trip is more worth it, but costs extra. The highlight is by far the otters and if you're lucky you'll get to see them during feeding time.

Overall it was pretty good, but goods not as advertised. The river part needs improvement."
,,"Good, but see the Night Safari and Bird Park in preference",3.0,,"The highlight is is pandas, except that last week one of the two was on vacation.
Save money by going there by public transport (train and bus)- it is quite easy.
The boat trip was disappointing - only 15 minutes and you only saw elephants, giraffes and hippos in the distance. The Amazon boat ride was great, but is a $5.00 extra."
,,Effortless walk,4.0,,On the day we went there were not many people there so no queueing and an easy walk around in fact there were only 4 of us on both of our rides. The Panda display was closed but the other displays are good with the Amazon display and additional ride being of a very high standard. Recommend as an add on to the zoo as you actually see the back of some of the animal enclosures on the boat ride and can get some good photos in particular the elephants and giraffes.
,,Nieces visiting from Australia.,3.0,,Why can't you bring in Simply Wrapps or Salad Stop or Subway to the F&B operations at the zoo...inside and out. Right now there are no healthy food options inside or outside the zoo. Only Fast Food.
,,AWESOME Family bonding activity,5.0,,"Wow! We've been to the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, Jurong Bird Park, etc but this experience was exceptionally worth taking time to explore as it provides visitors a different unique experience indoors and out.

Though it may be cold indoors (perhaps because it rained briefly) particularly for the comfort of the beautiful creatures, bringing along a shawl or sweater serves the purpose to comfort those who are afraid of a little chill (like myself) otherwise normal tees, shorts and sneakers would be comfortable.

I initially thought it was a strange request when my son suggested this venue to spend our day together with grandma as there's probably not much to be entertained with. We thought it would probably be a few short minutes but ended up spending more than two hours walking and enjoying each experience together. The visit could probably take another hour if we wanted to explore more but we had to adjourn to our other plan as we didn't expect our stay there to be long (great opportunity to return for another visit with new visitors!).

It was a three-generation family activity; grandma (active and loves adventure), two young adult children together with my husband and I. It was a great outing because everyone was mesmerized by the beauty of these creatures and how ""unreal"" they look, etc.

What a blessing! Thank you Management and Staff of River Safari Singapore for your effort in making our experience memorable on this special day! It was a beautiful experience for us!"
,,Not bad,4.0,,Not as good as the Singapore zoo . The main attraction are the pair of Pandas and Red Panda. Nothing much there.
,,I Liked this safari,4.0,,"Good to visit once, Due to renovation I get a chance to see only one panda. Inside this safari, there are two boat rides one in open lake and other is in man made river. I liked second one as it give chance to see many creatures. In other ride, you may or mayn't see animals. Both rides have tickets 5 or 10 SGD each. River safari ticket cost is 33 SGD (adult) & 28 for Child. this safari in open till 5:30 or 6:30 pm (not sure)."
,,River Safari and Night Zoo - elephant's constitution needed,3.0,,"I wouldn’t recommend the combined River Safari and Night Zoo tour – unless you have the constitution of an Asian elephant.

It is basically two tours and lasts 9 hours. The “saving” advertised by combining the two tours can only be in the transport cost - in that you are only transported once instead of twice to the location.

We went by bus from our hotel. There was a guide on board who had an American accent.

She so brow beat us with details (mostly unnecessary) in a loud voice that by the time we reached the destination we were thoroughly confused and our heads were spinning.

It would have been simple to say the tour was in two parts, we leave you first at the entrance of the River Safari with a map of the place and give a short address at the commencement. Instead we were lambasted with an over-load of detail which left us none-the wiser.

The River Safari is basically a series of acquariums and fresh-water displays of various animals and fish. There is a Giant Panda display – well one Panda on the day we went, the female was reportedly pregnant and must have had a headache. She didn’t appear. There are apparently ever only two at most despite being billed as S.E. Asia’a largest Panda display. I suppose that is fair enough when there are so few in the World.

There are two trips by electric-motor launch, one at each end of the place but for some parsimonious reason only 1 is included in your ticket. The other is $ 5 extra.

The boat trip we went on was far from impressive – no longer then 10 minutes – but we did glimpse a couple of elephants, two giraffe and a rhino in the distance.

The place was jungle-heat hot and humid. We lingered as long as we could at the Panda display which was Arctic cold - and heaven.

The Zoo by night tour started later in the evening. We had been to the zoo before. The heat and and humidity drove us over to the cab rank early – and home to the air-conditioned hotel. We didn’t go to the zoo.

Tragic."
,,A half a day venue,4.0,,The place is still the same as we visited before. This time we came during low seasob so there was no que anywhere. We could only see JiaJia diring our visit. But we get to taste the panda pao that we missed last time.
,,The best aquarium,5.0,,I like the concept of displaying various river animals from famous rivers in the world. The aquariums were big and fantastic. First time i'm watching a real life panda and dugong here. Please visit this place.
,,Came here for the red panda!,4.0,,"So we bought our tickets online to avoid the long ques and we're happy we did! The river safari has quite a bit to offer. It really showcases the different species existing in different ecos. You'll find yourself walking a lot to discover different settings that contain something to look at. Highlight for me was the red panda. Incredibly cute animal that was running around marking it's territory. Not to be missed as well is the panda! Unfortunately when we were there Kai Kai was sleeping. So try and make it a point to come earlier in the day when he gets fed! We also took the boat ride (would recommend the Amazon boat ride instead of the river boat ride as you get to see the jaguars and other animals. All in all, it was a great place to learn about the animal kingdom!"
,,staff retreat for school,3.0,,same concept as the hippo enclosure from the singapore zoo except that for river safari the concept applies throughout. it is just an attraction masked to house an expensive home for the donated pandas.
,,"A unique attraction, especially the panda",4.0,,"Creatures of water are usually in aquariums but not so often in a tour. This was a learning experience about creatures of water as well as ones that live in river based eco-systems.

The Panda is a special attraction. Got a glimpse of their eating, lazing. That was the best part.

The boat ride was cancelled. a disappointment. Over all a good experience."
,,New creatures,5.0,,"We came specifically to see the Pandas - and that was fabulous. But there are so many amazing creatures to see, we had totally underestimated the scale of this Safari. Magic for the kids with the giant aquariums, and the Amazon river trip is something else!!!"
,,World class,4.0,,"Very outstanding, clean, nice and wonderful experience. Good for family trip of all ages A bit costly."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"My husband and I paid tickets for the Zoo and river safari which was $124.
Walking around the river safari is nice and very informative.
But the bit that we were looking forward to was the boat ride. This is a 15 minute trip where we seen elephants and giraffes. This was most disappointing.
You can pay $5 per adult to do the amazon boat ride. This was much better."
,,Interesting,4.0,,The Safari is very good you walk through and see lots of animals Fish Sharks etc in a large Aquarium then squirrel monkey Forrest at the end of the trail you to the Giant Panda what an amazing animal. Then onto the river cruise at $5 a head i would not do that again you go in a large loop and not see much at all but a quite enjoyable experience
,,River Safari,5.0,,It's an Excellent place to visit with Family. Lots of Fish and Marine life to see.loved the Big Aquarium. The Boat ride was excellent but 15 minutes is very less for such a wonderful journey. Suggested 30 minutes.
,,Good experience,4.0,,"The place is very clean and well organised. You can't get lost, just go in and keep following the path. There are lots of animals and you can see most.

The only disappointing thing is the Amazon boat ride. Its quite fast to take photo's and most of the animal's are hidden. Obviously it's normal but seeing that you must pay extra for this it was disappointing.

The best experience were the panda's, omg they're sooo cutee."
,,Great way to spend the afternoon,5.0,,"Very well organised and clean attraction. Great range of animals to view, all of which looked happy and healthy. The giant pandas are of course the main attraction and are worthy of the visit alone. But the squirrel monkeys the crocodile and the manatees were all a highlight. The Amazon Riverquest was good but could have lasted a bit longer. Good choice of eating outlets at the entrance."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Eventhough its locaion quite far from the downtown, but once we get there, it was so amazing. They have giant panda, panda shop, and panda pou."
,,Hot and informative,3.0,,"All I can really remember from the trip is the heat and humidity. And the excitement of walking into the air conditioned area for the panda!

The panda showed a lot of action that day though, drawing a lot of excited crowd.

I really enjoy the information provided in this place."
,,Good but not great,4.0,,"Our family went here as we did not have time to do the full Singapore Zoo and we wanted to see the pandas. The price is $10 cheaper than the zoo but was still more than $120 for our whole family.

I can see why the zoo lent the pandas to the river safari as without them it would not be worth it.

One main feature was a boat ride. There are two - one a boat cruise around the river and another theme park ride around some larger animal enclosures. I found this ride disappointing as it felt so rushed. You cruise past animals like the leopards but only see them fleetingly for around 5 seconds. There is no opportunity to come back and see them - only visable from the boat and each trip costs money.

There is quite a get smaller exhibits (fish, birds, smaller annals) which are ok but the main features being the pandas, red pandas, manatees. The main thing we really enjoyed was the squirrel monkey enclosure getting up close to many.

Unless there is particular animals you want to see, I think it would be better to pay the extra money and go to the proper zoo next door. The night Safari is also much better."
,,"Awesome, one of the best zoos we've been to",5.0,,"This is a great place, well laid out to see the animals and marine life.. The Panda's were very active and put on a show which our little one loved.. will be getting the zoo pass and visiting the other locations too."
,,Singapore River Safari,4.0,,"If you want a stress-free, educational and fun day out with your young children, come visit the Singapore River Safari. It is a river-themed zoo and aquarium. It features fresh water fauna of great rivers like Mekong, Yang Tze, Mississippi, Nile, Ganges. Unlike the Zoo (adjacent), River Safari has covered walks so you dont have to worry about the Sun and the rain. This is where you also see 2 giant Pandas named Kai Kai and Jia Jia. My girls enjoyed the giant aquariums and the Amazon quest boat ride (tickets at $5 adult $3 child). They were also excited to see the giant otters that played in the water. You only need half a day or less to explore the park."
,,Decent place for a visit,3.0,,"Overall a nice place to visit, although not a must-visit place. Big Panda is the big attraction here. If you have visited SEA Aquarium, this place will not sound too great. However, since this is close to Singapore Zoo, it makes a good 'filler' in between Zoo and Night Safaris."
,,Cutest Panda,4.0,,"If you want to see the cutest panda, visit River Safari. My kids and I enjoyed seeing different kinds of sea creatures, too! Singapore Zoo, Night Safari + River Safari are attractions that you should not miss when you visit Singapore."
,,First visit to River Safari,4.0,,"This was my 1st trip with my family. Booked another senior citizen ($18) ticket for my mum. Senior citizen ticket is the cheapest of all categories. Booked oso the river cruise tickets. Enjoyed the sheltered walkway. Interesting new huge habitats for Manatees, panda, koala. Koalas were doing ""cat walk"" on the ground! Should have bought the cruise for the animals exhibits instead of the scenic cruise. The ticket counter staff did not giVe us good advice though. Overall, a nice place for a family outing."
,,Nice part of the Singapore wildlife showcase,4.0,,"Part of the ""trilogy"" of wild animal parks in Singapore along with the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. The River Safari is an interesting one themed around wildlife that lives in 6-7 major river ecosystems around the world such as Congo, Nile, Mississippi, Ganges, Amazon and more. The giant pandas are fantastic to observe. There are two boat rides, and I'd recommend the Amazon river ride. It could have been longer but it's as good as it gets, I suppose. Check the website for discounts and offers.

If you are selecting between the zoo and the River Safari, go with the zoo, it has more things to see and do."
,,Visit with teens,4.0,,This is a educational ride that we were enjoyed! There are so many information with pictures for us. We visited the zoo and it is much cooler at this place. We love the amazon river quest and the big fish aquarium.
,,River Safari,2.0,,"We were a bit disappointed with the River Safari. The description and the pictures lead you to believe that the River Safari is with a boat ride. Actually it is a walking tour of exhibits from different river ecosystems of the world. If you have been to Singapore Zoo/Aquarium, then River Safari is a bit of let down. The cost of the river safari is similar to ZOO, but the Zoo has different shows and interactive sessions for the kids/adults to make the visit memorable. River Safari does not have any of those.
There is a boat ride in the park which is not included in the ticket. You have to purchase that separately. We felt it was hyped and did not deliver to the expectations :("
,,Nice change of pace,4.0,,"We arrived at approximately 4pm as we planned to do the 7:15pm Night Safari. Timing worked out very well for us. No queues, no crowds, we got to see everything without any stress or hurry. We had taken our time here and still finished by 6:30pm and got in line for the Night Safari. The River Safari Cruise itself only goes for about 15 minutes -was really relaxing and lovely (however my 2 teenage boys felt it was average) a would have been better if the cruise went for longer.

This part of the zoo mainly focusses on water species - very interesting and lovely aquarium.

They also have 2 pandas which was definitely the highlight of the visit here - they are sooooooooooo beautiful!!!

We caught a taxi here which was far cheaper and convenient for us (staying near Orchard Rd).

Recommend and would visit again."
,,Give it a miss!,1.0,,River safari is not worth. It is neither a zoo nor an aquarium. Better to do Singapore Zoo + Sentosa Aquarium
,,Water creatures,4.0,,"River Safari focuses on species that lives in water. There are a lot of varieties available to see. Aside from this, the panda bears are also located here. They have a boat ride also which you can enjoy. The area is not as big as Singapore Zoo but it is a very nice place to visit too."
,,Fantastic,4.0,,Having been to the night safari and the zoo I was curious to see the river safari and I was not dissapointed I enjoyed the nice calm pace of the displays. The only thing that was a little dissapointing was the Amazon ride this should be included in the price not an added extra .It was a warm day and some of the monkeys were not visible which I understand. But the giant pandas are a great sight to see and are well worth the visit in themselves.
,,Quite disappointing,3.0,,"Aside for some big fish, and the two pandas (if you're lucky to see them), not much of an experience. I would not recommend the amazon boat ride. We saw two monkeys from afar and it was so quick that we saw the jaguars for a few seconds. It's a bit of a rip off."
,,Great Day out for the Family,4.0,,"The River Safari is located next to the Singapore Zoo, adjacent to the Upper Seletar Reservoir. To begin with, the complex begins with a walk along covered areas with displays of habitat depicting various rivers of the world like the Amazon, Mekong etc. There is an interesting selection of Fish, reptiles and amphibians.
Some where along the winding exhibit is the giant Panda enclosure where you can see 2 Giant Pandas. There are also a couple of Red Pandas. Both make good photographic subjects.
We broke for lunch at Mama Panda, a Chinese fast food. this was a real disappointment.
The boat ride was a short 15 min cruise of the reservoir where we saw a couple of giraffes and elephants. Not much to talk about.
As we headed towards the exit we entered a huge airconditioned area housing various fish and a large aquarium.
Great place for young kids with lots of different things to see. Of particular note is the place is wheel chair friendly."
,,More about Pandas than rivers.,3.0,,"Actually a bit of a disappointment. Fairly basic aquatic displays, short ""boat "" ride during which you don't see a lot and the standard tourist fare. The highlight attraction seems to be the pandas on display that are on loan....what they have to do with any river I'm not sure? We came as part of a package including ""Night Safari"" , if I had made the effort for just his I would've been unhappy."
,,Best way to watch fish,3.0,,"Has one of the biggest aquariums in Singapore with walrus and other beautiful species of sea animals but it does not only contain that also reptiles and kinds of monkeys, the cat family and specially unique pandas that pose brilliantly for a picture"
,,Customer service,4.0,,"I went to river safari singapore on 25 Dec 2016 with my family. We took the Amazon Quest boat ride n when i was about to leave the place i realised i had left my son's water bottle around the area i was at earlier. I sought the assistance of the staff, Mariana. She was so patient and understanding. She went to the extent of back tracking with me to where i had started just to find the water bottle. It was a long journey but she did not give up. At last we found the water bottle. Kudos to river safari for having a staff like her!"
,,River Safari- Singapore,5.0,,"River Safari - Singapore
One of the must visits when in Singapore
- Compulsory Visit if with children :)
- Can spend hours walking around
- Pandas . YAY
- Aircon areas in between - So no worries about weather being hot
- Eating options

Can spend whole day if you wish
else keep 2-3 hours minimum ."
,,Only to see pandas,2.0,,"This river safari is created for ppl to see pandas only - nothing else worth mentioning. We finished the whole park in 2 hours time, since the boat ride was suspended as well. It was very expensive to pay for a ticket that last you for 2 hours tour only, moreover boat ride is chargeable as well. Apart of seeing some fishes in their tanks, the pandas would be the main attraction. However, you need to be lucky to see them as they will spend most of their time sleeping, unless you don't mind wait for them to wake up - could be hours! Paying the full price ticket just to see the pandas is really NOT worth it, I think. But if you are a panda lover then it would be different story."
,,It's an aquarium with short boat rides!,2.0,,"The title is quite misleading. I initially thought that it is a journey through the river. Actually it consists of three parts.
1. Walk through an aquarium, a Panda enclosure. This covers the 85% of the animals in River Safari. You can find different sections in the aquariums belonging to rivers like Nile, Ganga, Congo etc.
2. 15 mins boat ride in a lake. (River Safari Cruise - Charged extra)
This is a very boring boat ride. You may see Giraffe and Elephant during the ride. (From the zoo area). Not recommended.
3. 10 mins boat ride through a simulated amazon river surroundings. (Amazon River Quest - Charged extra)
This covers the remaining 15% of the animals. A very short ride and not recommended for the ticket price.

Other details:

1. River safari is 2 mins walk from the Singapore Zoo. Popular route is bus 198 from Ang Mo Kio terminal.
2. Camera can be used at all places. Be sensitive not to use flash whenever instructed
3. Do not disturb pandas by making noise
4. Pandas may not be seen if sleeping in some corner
5. River Cruise and Amazon River Quest may be cancelled if it rains
6. Buy Park hopper 4 in 1 ticket (Bird Park, Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari) online and save money and time. Present ticket through mobile. No print copy required.
7. Food and drinks are expensive. Bring your own to save money.

You may skip the river safari if visiting SEA aquarium in Sentosa and the Singapore Zoo. It is a repeat except for Panda."
,,Decent zoo with lots of fishes and panda,3.0,,"Attractions will be Jia Jia and Kai Kai. Have catch both their glimpses in large air con room. Have shelter so even if rains also no worries. Showcase lots of fishes from different rivers throughout the world. If u have not been, can go visit lovely panda. Normally I will go zoo and river safari on same day to save on expensive parking fees. Good place for visitors and tourists."
,,Pandas,4.0,,"Did this as a park hopper with the zoo. This is the newest attraction after the zoo and night safari and the planners considered Singapore's tropical and wet climate, hence the whole park is fully sheltered (great for rainy day). In my opinion, the greatest attraction is the pandas (I only see one up close). It may be good on its own, but if you visit immediately after the zoo, you may not be wowed by the experience. Nevertheless, seeing the panda is definitely worth the price paid for the entrance tickets."
,,Saw the adorable panda,5.0,,At same place with singapore zoo. I would recommend going here together with singapore zoo in one day. They have the panda. The kids enjoyed it.
,,Good for Family Activity but Not Very Exciting,3.0,,"As with anything else in Singapore, the River Safari is well designed, carefully thought of, attraction.
Cleanliness, decoration theme, and supporting facilities (i.e. toilet, walking path, restaurants, etc.), come naturally adequate and well maintained.
The highlight of the park will be the Red Panda and the Giant Panda.

On the down side, the size of the whole park and also of the individual displays are quite small, combined with the number of visitors, it can really feels cramped.
With the amount of fish being promoted put inside such small aquariums, it really kills the excitement (in exception for 1 big aquarium where the manatees are).
The Optional Add-On River Cruise while doesn't cost much and give you that relaxing stroll along the actual river, is a merely 10-minutes sit with nothing much to see but trees (and giraffe and elephant in far distance, belonging to the zoo).

Overall, given the remote location and the amount of time required to reach it (using public transport, you must take MRT combined with bus trip), it's only worth to go if you have plenty of time to kill in Singapore.
Perhaps if combined with the Zoo and Night Safari (also been there on different occasions) it will worth the time, but then the ticket cost might not worth it.

Visiting River Safari with my 2-years old daughter does make good experience for her, but really nothing exciting for myself."
,,If you like animals you will enjoy this place,5.0,,"It will take nearly an hour or two to see all the animals. We can see Panda, red panda, different type of fishes, monkeys, polar bear etc. finally we travelled in the Cruise ,it was just a 15 minutes but you will really enjoy it."
,,"It's not the animals, but the environment, that is worth being there",3.0,,"I have not stepped foot into River Safari ever since it was opened in 2012. I went only because my children have been asking if they can go to the zoo, and to look at animal exhibits.

If there is one good thing about River Safari, it is that there is space for people to walk, run and enjoy themselves in nature. Yes, there are animals to see, including the red pandas and giant pandas, which I have never seen before. There are also fun things to do, like taking a cruise and a boat ride, and posing for photos with animal statues. But for me, I like the natural setting, and the opportunity to take scenic pictures of Mandai area. Not something I get to do on a daily basis.

What I don't really like is the implicit idea that everything you want to see or do costs money. For example, you pay $5 for a river cruise. You pay to keep the photos the staff take for you (at the main entrance and just before the panda exhibits). There are booths placed strategically to get you thinking whether you want to part with you money (like cafe outlets, photo booths). It's probably the tourist mentality that will get you to part with your money (which I did). But somehow I just don't like the idea of income generation in every part of River Safari. Just too commercial for me."
,,Place to see giant pandas,5.0,,"Do this instead of the Zoo - we took public transport to here and the Zoo, river Safari and night safari are all beside each other - the river trip is great and it skirts around the zoo so you see a the animals there as well - follow it up with the night safari and you will have got the best two of the three - at the end take one of the five dollar private coaches back to the hotel area - no need to pre book."
,,Normal place to visit,3.0,,River Safari is just a normal place with not much animals unlike ZOO. Its took about 2 to 3 hours or even 1.5 hours to finish the whole journey. Nothing much to comments. Just an average place.
,,Not as exciting as the zoo,3.0,,"Most of the area inside is indoors. It is a small area compared to the zoo. If you have time for only one to visit, stick to the zoo. Not much choices for food at all. I think younger kids would find the zoo more exciting."
,,River Safari will feel great if you enjoy it for cheap tickets,5.0,,"River Safari will feel great if you enjoy it for cheap tickets. This is not a great place like Singapore zoo but Ok to visit once. Rides are not that great.

But if you manage to get cheap or free tickets from travel agents or qoo10.sg then definitely visit there to have some nice clicks.

So go ahead and visit River Safari asap ...."
,,First class viewing experience with air conditioned comfort,5.0,,"This is a relatively new extension to the Singapore Zoo, and I am very impressed with the modern facilities and cleanliness. It is a breeze for those with young children, as the sheltered and air conditioned walk ways and viewing areas are well maintained with proper (air conditioned) rest rooms.

The place is very educational for young children and the place is safe for them to roam around - galleries are enclosed with railings and carpeted walkways.

There's a couple of restaurants at the end of the attraction, reasonably priced too."
,,Walking with nature,4.0,,"Spend half a day here with nature and get to see exotic fishes, panda and monkey. Find out first the feeding time and plan your tour to your preference."
,,Nice to visit,4.0,,"Walking required. Personally i kinda like it as its away from the city crowd. Purchase your tickets online as there might be some discount (compare prices whilst u are there. There is free wifi so u can purchase them at the counter).

Lots of photo taking opportunities. However, please skip the cruise (both of them). Its S$5 per person but its a complete waste of time and money."
,,Poor food standard,1.0,,"All the food:Panda paus, fried dumplings and coffee we ordered from the Panda Mama Restaurant were cold. This wasnt the case when we visited the River Safari in 2014. We were expecting at least warm food and were sadly disappointed."
,,A very good place to enjoy nature with family.,5.0,,Our family visit Singapore Zoo and Jurong Birdpark a few times a year. Yet I didn't expect River Safari to be as good as the 2 famous parks. Large Aquariums and Pandas are obvious attractions but the scenery is outstanding as well. While River Safari doesn't have water playground but our kids can appreciate the nature and animal kingdom better.
,,A little suprised,4.0,,"So I am not a big fan of zoos, or animal parks but the river safari is very good. It is a very nice and calm place to walk around and see the animals. I think we where there for around about 5 hours. Loved loved see the giant panda and the red panda. It was something good I was not expecting it to be. Seeing all the different fish and marine animals good too. We did do the river boat trip at an extra cost, it went for less than 20 mins,fun little ride don't get scared of you hear people screaming there is really nothing scary in the ride. Totally recommend checking it out l."
,,Enlightening,5.0,,"As we have been to Singapore a few times & seen many of the sights, this was new to us & seemed interesting. We weren't disappointed, as was educational, even for an adult, interesting too, with typically beautiful Singaporean gardens and greenery. Would highly recommend this tour for young & old."
,,A Unique experience,4.0,,"The wide varieties of animals species made it one of the ""must go"" tourist attraction in Singapore. Young children get excited with the giant creatures such as crocodiles, big fishes,giant stingray etc in the aquarium setting. the different theme based on the different river around the world made this place unique traveling experience. Although it look weird that the giant panda were placed at river safari instead of zoo, nevertheless we enjoyed it very much."
,,Entertaining afternoon,4.0,,"The first stop on our list; good to go here before the night safari. The only thing we didn't plan for was the exhibitions closing before the park actually does, so check this first. Sadly we missed out on the pandas, but the squirrel monkey exhibit made up for it! This was interesting- you can walk through their cage and watch them jump the trees above you! The exhibits of the 7 rivers were great, although not as vast as I imagined. Still as great way to see a lot at once, and the safari itself was a nice way to relax after the walk"
,,Manatees <3,4.0,,"I came here to see the pandas up close. Unfortunately, only had the chance to see Kai Kai. Jia Jia was in another area and we could only see her from the live video.

Didn't expect that animals other than pandas would steal my attention here: Manatees. There is a very very big aquarium with many many cute manatees here which has captivated me. Totally in love with this animal!

Had a panda bun at the restaurant/ cafe there. The bun was really cute. But taste wise, not really special.

Hope they will open more animal exhibit and attractions, because the value for money is not so good for the amount of exhibits and attractions they have now.

And hopefully they can provide more buses from more areas in Singapore."
,,The Safari was very useful to me,4.0,,I was impressed by the way this place is organised. It is no doubt an attraction to those who wish to explore the creatures under the sea. I've experience both Amazon River Quest and River Cruise and I prefer the first one. I will try the Night Safari next time.
,,"Like an aquarium, but not really",4.0,,"The River Safari is Wildlife Reserve's latest attraction. It's like a zoo and an aquarium mixed together, and is definitely worth a look.

It's quite compact, and can easily be finished (if you walk briskly and traffic is moderate) within 90 mins, and will take 3 hours tops if you stop for their feeding sessions and for meals. There are no trams or animal shows in the River Safari. There are two boat rides, one is the Amazon River Quest and the other is the River Cruise. Both require additional tickets.

The place is sheltered, and there are some fully A.Ced areas where you can seek refuge from the tropical heat. The park is literally just one long pathway, so you wouldn't have to worry about losing your way or your group. It is also stroller and wheelchair friendly.

There are some interesting creatures to see, like the pandas, the giant mekong catfish and the manatees. I was also very excited to see the giant anteater on the Amazon River Quest (a boat ride with some shallow drops, thus the height limit). They've just opened a touch pool (mid Nov'15), where you can come up close with sea stars, sea cucumbers and the horseshoe crab.

There is a restaurant in the park, the panda buns are a novelty and some snack stations and drink vending machines along the way. You can bring your own food in but there are not many points to really sit and eat. The food is not halal certified although the staff informed us that the food is prepared using halal sources. I recall seeing only one water fountain.

If you had a day to spend, consider doing the River Safari together with the Zoo OR Night Safari. If you could only do one, while the River Safari has some novel creatures, it is not as diverse as the zoo. Still a fun outing for the whole family :)

It's easiest to go there by cab or private transport, but there are some shuttles from the city that would be a cheaper option if there's only 2 of you. For the cheapest tickets, I've always found that buying direct (airlines, hotels) is best but some travel agencies might have good bundled prices. Other than buying from the ticket counters, there are iPads set up where you can buy your own tickets and get a credit card discount."
,,Different kind of zoo,4.0,,"This attraction offer the river ecosystem. The interesting one is the flooded Amazon ecosystem where there is big aquarium filled with giant fish, including dugong. I've tied the Amoson quest ride which we travel with boat to see some of the animals found in Amazon forest. The ride is interesting but too short for me. The other attraction that also interesting is to see red pand and giant panda."
,,The zoo and night safari is better,2.0,,"It takes around 2 hours to do everything and a taxi ride there is under $25. If it's raining the river cruise and river quest rides get suspended so don't buy your tickets to those attractions in advance.

I bought tickets to the river cruise and it immediately started raining for the rest of the day so we couldn't do it or the river quest. The otters and pandas were cool but overall there wasn't much to see. The zoo and night safari are much better, the river safari is skippable."
,,good place for family holiday,4.0,,"Kids love the safari experience and animals especially the panda
Smart idea with the panda cafe serving panda bun and coffee. Take the kids there for a break
The only dissapointing items for us when we went there, it was cloudy and stormy and they cancelled the boat ride. So it is wise to call them prior to visiting especially on cloudy day to make sure that the boats are in operation."
,,River safari,4.0,,"This is the second time I have been to this zoo. The first time not all the zoo was opened. I really enjoyed this zoo my favourite was the pandas and the Amazon boat ride, will go again with my family."
,,River-themed wild life park,5.0,,"Said to be Asia's first and only river-themed wild life park, this newest addition to Wildlife Reserves Singapore portfolio, is home to thousands of giant pandas, stingrays, squirrel monkeys, prowling jaguar, fresh water aquarium that re-creates the Amazon forest during its rainy season. Awesome experience!"
,,Rivers intro,4.0,,"The variety of fish from various places is informative. Take time to see the enclosures. The highlight was the red panda. As it was raining, the ride was closed off. Do arrive early to enjoy that as well."
,,"Pandas, hedgehog, and lots of fish",4.0,,"Visited on a rainy week day. No crowds so we didn't have to queue for any of the attractions. Buy your tickets online for more discounts. Free admission for Singapore citizens and permanent residents if you visit on your birthday.
Amazon River Quest boat ride costs $5 for adults, ride was short but quite entertaining, and we didn't get wet so don't bother getting ponchos. Both River Quest and River Safari rides are weather dependent, so it's best to purchase your boat ride tickets just before boarding because no refunds will be given if rides are cancelled due to bad weather. Most parts of the park are sheltered so we were able to see most of the attractions despite the rain. Don't miss the African hedgehog encounter at 3pm, just outside the panda enclosure. Cutest tiny albino hedgehog I've ever seen."
,,Panda:-D,4.0,,First time go here still not many animal seconds time way much better. I seen real Panda nice experience.
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"With only half day to spare we chose to do the River safari (instead of zoo or night safari) and were certainly not disappointed.

We had the opportunity to see the animals according to their habitat: From the Amazon to Ganges display with the species found in that area."
,,great experience,5.0,,"Great new zoo full of really great aquariums featuring huge manatees & other cool exhibits like Giant Pandas. I have a mobility issue but this did not hamper my experience as I was able to hire a free wheelchair. I could even go on the amazon boat ride which was a lot of fun but it could have gone a bit slower to give you more time to view the particular animals in this zone.
Overall a lot of good old fashioned fun."
,,Nice and educational place,4.0,,"It's a nice place to just walk around and look at the animal. You can see some of the animals that you never see before (not even on tv). Too bad we only saw Kai Kai the panda and the other one (Jia Jia) might be relaxing in her executive lounge :). We didn't try the restaurant there but did visit their retail shop to buy some small merchandise. The boat ride was a bit dissapointing, not because we need to pay additional ticket, but because i feel that the boat move too fast and we unable to enjoy the journey as well as spot all the animals along the ride since the enclosure located opposite each other, so when you try to spot animal on your right, you will miss the one on your left. It's just dissapointing, specially since we don't come during peak period, it's great if they can slow down the boat so that we can see more of the animal."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The Singaporeans known how to showcase aquarium animals. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the pandas were visible , so to the manatees which were highlights for me. We were lucky to go on a week day and had no crowds to deal with. It is mostly under cover so would not matter when you went.
As with all of Singapore it is clean and well thought out. The only disappointment were the river cruise where you really don't see much, and the Amazon experience where the little boat goes way to fast to actually see or appreciate any of the animals - all that seem to live in small quarters."
,,Absolutely disappointing.,2.0,,"Ive been to the night safari n zoo (though not recent) but by far river safari is a major let down. I felt like i was just visiting some aquarium. To begin with, the design seems weird. Most of the time, the animals are hidden. The display signs of the animals are confusing. There's a few kinds of animals in an area but the sign doesn't explain them all.

I didn't understand why we had to pay extra for the cruise only to see 'borrowed' view of elephants and giraffes from the zoo. (Yes, u pay sgd5 just to look at giraffes n elephants that are sitting in the opposite zoo from a cruise) and you have to play another sgd5 for another river ride. The River ride was too fast you couldn't hardly see any animals. Overall, perhaps good for very young kids and old folks friendly. But I was expecting something on par with the zoo or night safari.
Will not visit again."
,,Hyped off,3.0,,"By the name it feels that u will be on river. But thats not true. River ride is only for 10 mn . Rest its more like underwater world. If less time, u can easily skip it."
,,A great exhibition of the greatest rivers of the world :),5.0,,"A well-organized park with two sides separated by water in between, this is where you'll get to learn about the greatest rivers of the world with the creatures typically found in those rivers displayed in big glass tanks here (some really big taking up the whole wall on one side of the room like at the Mekong area) and some information about people's lives around the rivers nicely presented by means of things like some Mark Twain audio, the Canadian nickel & a beaver hat and some model log cabins at the Mississippi River area and things like the step-by-step process of rice growing in the Mekong delta at the ""Mekong River area"".

On the left side of the water are the areas for the Mississippi, the Congo, the Nile, the Ganges, the Mekong and the Yangtze in that order; just after the Yangtze is the Giant Panda Forest with two beautiful pandas (kept in separate rooms), I was especially impressed by the second panda which I believe was a female that put up a great show walking around and eating bamboos and such; and after the pandas is a polar bear tank where I was lucky to see a big polar bear swimming which you may or may not see depending on where the bear is (apparently, it's a pretty big tank that maybe even connected to the Singapore Zoo nearby!)

The right side of the water is all ""Amazon-themed"" consisting of the Amazon River Quest boat ride along a man-made canal-like waterway resembling the Amazon River with the creatures of the river such as monkeys, wild pigs, flamingos and even jaguars (all in a natural setting except jaguars which are behind glass) to be seen on the 'river banks', the Squirrel Monkey Forest with a big Anaconda snake in a glass tank at the entrance, and the Amazon Flooded Forest with a REALLY huge glass tank containing manatees (which I interestingly learned there are relatives of elephants!) and a fairly realistic display of an Amazon flooded forest with two model houses (one on each end of the display area behind glass) and huge tree trunks half buried in water between the two houses.

Also, there's actually something to do ""from"" the right side (which otherwise is all ""Amazon-themed"" as mentioned above) of the water separating the two parts of the park, and that something is the River Safari Cruise for about 15 minutes in the waters adjacent to the River Safari land with animals like giraffes & elephants on land to be seen from the boat.

Coming by MRT, the station to get off is Choa Chu Kang (red line) where you'll have to get on the bus (can find out the bus number on the River Safari website) on the far side of the bus terminal adjacent to the MRT, and the bus ride from the MRT to the River Safari takes about half an hour. Also to do here (according to your budget of time and money) besides this are Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari, and they actually have ""combo tickets"" at special prices."
,,Beautiful place to visit,3.0,,"There are many big fish and animal such as jaguar. However, sometimes you cannot see them as they go to sleep go hiding somewhere."
,,very interesting place /1,4.0,,"Came down for the Safari Boo event for my children . Not disappointing at all ! very pleases with the event, only bad thing is the humidity of the place especially now is the haze period affecting Singapore. Overall nice experience with the cool exhibits shown"
,,"Pandas! Ok, when you have extra time",3.0,,"We did not plan on visiting this part, but the combo offer was interesting and since the bus ride out into the boondocks took so long, we wanted to see as much as possible. On first entrance, it appeared deserted ... they told us also upon entry (but I doubt after any chance to get money back) that this one ride attraction they have is currently down. SO, we followed the path and enjoyed a quick glimpse at a shy panda and then enjoyed the rather brief and not very spectacular 'cruise' ... Not a highlight, but when there, why not ..."
,,Worth for the Pandas,3.0,,"I loved the Panda!! That was the main reason why I went..although the only panda that was outside was sleeping and he was on his own. Was wondering where the others were..?

We also were on the little boat that drove us around a bit..too short unfortunately and the animals were mostly hiding :( But great idea..the boat should go a bit slower so that you get the chance to look around a bit better.

Rest of the river safari was nice and interesting - but when it comes to fish the SEA Aquarium is much nicer."
,,Safari boo,4.0,,"We are regular here with 15min drive fro home and a zoo friend plus member. The Hallowe'en theme event this year are excellent for local young childrens. If you are foreign visitors, the panda and manatee are the highlights. Give the boat ride a miss. It does not provide a proper view for most of the animals. Pity that they relocate my favorite Jaguar from zoo to the boat ride."
,,can give it a miss!,2.0,,If you are checking out to buy the park hopper ticket in Singapore. Just go for Jurong Bird Park and Night Safari. You could easily give a miss to the River Safari and Singapore Zoo.
,,If time constraint avoid it,3.0,,"MOst of the animals on the boat ride are visible in Zoo, so avoid it. There are aquariums inside which are ok but if you visit SEA aquarium then this is nothing."
,,A must visit!,5.0,,"Even though the Amazon river cruise was closed for maintenance this must be on any visit to Singapore. The aquatic exhibits are first class. One Panda on display, the female on closed circuit. Cafe had good food choices. Worth a full day with Zoo as well."
,,A Safari of its kind!,5.0,,"We took the river safari when we were there in Singapore for almost 10 days. We had plenty of time. In this, you ride a boat, they lift the boat to a height and then allow it to move with the force of gravity in water. While moving, you can see the animals and birds on either side."
,,Great viewing opportunities,5.0,,"Our visit to the River Safari was a pleasant experience made even more special by the antics of a panda. Only the male came out to strut his stuff...the female chose to be shy and retiring but she was visible on cctv. The aquariums house multiple fish of all shapes and sizes. Some are enormous.
The only disappointing thing was that the boat trip was cancelled due to thunderstorms so plan your journey for a fine day (if that's possible in Singapore!)"
,,Excellent,5.0,,A great place made even better by the pandas. One was being a bit lazy but the other was eating and wandering around exploring. Extremely well done with great staff
,,'Pandamania',5.0,,"If you are expecting this to be on a Par with Singapore Zoo you will be disappointed as there are not very many interesting exhibit unless your a fish fan. The River Cruise is ok for small children. The Amazon Safari is a Disney themed ride and a nice way to see the animals in their habitat. When we went to visit the Pandas, One was sleeping and the other was missing. We went back in the afternoon and it was worth it to see the Pandas up, eating and generally having fun. A memorial experience."
,,Went for the Pandas,4.0,,"A beautiful environment. Wasn't disappointed. Only 1 Panda out and he was a delight to watch... Eating, playing, scratching. A great display all around enjoyed every part of the zoo ... Including the Panda Cappucino 😊"
,,One of the best safari in the world,5.0,,"Singapore has done well for our zoo and Safari in many ways. Yes, I'm a Singaporean but I have to say we have one of the best zoos in the world.

First, the exhibits are well maintain and clean. The animals are well fed and you can view the feeding daily. *Do note that some animals eat only once per week. I went on a Saturday and I got to view most feeding sessions from 9.30am onwards. Plus, the feeding sessions come with a guided tour by the zookeeper, so you will know what and when the animals eat.

Second, river ferry and boat ride are enjoyable. Sit back and relax. Enjoy the quiet and beautiful reservoir while on the ferry. See the giraffes and elephants housed near the zoo and night safari too. After the ferry ride, check out the boat ride. The ride is about 10min and it takes you close up to some beautiful animals. The river ferry and boat ride are chargable.

Third, not to miss out the stars of the river safari, the red panda and both pandas Jia Jia and Kai Kai. Be sure to stay for awhile to check out some panda actions... Like when they roll down the slope or chew some bamboos.

Well, you will definitely enjoy it and take more pictures."
,,Quite nice and clean,4.0,,"Most people come by to visit the two pandas. Other animals / exhibits are nice and well maintained too. We enjoyed the river cruise too (not included in the tickets' price). Do try the panda buns sold at the restaurant or some kiosk, the buns are quite nice."
,,Visit the Pandas,4.0,,"Meet the 2 pandas from China.They are housed in a special climate controlled enclosure. Be prepared for not much action though, as they are either sleeping or lazing around. Check for their feeding time, when they may wake up to feed."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Extremely well planned taking you through different rivers of the world. Very informative. All exhibits excellently looked after. Fish tanks very clean. Panda enclosure very good, but I think Hong Kong enclosure better. Walked round twice. Very enjoyable day. The short boat ride around the lake peaceful. The manatees had a calf."
,,Entertaining for the kids,5.0,,"We visited with 4 kids and it was a great venue to spend a day on the outskirts of Singapore. The underwater viewing at the end was absolutely amazing, and my kids was just gazing at the manatees for half an hour.. Would recommend."
,,A morning of delight viewing nature fauna,5.0,,"The River Safari is a great family entertainment consisting of seeing various animals such as a playful polar bear, panda bears and a rare red panda among other creatures as well as fishes from various continents such as piranhas, manatees, Amazon rainforest animals, most spectacular was the jaguar. There is a ride that costs $5 SD for adults &3 for children called Amazon River Quest over water that is worth the money. There is sufficient food concession to meet any food desire."
,,Good Place - pandas are a must-see,4.0,,"After doing the zoo which is great, this was a bit of a come down in comparison - but only in comparison. Having said that, myself and family (2 children, 5 and 11) loved the pandas, and the Amazon boat ride (slight grumble that you have to pay extra for this). It is definitely worth doing if you have time after the zoo though."
,,Could Be Better,3.0,,"There is a lot of good things here, but I would have liked to have seen more of the animals that live close to the rivers without having to pay extra for the Amazon for example."
,,Must see for the Pandas,5.0,,The Panda's in Singapore are not in the Zoo but the River Safari near the zoo. At 1st we were disappointed that we had to visit a 3rd Zoo. There are some nice exhibits including a covered Monkey enclosure you can walk through. Be careful as they may poop on you. 1st time we saw the Pandas one was indoors (she is pregnant) and one asleep. Later they were both out and about and it was pretty amazing.... worth the admission price for sure. Can get some brilliant pictures. You must go!
,,Not as impressive as it can be,3.0,,"We went on the Night Safari and the River Safari on different days. The Night Safari was excellent but the River Safari was not as good. You get to see the pandas, which is cool but that is really about it. The Amazon River Quest was good but short. The River Cruise, on the other hand, was a complete waste of time and money.
Overall, I am not sure why the River Safari needs to be separate to the Singapore Zoo. A separate price of admission hardly seems justified."
,,Love it!,4.0,,"The park provides you a different kind of aquarium cause definitely its a fresh water kind of tanks! Many weird and never seen before animals.

The biggest aquarium really catch your breath away.. This park also is not that packed compared to sea aquarium. The pandas are not really cute as they only sleep and hide. So make sure you dont just wanna see the pandas, it maybe dissapoints you.

At first i expect it would be hot but turns out i was wrong, there are roofs all over the parks so you wont get tanned :p

However, the amazon quest (with additional s$ 5 for the ticket) are not really worth the money. The rides move so fast you cant even take a while to see the animals. And so sad to see cheetah in such small spaces...

But in my opinion, this zoo is worth one visit only and they should update the tanks with more and weirder animals to add more value and make the guests want to come back."
,,A lovely refreshing walk,4.0,,If you are at the zoo then walk next door to the River Safari. Its a nice refreshing walk around - with a lot of the walk being either across the water or just near the water. Interesting to see the fish and other water animals and a bonus to see the Pandas .. There is even a boat ride and a small amusement type ride as well.
,,MUST MUST SEE!,5.0,,"First off, Singapore is the perfect example of what a country should be like. Visited with friends from Trinidad recently and only had one afternoon, was it was a long transit stop to NYC. On the recommendation of the taxi driver, no less, we decided to do the River Safari, which is immediately adjacent to the Singapore Zoo. Everything, from the layout, to the attractions was perfect. Very educational and informative. The displays are extremely well designed and the highlight, the pandas, were incredible. The only downside, which is no fault of the Safari curators, was the haze over the city, which rendered the air quality poor and which had to force the shutdown of one of the open air cruises. Otherwise, highly recommended!"
,,Panda enclosure closes before 6pm....sucks,2.0,,"As Friends of the river safari and zoo I am very disappointed to hear that I can't see the Panda till 6pm. Today we waited till after the showers and we were there by 5.20pm to be told Panda enclosure is already closed. When it is mentioned that River Safari is open till 6pm and Zoo till 6pm. So that means there is no point coming later in the day to visit as there will not be anything to view. The river safari does not have much else besides amazon boat ride where you pay extra to see the Jaguars and then the Red Panda and Giant pandas..which are the highlight...so today with my 2 niece's just starting their school holidays we did not get to do either as by the time we walked to the Amazon boat ride it was closed due to inclement weather and then we walked to the Panda enclosure to be told it was already closed.....it is very disappointing visit.
So I guess you can see anything in the last hour at the River Safari?"
,,Educative,5.0,,"It's a wonderful place to take school going kids. Not only is it educative, it is also fun filled and very informative. The place is divided into zones and it gives an in depth knowledge of that particular place. The giant fish tank is one sight not be missed. Children will be glued to this attraction for hours. It's so breath taking. The next attraction is the red panda. It's in an open cage along with giant panda. My girls loved the boat ride. Overall it was great fun for the whole family."
,,so many to see so little time,4.0,,"We scheduled our trip here for only 2-3hours, turn out you need to spend more than 4-5 hours here..so many things to see, all well maintained and well prepared.
The fish tank, aquarium, river history and the highlight perhaps the Panda Dome, both of the Pandas looks so cute and calm. The river cruise and amazon ride only took 10-15 minutes each and most of the animal seems to lazy to showed up. However, this is totally worth your visit and surely will entertain and educate the kids."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"This was a great way to spend an afternoon - even though we got soaked by a thunderstorm on the boat ride! Each exhibit is well presented and the highlights are the giant pandas, otters and manatees. The manatees are absolutely worth the price of admission alone."
,,A must do in singapore,5.0,,"This place was the highlight of our trip. Simply amazing. Very well organised, Staff were very helpful and everything about the place was just superb. When going to the park there are two boat cruises. One is the river safari and is more of a scenic tour and the other is the amazon which has animal's in it (recommend)."
,,River wildlife and other attractions,5.0,,"You get to see Pandas, Red panda and lots of freshwater reptiles, fishes and animals. The Pandas belong to China and will return to their motherland in 2021."
,,More than we expected,5.0,,"We found this to be a very pleasant morning looking at the various animal exibits, relaxing ride on the water and the little boat ride through the animals, they are so close. One of the Pandas was in its sleeping area but thats couldn't be helped. We had no idea about the size of the aquariums, that was a surprise, in particular the massive Mantees that we watched feeding. Overall we found it very well organised and worth the trip out to the zoo. The total admission also included a $5.00 voucher to spend at the shop."
,,What a Shame!!,2.0,,"An awful shame! Very nice facilities brought down by awful customer service!

My wife & I pre-purchased tickets to all three of their parks (River Safari, the Zoo, and the Night Safari) online before we left home. It was expected to be a highlight of our trip. Put simply- If you are short on time, or do not have very flexible travel plans- DO NOT PRE-PURCHASE TICKETS! The discount is not worth the lack of flexibility they provide.

We spent $100 on the pre-purchased tickets! My wife & I avidly visit zoos all over the world, but have NEVER spent that kind of money on a zoo facility in one shot (the only thing that comes close is the San Diego Zoo & Safari- our favorites in the world- which we did on two separate visits).

So, its damn expensive. Therefore expectations are high. And, I have to say, it was worth it for the first hour of our visit. But, then it started raining (pouring actually)- and we had only visited a PORTION of 1 out of the 3 parks. So- we went to customer service to confirm that we could come back to see the other two parks another day. We were told no.

No. No way, not a chance. The only day we could return was 8 days away (we were going to Malaysia for a week the next morning) and you have to visit all 3 parks within 7 days with the pass we purchased. Nobody would make an exception- not customer service, a manager, nobody... the fact that we were only there for an hour, and had only seen part of 1 out of 3 parks didn't seem important to them at all. And they were rude about it, as if we were ridiculous for asking to use our $100 purchase on a day it wasn't pouring! So- that was upsetting... but we sucked it up and just trudged on in the pouring rain.

But- the worst was yet to come... even though we toughed it up and were willing to (and did) explore the parks in the pouring rain, the MAIN ATTRACTION of River Safari (the boat ride) was CLOSED! (and would remain closed even after the rain stopped!!!) They would not even let us come back to experience the attraction that they had shut down!! So- we could not experience the #1 aspect of this park, even though we were willing to make the trip back!

And here's the kicker- the most obnoxious piece of their customer service that day: Moments before the rain kicked in we purchased an ADDITIONAL ticket (only about $10 for the two of us) for a 2nd boat attraction that was not included in the $100 price tag. So- they closed down THAT RIDE TOO. Fair enough- it was raining and thats their policy, so be it (though they also did not re-open this attraction when the rain stopped). The obnoxious part- AGAIN- is that they would not let us return to use these ride tickets!
So- instead of giving us a refund for tickets we purchased MINUTES before the rain started, all they would do for us is say we could use the $10 as a STORE CREDIT!

A store credit!? We did not want a t-shirt or souvenir- we wanted to EXPERIENCE THEIR ZOO!! I have to say, my wife & I were totally enamored with Asia, and in love with Singapore in particular. But, this complete lack of caring about customer satisfaction was shocking to us. Money was the bottom line to them, clear & simple- no exceptions, no gray area.

I've encountered places before not being flexible about refunds, and thats to be expected. But- to not let us return after spending over $110- to use the tickets ONE DAY past the 7-day window, when they themselves were shutting down large portions of the park? Its unacceptable and a total shame! The facilities at River Safari were new and seemed quite pretty and well done... but without the two boat rides we missed half the park, and it was absolutely not worth it!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We loved river safari. The amazon boat ride was very cute. The huge aquarium with the manatees is gorgeous. We just sat and watched them for ages. Very peaceful and relaxing.
The only part we didnt like was the river cruise. It was very boring n basically just showed animals from the zoo."
,,Panda lover paradise!,4.0,,"I dragged my partner with me to the River Safari as I'm a bit of a panda fanatic and was desperate to visit Kai Kai and Jai Jai before we left Singapore; but this place has a lot more to offer than just the giant pandas!

It can be a bit complicated to get out here if you're a tourist traveling by public transport; it would have been 3 buses, or 2 buses and a metro trip for us to travel from our hotel (roughly a 1 and 1/2 hour journey). We chose to save time by taking a taxi which cost around $20SG and took roughly 30mins.

As previously stated we were mainly here for the pandas but the aquarium sections were also very appealing and nicely laid out with lots of different levels to view the fish and animals. The amazon safari boat trip was also really cool; we saw lots of animals including napping jaguars which are usually very shy and difficult to spot. The ride goes a little too quick to get good photos though. I was also able to feed some of the animals and you can walk round a monkey enclosure for that more interactive feel.

We did get to see both pandas being active and playful but by nature these animals are quite sleepy and lazy at times and to really see them sometimes you have to be patient and hang around and wait. A lot of the people who entered the enclosure at the same time as us just waked round complaining that the pandas weren't out and completely missed them! I would recommend to aim for late morning as this is when pandas are generally more active.The gift shop has a lot of nice things and most of the prices are reasonable, and the panda cafe was fully on theme. Edinburgh Zoo could pick up some tips from this place for sure.

A lot of the River Safari is either inside or covered with air conditioning to keep you cool and as tourists we really appreciated that. There's plenty to see and do (for all ages) and we really enjoyed our visit. Would love to go back!"
,,Magnificient ambience,4.0,,"This is a place where one enjoys the beauty of a forest in the boat ride and then the man made habitats for the endangered animals. The biggest attraction are the white and red Pandas. The day we were there, they were probably in good mood and so had a very close look. The Amazon quest ride should not be missed. The different river sections are very well organised."
,,Amazing animals and beautiful surroundings,4.0,,"We really enjoyed the opportunity to see such variety of animals in our time there. We needed at least 3 hours to see things more than once. The flow of people and signage are really well organised. The boat rides on the river and the Amazon Quest were lovely, if only too short. The little trip, however, was not really about river life but glimpses of edges of the animal enclosures in the zoo. But we saw every animal advertised in the brochure and it was still fun. The exhibits were amazing, in particular the tanks with large fish and mammals. We could not have enough. A little inconvenience was having different sections charged separately, and we would have preferred a ticket to cover the entire experience."
,,Nicely Done,4.0,,"This is a thing to do before the night Safari, the park is well maintained, the boat ride itself is pretty short but still interesting.

The main thing over here are the Panda's, over than that there are just Aquariums and all, but its a thing to see."
,,Not worth a second visit,1.0,,The only star attraction is the 2 panda bears and nothing else. Even then it also depends on ur luck tt day as to whether u can spot it. This shows capitalism at its best as instead of merging both the zoo and river safari they separate them into 2 diff places so tt they can earn more fr tourists and locals. It is so overpriced and there are so little things to see and the 2 boat rides which cost a grand total of $10 shd be alrd included in the super expensive admission ticket which btw is $28. The 2 boat rides are not worth it too as u really see nothing. Will not come back again even if it is free. Really not worth my money and time to come here and no halal food too so malays beware. Only 2 pathetic chinese restaurants there and the panda bao there cost a whopping $2.90!!!
,,Very Hot,3.0,,"As usual, the safari was very well organized. Went there with some friends, i found it so hot. Would recommend this place for families with small children. For adults, it was kinda boring. It was good but i won't want to come back again unless i bring my kids. Very hot, please wear sunglasses, hat, and comfortable shirt and sandals/shoes."
,,Unique approach to an aquarium,5.0,,"River Safari is another section of the great Singapore Zoo. It is our favorite, and we could return for more visits. It gives an excellent insight into the marine world in various regions of the planet. There are boat rides, walks through tunnels with marine life playing above you, there are displays and tanks with examples of the world's marine life. The displays are connected by covered walkways and makes this an all weather attraction. And, for some reason, the Giant Panda exhibit lives here as well. The whole park is woven together seamlessly to create a most excellent experience."
,,"Interesting & unusual fish, sheltered walkways, good underwater viewing areas.",3.0,,"It was raining when we went on a weekday, so it was very quiet, which was great, although the 2 boat rides didn't work until later in the day. The walkways are all covered so don't worry about the weather & it is all wheelchair accessible.
We ate in the River Safari Tea House before we went in, which was ok. Allow about 3-4hrs, more if you have curious kids. The exhibits are well signed & clear, although they generally tell you more about the species than the individual animal. There are loads of fish we had never heard of, so it was really interesting to see & learn about them. The giant river otters were great, as were the huge underwater tanks, & Kai Kai the panda was funny scratching his bum against a tree, but I wasn't happy with the very small enclosure for the red panda, who really didn't seem happy.
You don't really need a map as you just follow one path through regions & areas. The bats & monkeys are great too - just don't try & touch them!
The staff everywhere were friendly & helpful.
The boat rides - the cruise was relaxing 15 mins on a totally calm Upper Seletar Reservoir, but we saw nothing, & the Amazon Quest ride was pretty naf really - nothing seen & no real purpose to it - a bit unnecessary we thought, again no animals seen nor any real sign of any.
Overall, a very interesting day - we enjoyed it, worth a visit & very easy to get to via bus/MRT - allow 45 mins approx from the City."
,,"Good for kids, not for adult",3.0,,It's good place for kids . I expected much more interesting things there however it was nothing much to see. The only thing appealed me is Jia Jia and Kai Kai panda. But they hided from customers so the only thing i saw was...their back.
,,Great river rides and pandas!,4.0,,"I would characterize this primarily as an add-on to the Singapore Zoo, with the biggest bonus being the panda exhibit and the leisurely boat rides . There are a few rides, which are definitely of value (though you are not guaranteed to see animals on the rides; they may be hiding - I was a little disappointed to not be able to see the anteater) . If your primary interest is aquatic/river life (ie, if you want to see manatees up close) this is the park for you. Manatees galore! If you want to spend time with the pandas, this is the park for you. We got to see pandas feed, which was fabulous! But for the most part, this is a lot of information about wetlife and ambhibious/fish life. Not for everyone."
,,Scuba Tanks Optional,5.0,,"If you want to see fish and reptiles that are so rare that you either have to go scuba diving or see them in a National Geographic underwater special then go to Singapore's River Safari (Actually some of them you wouldn't want to see while diving because they would eat you!!).

The park is laid out in a U-shape with most of the really impressive fish along the first half of representing all the major rivers around the world.

Strangely, half way through is a panda exhibit where you may glimpse one of the two pandas on loan from China. I say ""may"" because they are so shy that they had to install cameras in their dens because they spend so much time in their. In fact, the day we went, the female even managed to find a hiding spot away from the cameras view, so we just saw something panda-like on the TV screen. The male was sleeping spread eagled in his pen.

Take the bridge across the lake to the second half, and start by taking the gentle river raft trip. Animals were quite shy here too but it was mid-day, when all intelligent creatures should be taking a siesta. After that I don't remember much of anything worth noting here.

One real plus to the whole River Safari park is that most of it is under a roof or awning so you are out of the direct sunlight, which is a real plus in this tropical heat."
,,Good day out,4.0,,"The river safari was great. There are two optional boat rides which I recommend doing. One goes around the lake area and you can see elephants, giraffes and other wildlife. The other is like a ride, it was good but we didn't see a few of the animals. It is worth the money and interesting to see the wildlife from rivers all over the world. The only problem we had was getting there too early as we had a ticket for the night safari too and had to wait. We needed up doing the zoo as well. You can easily do all three in one day"
,,An Aquarium about River Wildlife,4.0,,"This all turned out to be a bit different to what i was expecting - but not all bad. The advertising has a picture of a boat cruising down a river. You do get to go on a boat for a short time eventually.
We brought a combo package to the Zoo and to the River Safari with the entrance to each being about 30m apart. The safari is more an aquarium that is about river wildlife and covers all of the major rivers in the world. If you are into aquatic life you will enjoy it and there will be several exhibits you will not have seen before. They have clearly spent a lot of money on this park which is reflected in the standard of the exhibits. You stroll from region to region across long boardwalks before boarding a boat that takes you for a short trip out onto the reservoir that borders the zoo. You get to glimpse a few of the zoo animals from on the water but there is not much else to see.
The whole place is wheelchair and pram friendly but be warned if you are going to double this up with the zoo and make a day of it there is a serious amount of walking involved. If you are travelling with young kids you might want to flick this and just do the zoo and finish in the zoo in the water park for kids - take bathing costumes. Having said all that if you really need to get up close with a Panda then you cannot miss this."
,,Showcasing Marine River Life from Around the World,4.0,,"This is the newest addition to the Singapore zoo complex and attempts to showcase marine life from major rivers around the world.

The park spans both sides of the upper Selatar Reservoir and covers the Mississipi River in North America, Congo and Nile in Africa and the Ganges, Mekon and Yangtze rivers from Asia on one side. Across the bridge on the other side of the reservoir is Wild Amazonia which showcases the plant and marine life from the Amazon (South America).

All the exhibits are essentially giant tanks containing the marine life from the river. To give it an authentic field, the area around the tanks has been decorated to look like the part of the world the rivers belong to.

The Amazon portion also has two boat rides - one (River Safari Cruise) around the reservoir and the other (Amazon River Quest) which takes you around the Amazon rainforest.

Don't miss the Giant Panda forest which showcases two Giant Pandas in their natural habitat. Same goes for the squirrel monkey forest where you can walk among the monkeys. Just make sure you don't have any food on you. Manatee feeding is also a must see. There are portals around the tank at various levels so you can watch the manatees feeding from below (underwater) or above.

Worth a visit if you have a half day. If you are adventurous, you could even do the Jurong Bird Park, River Safari and Night Safari in one day since they are located close to each other. If you plan to do this, make sure you buy the park hopper ticket which covers multiple parks and is cheaper than buying individual tickets for each park."
,,A different animal park,4.0,,"This is one of the zoo park sub complexes. It has three components to the visit.

The actual park has seven big tanks representing the seven biggest rivers in the world. Besides having the accurate flora and fauna of the river the decoration is in tone as well.
Then there is the Giant Panda Forest. It sports two giant pandas (Jia JIa and Kai Kai. ), a couple of red pandas and various birds.
Then there are the two rides of park. One is a lake ride on a big boat with english commentary guiding you through the surroundings. The other is Amazon River Quest. A rollercoaster type of ride which takes you to a beautiful landscaped part of the park with wild animals just a reach away.
For those of you in the first row - the first drop really gets water over you, so protect your cameras ;)"
,,Conveniently next to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari,5.0,,"An easy attraction you can do, right after the Singapore Zoo. It's definitely smaller than the zoo itself, so it is not strenuous to cover the grounds. Many interesting river creatures and it's generally shaded, so it won't be too hot to walk around. I would recommend doing this attraction AFTER covering the Singapore Zoo, to cool off."
,,Could be better,4.0,,There are some very impressive fish tanks here but I was a little disappointed overall. The girl who spoke at one feeding time I saw was difficult to understand. The size of the fish is amazing and they are only babies. Go only if you want to !
,,Plentiful of Room for improvement,2.0,,"This attraction has lots of room for improvement. It is not an attraction which I will look forward for a return visit.

Admission tickets aren't cheap, and river rides should have been inclusive in ticket price.

River Safari cruise was extremely boring. A fifteen mins boat ride and we only saw two white rhinoceros, one elephant, two giraffes, all from a distance????!

Amazon river ride was pleasant and somewhat more enjoyable. We got to see more animals.

The only attraction would be the pandas. The female panda was no where in sight! It seems like this attraction was established just for the pandas, and remainder was grabbing some animals from the zoo nearby, flamingo from hiring bird park, crocodile from reptile park and fishes from RWS!

Food and beverage was overpriced. A bottle drink from the vending machine cost $4.50! That is how much half a carton would cost in the marketplace! I don't see why management would sell these beverages at such a high cost?!

We tried the panda bao ($2.90) each, taste was normal. However the panda cappuccino ($6.50) was took a while to be ready and was not hot when served.

Parking was expensive for a public attraction!"
,,Lots of Fun and Beautiful Forests,5.0,,"This new attraction side by Singapore Zoo is truly a hit! The Panda forest is awesome! They have Kai Kai Panda who is soo lazy just lying on her bench. Although it looks thinner than some I saw in China or Ocean Park Hongkong, but it is amazing that Singapore could bring this exotic animal.
And they have also a common squirell monkey forest which several monkeys can be playing freely around you. Beautiful!!
The Amazon river cruise is fun! Although not much animals we could see along the journey but it was a brand new experience for me. Love it!!
The giant aquarium is great also.
Really really reccomended for you and the whole family. This is how to enjoy a living zoo in a much more fun way!
Get a free hop on buses from certained and scheduled bus stops near tourist hotels in Orchard-Bugis-Marina and depart from Suntec City. You may buy entrance ticket plus return transfer ticket also in Suntec City. The bus ride to Singapore Zoo complex in Mandai took about 30 minutes without traffic.
Enjoy!!"
,,Where are the animals?,2.0,,"We visited the river safari and left feeling disappointed. The exhibits are small and many of the animals weren't available to be seen. The pandas which for many are the main attraction were laying in an area with an obstructed view.

Quote of the day: ""The animals are the boss, if they don’t want to be seen, they won’t be"" - unnamed tour bus guide

I did enjoy the aquarium, this was the saving grace of the visit, otherwise the trip was a total loss."
,,2nd to Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"We went as a group of 2 couples and 1 baby during Singapore's National Day, after a great time at the Singapore Zoo.

I heard so much about the River Safari and was raring to try out the river ride but apparently it had already been fully filled. Do book early to avoid disappointment!

The rest of the exhibits are large enclosures which weren't that exciting compared to the Singapore Zoo.

The highlight was seeing the 2 pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia, though Kai Kai was very shy, hiding among the trees."
,,A good idea but poorly executed,2.0,,"We visited this as part of our zoo ticket but left feeling disappointed. The exhibits are small and many of the animals weren't available to be seen.

The pandas which for many are the main attract were not out when we first went past, or the second time. We decided to give it one more try and got lucky just before we had to leave. The river cruise was pointless with nothing to see and the same was true of the safari where the animals were out of sight.

This is a good idea but very poorly executed, save your money and spend it on something else."
,,Another Singapore attraction done well,4.0,,"The River Safari at Singapore Zoo is done really well with lots of exhibits themed to the the largest Rivers in the world and their inhabitants. The highlight for me was seeing the Panda Bears, although they were sleeping they are such beautiful creatures. I would definitely recommend a visit."
,,Pandas are the star attraction!,4.0,,"An interesting way to spend a few hours is to visit the River Safari in Singapore. A fairly new attraction it consists of a number of large aquariums with species of fish from various parts of the world. Very educational for young ones (and old) as each area has quite a bit of information on the various fish etc. The best part is seeing the two giant pandas who are VERY cute - even though they tend to be asleep for most of the time! The monkey area is also worth having a look at as is the adventure river safari ride. Not Universal Studios by any stretch of the imagination, but still a worthwhile attraction to visit if you have done everything else in Singapore!
The attraction is next to Singapore Zoo and as it should only take you 2-3 hours to visit, a good idea is to combine a trip to both places on the same day."
,,Captivating But Could Have Been Better,3.0,,"Visited River Safari on a weekday morning. Best time to visit when there are not so many visitors around. Came in upon opening time. Wished the staff were more enthusiastic to receive their first visitors. A warm smile and greetings would suffice or something creative to create the kind of mood for a safari. Hardly saw any keepers or staff near the exhibits except at the river cruise counter or entrance to some of the special exhibits.

Nevertheless, a good mix of animals seen on display. Enjoyed watching Kai Kai, one of the panda bears having his breakfast up close. That's the reason it's always good to come early. Loved watching Inuka, the polar bear swimming in and out.

Must not miss entering the spider monkeys enclosure. But be sure to keep your sweets and candies safely hidden cos they can smell it a mile away. Saw a lolly taken away by one of the spider monkeys. The safari should have more of such enclosures where visitors get to be really close without any physical barrier between them.

2 water activities you should not miss- River Cruise and Amazon Quest (entrance fee of $28 does not include these 2 rides at $8). The river cruise takes about 15 minutes around a water catchment area. If you're lucky, you'd get to see elephants and giraffes by the river. We saw 1 or 2 wild river otters. Yes, and that's it.

Amazon Quest was alright. It was another ride but on a motorized raft which fits about 8 people. You pass by some animal displays, mostly primates. Quite comical to hear them saying... ""Look to the right and you'll see..."" You look to the right and you hardly see anything but lots of flora.

If you have a lot of time to spare, it's nice to just sit down and watch the huge manatees, enormous fishes, etc. swimming under water. It's like looking into a gigantic aquarium.

For Muslim travelers, it may be useful to know that there are at least 2 halal food outlets - KFC and Ah Meng Cafe. The first serves fast food while the latter, Asian street food."
,,Had a very good time.,5.0,,It's a very nice place to visit. I visited River safari with my wife and really enjoyed. We really had a very good time. It's very educational for everyone. We really had fun and nice time.
,,Some wow factors,5.0,,If you like aquariums then this is a must. I do not want to give too many spoilers just to say this is a very well planned and thought out attraction. We did both the boat trips and would recommend them as they did enhance the day. A top attraction.
,,Amazing and Educational,5.0,,"River Safari is very educational and fun. The aquariums are huge and spectacular especially the tube where you could see the otters swimming above you. The panda exhibit is nice, chilly and quiet for you to relax and observe the panda. The manatees AMAZING huge view of those amazing marine mammals, once you're walking you can see different view of the manatees and dugongs too! The boat ride (not the amazon river quest) had some nice views it is very interactive you can see some animals from the Singapore Zoo too! The Amazon River Quest was short but very exciting there are animals in there that you can't see without going in there."
,,Great set up with one flaw,4.0,,"There is no questioning that this is an amazing place to witness life in and around the major river systems of the world. Everything is of the same high standard and quality as the other Singapore zoo attractions.
My only criticism is that after being told my eldest daughter was not tall enough to go on the Amazon Quest boat ride we discovered that this ride is the only way to see a lot of the Amazon animals (including the Jaguar which is her favourite)
I have no problem with height restrictions for rides. We expect it when we go to an amusement or theme park. I didn't expect to not be able to see a lot of animals when we go to a zoo because my child is too short to go on a ride.
This is a bad planning decision and the reason they are not betting 5 stars"
,,An enjoyable experience!,5.0,,"Visited this attraction as part of a bundled package which offers a 50% discount on purchase of zoo+river safari ticket for SG50 celebrations. Fortunately, we started the journey when the feeding of animals also begin (at around 9.30 am - note the park opens at 9 am). This made an otherwise uninteresting walkthrough zoo into an interesting, interactive, fun and extremely memorable experience. Unfortunately, we didn't experience the boat rides as we had the zoo to cover also, but I'd think it would make the experience even better.

Although its called a ""river safari"", actually its a single pathway walkthrough park with animals on both sides. Its really half zoo and half aquarium and has various mammals, reptiles, fish, birds etc. The giant pandas, red panda, mekong river exhibit and flooded amazon exhibits were truly breathtaking and is well worth the visit.

Getting there is easy by MRT and bus (take bus 138 from Ang Mo Kio station or bus 927 for Choa Chu Kang station) The river safari is located a few meters away from the zoo and night safari, so if you've got the energy, you can do all three in one tiresome day. This is a must visit attraction if you want to see the Giant pandas!"
,,Enjoyed the beautiful aquariums,5.0,,"I really loved those huge aquariums showing all kind of fish and turtles. The aquariums are very beautiful giving you a good impression on how this animals live in the water. It was particularly funny to walk through the tube with the otters swimming all around (and over) you! The huge aquarium with the manatees was stunning. However, I can't help wondering why the pandas are at the river safari. I would recommend to visit the River Safari, despite not even having done the actual boat ride (I had no time)."
,,Pandas in residence,3.0,,"Didn't enjoy this place as much as the zoo next door so to be fair this place does give you info on the various famous river systems of the world. Highlight for us was seeing a Panda, this is a rarity for some of us so this made the entry fee worth while."
,,"Well, they have the panda.",3.0,,"Having read the previous reviews, we went with managed expectations. We went to see the panda and that is definitely the main attraction there. I did also like the concept of categorising exhibits by the rivers. And did enjoy a lot of the exhibits. But it does feel like the zoo is much more value for about the same price, and much more fun as well."
,,Nice place to take shelter,2.0,,"Been to River Safari 3 times over the last year or so. Thankfully 2 out of the 3 visits were free tickets from friends.

Display/ General overview:
Without doubt, it is well-designed. And it is also well sign-posted. Lots of covered walkways. If you like to whine about the hot weather then this is the place... But River Safari is just an enlarged version of the small aquarium you find in many zoos. Just that Wildlife Reserves Singapore decided to expand it to become a standalone attraction and charge a separate admission for it. Cha ching!

Rides (River Safari and Amazon River Quest)
The boat ride was one of the worst way to spend my money. I have no qualms about zoo having something Disney-like. But at least make the 15 min worthwhile for visitors. If you are lucky, you can see up to 3 types of animals. Yes... 3 types of animals. Basically, the ride brings you to part of the zoo and a small part of the night safari.

The amazon river quest is an amusement park water ride. For a water ride, it is too slow and not exciting but for a tour, it is really fast until you could hardly take a decent photo. So you have a choice to make... take a photo or just soak in the sight. The problem is there is no guarantee you can see the animals this way. The fun of going to the zoo is to see the animals and try to spot them. But the river quest took that excitement away.

For the budget visitors/ travelers...
There is no water cooler (drinking fountain) in the River Safari.
So either you suck it up by drinking tap water (faucet) from the washrooms or just pay and pay for bottled water. By the way, tap water is clean and drinkable in Singapore. We have pretty good water purification technologies here.

Food is expensive even by themed attraction standard. A set meal at the only quick service restaurant is between S$15- S$17 excluding drinks. The only thing worth buying is the S$2.90 steam bun which looked like a panda. You can get the $6 panda themed cappuccino if you like a hot drink in our hot weather.

If you never seen a panda then go. If you seen panda before, don't bother unless you scored a free ticket."
,,interesting day trip,4.0,,"Having already been to the Singapore Zoo I was looking for something a bit different. This place certainly lived up to expectations although not as remarkable as the Zoo. I certainly felt like it was worth the money, both informative and entertaining."
,,Just go for the pandas,3.0,,"I went because of the pandas and it totally worth it. But if you're not a panda freak like me, let me tell you that the River Safari it's lame. The boat ride it's only 15min and we can't really spot the animals because it's too quick and far. We're also told not to stand up in the boat, being sitted just make even harder try to see something in the woods. The rest of the safari, the fishes for example, way better to see in the S.E.A. Aquarium at Sentosa. But, again, because of the pandas I would go again a thousand times."
,,Okay not to put on top of your priority list,3.0,,"If you've gone to the Singapore Zoo, you may well skip this one.

This park offers several displays of fishes and aquatic animals, two pandas, two boat rides but there is really nothing special about them. The boat ride takes you to see the backside of the Singapore Zoo so you're actually be seeing the same giraffes and elephants. And frankly, I don't think I need pay to to see a 'kapok' tree from a distance.

If you've gone to see the aquarium at Sentosa or even in Hongkong Ocean Park, you won't miss anything if you don't see the aquarium here.

I've you've gone to see most of the attractions at Singapore, it's okay to come just to be able to say 'I've been there' but it's also okay not to put this on your top priority list."
,,A Walk Through Aquarium,3.0,,"I really expected to be on a boat when my sister booked the river safari for us. The idea Safari is misleading. The tickets were a birthday present.

There was some valuable educational information about the different rivers in the world and I found the information interesting. The tanks were impressive and well kept.

We chose this over the zoo, because it was undercover and so would be cooler.

Pretty much all a big aquarium. my Brother in law loved it, because he loves fish.
I have to admit I got a little board with all the fish, and very few other animals there. Two red panda and a panda bear, a polar bear and some otters were the other animals.

Maybe the Zoo is a better option if your not a fish person."
,,More amusement park than safari!,3.0,,"Nice add-on at this location, but unlike the main Zoo or the Night Safari, this is more amusement park than nature park. Best attraction are the pandas thrown in to attract visitors!"
,,Worth it to see the pandas!,3.0,,"My husband and I spent an hour and a half here and felt we had wasted both our time and money. We walked the entire park seeing hardly anything. I was so excited about seeing the pandas, but one was sleeping and the other was missing. We stayed for 30 minutes and then left. The boat ride was not worth the money as I couldn't see the animals because the boat was overcrowded. We reached the exit and all I could think about was how much time and money we had wasted. My husband wanted to leave, but I just had to try one more time to see the pandas! I walked all the way back to the panda exhibit and on my way was amazed to see all the animals that were missing the first time around! When I got to the panda exhibit, they were both out and moving around!! I stayed for a long time watching them and taking photos that I will always treasure!! It was worth it, after all!!!"
,,Must Do!,5.0,,"THE PANDAS!!
There are only a few select locations in the world that have pandas for public viewing! The Singapore River Safari is one of them! They were amazing and close for viewing. I essentially went to see the pandas but ended up really enjoying ever other exhibit! It is unlike no other zoo as river animals are not your typical creatures. We thoroughly enjoyed the boat tour and the short boat circuit! It felt like you were on a true river safari! Highly recommend this park for people of all ages."
,,Over rated!,2.0,,"Sounded like a great experience but certainly didn't live up to the hype on the brochure
If you book tickets check that you are getting both rides or you will have to buy tickets when you get there.
The River safari only shows another view of animals that are in the main zoo! .. that's if you can see them!
The Amazon Safari is a canal ride and is over before you can blink and most exhibits were empty ... no one could spot any animals.
Seriously the only highlight was the walk through the aquarium before you get to the rides!"
,,Great Disappointment,3.0,,Hardly 2 Hour time is enough for River Safari. If climate will allow otherwise no use to go there. Amazon Ride is good
,,"Finally saw the Giant Panda, Red Panda, the Dugongs were the highlights!",4.0,,"We chose River Safari to see the Giant Pandas, but we also saw other great animals at river safari. The Giant Panda is cute, but maybe a bit too lazy, the rarer and smaller red panda while not as cute in the pictures, was more fun to watch, definitely has more character than the Giant Panda.

But the dugongs stole the show. Floating ""gracefully"" and lazily, Dugongs aren't as common as some other creatures in most Zoos.

We tried the panda themed café, we tried the red bean dimsum, price was reasonable and to be fair, it tastes good!"
,,The pandas are great,3.0,,"This is a significantly smaller attraction than the Singapore zoo and is best visited as a combo ticket (in order to take advantage of prevailing discounts). The pandas are most impressive but most of the other attractions are fairly average. You have to pay extra for the boat rides: we did the Amazonia, but note that children need to be at least 106cm tall. The dugongs at the end are also good. No drinking water fountains as with the zoo so as to maximise gouging potential."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Definitely worth giving a visit. If your planning on doing the zoo I recommend doing both on the same day and visiting the river safari first and heading to zoo in the afternoon.
We visited both parks on a Friday, the river safari was very quite when we arrived just before opening. We were one of the first in the park and it was really nice to enjoy it by ourselves.
The two pandas Were the highlight along with the boat rides and giant otters.
As it wasn't busy it only took us 2 - 2.5 hours to enjoy the park and gave us plenty of time to head to the zoo after.
Also if you are going to the zoo and are planing on purchasing gifts check the river safari gift shop before you leave. When we were there the river safari store sold similar items and had a special deal with your ticket purchase if you spent a certain amount of money you got a discount which the zoo store did not, the river safari store is also accessible from outside the park so you can go back and purchase items after you have explored the zoo."
,,Good place,4.0,,"This is next to Singapore Zoo. Here Aquatic animals and other few animals are kept according to different river themes. There are small and huge aquariums and sea creatures which are worth seeing. The boat ride inside the river safari gives 2 options. One is outdoor boat ride and other is Amazon trail. Later is of short time but good one. Pandas are nice. If you have already visited SEA aquarium in Sentosa island, then you may find few creatures are repetitive. But it is different experience being here. A worth visiting place for people having interest in nature and creatures. ಜಗತ್ತಿನ ವಿವಿಧ ನದಿಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ವಾಸಿಸುವ ಜೀವಿಗಳ ಆಧಾರದಲ್ಲಿ ಮೀನು ಮತ್ತು ಇತರ ಕೆಲವು ಪ್ರಾಣಿಗಳನ್ನು ಇಡಲಾಗಿದೆ. ದೊಡ್ಡ ಅಕ್ವೇರಿಯಂ ಇದೆ. ಅಮೇಜಾನ್ ಕಾಡಿನ ಪರಿಸರದ ಒಳಗೆ ಹೋಗುವ ಬೋಟ್ ರೈಡ್ ಇದೆ. ಒಟ್ಟಾರೆ ಪ್ರಾಣಿ ಹಾಗೂ ಪರಿಸರ ಆಸಕ್ತರಿಗೆ ಒಳ್ಳೆಯ ತಾಣ."
,,Amazing dugong exhibit,3.0,,"Dugong exhibit was incredible, but boat ride was not that great. Have heard that the actual river safari is better though so will try that next time. Overall exhibits are very well set up, and if you are going to the zoo and can get the package deal it's worth it. Would not pay the full ticket cost for entry however."
,,Wild Safari!,4.0,,"Go visit during off peak or during weekdays as we did. No queues in the attractions, as well as the boat rides. The River Safari Cruise boat ride was so-so because it just circled the lake. Make it an optional ride, if you have time to spare. The Amazon River Quest was better as you get to see wild life riding this boat."
,,One of the best to do in Singapore Zoo,5.0,,Was really a nice and very interesting part of the Zoo as it doesn't just show animals but also to sensibilise the visitors to care about the environment and that they can influence it by their own consumption of fisch and other goods.
,,Rather disappointing,2.0,,The actual boat trip is only 15 minutes - I know it is advertised as such. But the only wildlife we saw was the back of the giraffes we had just visited at the zoo and the back of some elephants. Glad we did not pay a lot of money for it as it was not worth it at all.
,,Around the world's rivers in 3 hours!,5.0,,"Thanks to the Golden Jubilee Weekend that my boyfriend and I got to enjoy the 50% discount for the Singapore Zoo and River Safari promotions.

This is my boyfriend and my first time visiting River Safari. I was simply awed by the sizes of fish found in the different rivers of the world.

As we only had 6 hours to visit both parks, we didn't stay too long in each 'river'. However we still enjoyed ourselves thoroughly as we looked at the different species of animals and fish and reptiles found along the rivers of the world.

Of course the highlight of the trip was a visit to the Yangtze River which I wanted to see the panda. But I the end, our hearts were won over by the Red Panda who endeared itself to many visitors!

The Amazon Quest was really interesting as we got ready to go on an adventure. However do not sit on the first row unless you do not mind your shoes getting wet! When it happened to us, we both were just laughing so loudly!

The River Cruise add on a nice tranquil touch to the trip as the boat ride brought us away from the crowd. It was really peaceful to be out there in the boat, looking at the sky touching the greenery of another side of Singapore which we city dwellers never get to experience much.

We really enjoyed our trip a lot and it was definitely a great place which add on to beautiful memories for both of us.

We will definitely come back again!"
,,Pandas were the main attraction !,3.0,,"Went for the river safari with my wife in April earlier this year. Having visited the zoo and night safari previously we decided to try it.
It wasn't as good as we expected it to be. The only highlight was the panda enclosure. There are two rides in the safari as only one was complimentary with the entry ticket we had to pay for the other .try and avoid the nature safari . A total waste of time. The Amazon river quest was better but lasted for like 5-7 mins and hardly saw any of the animals as they were hiding and the boat moved really fast.
Overall was a nice experience."
,,Love the panda!!!,3.0,,It was not so much of the fish part but the pandas were awesome!!! However the pandas itself was probably the only interesting attraction there.
,,hidden cost,2.0,,"If you do not pay an extra amount for the ferry part, you would only visit 60-70% of the total spots. Even you paid for it, you will never think of coming back again to river safari.
The only reason attract people to this place is PANDA. how pathetic!"
,,Informative park with an interesting ride,4.0,,The highlight of our visit was the Amazon River Quest ride. Don't sit in the first row though or you'll get drenched. The pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia were very cute. Very informative and you do get close to some of the creatures that naturally live in or near the rivers around the world. The large aquatic tank where you can view dugongs and other river creatures was awesome. We spent 4 hours in the park and had a really good time!
,,It's very good!,4.0,,"If you are looking for a place that educates you in some way, this is the right place to come! It's built uniquely with covered walkways for most part -it shows you history of great rivers and then has half open water tanks set in natural surroundings that contain various fish. The pandas are a big attraction too and so are many animals on the Amazon river ride. They charge extra for the river boat ride and Amazon ride so best is to buy all tickets online you get some discounts. Ideally go early morning at 9 we spent 4 hours there at a leisurely pace. My mother in law was visiting and has leg trouble but we got a wheelchair and she could see everything. Very well designed"
,,Around the world's rivers only at River Safari Singapore,5.0,,"Yesterday we went to one of the newest attraction in Singapore situated beside the famous Singapore zoo in Mandai - River Safari. It was one of the most unique, inspiring and relaxing attraction I ever visited around the world. It was a rainy day but the attraction itself is mostly wet proof - tents, covers, and mostly indoor and very well air conditioned. I personally like the way they organized the zoo according to the largest rivers in the world as well as definitive information about the animals and their current status in ecology. In addition to freshwater fishes, amphibians, reptiles you will also have some mammals like the River Otters, Panda, Manatees, Red panda, Capybara, Jaguar, etc. The Amazon river quest was a very unique combination of zoo and ride (with drops) although you might be only luck to see some animals unless they hide with the exception of Ibis and Flamingos who are very much visible. The River boat cruise is a wonderful experience to see that Singapore truly treasures and protects their remaining nature reserve - bonus are some wild birds who called the zoo their home. Overall the journey takes you around 3 hours to visit the whole park and the bonus part is you could catch a glimpse of some animals found in the Singapore zoo thru its backdoor. Food and refreshments are also readily available including wheelchair accessibility and clean restrooms. If you are a tourist I recommend buying the tourist package worth 36 dollars so you wont have to line up and buy separate tickets for Amazon river quest and the boat cruise. Truly a magical experience I had with my parents at the River Safari."
,,Unexpected delight,4.0,,"We bought a combined ticket in advance and were less enthusiastic about this park, expecting it to be on a river safari (!!). In fact the river trip is the most disappointing part, lasting only 15 minutes and just seeing a few animals from the Zoo. But the rest of the park we loved.

We had expected it to take about an hour, but this was 4 hours of fun with gently walking and made easily accessible for wheel chairs and buggies. The whole park has covered walk ways so you are cool and never in the sun for the whole visit. Plus, as the less popular attraction, the park was reasonably easy to negotiate with fewer people to walk round.

Overall I would really recommend this place. The pandas were of course wonderful as was the monkey trail, Once you get past the animals in captivity issue. There was lots to see, and our kids were genuinely excited to see round each corner. If you are on a budget take a picnic and drinks, the prices are eye watering.

Getting there on public transport was an event and took 90 minutes. MRT from Singapore to Ang Mo Koi and then bus 138. Once off the train getting to the bus is well signposted and just needs the navigation of the usual Mall experience. The bus stop is also well signposted. The bus is exact change only $2.20 adults(I think) but you can use your EZ card on the bus as well as the MRT, just tap on entrance and exit. Strangely the bus was only a single decker, so be prepared to stand for the 45 min. Journey or push to the front of the line!

At the park there are coaches advertised that will take you back into town for $5 per person, and this takes 30 mins with designated drop offs. They have a time table so check before going into the venue. When we left at about 5 the taxi rank was very long, with no waiting taxis, but seemed the popular route back into town."
,,You need at least 4 hours,4.0,,"We took an ""organised "" tour to this and they spoiled the experience. It was so badly run that we only had a bit over 2 hours to see it, nowhere enough time. Taxis are cheap in Singapore. It is worth paying for one to go here."
,,Nicely organized zoo,4.0,,Nice park. The River cruise goes very quickly and it is difficult to see the animals. The pandas are amazing and a main attraction.
,,Worth it only to see the Pandas,4.0,,If Pandas weren't my favourite animal it really wouldn't have been worth it. The Pandas & Red Pandas are awesome and some of the parts you walk through we're good too but the river safari itself is rubbish as is the amazon river ride.
,,Don't miss the panda!!,5.0,,"The river safari is a very relaxed way of watching the animals.

There is more shelter hence less warmer than the zoo.

It's amazing the different range of animals the zoo has.

We did the river cruise which is okay and nothing great. The Amazon quest was closed when we visited. Have heard that is good fun.

For us the highlight was the panda

A must do when in Singapore."
,,Enjoyable Birthday Visit,4.0,,"Found out a week before my birthday that one gets complimentary admission to Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari on one's birthday. I went there on my birthday this year in July. It was my 2nd visit to River Safari. Compared to this, this place is fully shelter, good to walk with under the hot sun. This time, I enjoyed myself even more.. love the manatee pool , and also managed to follow the feeding session, and the animal encountered. A very enjoyable birthday visit. :D"
,,Loved this place,5.0,,"I don't understand the bad reviews, my daughter and visited the river safari as part of a 3 in 1 ticket with the night safari and Singapore zoo. We did the River safari first really enjoyed the pandas both Red and Giant, nice enclosure and air conditioned which was nice as it was 38C. The aquariums are excellent with some amazing species including freshwater sting rays, giant Mekong catfish and some nice reptiles. The area is well designed and the walkway is excellent. We went on the Amazon ride which was fun but don't expect to see too many animals. The spider monkey enclosure is excellent and we saw jaguarundis as well as some big snakes. The river cruse was good but we only saw elephants and giraffes. Much better than I expected after reading the reviews, if your into freshwater fish, like log jam rides or want to get up close and personal with spider monkeys then go along you'll enjoy it."
,,Exciting short boat ride,5.0,,"It was an exciting short boat ride on the last sector although the journey was short was it was adventurous as we rode down a man made path through a section of the zoo. To be exact it felt like a roller coaster ride on waters.
The first sector was a lot of walking studying the different life along different rivers of the world. Very educational. The highlight was seeing Kai Kai and Jia Jia the two pandas from China. Then it was a leisure river boat cruise. Very relaxing.
I would recommend to spend the entire day at the zoo and river safari as well as the night safari. Don't miss it."
,,Not worth the expense,2.0,,"After looking forward to visiting the river safari, we too were truly disappointed . It's definitely not worth the entrance fee. The Pandas were the highlight of our visit, as for the amazon boat ride we saw very few birds and animals all we saw were the Jaguars, a few monkeys and some red birds, the automated boat travels far to fast, and the automated commentary is even faster than the boat.
The only other things on display were various types of fish, so don't waste time by visiting this place."
,,A nice alternative to a zoo,4.0,,"We visited the river safari as part of a 3 in 1 ticket with the night safari and singapore zoo. We went to the night safari first then the river safari. We'd never been to a river safari, but assumed it was a zoo but with more sea animals and fish. We were correct.
It was a quiet day so luckily we got around everywhere without any bother from others.
We had rides on the boat ride which made a nice change, a bit like a log flume with animals around us. We luckily just managed to get the last river boat cruise around the large lake, it was nice because we could see the giraffes and elephants from the nearby singapore zoo. Knowing now what it's all about I wouldn't go back again, only because I've been and don't need to go again. But if you have time to kill and fancy it try it!"
,,Boat Ride & Amazon River Quest: Disapointment,2.0,,"This was our 2nd visit to River Safari. In the first visit, two major attractions (boat ride & Amazon River Quest) were not opened yet; thus, we had high expectation to take these attractions in our 2nd visit. However, the reality was much below our expectation. The boat ride was just like riding an ordinary boat and we saw only a glimpse of giraffes and elephants from a distance. The next ride (Amazon River Quest) did not come close to its name. The boat moved quite fast so we did not have enough time to see the surrounding animals. Further, there are not many animals to see and in quite a few cases we could not find an animal at all."
,,Can do better!,3.0,,"Thick Singapore foliage offers a great opportunity to explain creatures of a tropical forest such as the Orangutan (ah ment), etc...touted as one of the worlds most exciting zoo/ safari experience, the River Safari's boat ride is painfully low on detail. There is also very little to see except for the thick foliage...the narration/ customer engagement could improve.."
,,Good Attraction,4.0,,"We have visited this place with a special visitor from New Zealand. He came to Singapore on an exchange program with the school. Although the weather was hot, everyone enjoyed the place especially the boat ride."
,,Expensive hardly any animals,2.0,,Not worth the money. I mean the river quest and boat cruise are ok u get to see an elephant from far. And lots of fishes in tanks but its not mind blowing for the prices paid. River safari makes it sound much more amazing than it actually is.
,,Good attraction to visit,3.0,,i enjoyed the river safari for the most part. The pandas were very lively on the day that we visited which was great. The boat ride however was disappointing. It was very short and there were very few animals to see.
,,wonderful place in very hot Singapore,4.0,,"I never thought Singapore is very hot., But Inside the Zoo i felt good. And river safari is really very good. especially Jia Jia and Kai Kai pandas."
,,Great place to Visit!,5.0,,"Visited the place with 3 other friends and we enjoyed it tremendously.
We went early to avoid the crowd and heat, which worked great for us.
We spent about 2.5 hours in it, so after spending the morning there, it was lunch time.

Took the additional boat ride which was a little disappointing considering the additional costs. I'd still recommend it but do choose a day whereby it is not gonna be too crowded or you will have a hard time enjoying the exhibits."
,,Second visit,3.0,,"This was my second visit and was an add-on after we had finished visiting the zoo. Hint: On exiting the zoo walk to your left and you'll see the signs for the entry.

As on my first visit, I enjoyed a leisurely stroll past the aquariums until we reached the Pandas. There is, of course, no guarantee that the Pandas will be out of their dens and visible, however this time we were lucky and one was outside grazing on bamboo.

On this visit I realized that I had actually missed about half of the exhibits on my previous visit. After exiting the Pandas we walked down to the bridge and I realized that last time I had not crossed the bridge. This time we walked across the bridge and on the other side was the Fragile Forrest, the huge Manatee aquarium and various other exhibits.

So, don't think that the only reason to cross the bridge is for the river cruise because about half the exhibits are on the other side! I felt a bit silly when I realized what I'd missed last time.

I'd say that the River Safari is a good add-on after the Zoo, however I don't think that it's worth a separate trip from the city."
,,Nice attraction,4.0,,My sons really enjoyed the marine animals there. Quite an interesting collection of exotic crocs and fishes. The Pandas are lovely. The Amazon ride is OK. I liked it when the boat was elevated to the river level. The Boat Cruise is not as interesting. Buy your tickets online to get a good discount.
,,Two words...don't bother!,1.0,,"This recent entrant into the Singapore Zoo/Night Safari complex really is a waste of money and time but for the panda exhibit and manatee pool.

Exhibits were not well set out...a bit of a pack'em and stack'em concept with little thought given to education and a lot of thought given to how to squeeze every last penny out of you.

The worst part of the whole experience was the boat ride (we chose the quasi-log ride). An additional $5 per person netted you about 10 minutes with a fabulously cheesy tacky commentary that was not in sync to the location of the boat and left you feeling entirely ripped off by the whole experience.

Money definitely not well spent.

Avoid...avoid...avoid..."
,,Great to see river inhabitants which are hard to find.,4.0,,"Like SEA, they have various of river inhabitants, some of the greatest are manatee, giant mekong catfish, carp, and stingray. They also have the Nile crocodiles are mesmerizing. My only complain will be, it's hard to take a great pictures of them because of the sunlight reflected by the glass. There are two main attraction which you can choose, i don't really enjoy the river adventure, the boat moving too fast, and it's hard to see the jaguar being active at morning or noon."
,,A leisurely place to visit,4.0,,"The place is nothing fantastic to woo about but you can bring your kids to learn a lot about fresh water animals, insert and fishes. There is also quiz to entertain you.
Pay a bit more to cruise the seletar river and Safari quest.

Time needed: Two hour"
,,not worth it do Zoo and Night safari,2.0,,"not really worth the visit, the boat ride is only 10 mins at the end and you struggle to see any animals. you do get to see the giant panda's but if you are visiting the SEA aquarium you would be better off with the Zoo and Night safari rather that this."
,,Spectacular enclosures!,4.0,,"Great enclosures and nice sunset!
Do look out for the pandas - Jia Jia and Kai Kai and the humongous fishes! Don't forget to take a river tour on the boats (comes at an extra cost) and snap some amazing shots on the boardwalk! I advise you to come in the morning as all the enclosures will be open to the public."
,,"Must see panda, but feel being rob when buy meal at mama panda",4.0,,"Yes the goal is to see panda, very cute panda , love it.
After that, I'm buy a meal for my kids, and guess how much i must pay for a meal ?... S$ 17.(look like a kid meal for me).. Whoa....
Overall, the most interesting attraction is panda
So, if you want see Panda, consider not to buy meal in there"
,,Would prefer S.E.A. at Sentosa than River Safari,3.0,,"The whole experience was a lesser experience than S.E.A. at Sentosa. The only interesting attraction was the Amazon River Quest, which my 7 year old nephew and 4 year old nice enjoyed. Nothing much interesting in my opinion."
,,Fun new zoo experience,4.0,,"We went to the River Safari earlier this week after booking online before we went. We got both boat rides, which we all enjoyed.

The highlights were the pandas (although we only saw one) and the manatees.

We caught the SaEx bus there from Farrer Park MRT and had 3.5 hours there, which was plenty, including lunch. Caught the SaEx bus back into the city afterward, which was very convenient."
,,Alright if you haven't got much else to do,3.0,,"I went on a weekday to avoid the crowds. It took 3-4 hours to complete the entire tour. There was nothing particularly memorable about visit other than the panda waking up from its nap and taking a poop. Do this if you haven't got anything else planned, it's not entirely bad but don't make it a priority."
,,A day well spent,4.0,,"Adjacent to the Singapore Zoo, the River Safari is the latest addition to Wildlife Reserves Singapore's stable of world class wildlife parks. It is eminently suitable for families with young children due to its compact size and rather shaded environment. Our family spent the larger part of the day there and did not end up tired and hot, due to the seamless migration from one river zone to the next, unlike a day at the zoo which could send one going off in different directions.

Of greatest value, we found, was the educational aspect. The accompanying text to the aquatic enclosures was simply and sufficiently written, appealing to both adults and children. Undoubtedly the Giant Panda Forest was the highlight, and we were blessed to have been able to catch both Jia Jia and Kai Kai in their respective enclosures doing what they do best - eating bamboo shoots.

Avoid weekends if you can. We were glad to have visited on a weekday when we did not encounter queues for viewing of these delightful creatures, nor for entry, food, other facilities and the boat rides. If pressed for time, you can forego the River Cruise around Seletar Reservoir. The Amazon River Quest boat ride offers more sightings and thrills.

All in all, we were glad that we devoted time for this splendid new attraction."
,,Definitely worse of Singapore Zoo collection,2.0,,"This place was smaller, emptier and less ""finished"" when compared to all over attractions in the zoo collection. There was a lot of walking with no animals and only informational signs. The whole place felt like it wasn't actually ready for the public. It also felt as if they'd shipped some animals to this attraction from the zoo, called it something else and charged extra/double ticket fees. A bit cheeky in my opinion. The giant pandas were very sweet though and their habitat seemed rich in stimulus, the animals appeared happy. The red panda's habitat seemed a bit small and the animal looked bored. The large aquarium was very interesting and definitely the highlight of the attraction. Overall, not recommended."
,,Not a Safari,3.0,,"If you are short of time this is easily avoidable. Except that the pandas are amazing here. The boat ride is Definitely a waste of time and money. Easily avoidable. It's a 15 min boat ride and that's it.
The only thing worth the visit there is the Pandas. Gorgeous Pandas. Your kids would love them. So you can actually just rush through the exhibit avoid the boat ride and head straight for the Pandas."
,,Disappointing.,2.0,,"There was so much hype bringing in the panda, Jia Jia and Kai Kai so I expected quite a lot from this place but ended up with a huge disappointment.

In my opinion, the Zoo and night safari are good enough already. In fact, I highly recommend Zoo because it is so much bigger and there are a lot more animals."
,,Trip highlight,5.0,,"We did this on our last day in Singapore and was lovely. You will learn from the boats travel video, it last approximately 40mins ride but all went well."
,,Mystic Rivers,5.0,,"All the wild life found in the rivers around the world are kept the star attraction being the pandas also the red panda's.great Amazonian gaint fish something you only will get to see on tv,Purchase the park hopper pass."
,,"Bit dated,pandas worth it ,otherwise go to zoo",3.0,,"As part of deal got river safari added on for $5 ,doesn't take a long time the fish tanks / aquariums felt pretty old ,to be fair did not get on the river boat ( to hot after spending 6 hours at zoo ) but looked at everything else ,pandas were great and could have stayed for an hour or more watching them ,but overall park just felt dated"
,,Clean fun & open greenery,5.0,,"There's so much to see all various animals and flamingoes down along the Mandai river. The attractions are nicely spaced out so get a chance to stretch your legs. Sunny blue skies with breeze blowing fresh air to breathe. Panda and various monkeys will keep you enthralled watching their antics. Lots to photo and there's a loop around by ""ferry"" as well as a boat ride in Mandai reservoir. This interesting place has something for everyone to enjoy."
,,"It was great, bit quick",3.0,,"I should start out by stating that we went to River Safari (RS) straight after the Zoo. After you've seen the Singapore Zoo any other exhibit is a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong, the RS was very educational and informative. But it was quick. I feel like they could add more attractions, exhibits, or even animals. The biggest attraction of RS was the pandas. Which seemed out of place when the whole point of RS was rivers and water conservation. I liked RS, but if I had planned a whole day for this I would have been disappointed."
,,Fun educational river safari,4.0,,"Very fun, educational river safari! Lots of exotic animals such as panda, manatee, giant crocodiles, Python, jaguar, polar bear, and other unusual fishes! Very well- maintained facility and cleanliness."
,,Sensational River Safari,5.0,,"Our visit to the Singapore River Safari far exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed every moment of our stay and would recommend you go if you have time on your hands as it probably took a few hours to go through, looking at all the attractions. We saw our first Pandas and numerous other fish life that amazed us. The attractions are incredible! Plus you can get a meal there as well....! A very clean cafe with proficient staff and good food at reasonable prices! Don't take a taxi, it's very easy to get a train and then change to a bus...very cheap and you get to see the sights and experience the friendly local people. A must do when you go to Singapore!"
,,Nice place,4.0,,"This place is not crowded compare to Universal Studio given its main attraction is fishes (and a pair of panda).
Not as many attractions as Singapore Zoo, but it was a nice place to be especially if you like to see fishes and try to avoid jumpinh into huge crowds."
,,Waste of time and money,2.0,,We visited this as it was a latest addition from the last time we visited in 2006...........It is nothing but a ride on the boat around the zoo which shows you animals from far off........which you can actually go and see inside the zoo.......this attraction can be replaced by other attractions in Singapore as it is a total waste of time
,,Cool animals,4.0,,"The River Safari has some really cool aquatic animals, including manatees! The tanks are organized by region where the animals could be found. We did not take the River Cruise or Amazon River Cruise because the former seemed to just be a boat ride on the river, and on the latter it seemed that you could see animals that were at the zoo, right next to the River Safari"
,,Fantastic River Safari,5.0,,Throughly enjoyed the River Safari. Best part was seeing the two Panda Bears and the incredible Polar Bear underwater.
,,Pleasant day out,4.0,,The River Safari was a nice day out. Its not too exhausting (not like the zoo) so if you want something less taxing then this might be for you. The animals are all displayed according to which river they live in and quite a bit of information is provided. In Singaporean fashion everything is very clean and ordered. The Amazon boat ride is closed for maintenance for a couple of months (so I can't comment on that). My favourite part was the boat ride in the main lake. I got to see the giraffes from the water. I love those guys!
,,Need to make it a bit adventurous/Excitement/Thrill,3.0,,"River Safari is a place where one can actually take a glimpse of living creatures like fish/animals found in rivers like Amazon, Nile, Ganges etc. So, if you are an admirer of animals/fish or have inquisitiveness, you may like to spend your time along with your kids. You can also see Panda in a forest surrounded by Perspex. One can also enjoy Amazon River Quest & Boat ride.

It's a short tour of apx 3 hours & the management may like to review whether existing attraction is good enough to attract tourists on such a high package. More adventurous/thrill rides may be introduced or else it will be classified as ""Aquarium"" only in near future."
,,A Different 'Zoo' Attraction,3.0,,"The River Safari focuses on animals and fish that may be seen on or in the many great Rivers and a choice of a boat ride within a river allows an up close view of many animals that are normally reclusive. The area is linked by a board walk and includes a panda enclosure with the most agile and cute Panda in a huge jungle surrounded by Perspex, an aquarium with a range of other animals. The directions were a little difficult to follow and staff were keen to take photographs at a number of 'experiences'. Ideally a second boat trip (a choice was required between the safari boat or a river ride) that takes visitors down the river should also be part of an inclusive deal as the experience was completed in around 2-3 hours and was of a similar charge to the Singapore Zoo."
,,Nice but a little boring,2.0,,There weren't not much to see. The panda was really adorable and riding boat might be a little boring.
,,Nice collection of under water creatures and cute pandas,5.0,,"We spend several hours in River Safari as our kids love to see the animals up close. There is good collection of all kinds of living creatures that live in the water. The area that we can see the pandas and red pandas is nice and cool. You can add more excitement by joining the Amazon River Quest and be prepared to get wet if you sit in the front row. The manatees shown in the aquarium are so huge, in fact, they are the biggest we've ever seen. We really enjoy visiting the River Safari. Free wifi is also available through out the park."
,,not worth the visit,2.0,,"We went to the river safari and walked by numerous tanks of fish and went for a less exciting ride on the boat. Then went on the even more less than exciting ride on the rapids ride.
The only exciting sight we saw was the swimming of manatees around in a very large tank and a baby manatee playing with the vacuum hose of the person cleaning the tank"
,,Day out with the family,3.0,,"It's a small attraction, with small exhibits inside, and an average internal ride (which you have to pay for if you don't have a membership).

we purchased the annual membership and used it several times, so it worked out well.

but for a one-time fee, it is expensive, and the attractions are just not that exciting.

there are some highlights:
1. the crocodiles -- if they moved -- were a visual treat
2. the manatees ... those fellas are huge
3. the pandas
4. the giant catfish
5. the little monkeys ... watched them excrete on a poor unsuspecting lady once

ok, so i'm bumping this to an average rating on account of the manatees.

food is expensive. bring your own."
,,A must visit place!,5.0,,"They have pandas here! Great atmosphere. Many covered areas, not a problem to visit on light down pour days. Animals look healthy and well fed. An educational visit definitely."
,,A local experience,4.0,,Went with a group of friends with children. Enjoyed watching the pandas and the cruise. The rest of the place was subdivided into famous rivers of the world and with fishes in the tanks. Good for those who love watching these fishes. There was just...More
,,A total waste of time and money,2.0,,River safari is a big disappointment. The pictures look very attractive but going there we were extremely disappointed. It was more like an aquarium and not a safari. The entry ticket is also quite high (28 dollars) but does not include the boat ride. Walking...More
,,River Safari...An extremely enjoyable experience!,4.0,,"My friend and I went for a day trip to Singapore's newest wildlife park, River Safari. Located next to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, this park has a wide collection of aquatic creatures. Each are divided into 7 major river systems across the world:...More"
,,Did not enjoy,3.0,,"The pandas were the hit, however they were lazy and hiding when we got there. the river tours were not operating either, a waste of money i feel."
,,River Safari,3.0,,"I am quiet disappointed with River Safari. I am expect something awesome like Singapore Zoo but it's not really special after all. It's true that they have hundreds of river specimens and some of them were endangered species, but I don't think i want to...More"
,,River safari,3.0,,"Took public bus to river safari which stops just outside. First stage is walking through different aquarium areas where there is information on different rivers and aquatic life from different parts of the world. Pandas were the highlight and definitely worth seeing. Both were awake,...More"
,,See Pandas and river creatures set in the natural habitats!,4.0,,"This park is located next to Singapore Zoo and Nigh Safari. The most famous exhibit here is the Pandas, which are on loan from China. You enter an air-conditioned building, which is set to be like a forest. Depending on the time of the day...More"
,,A disapointment,2.0,,We paid for this and went before the zoo - total waste of money and time as we went on a boat around the island with a brief history lesson. Managed to see an elephants back from a distance and no other animals at all....More
,,River Safari,4.0,,Its a lovely amazing safari for kids as well as adults. It has been planned in a very attractive way and you must visit when in singapore
,,"Interesting mix - aquariums, panda and river rides",4.0,,"A really enjoyable morning out. We went by public bus that stops at the entrance. Lots of fish in tanks and pools, then panda and even a polar bear. The first river ride was a little disappointing as many of the animals were hiding however...More"
,,good day out,5.0,,"Good attraction if you have already done the Zoo and bird park, takes about 3 - 4 hours, well laid out and covered walkways through out, so the rain or excessive heat from the sun wont be as issue. the highlights are the Pandas and the large display for the manatees with a small auditorium style seating to realx and enjoy these great mammals.
there are 2 boat rides - the river cruize or the amazon river quest, the amazon river quest is the better of the 2 as you see more animals.
The only negative is that there was no vegeretain food available inside, so if you are vegeterian plan ahead."
,,"Small, can be covered within 2 hours",4.0,,"A really small park as compared to the Singapore Zoo, the only real thing of interest (to me) in River Safari are the 2 pandas. The rest are mostly just fishes swimming in tanks.

There are also 2 rides you can enjoy within the park, each costing 5 SGD, or 8 SGD when you buy both. I happened to go for both and I will just say that the Amazon ride went by really quickly and don't ever get a seat in front. There's a reason why it's called the 'Splash!' seat. As for the River Cruise, get a seat on the left as that's the side closest to the animals, and also the side that doesn't leave you hapless in the face of the merciless Singapore Sun at 3 to 5pm.

I finished the park in 2 hours, but had more time to kill as I was going to Night Safari later. I ended up returning to the pandas' enclosure, where I enjoyed the aircon and watched JiaJia amble up and down the length of her enclosure and KaiKai eat bamboo for a good 1.5 hour."
,,Educational with a large aquarium,5.0,,"The River Safari can be toured in about 2-3 hours leisurely on a weekday, including a 15 minutes River Cruise and 10 minutes Amazonia Boat Tour. The attraction ends at a large aquarium which has many large fish (catfish, and carp, etc).

Quite educational for family with young children, and I highly recommend the Amazonia Boat Ride which we saw 2 jaguars."
,,Unique and educating,4.0,,"I havent seen freshwater exhibits quite like this one. Although the aquarium tanks at the first part of the tour were so so, but the Manatee freshwater aquarium were quite an exhibit. With a large, flat glass panel that spanned the entire wall of a dimmed auditorium-like room, it was hard not to be impressed. You feel like you literally stand at the bottom of the river, looking up. It was serene, beautiful and educating at the same time. Dont forget the panda exhibits : Jia jia and Kai kai are super adorable !"
,,Pleasant for animal lovers!,4.0,,"The Amazon River Cruise is quite entertaining with the animals close by. The other river cruise (the one is the Reservoir) can be quite fun if a few animals can be spotted. The forest area surrounds the reservoir and the animals roam free, so if it is not too sunny neither rainy, then at least elephants can be seen from the boat.
The 2 pandas are adorable, especially if they have just woken up from a nap and are stretching. The polar bear can also be viewed.
All in all not a bad attraction to spend about 3-4 hours with family/friends."
,,Rip off,1.0,,"Just attended the much lauded Singapore Zoo River Safari, now wishing I hadn't bothered. Aside from the fact that the whole attraction hasn't been finished and is staffed by untrained simpletons, it is actually comprised of four components.
1. A walk through average looking aquarium tanks.
2. A stroll past a Panda.
3. A 10 min putter on a boat in a large loop looking a Singapore Zoos fenceline seeing nothing but one elephant, just.
4. An optional ride thru an extra few animals at an additional cost to the already expensive entry tickets.

Avoid the River Safari. IT REALLY ISN'T WORTH IT.
I honestly wouldn't take anyone here even if it were free."
,,Learnt lots about rivers of the world,4.0,,"It was pouring with rain when we visited however it is all undercover. We really enjoyed the wide variety of exhibits & the great information about each river.
Friendly staff and the whole place is well organised.
I think families with children aged 8-18 years would really enjoy it."
,,Meet Tjia Tjia & Kai Kai,5.0,,"Here we can meet Panda -Tjia Tjia and Kai Kai, lucky enough both Pandas go walk around n we can have pictures of them. Have many collection of river fish ... Specially Cows n Calves. Inside did have river cruise or boat ride, superb experience that Singapore did have wild scenic view."
,,If you have time and nothing else to do...,2.0,,"I went to the river cruise boat ride and the river safari on the same day as I went to the zoo, after the zoo in June 2015. You can see everything you see in the zoo trip, at the safari but not in such detail and close up. So the zoo trip is much better. I wold not recommend the safari boat ride. The safari itself was nothing great. I would give it a skip completely. There is the giant panda, some fish exhibits, the boat ride, a store and the only think you would maybe enjoy is a large tank with large fish in it including Manatee. There is a theater like seating area and if you have time to spare then watch this like you watch construction."
,,Not worth it...,2.0,,A 15 min on the boat with a distance view of greenery and nothing much. you can avoid the river safari and instead spend your time watching the zoo and the various other activities and sight seeing around River safari.
,,My kids were not really excited but enjoyed squirel monkey,2.0,,"Overpriced, not worth for money, the ticket plus boat ride is s$33, my kids were not really excited when they saw the exhibition, we covered that in just a couple of hours, no animal show, Amazon quest is a 10 min boat ride and there were not much animal around, even they charge s$5 for that ride.

The only thing my kids enjoyed was the squirel monkeys, they come near and thump around"
,,Don't miss the squirrel monkeys!,5.0,,"Everyone comes here for the pandas, and they are so adorable... But they're quite often found sleeping and the crowds they attract make it hard for one to really appreciate them.

The highlight for me has always been the free ranging squirrel monkeys who have a whole enclosure to themselves. They're free to come right up to you and they can often be found sitting on the handrails right along the guided path of the enclosure. They're simply one of the cutest things on this planet so you must make sure you don't miss them.

The Singapore Zoo is a magical place and hands down the best zoo in the world. The River Safari adds to what is already something that is a must see when visit ting Singapore with children of all ages."
,,Avoid it -- sheer time waste,1.0,,"Don't know why we did this, plus the Amazon River quest. The River Safari is totally overrated, we found it absolutely waste of time and its tiring to walk upto the boarding platform and then have a sun bath in the middle of the River. All we saw was tail of an elephant, nothing else. No animals nothing to see actually.

Avoid at all costs, save time and money!"
,,Average exhibits compared to the zoo but worth a visit,3.0,,"Worth to visit once just to see the panda. Smaller scale compared to the zoo and we finished the park in 2 hours. For someone who has limited time on hand, I would recommend the zoo over this river safari."
,,Nice place for children and adults,4.0,,"Enjoyable place for the kids and adults alike, the place is mostly covered so it is nice for those that dont want to be in the sun much. The highlight would be the pandas."
,,Interesting aquariums and displays but small,3.0,,"I enjoyed my morning at the Singapore River Safari as part of a four park package. Being a weekday there were fewer people so there was little waiting time at the attractions. The pandas bears were active, the aquariums were clean and full of life and the manatees were swimming. Unfortunately, there is a smaller range of animals when compared to the nearby zoo, the ""monkey experience"" only opens in the afternoons on a weekday and the river boat ride that was necessary to see several animals (deliberately no pathways?) was an additional cost! ($5 each trip). Unfortunately, the Safari Cruise was included in the package. This 15 minute short trip by boat on the lake was ordinary at best - it could have been much better and should travel further and for a longer period of time. Basically the ""Cruise boat"" sailed past a few cages from the nearby zoo and Night Safari. We saw very little. The staff were generally friendly. I travelled to the River Safari by public transport from the city via bus then MRT and then bus (cost under $2 in total). For the return journey I travelled on one of the buses offering $3 fares direct to several key locations in the city."
,,Great visit,4.0,,A great place to go just to see some of the wildlife that Singapore doesn't have. A nice place to bring your kids sight-seeing.
,,Great,5.0,,"We decided to do the River Safari as we had been to the Zoo a couple of times now and the River Safari is a fairly new attraction in Singapore and it is attached to the Singapore Zoo. We arrived by public transport which is really easy in Singapore using the MRT and buses as the Zoo etc are quite away from the City . We purchased our entrance tickets and began a leisurely stroll through the River Safari which tells the story of various River systems throughout the world , with wildlife from all of these regions . It is a really good example of a well thought out concept . It is both Educational and entertaining and also is not completely taken over by stupid Tourists and their ""Selfies"". We paid an extra $5 for the River ride which I felt was great value, although you may not see all of the animals as they are in there natural environment and can be hard to see. It is still worth it."
,,Peaceful and leisurely,5.0,,"Enjoyed the river safari a lot because unlike most Singapore attractions (and most of Singapore), it isn't packed to the gills with noisy people pushing their way around. You can take your time, wander around the outside areas, then go inside and sit and watch the manatees which is quite calming. No there's not as much to do as the zoo, but that's kind of the charm really, you can spend a few hours or however much you want without feeling pressured to rush around just to take your snapshot of every animal. Sometimes it's good to just sit and watch them for a bit rather than running from point to point."
,,a memorable experience,4.0,,"i guess the best part about this place was the amazon quest..they take u through the boat , and along the way u see plenty of animals in its environment...perhaps thats the reason they have named it the river safari..
there are plenty of animals to see in the river safari, but if u are visiting the zoo, or the night safari, one can miss this one....!!!!
my kids had a lovely time though ,at this attraction...and if u havekids too, u must see it...remember u will have a marathon walk though ..."
,,Only for Panda and RS BOAT,4.0,,"Getting here, we exit at ANG MO KIO MRT, then took the escalator as we turn right going down, walk straight, then another elevator to go up. Then you will see bus terminal. Look for BUS NO. 138 to take you directly to River Safari. I also recommend To purchase EZ Link for your convenience for payment at the MRT and at the bus.

Last year we were here, the Pandas were asleep. We got lucky this year because one panda is awake and eating. What an experience!

I also recommend to take the RS boat, additional payment. But its worth it. Another way to enjoy the safari for close encounter."
,,If It Is Raining Don't Bother,3.0,,"I purchased entry as a package with Singapore Zoo. This park is relatively new and some parts and exhibits arent actually finished. The day I was there it was raining, so both boat cruises were suspended for the day (which rendered parts of the park inaccessable). The best part is probably the Panda (because they seem to be quite rare- even in captivity) and Squirrell Monkey exhibits (because you are inside the exhibit with them and up very close while they swing around the trees). This park took only about an hour to go around even walking slowly, so if you do go, packageit up with either the Zoo, Night Safari or both."
,,"Not what I was expecting, but more than meets the eye...",4.0,,"Looking at the River Safari website, I must have missed the concept of what it actually was, and that there are several parts to the visit. First there is the exhibits associated with the major rivers of the world. These are giant outdoor aquariums where you wander by (under shadecloth) with fish literally swimming up to your nose. Then there's the Panda enclosure. Dont forget to look up for the Red Panda. Not as big, but as cute as their 'not closely related' black and white relatives. From there its on to a sedate river cruise (15 mins) which - when we were there - had no waiting time. What you see depends on time, weather etc. From the water we saw giraffes quite close as they were at the back of their zoo enclosure shying away from the hundreds of tourists there. Also an elephant. Not a highlight part of the visit by OK if you don't have to wait long. From there to the Amazon River Quest ride. Need to do it twice - once to look, another to photograph!. Then there's a wander through the squirrel monkey forest - an enclosure where these small creatures dart over you, under you, and sometimes in your bags (and prams!). Finally there's the Amazon flooded forest - a giant aquarium with multiple underwater views and an 'on top' view. Leave time at the end of your trip to just sit and watch this exhibit. There's the usual food, photos and souviners - all of which we bypassed. Got an express bus from the CBD (with a hotel pickup) - easiest and quickest way to get there. After thinking we'd be in and out quite quickly, spent 4 hrs plus there. Well worth a visit"
,,Pandas,5.0,,"Loved the trip to River Safari. The boat ride was good but the Amazon quest was worth the extra money. The highlight had to be the Pandas, went early but they were sleeping. Went back after the boat trips, so glad we did. They were both out, moving around and were so entertaining. Very lucky to have seen them both. Great day."
,,Fun educational experience,4.0,,"I wanted to give a positive review after reading the recent less than positive reactions. I think this is an attraction that people will experience differently depending on their expectations and interests.

We were 2 adults - 20 something age son and middle-age (sigh) mom. We enjoyed the River Safari, relaxing in the air conditioned facility and reading the information about the fish and animals in the different river systems. I think it was interesting for us since it was possible to approach as an ""educational experience"", not just seeing different fish swimming in large tanks. The river fish aren't as colorful as those that we saw at SEA Aquarium in Sentosa, but that's the point of River Safari - we could compare the different river systems and their wildlife. Perhaps it helps that we are from the Midwest USA and experience freshwater Lake Michigan and Mississippi River ecosystems. River Safari expanded on this background.

I was aware of mixed reviews as we walked through the facility and we commented that we were pleasantly surprised based on others' feedback. We thought that the exhibits might be more interesting for older grade school age children who could appreciate the environments being displayed. (We both work with children professionally.) There were many families touring with us that had pre-schoolers, however. I didn't see anyone who looked bored. My only thought was that I would have liked more - not that I thought River Safari as it exists now is small, I just enjoyed the displays so much I would have liked more of them.

The red pandas were active while we were there - cute, cute, cute. Only one of the larger pandas was out - sound asleep. Still, it was fun to see pandas.

We took both the River Quest and Safari Cruise. I made the mistake of sitting in the sun on the Safari Cruise. Few animals were out and there was a young child who continually shouted his excitement at seeing the lone elephant, so we couldn't hear the commentary. I would skip this ride next time. The River Quest was fun. The animals were out and close to the boat for viewing. I enjoyed this ride, but it is short. I would skip if the lines and wait were long.

I would definitely return to River Safari."
,,An Average Attraction Overall,3.0,,"My trip to the river safari was back in 2014, in short the main highlight for the entire park would be the panda and the river cruise, the queue for the river cruise would take a bit of your time over there as well.

To summarize my experience for river safari, if you're a keen animal lover my advise would be visit the Singapore Zoological Garden which is just a few min walk away from River Safari...... Unless you are there for the panda...."
,,Different experience from normal aquarium,4.0,,"What would you expect from aquarium?

Normally, you can see shark, coral, dolphins and sea lion shows...etc., but none of the above can be found in the River Safari.

Yes, we are talking about rivers.

The River Safari guide you through the Mississippi River, Congo River, River Nile, Ganges River, Mekong River, Yangtze River and definitely you can't miss the Amazon River.

You can see over 200 species of animal which are living in or around the rivers, from those over 1000kg Manatee, the Jaguar to the small monkeys. Some of the animals are not easy to be found in other aquarium.

And don't miss the Amazon River Quest. A tip for you: don't try to capture the animal by your camera, watch and capture them by your eyes and mind.

Lastly, the food in the mama Panda kitchen is quite nice, unlike other theme parks."
,,Amazing to get to see the Pandas,3.0,,"The ticket to the river safari was discounted with the zoo ticket, if one could visit both on the same day. We entered at around 3.00 pm after visiting the zoo in the first half. The boat cruise was just a ride on the Selatar reservoir and was quite mundane. But I guess tourists might find the history and the scene fascinating. especially the efforts taken for its maintenance. The amazon river cruise was very artificial and needs much imaginative improvement. The queues for both were long and the wait time was as long as 40 minutes. The only spectacular thing to watch in this part of the zoo are the pandas. We could watch very closely their antiques and it was a real pleasure. As are most areas in Singapore! very beautifully maintained. But unlike the zoo, not worth going more than once, unless of course you are a panda fan."
,,"If you an animal lover, this is your choice.",3.0,,"Nothing special, because I have been many zoos. It was okay. You can enjoy your time with many kinds of animal."
,,If u are a fish lover,3.0,,"If you are the fish lover ,you must go for this place. Different kind of fish , colourful and huge. Interesting with panda can try to visit,if not i rather choose for zoo. The price is not cheap and the boat ride is only abt 15 mins."
,,can give it a miss..!,2.0,,"What a sham! It is so average its not funny. Complete waste of time. The only thing worth seeing were the Pandas (thankfully airconditioned compartment), but all the animals are so fed up of tourists and the heat that they turn their back on to you or hide in the bushes!
No effort is made to feed the animals or do something so the tourists get their money's worth of visuals! We took the Amazon boat ride and didnt see the black cat. It was hiding! only saw a few flamingos.
Most of the animals are behind a glass wall, you cant even tell if its alive or not.
Be prepared to deal with the heat! They need to install water mists systems and large fans like in other countries safari parks!
There are dining options inside and outside, but mostly Singaporean and Malaysian
cuisine! Its about time they need more variety added which need not be super over priced just because its a tourist attraction!"
,,love the amazon boat ride,5.0,,"We (me, my husband, and my 4.5 year old son) went to visit river safari after we visited the zoo.
I thought it would be boring but I was pleasantly entertained during the visit.
Bought the entrance ticket+boat ride. There are two boat rides, the cruise and the amazon river quest, we took the latter one, and it's so much fun!
The track for river safari is very clear, so we just follow the track throughout the ""river"" which actually collection of aquariums filled with animals that fit the river theme. There are quite a lot of enormous aquariums, and it's amazing how everything is so neat and well kept.
There also two cute pandas here (I don't really understand why don't they put the pandas on the zoo).
No water tap, food is available in front of the next door zoo.
I think two hours visit of the safari would be enough."
,,A real surprise!,5.0,,"After walking the Singapore Zoo for most of the day, we decided to check out the River Safari next door! It was a real surprise - really interesting, easy to navigate, great exhibits. The major river zones of the world were explored. A real surprise was finding the the two pandas living there - and a wonderful walk through enclosure with monkeys! The displays are all freshwater environments so very different to the normal aquarium. The last aquarium you come across is breathtaking - a giant freshwater aquarium that is viewed below and above the water. The dugongs and large fish had so much space! There is a river ""cruise"" - not worth the $5 for the trip! It only goes out onto the resevoir and you get told about giraffe hair and ostrich eggs. The river ""ride"", though, is really good as you get up close to numerous riverside animals - it was good fun. If you're going to Singapore don't miss going to the River Safari!"
,,Small but nice,4.0,,"Lets face it... the only reason I came was to see the pandas. I was not disappointed! I could have watched them all day if I could. There were also other highlights such as the manatees, but otherwise it's pretty much ~$30 just to go and see some pandas. I was expecting more stuff for the price but it is pretty small. It is wheelchair friendly. I'm not sure I would go back again but it's definitely worth ~$30 to see the pandas, red pandas (firefox!), manatees, and other stuff at least once in your life if you haven't seen them before. If the pandas weren't there, it probably wouldn't be worth $30."
,,PANDAS,5.0,,"Yes!! The highlight was the pandas for us. After being told buy our hotel that there were pandas in the zoo witch unfortunately there weren't we then brought tickets for the river safari witch was an awesome experience it is a bit of a walk around, however there are some awesome animals that you may not have seen anywhere else. They also have a smaller ride there as well witch takes you through some enclosures and things all so much fun truly and awesome experience. We did singapore zoo, the night safari and river safari in the same day :)"
,,Unexpectedly small zoo,4.0,,"This zoo wasn't what we were expecting. First it was small and easily accessible for young kids to walk around which was great. But it was more of a one way tour last various enclosures than a ""river"" zoo as perhaps we had expected.
The river safari ride that apparently books out sometimes was very overrated. It was really just a short cruise around the back of some enclosures - for example the jaguar park cruised past with nothing to see. My four year old loved the ""ride"" though so maybe it was designed with kids in mind."
,,Fantastic! Pram/Wheelchair friendly.,5.0,,"I spent a lot of my childhood at the Singapore Zoological Gardens and the River Safari (along with Night Safari) are in the same area. Everything is well presented. Area very easy to move prams and wheelchairs around (Except for one ride which is clearly highlighted on the web site)

Panda's are in an air conditioned area which is popular for many reasons. Feel free to go early to the panda's but as the river safari area is not very big, you can double back to the beginning.

We had a fun surprise when we started with the morning feeding session with the snapping turtles. It turns out that the feeding session leads into a little tour from start to end exhibits with little breaks in between. Our keeper was very jovial and presented things well. Certainly a great experience for children and adults alike.

The little ferry ride around the reservoir is very cleverly done as well. You see into part of the zoo enclosures and the reservoir is so well forested that you would never know you were in the middle of the vibrant city.

Highly recommend a visit to the River Safari. Go early when it's still cool though."
,,Pandas away to mate!,5.0,,"From the zoo, we walked to River Safari where aquatic animals are grouped according to their habitats in the great rivers of the world. It was interesting to see and relate them to the rivers. The walkways past the aquariums are sheltered, providing a comfortable visit.

Unfortunately, at the Giant Panda Forest, we did not see the 2 giant pandas as they were removed for mating! However, we saw the red pandas. The multi-storeyed aquarium at Amazon Flooded Forest was very interesting.

Both Singapore Zoo and River Safari are fantastic zoos and a great opportunity to learn about and appreciate the animal kingdom."
,,"Admire Pandas, not behind glass walls",5.0,,"I have visited several zoos, but Spore has done it very well to exhibit the pandas in a cool enclosure but with open- concept so you can admire n take pictures of JiaJia n KaiKai without the glass walls which prove to be challenging for aspiring photographers.

Don't miss the Boat ride ($5 additional)... Though the ride is short, you get to see several other animals not visible when u are on the walk path. I especially enjoyed seeing Jaguars (much more majestic looking than leopards) n bright red colored birds, etc....

River Safari also offers water related creatures, like Alligators n there's also Alligator-Turtles with alligator like mouth/beak! Also a underwater theater where u view stingrays, manatees, and many other fishes..."
,,I went there for the pandas but found some of the exhibits interesting too :>,4.0,,"I had wanted to visit River Safari for the pandas, and after my friend told me it's ""pretty interesting"", I scooted down the moment I could go on leave. We arrived around 9.15am the day before Labour Day and were one of the few people roaming around as it was a workday. We took our time walking around and had a bit of fun playing spot-the-creature as we moved from tank to tank. There were many swimming creatures and some caught our attention with their metallic skin, duck beak-like mouths, giraffe print etc. The paddlefish is quite a hoot. The two huge crocodiles were stunners with armour-like hide and powerful-looking tails.

We did not manage to spot all the animals, as can be expected, and did not get up close and personal with the monkeys as the Squirrel Monkey Forest area was open only after 1.30pm on weekdays, so if the kids want to do this, do check the opening hours.

To reach the pandas, you have to cover about half of the entire route, so that might take 1 hour, depending on how much time you spend gaping at the piranhas, queer-looking catfish etc. We finally got to the pandas. Jia Jia was about to, ARGGGH, retreat into her cave when she heard a snap. Something had fallen to the ground. She looked down and saw a bamboo stick, so she sat down and proceeded to chomp on it. She spent quite a bit of time doing this, so we went to see Kai Kai, who was also chomping away, but on his back with his legs splayed open. He really looked like he was having a good time. When we went back to Jia Jia, she was still busy with her food. They munched and munched and munched. Finally, Jia Jia got up and walked around the compound, giving us slow fingers a chance to take multiple shots of her. Thank you JJ for your cooperation!

The red pandas were cute too. One climbed onto a tree branch hanging overhead and I saw it peering down at me, perhaps weighing its chances of successfully landing on my head and making a break for freedom... Another one walked round and round near the glass enclosure panels, much to the delight of camera-toting school children. I could not decide if the red panda was stressed or if it was simply scent-marking. The shop near the panda compound carries merchandise not available at the shop near the entrance, so if you see something you like here, buy it there and then, especially the panda-themed stuff, as this shop has the entire collection.

I like the manatees. The scene was kind of dream-like with the blue water and dim lighting. I saw two manatees getting intimate and later one hugged the other from behind, awwwww.

We took the Amazon River Quest ride. The staff kindly asked if we would mind getting wet, and then made arrangements for us to sit in the third row so we could stay dry. The boat ride was short, maybe 10 minutes, but it went pretty fast so we were busy whipping our necks to the left and to the right. There were wolves and flamingoes and tapirs and monkeys etc and we came pretty close to the red birds, but we did not manage to see everything.

I think I saw at least one new exhibit under preparation, so I might make another trip, but not anytime soon, cos I am not into swimming creatures, so the pandas made all the difference to me..."
,,Panda,4.0,,"Well worth a visit, at the time of our visit the Panda were awake and walking around, this is the first place i have ever been to that have see that normally the Pandas are a sleep and don't for get to do the ride"
,,WELL WORTH THE EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"Having already been to the adjacent attractions of the Zoo & Night Safari & with limited time on this trip in Singapore we were fortunate to be able to catch a SAEX Bus right outside our Hotel - The Peninsular Excelsior. Because we bought the entrance & Bus tickets on the Bus at arrival we were given a discounted price. For example our return Bus trip cost $10.00S & obtained a few dollars off the entrance fee. Our tickets also entitled us to a ""Free"" boat trip down the ""Amazon River"". The exhibits take you along covered walk ways past aquariums & live animals from the Mississippi ,Nile ,Ganges, Mekong & Yangtze Rivers. Beautifully done."
,,"ok ,,,, once and done",3.0,,"The river safari is right between the Singapore Zoo and Night Zoo. It is a separate park and requires a separate ticket. It is not as big as the zoo. It is more of an enlarged aquarium with some animal exhibits. There is boat ride along the lake which is not really worth it. The log type ride is refreshing but you do not see too many animals and since it is constantly moving, you do not get a really good look at them. If you have a whole day, you could do all three parks but it would make for a very long day. The exhibits are interesting covering the different major river systems of the world but I do not think it is worth the separate admission. This falls into I did it once but probably not again."
,,different look of singapore,4.0,,"For children and more green and nature feel, try river safari. located in a 1 stop area along with the singapore zoo and night safari. from city center, around sgd20+. if not, can use MRT and continue with bus.

the highlight of the place are kai kai and jia jia the panda which nested in a cooler area. the place is well built to accommodate the wild life.

there are several place to dine near the ticket counter.

with additional sgd5, which can be bought inside, we can ride a small boat in the amazon river, pay attention to the children minimum heights for the boat trip."
,,Well Worth A Visit,4.0,,"Wasn't sure what to expect here but its basically a reproduction of various famous rivers from around the world with giant pandas & all sorts of other wildlife, alot of which is underwater in superb aquariums.

Our visit included a really good boat trip which I would like to have repeated but even though the place was empty we were told we couldn't (not sure why...).

Unfortunately we had a limited time here & would like to have stayed longer but its a lovely place, full of interesting stuff & well worth a visit."
,,Wonderful visit to see the pandas!,5.0,,"We visited here in December 2014 on our stopover in Singapore before our return home to the UK- we loved it. The highlight was the pandas - they were beautiful and the boat trip around the reservoir was good too. We dropped into Mama's Panda Kitchen and tried the Panda Pau dessert, it was very nice!"
,,Really enjoyable day out,4.0,,"I really could not make up my mind about this one, after reading the reviews I was not that keen to go but had promised my daughter we would see the pandas. And very pleased we went.
We enjoyed the boat ride, maybe we are better animal spotters than others, or maybe the animals just happened to be out when we did it! It helped that we went midweek - I imagine it would be very frustrating to fight the crowds and wait in long lines for what is admittedly quite a short ride.
Loved Kai Kai, the otters and the manatees, and the other less dramatic exhibits were also interesting & well done.
Would really have loved to have done the zoo too, but time did not permit. Still happy with our choice though, we saw a lot of animals we had not seen before.

One thing which was frustrating was trying to get to the zoo in the first place!! Remembered that we had to get tickets at Suntec. Which turned out to be an enormous maze of shops and offices. NOTE: Get off at Esplanade MRT and follow signs to Suntec City Mall. It'll save a lot of time. The ticket booth is next to the Adidas shop on the outside of the Mall (Nicoll Hwy) You can get off at a number of stops along Orchard Road on your return trip. (think you may also be able to get onto the bus at those points too …)"
,,Ok OK.. not compulsory,3.0,,"We visited river safari, it took about 3 hours to see all and do the boat ride. Its good for first timer, but i think SEA world at Sentosa is much better than this. Anyways if you have no time and want to see one aquarium then this is a choice. Underwater world at sentosa is other choice. SO dont have all three in yur visit list and have only one of this.
CAUTION : Nothing vegetarian option for food inside, Be prepared if yu are vegetarian and with children."
,,AMAZING PANDAS!,5.0,,"We only visited here, as I've always wanted to see Pandas and thought this opportunity was too good to miss. We had a short day in Singapore from the cruise ship. Had done no homework on the zoo, just knew where the Pandas were and was determined to see them! I hadn't realised how far out of Singapore the zoos are. We took the MRT from the cruise terminal and was told it would probably take us an hour to get there. In fact it took nearer 2 hours in the end! The MRT train took 30 mins to get to the stop we needed, then we had to cross over the road/underpass to the bus station and get the bus to the zoo. This was the unpleasant part of the journey, as it was stuffed full and stopped at practically every stop! We paid approx. £13-14 each to enter the River Safari. I personally don't think this is too expensive, the attraction is very modern and well kept and they're having to care for rare animals/reptiles, which must cost a fortune with all the specialist care and attention they need 24/7.
I have to admit, as time was very limited for us, as we had to prepare ourselves for a possible 2 hour trip back to get our ship, time was very precious, and as my only real purpose was to see the pandas, I literally rushed through all the reptiles/fish, with only a fleeting glance, as I didn't want to shorten my panda visit.
The Panda enclosures are lovely. They are very pretty and attractive and SO cool with the air con, which is a welcome feeling against the heat and humidity of Singapore! You are told to whisper only and not use flash on your cameras. The Pandas weren't out when we arrived, and their food was being laid out and hid. We waited for a short few minutes for the hatch to go up and then there was a collective gasp as Kai Kai poked his head out and plodded out into the enclosure! It was a feeling I won't forget! I felt very honoured to be able to witness such a beautiful, rare animal so up close and wow, was he on form! It was as if he was performing for us! The keepers hide/place his food and titbits well, so that everyone can get a good view of him as he wanders from one area to another. He obviously knows where the food is going to be and is proud to put himself on display - he was awesome! We then went through to see Jia Jia. She is apparently much shyer and doesn't always make an appearance, but we were lucky and she had quite a good romp about to find her food, though she didn't put herself quite on ""display"", as Kai Kai wanted to!
Our long, uncomfortable bus journey had been worth it, once we'd seen the Pandas, it is something I will always treasure. And thankfully, the bus ride back was only about 25 mins and much more comfortable!
The souvenir shops in the River Safari are well supplied with a whole host of goodies and in my opinion, well priced and not too expensive. I also think the same about the small amount of food and drink we bought here too. I feel they could have priced things higher and people would still have bought them, so it was nice to see them not abusing the situation. Rest rooms were clean, modern and plentiful.
I wished we had more time to visit the main Zoo, as I'm sure that must be amazing if the River Safari doesn't compare, as in my opinion, it was full of amazing creatures, all well housed and cared for."
,,rather disappointment than satisfaction,2.0,,"As compared to the other parks, unfortunately this was no good. By the time we arrived at past 10 am, the next available boat slot was after 3 pm. The property isn't that big, for sure not that big enough to spend 4+ hrs waiting for the boat slot, with 3 young kids. The pandas compound was good, but apart from that nothing special. Personally wouldn't recommend, not worth it, unless if seeing the giant pandas is your main goal."
,,As only Singapore can do.,5.0,,"Fantastic !!!! To be able to see all the creatures of each of the major rivers is amazing. The 2 Pandas were awesome & 1 in particular was very interactive, climbing trees etc. the Amazon River cruise for $5 was great value. The entire park was extremely well done."
,,Pay if you want to see all the sights,2.0,,"The place has a good collection of aquatic and amphibious animals living in the various river habitats. Half the park is friendly to families with prams and young children as there is a path for prams.

As for the other half. I would say it is not very welcoming.
First of all, that part is only accessible via a boat ride, which you have to pay additional to get on. This means that you are forced to pay additional if you want to see all the attractions, not sure why that is excluded from the entrance fee. It is understandable if the additional is for riding on the boat, but there is no other way of exploring that part without paying to take the Boat.
Secondly the park also states that only people who are able to get on the boat on their own can use the ride. This excludes families with children and the disabled.

So, in summary, this is a place with many unique exhibits, but unfortunately these exhibits are not for families with children and the disabled."
,,Not comparable with the zoo,3.0,,It's not there yet. The Singapore zoo is outstanding. One of the best I have ever seen. The Night Safari is really fun but the River Safari is not yet ready to follow the great experience you can get in the outstanding and stunning Singapore Zoo. Esp when the giant pandas are away then it's not worthwhile the money. They need to upgrade or lower the prices. Prices for rides have to be paied separately (and quad again).
,,Pandas are great,3.0,,"This won’t get a return visit. We went later in the day with the intention of then going to the night safari. What a disappointment. The boat rides are very average and you do not see much – in fact I believe a lot of the animal enclosures on the theme park style ride were uninhabited.

After seeing all the park we were out in under 2 hours which meant we had a long, long time to fill in before in was night safari o’clock.

The Pandas on the other hand were great. I had never seen one before and got excellent views of both pandas.

The pleasure of seeing them made the trip worthwhile otherwise I would have been real disappointed"
,,A good addition to the SIngapore Zoo attractions.,4.0,,"The River Safari is the only attraction int he Singapore Zoo we haven't been to so we decided to give it a go. The displays for the various great rivers of the world are interesting with information and trivia all over the place.
The attraction is not as huge as the zoo but the layout is good. We also enjoyed the ride in the Amazon River section which was fun and interesting, bringing you closer to some animals and birds of the region.
The fish display was good. There were really huge manatees in the aquarium and very playful otters.
The pandas were a letdown as they were both asleep during our visit but the pair of red pandas were adorable!
The River Safari together with The Singapore Zoo and The Night Safari are must-see places. They are very beautiful and the displays are informative."
,,River Safari experience,4.0,,"My hubby and I took my little girl about 15months to River Safari on a weekday to avoid crowded.
Unfortunate it’s start to pour heavy rain when we reach, but we still proceed ahead
Once we went in, we are glad that most of the area are sheltered.
There is stroller rental available at the ticketing counter. If not wrong, the rental cost S$9.00

On the Panda area, we only managed to see Kai Kai. For Jia Jia, we saw her inside thru the TV screen.
Look like she’s too shy to come out.
Not forgetting to enjoy the Panda Bao in the Panda café and Panda cookie are available for purchase
And due to down pour, we got our refund on the boat ride which we used to buy souvenir from the shop
My girl enjoy looking at the big fish aquarium at near the end of the journey.

The whole area aren’t that big, a couple will be enough to cover.
Overall experience is good"
,,Worth a look if you are going to the zoo first,3.0,,"Can spend around 2 hours here. Panda exhibit was really good, and a nice cool relief from the hot/humid weather. Lots of aquariums. Our ticket included either the cruise of boat ride - we chose the boat. It went very fast and didn't see many animals, and was over after a few minutes. Given how great the Singapore Zoo is I was a little disappointed. However glad I went on the same day as my visit to the zoo so didn't make a special trip. Photo as you enter is against a green screen, would have preferred a real photo"
,,Not very impressive,3.0,,"What they have in this place is more of a 'river exhibition' than a river safari. There are exhibits about 5 different rivers of the world, their vegetation, aquatic life etc .. and then there are fishes in aquariums. To their credit, some of these exhibits are really good. But do not expect anything out of the ordinary. It is just like walking through a museum/aquarium. We found it quite over priced at SGD 26.

The highlight of this was viewing the giant pandas. We were seeing pandas for the first time in our lives. Just because of this we did not end up regretting taking the river safari.

We also took the amazon river quest for an extra 5 dollars. This was a fun ride but ended too soon at 10 minutes.

Overall this is a good experience, especially if you are interested in seeing pandas. But can be safely skipped without missing much if you are hard pressed for time."
,,Wonderful concept to showcase animals!,5.0,,"This is one of the main attractions that you'll have to visit when you're in Singapore! If you are an animal lover but don't have the luxury of time visit the zoological gardens for the whole day then you should visit this place. 3 to 4 hours is all you need to see all the exhibits and have fun! The pandas are definitely the highlights. The boat right in my opinion wasn't that worth it as it was short and some of the exhibits were under renovation. Overall, visiting the River Safari is really a memorable experience!"
,,Not that worth it,2.0,,"The River Safari is way overpriced. At 28 per person (internet price) + 10 for 2 boat rides, it should have been a day-long attraction. In reality, it only lasted us 2 hours - and that was because we went around the thing twice. The exhibits are not that interesting - I don't know if the river safari should be blamed for that, considering that fish, regardless how 'unique', pales in comparison to its mammalian counterpart in the neighbouring zoo. There are 2 boat rides - the first takes you around the lake, the second is a theme-park-styled ride. The first one was boring. There was nothing to see. The guides tell us that if we look hard enough/ are lucky enough, we might catch a glimpse of the giraffe/ other animals in the neighbouring zoo. well, no luck there. The second is way too fast, as echoed by other reviewers - out of the 20 animals you're supposed to see, we probably only managed to see a total of 6 - 7 between the two of us. Overall, I believe those two rides should be incorporated into the $28 ticket price; they're just not worth the extra $10. Also, I don't see the big fuss about the pandas. They hardly move. Of course, it's not their job to entertain us. But to house them inside a giant air-conditioned room that mimicks Chinese mountains, and to set them up as the 'main attraction' of the safari is just too much, iom. The only thing that was interesting was the last part - the amazon rainforest flooded 10m+ tall."
,,Not as impressive as the Zoo..,4.0,,"I must say, was not so thrilled with this place.. I prefer the bird park or zoo anytime..
It was quite sparce, n not much animals or exhibits to see..
The main attraction.was the Panda's.. Tt too was such a let down as most times both panda's were sleeping in.sum corner.. Nothing much too see..too photos of e fake panda figures more dan e real ones..
The boat ride was e biggest joke! It was like a boat ride along a narrow drain.. Unlike the huge boat and vast river tt it was advertised as.. No animals were in sight also.. The most boring ride ever..
Less dan half a day is needed to finishing the whole ""safari""..
I wud suggest gng to the zoo or night safari instd.."
,,Only if you have visited the zoo and if you have a full day.,3.0,,"We purchased a double pass for the zoo and the river safari. The zoo is excellent, 5 stars and spent an easy 4 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it! If you have a choice or time to do one. Go to the zoo!!! Only do the river safari if you have time to go and happy to spend 30+ dollars on something less value for money than the zoo. Finally important to note. You will only need 2 - 2.5 hours in this park. You need minimum 3.5 - 4 for the main zoo if your gonna plan to see both.

The fact that the ""river safari"" has two pandas on the front of the flyer should have been a bit of a warning. The park is quite good as I will detail but only as we were fortunate to see the pandas and we had just spent a great time at the zoo.

The start is ok, quite a step back from the zoo and being literally surrounded by animals and nature. The river safari is more a ""work in progress"" and is more a walk through as opposed to a maze of animal enclosures. The pandas were great, but we were lucky as it was feeding time for one of them after a ten minute wait.

The included boat cruise was quite disappointing. Not much to see and nothing new that wasn't seen the zoo. Miss if short on time. Quite accidentally we found ourselves in a little bird/reptile show that was actually quite cool. Got close up to birds and had photo opportunities. This was near the waiting area for the boat ride/near the cafe. We skipped the Amazon boat ride so can't comment.

The remainder of the enclosures/tanks with animals and fish were quite good and the species were interesting, especially the larger aquariums! Pretty neat.

Overall this visit was good, very much inferior to the zoo but the pandas and aquariums were highlights. As stated earlier visit only of time permits. Go to the main zoo first!

Note: we took the train/bus from the city. This was excellent but did take approx 1 hour from the city."
,,"Not good for aquatic/marine life but for Pandas, take your decision",3.0,,"As the name suggests, River Safari is meant to be for aquatic/marine animals. It does have this but not enough to compare it with other similar attractions at Singapore, i.e. SEA Aquarium.
River Safari is located adjacent to the Singapore Zoo, so you may think of covering both the attraction at the same day. River Safari will need about 2 hours to complete the round.
To distinguish itself from other similar attraction on aquatic life, River Safari has designed on the lines of major rivers of the world. It has Amazon, Congo, Ganges, Nile and Yangtze rivers. The exhibitions for these rivers are very small, and do not have enough exhibits. Except for Yangtze, other rivers have very less space and animals for exhibition.
There are two boat rides, I would suggest for Amazonia quest as the other one is a cruise ride and not much interesting. Amazonia quest ride is about 5 minutes, and it takes you through wild life of Amazon rain forests. You can spot animals during your ride.
The star attraction of this River Safari is two giant Pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jai, male and female respectively. I found that these two pandas mated here for the first time and therefore they are Singapore's pride. I agree, as Pandas are shy creatures and having them mated here is a big step towards their conservation.
The key point is that if you wanna see Kai Kai and Jia Jia then you have to go for River Safari, otherwise this attraction can be skipped in my opinion.
Opposite to Panda exhibition, there is a glass wall to view Inuka (polar bear at Singapore Zoo). If you have missed Inuka during your Zoo visit then you can view it in River Safari. Check the feeding times of Inuka so that you do not miss it.
Overall, an average experience, not much to see and do inside and the attraction does not meet my expectations."
,,Nice place but don't ride the Amazon River Quest,4.0,,"The place is so nice and the animals is quite a lot, but don't ride the Amazon River Quest, not many animals shown and some of them are not seen"
,,Can be skipped,3.0,,Nothing much to see. Some animals were hiding. We didn't see the pandas because it was their mating season. The highlight was the River Cruise but it was just 10 minutes long.
,,Great little zoo,4.0,,There is a section of the zoo that you can only see the animals by a little boat ride like Cheetahs and wolves. We wanted to go back and see them but the only way was to pay for the ride again which went past their enclosures to fast.
,,Not what i expected,3.0,,This park is actually quite small. Not a huge lot to see. Best part is seeing the red panada and the 2 panadas. This was a great experience. The river safari wasn't much to get excited over didn't see many animals except from the singapore zoo. Not a place i would go again too.
,,One of the best attraction place to visit in Singapore,4.0,,"I have been there with my family and friends and we had a great time. It was started raining when we arrived but around 80% is shattered so we didn't face problem. The safari is divided into the Rivers of the World and Wild Amazonia. One of the main attractions is the Giant Pandas. Well, boat tour is abit useless since nothing special so see. Overall, it's worth to visit there."
,,"Well laid out, needed more info on boat trips",3.0,,"We purchased a joint night and river safari ticket. Upon arriving at the river safari, we headed for what we thought was the only boat trip included in the ticket price. We arrived at the cenrtre at 9am, but then Found out the first cruise was not until 9.30, and that this a river cruise where you may see a few animals. Another ride was available for five dollars to go within the park grounds to see more animals, but this didnt start until 10am! Apart from this, an enjoyable half day out, especially seeing the pandas!"
,,Should have gone to the zoo,3.0,,"We've done the zoo on a previous trip, so chose the River Safari this time - we should have stuck to the zoo!
The park is well set out, with a lot of information, but it wasn't really what we were expecting.
The Amazon boat ride and lake boat ride cost extra. I enjoyed the Amazon ride, as you were very close to the animals. The boat on the lake wasn't really worth it, as there was nothing to see (far off elephants and giraffes from the zoo and night safari enclosures.
Glad we did it, but wouldn't do it again. If you have limited time, chose the zoo and night safari instead"
,,Not Good,1.0,,"The highlights are the panda which are very cute and the big aquariums which displays fresh water fishes. the boat ride is not a highlight believe me!

I would recommend doing the zoo instead of the river safari because it is bigger although zoo have a different classification of animals than river safari

The boat ride in river safari is very short. like less than 10 mins or so. and it is not an actual boat. it s like a tram moving through a rail like a train and around it is man made nature with water all over. I swear when it started moving, you can smell the very strong stinky odor coming from the water or somewhere else which i can compare to a strong urine smell of different animals which by the way, you will smell until the boat stops."
,,Educational but the Pandas are the highlights,4.0,,"In a way it is like a mini theme park with the boat rides, and lots of information on the rivers of the world. The Amazon flooded forest was particularly interesting with a good number of the manatees swimming slowly and graciously amongst other species. However, the highlights of the park is really the 2 giant panda Kai Kai and Jia Jia even though they don't belong to the rivers! To fully enjoy these adorable creatures you have to wait patiently for them to appear closer. We were lucky to have Kai Kai rolling on the ground and even did a sommersault in front of us before it disappeared behind a closed door. Also Jia Jia was sitting in close range eating bamboo for a good 10 minutes at least. We must have spent at least an hour just to watch the 2 lovely pandas in action!"
,,Interesting Information,4.0,,"This is the third part of the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, both of which we have visited many times before on our trips to Singapore. The River Safari gives great information on the major rivers in the world. The most exciting part was seeing the two pandas. They were situated in their natural habitat and was great fun watching them eating. The information on all the rivers was great. We took the river cruise (extra fee) and not really worth it - it was a boat that just went for 15 minutes and showed us the back of the Singapore Zoo and we saw Giraffes and Elephants and that was it! The actual River ride was worth it!"
,,Surprise in Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore is not just an urban city. Still has its natural environment, wildlife. Good for bird watching."
,,Interesting but the main attraction are the Pandas,3.0,,"Some interesting features to the park - boat ride is good and the aquariums are interesting and give a good perspective of some of the endangered species.

Some of the species that have featured on the TV series River Monsters can bee seen in the aquariums

Probably the main attraction are the Pandas - if you get the timing right they are active during feeding otherwise just tend to sleep..

Many of the prepaid tours give you the impression that you have around 4 hours, however we found this is pick up to drop-off so you only really have around 2 hrs at the park."
,,Nice attraction for kids,4.0,,"Pros: - a large collection of freshwater fish, with the extra: the giant pandas and Amazonian animals (when you take the boat ride for extra $5) Cons: when we were there, the anaconda wasn't in the cage and squirrel monkey cage was closed for maintenance"
,,The boat ride has nothing to see,3.0,,"Visiting with my family, we find some interesting fresh water creatures in Aquarium, but we do not see anything interesting on boat ride."
,,River sarfari,5.0,,Best attraction in Singapore. Absolutely loved it. Saw pandas and more animals that you could imagine The aquarium is fantastic. So close to the zoo you can even see their polar bear swimming in its enclosure
,,Better than expected,5.0,,As we walked into the river safari the heavens opened up and it absolutely poured but this didn't matter as the walk ways all had covers over them with the exception of the boat cruises. The safari was amazing to see so many species of fish and animals. But the highlight for me was the red pandas and the giant pandas. I didn't realise how big the pandas were. One was happily munching on bamboo and the other was pacing around the enclosure. The red pandas were sleeping up in the trees. So well organised and spaced out. Booked through duck tours and this meant that we could take our time and on the hour go out the front to meet the bus to take us back to suntec City.
,,Relaxing attraction - Visit Singapore Zoo and River Safrai on the same day,4.0,,"It was raining day, but we are glad that it was all sheltered. No worries at all. Probably, It was due to the rain, the whole place was windy and the ""forest"" environment makes us feel great and relax. There are big fish tank with big fishes ( not as big as sea aquarium), 2 Pandas (Jia Jia and Kai Kai) and boat rides available with extra charges. I think the boat ride cost $5.

There is a Panda theme restaurant, you might want to try it. Everything with Panda design, Panda bun and coffee with panda shape. So Cutesssss!

For tourist: You can plan to visit Zoo and River Safrai on the same day, if you have time continue with Night Safrai during Night time. (You can buy combo tickets at Changi Airport).

You can travel by tourist bus which is cheaper than Taxi. If you would like to go for cheaper transport, you can take train and bus but i wont recommend you do it. I feel it too troublesome and time consuming.

,,A good change of scenery,4.0,,"Enjoyed my experience here after the shopping and sight seeing exploration around Singapore. This is where I could relax and just watch the animals while their time away in bliss. The pandas are the main attraction. So are the aquarium with otters and manatee. With covered walkways, one can walk in a leisurely pace rain or shine. Also took the River Quest 10-min boat ride, which was worth it. You get to see more animals up close.
I spent abt 2-hrs here and was a nice reprieve from the rest of Singapore. Commuted to the location with public transportation (train and bus) which took me >1hr to get to from the city.
There's a large food court that's share by the entrance to Night Safari, The Zoo and River Safari. So no worries if you got hungry or thirsty."
,,Good but can be a lot more better,3.0,,"Singapore Zoo a lot better and more worthed. Anyway I come here as per my son request. I buy ticket online as it is cheaper.

Come quite early in the morning and we go straight to Amazon River Quest. This boat take about 10 minutes ride. According to me and my son, after the giant panda, this is the best attraction in River Safari which is quite interesting There are 3 shallow slides during the entire ride but we stay dry as we sit in the middle. Actually that time during our visit, nobody taking the boat, so only two of us in the boat. We can't spot too many animals as per sign during the boat ride. We only can spot Jaguar, few types of monkey and flamingo.

After that we take River Safari Cruise. This attraction not really interesting and kind a boring. We can spot Giraffe and elephant but quite far from eye sight. Best spot is seeing stork (kind of bird) gather and flying around near the dock.

Then we go to see Kai Kai and Jia Jia (the giant pandas). We consider very lucky today. Can see both of them munching bamboos and crawling around This is best attraction in River Safari Other than that we also see the Red Panda.

We also go inside squirrel monkey forest and can spot two monkeys.

More boring part is actually river of the world. It can be more better. There are a few types of river such as Congo River, Nile River etc if not mistaken the aquarium Mekong River is quite bright and nice for photo taking. I can see that this area will be expanding very soon also as construction in progress.

The tunnel is too dark. However inside the giant aquarium, there are quite some manatee that are quite cute especially during feeding time.

Their OTTERS damn cute and loving. We manage to spot them cuddling each other inside the water while we are in the tunnel.

As for me this visit is more to educate my son about the rivers and animal. Their facility like tag, recording. Etc really not bad.

Signage (especially don'ts) quite clear

Staffs are friendly and always try to accomodate safety concern in very polite way."
,,Interesting but could be better.,3.0,,"Probably worth a half-day visit. Interesting themed safari showcasing marine creatures& mammals that inhabit the 7 major river ecosystems of the world, ranging from the mighty Amazon to the exotic Yangtze river in China. The latter river flowing through Sichuan which is probably the only reason why the famed giant pandas are included here and not in the neighbouring Zoo. Would have rated the visit a 4 if not for the disappointment of the Amazonian River boat cruise (additional charges apply). Here, the fast flowing waters thrust a boat and its occupants through a river course set out to replicate the Amazonian rainforest habitat. Sadly, the exhibits were packed too closely together, givng passengers scarcely time to view the creatures in the enclosures. It would have been ideal if the cruise could meander over a longer course over a larger area so that the animal enclosures could be adequately spaced. As it is, passengers on the boat could only glance in quick succession at the exhibits as the close proximity between exhibits meant that the next enclosure is round the bend or on the opposing bank of the river. One would have either to return for a second ride or try to stop the boat from progressing in order to thoroughly view and appreciate the animals featured in the exhibit."
,,Worth trying,5.0,,"Actually i enjoyed the river safari, even it is a short journey - 10 minutes- but it was amazing for $25. But the main zoo is much more interesting. Singapore zoo in great place to spend half a day. I love it"
,,OK,3.0,,We were bit disappointed with the exhibitions. There is no need for this to be a separate entity. It should be part of the zoo at same price. It is waste of money and time. It takes only 1-2 hrs to visit it all. Just go to the Zoo and skip this.
,,Meh!,2.0,,"Not nearly as nice as the two adjoining zoos. The main draw is a pair of giant pandas, who have a pair of red pandas for neighbors. There is a small number of additional animal exhibits, plus two boat rides. One takes you in a loop around the reservoir, and you see the backside of a couple of exhibits from the zoo and night safari. The second is a disney-style ride, where you get a minute or two in front of each enclosure. If the critters aren't out, you have to purchase another ticket to ride again. Even if you take your time, you can see everything in a couple of hours."
,,Don't bother - it's an overpriced boat trip,1.0,,"This was our second trip to Singapore Zoo in 2 years and the last time we came here, the walking part of the River Safari, including the pandas were only SGD7.00. Now you pay SGD25.00 and get a very tame boat trip on top.
On the boat we managed to see 3 types of animals and the commentary was hard to hear and poor.
We had also paid SGD5.00 to go on the Amazon Quest which was a quick 10 minute ride that was built up to be something it is not, to see animals that were free the last time we came!
All in all, it was a waste of time and money, and we came away feeling conned. Our advice is to not bother, but spend more time in the main Singaore Zoo."
,,"Nature, Rivers And PANDAs",3.0,,"A great place to spent a few hours.
Good scenery to take picture from.
Pandas are kept in a very very cool place where you can escape from the surrounding heat . Remember to pose well when approach by the staff for the camera where you can have a beautiful souvenir picture to bring home which cost $25. Boat ride is a bit too short.
Enjoy your holiday in Sunny Singapore!!!!!"
,,Something new... but overpriced...,3.0,,"The river safari is smaller is size compared to the other 3 parks but offers a boat ride which none other parks have. You will be able to get close with different wildlife species while on board the Amazon River Quest at an additional cost of $5/adult and $3/child (height must be above 1.06m) however, there's a high chance that you may not see much most of the time as these animals take shelter during hot and rainy weather. It is relatively expensive considering the size of the park and what it has to offer."
,,A So-so Experience,3.0,,"If you compare this with the Singapore Zoo, it is way below the Zoo's standard. The main attraction are the two Pandas on loan from China. Interesting to see them in action. Apart from this, the boat ride is interesting to which allows you to see different animals as the boat travels. However the boat ride is too short. Before you knew it, it's over.

Overall, it's only an average experience."
,,amazon adventure,4.0,,"The River Safari is a river-themed zoo and aquarium situated on a 30 acres of ground, and nestled between the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari. It is the first of its kind in Asia This attraction is the fourth zoo in Singapore, along with the Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park, and Night Safari, Showcasing more than 6,000 animals, including 40 rare and threatened species, you can discover one of the world’s largest collection of river-dwelling wildlife here. It features freshwater attractions and river boat rides as its main highlights, it has Giant Panda Forest and is fully air-conditioned, giant aquarium different species of fish and river creatures, Giant crocodile, piranhas, the red panda, Kai-Kai the big panda was our favorite attraction, and the re-creation of the Ganges & Amazon river ,it’s So placid and soothing. You can embark on a boat adventure of the Amazon River with the Amazon River Quest boat ride, We did both the Cruise and Amazon River Quest, I won't recommend the Amazon boat ride not many animals in site maybe they were asleep. We were enthralled by the sights and sounds of close to 30 wildlife species that hail from one of the most diverse rain forest habitats of the world. This unforgettable wet and wild journey will give you a truly unique perspective on life alone the mighty river. It’s pretty expensive for what it is, but it’s worth doing, we were thrilled with the adventure."
,,Interesting Place! and PANDAS!!!!!,4.0,,"The place is not conveniently linked to any MRT so we had to take a taxi here.

We went on a weekday so we had a great time strolling around from one river to the next without bumping into too many people. There are quite a variety of animals and each are explained on a little board near the exhibit.

Some enclosure were considered small to house a few species of animals in it but it was still kept clean and maintained. I wasn't too keen on getting close to a huge Nile crocodile despite being safe behind the thick glass panel but I went very close to it and it was amazingly frightening.

I liked the panda enclosure. It was very spacious with well regulated cool temperature although I think one of the pandas was restless for some reason when I visited. There were red pandas too!!

There was even an enclosure where cute little squirrel monkeys roam freely but watch your bags! One almost reached into my bag for food (I think) but a nearby employee was quick to give it a little shout."
,,River Safari,3.0,,We finally had a chance to see the River Safari. A note that the River Safari and the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari are all in the same area so why not book them all and save going back and forth. The reason for the lower score was because we were not able to see all of it as there was a torrential downpour that went on for an hour just an hour before it closed so we missed a lot of it - there is always next time
,,One for panda lovers!,4.0,,"We went on a Monday afternoon by taxi from Marina Bay at a cost of S$20 each way. There is a taxi drop off point and taxi rank. There is a river boat cruise that takes you past animals such as giraffes that are in the zoo next door. There is also a river quest which is the only way to see some of the animals in the river safari area. We did neither as it was raining! If I were to do one it would be the river quest as this is the only way to see some of the animals but it should be included in the price.
The highlight was the pandas for sure. The red pandas are my favourite animal and it was nice to see them along with the black and white ones. One of the pandas was quite shy and spent some time out the back away from the noise. There were signs everyone saying not to shout but this didn't seem to stop everyone that came in. The noise in there was appalling and there was an echo. The panda area is chilled so take a jumper. Please also stop and say hello to the Golden Pheasant who is opposite the red pandas. Poor thing is ignored by everyone going to see the pandas We were there for just under 4 hours and saw a lot. We spend time watching animals rather than marching past. The manatees were also another highlight as we saw them being fed. There is a nice area to sit and watch them out of the sun/rain! The walkways around the park are covered so you are out of the sun/rain. We ate in the panda café which had some nice cute food at reasonable prices."
,,Cute Giant Panda,4.0,,"If you want to see the Giant Panda (Kai Kai and Jia Jia) from China, you can see them at here. Besides, you also can see a lot of water animals by taking the boat ride on certain time."
,,Pandas and manatees,3.0,,"I found the ""river"" experience (cruise on the reservoir and the Amazon River Quest) not as interesting as the land part where you walk past various river habitats, such as Mekong, Amazon, Mississippi, and observe creatures from around the world. The highlight had to be the PANDAS. Also loved to sit & watch the manatees. That's why the Amazon River Quest did not appeal - the ride in the boat is short and, for me, a little rushed. I like to stop and watch the animals. For strange new animals, how about the Indian gharial ? The Singapore Zoo has it all !"
,,Good,4.0,,"In comparison to zoo and night safari, this park is smaller but interesting non the less.. There are two kinds of boat rides one can take.. The information provided about the fishes etc is very interesting specially the trivia. There is a massive enclosure where you can spot various fishes. Highlight is seeing the two pandas jia jai and kia kia who are adorable."
,,Beautifully set aquariums and animal enclosures,4.0,,"We came here as a follow on from the zoo next door. Was a lovely addition to our day. Highlight was the pandas, but all very good. River safari was ok, wouldn't have missed much by not going on it. But the Amazonan river ride was good. Worth a stop if you are going to the zoo."
,,Overpriced and Over-rated,2.0,,"This is a really expensive attraction and we were disappointed. Most of the enclosures are small and inappropriate (two miserable looking storks that barely had room to stretch their wings, let alone fly, actually brought tears to my eyes). The Amazon Ride promised a lot and delivered virtually nothing - a ten minute slog around more miserable looking animals in pathetically small enclosures. The river boat trip was a waste of time and unless you have a burning desire to spend more money and see nothing but two giraffes and two elephants in the adjoining zoo, don't bother. Singapore is a great place to visit but this 'attraction' is a total rip off. My only hope is that at least some of the money is going towards improving the conditions for the animals."
,,Ride into the wild,4.0,,"I liked the Night Safari better but this trip was also fun! Was able to see different species of fish and river creatures and read/discovered fun facts about them. My favorite would be the giant crocodile, piranhas, the red panda, Kai-Kai the big panda & the recreation of the Ganges & Amazon river! OMG I could just stay there all day staring at the giant aquarium. So serene and relaxing. :) I won't recommend the Amazon boat ride though! We just saw a few animals because most of them were hiding or sleeping. :("
,,No child under 1.06m tall allow seriously!,1.0,,"We went there with our kid today. They don't allow any child under 1.06m tall. Seriously if they can not build safe Zoo(River Safari) for family. Surely, its not so hard. Not family friendly here."
,,Loved it! Do both cruises,5.0,,"We did this after the Zoo and probably rate it higher. Its pretty expensive for what it is, but saying that we are definitely glad we did it. We did both the Cruise and Amazon River Quest and loved both. Definitely pay the extra few dollars to do them!! Its alot smaller than the zoo and i think we did it in around 1.5 hours. We loved seeing the pandas too :) Our biggest frustration was that in the Singapore heat and there was nowhere open inside to get a drink. They probably need to sort that out."
,,Go only if u want to see the pandas,3.0,,"Time required : 2 hours or so.
If I have to rate the wildlife attractions in Singapore, my ranking would be as follows:
1. Zoo
2. River Safari
3. Night Safari
4. Bird park

I found the bird park to be very boring, night safari lacking much content, river Safari is good mainly because of the Panda, but the zoo is truly great. I must admit that the bird park shows are great. Shows at night safari also not bad.

The best attractions are the pandas. Panda feeding sessions are also good and you can try to catch a few of you can. The show and feeding timings are published on river safari website.

The boat ride is not great, from learning point or adventure point of view.

If you buy combined tickets for wildlife attraction it's cheaper. They are all located at the same place except the bird park which is at a different location."
,,Once is enough,3.0,," Went on a weekend and it was not crowded at all. Other than the much publicized pandas, I don't find the place worth a second visit. You can easily finish the whole place in 3 hours. One could see more marine life at the SEA Aquarium. You will also miss out on some of the exhibits like the the Scarlet Ibis and Flamingoes if you do not take the Amazon River Quest ride. The Amazon Flooded Forest is interesting though as you can see the whole forest submerged in water.  

The Giant Panda Forest is fully air-conditioned so it provide visitors a respite from the heat.

It would be more interesting to visit the zoo next door."
,,Everything for Kaikai and Jiajia,5.0,,"I love Pandas and this is basically the reason why we decided to visit River Safari. Prior the visit, I was only thinking of the Pandas as the main/major attraction but as we went inside, other animals were also very interesting. Half day stay is enough and make sure to bring some fan because it can get hot at some areas. We also tried the Amazon River Quest but as they've said, you can't really see all the animals in one go. When we went there, the jaguar/tiger was asleep in one corner."
,,Worthwhile visit,4.0,,"We got our tickets to River Safari & Night Safari from an online site offering discount tickets so paid a lot less than the actual admission price. We visited River Safari first.

It is very scenic with great photo backdrop opportunities of the river. There were a great variety of animals and wildlife to see to keep us entertained. From piranhas to Pandas and monkeys to manatees it had it all. I especially enjoyed watching the staff feed the manatees and other fishes.

Our family found it worthwhile and took about 2 to 3 hours to see it all before moving next door to the Night Safari attraction.

Word of advice: they warn about being careful in the spider monkey enclosure as they can bite. What they don't tell you is that warm sprays of rain drops aren't rain. Yes... Damn those little buggars.

Had a fun time albeit a little bit sprayed on.

Btw - you can find the discount tx by searching Qoo10. We went to their office direct which is at Level 2 Unit 10, 211 New Bridge Rd, Lucky Chinatown."
,,More than just a boat ride,4.0,,"Before you step onto a boat, you are taken on an adventure through various tyoes of aquatic life. The aquariums are fantasic, and there is one in particular that is let's just say........ big!

The actual boat ride itself was an opportunity to sit back and relax. You learn about wildlife that you see and how the reservoir the cruise is in came about.

The Pandas were a nice surprise and it was great to see then active and up close.

I recommend this trip if you are staying in Singapore. Work it into a visit to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari as they are all located close together.

Don't forget to do the Amazon Safari as well. It's not a 'hold onto your seats, it's a bumpy ride' attraction, but again it was great to see the wildlife that make up mark of the Amazon up close and personal. Give your self enough time to walk from the entrance, through the various aquariums to the boat ride. It took us about 45 minutes of checking cool stuff out before we stepped onto the boat.

When you leave the River Safari, DON'T go back the way you came. Take the alternative route as there is still more to see and not wanting to spoil the surprise... You'd regret finding out later what you missed."
,,Worth it for the Pandas,4.0,,"The River Safari has some interesting critters in 1rst class enclosures and aquariums. The landscaping is beautiful and there is a lot to see and learn. However, if the panda bear exhibit was not part of the River Safari – it would definitely not be worth the price of admission. So you may want to skip this attraction if you don’t think pandas are awesome.
My wife and I went exclusively to see the two pandas and were in awe! We watched them traverse their surroundings for over an hour looking for treats, eating fresh bamboo, and playing. It was an experience that not many get to have as they are endangered and only a few reside outside of China.
I would recommend a ticket package that includes this park plus the Zoo or Night Safari to fill your day."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"Really interesting, great displays. It was lovely to get out of the city and see some of the natural beauty of Singapore (because there's not really much of that left!). Well set out displays, great to see some new fish and animals and learn about the rivers of the world. Only negative is that they are really hot on the conservation message - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - yet print off several (expensive) photos of you with pandas etc - if you choose to buy them on your way out (which they offer) they then edit them, change the background etc while you watch on the screen and then they reprint them!! Even if you want the photo you saw previously they reprint it. What?!?!? How about showing me the screen BEFORE you print anything unnecessarily, then I can choose the best photo (or not) but by showing me on the screen first you're not printing off hundreds, if not THOUSANDS, of unwanted photos each day. REDUCE. Yes, I know, ""unpurchased photos are recycled"" - but that doesn't account for the waste of inks, power, time etc. Just too wasteful for me. I would suggest photos are shown to me on a screen, with the option of having them put on to a stick (good marketing idea, have the River Safari logo on the stick so when I take it to work or wherever I'm advertising for you) and not printed so that I can include the photos in my photo book which I have printed with my other digital photos."
,,Easy to walk,4.0,,"This place is very well set up with easy to navigate path with lots of sign boards to describe the exhibit.

Our favourites are red panda and the giant pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia.

The amazon quest boat ride experienxe is not very good. We couldn't see all the animals and it was too short. They should have stopped in various exhibit for people to see.

Worth a visit especially for family with kids with annual membership."
,,Red and giant panda!!,5.0,,"Really well set out, amazing range of animals including the unbearably cute red panda and giant panda. Starts with rivers of the world, then the panda enclosure, then for SGD 5 you can go on the river safari ride (well worth it), hang out with spider monkeys in a walk through cage. You really can spend the whole day visiting the three attractions, zoo, river safari and then night safari."
,,go for the Zoo ...,3.0,,"Went to River safari during the Chinese New Year holiday...
Good thing about River Safari is, the Q and the crowd are not as packed as the Zoo ...

If you have only a day to spare, go for the Zoo !! I think you can stay for almost a day there, give the river safari a pass ... unless u have nothing planned.
some said, this River Safari was built for the Pandas ... they are the centre of the attention, then the animals and fishes around, just the add-ons...

Personally I am a bit disappointed on the Amazon Boat ride, I think it can be longer ...

Will I go there again ... probably no ...
Will I suggest others to go, probably yes for a short 3-4 hours visit."
,,"Went twice, but just felt rather blah",3.0,,"Overall, it's an attraction that you wouldn't visit twice. I visited twice because the 1st time, I visited before the boat ride route was completed. I wanted to experience the boat ride, so I came a 2nd time. You can finish visiting it in around 2-3 hours. Really unimpressed. Would not recommend it at all. Better to go to the zoo/night safari!

Good things first:
- Not very crowded both times, so felt at peace :)
- Boat ride's cheap at $5/pax, 2 themes available (more on this later).
- Near the zoo and night safari, so it's good if you're planning to go to either.
- Squirrel monkeys are so adorable and are great photo opportunities!
- The long winding layout had many available sheltered resting areas throughout, so we were not so tired and hot.

Not so good things:
- To me, both times the pandas were supposed to be the main draw, but somehow they just didn't wow me.
- The 2nd time I went, female panda Jia Jia was not even in the enclosure! It was a disappointment for my parents and myself.
- The boat ride was a 10-min SLOW boat ride, which felt like those theme park rides without a splash at the end. Half the time, I didn't see any animals and was just baking under the sun. I feel that the extra $5 on top of admission fee was a bit over the top!
- The quality of the aquarium's glass is poor, so it felt like we were looking at the marine animals through dirty glass.
- Some exhibits were not even at eye level, so we had to squat to see them. Coupled with the poor quality of the glass, I didn't actually wish to make any effort to look at some of the exhibits."
,,A beautiful way to end the day!,5.0,,"After spending the majority of the day at Singapore Zoo, my sister and I went to the River Safari - it wasn't as crowded which was great. It is a lot smaller than the zoo itself, but it still showcased a few animals that we did not see while we were in there!

The ten minute boat cruise of the river was very quiet (we were two out of six people on board) and we got to see the elephants and rhinos from a different perspective. The walk down to the boat is lovely too (though a long way) with beautiful views of the river.

We paid a bit extra to also do the River Amazon Quest, and I am so glad we did it! It was like a water ride, with a few tame drops (you might get a bit wet so beware!). We didn't have to wait very long in line at this point (~4.30pm) and there were flamingos, toucans and warthogs! Super cool.

Another fantastic experience was seeing the giant pandas! It was absolutely freezing inside (air conditioner is up full blast), but it is so worth it to see the pandas munching on bamboo and to see the little fox-like red pandas!! Absolutely adorable.

The end of the day was spent at Mama's Panda Kitchen, a themed cafe with snacks and drinks. Their food is super cute and it was a great way to refuel before heading off home. Definately save an hour ot two after the end of the day to visit River Safari!"
,,Feel cheated!,2.0,,"Its a walk through in whats esentially a long, twisting hallway which gives you a feel of marine life in the many rivers of the world. Only positive was the random Panda enclosure (yes, Panda, in a river safari!) apart from which, this was a let down. Quite expensive too. If you're visiting the zoo, stick to it and skip river and Night safaris."
,,Fun time even for solo traveler,4.0,,"Located right next to Singapore Zoo, this place can be reached from downtown by MRT drop at Ang Mo Kio station and take a bus ride. If you wish to visit Singapore Zoo or Night Safari in the same day, I suggest you get deal to buy Park Hopping ticket (day pass for park attractions) so you can save some budget. I won't suggest to include Jurong Bird Park in the 1 day ticket as it's pretty far.

Basically it's a river themed zoo displaying for water animals and animals dwelling around rivers all over the world, with additional giant panda and red panda as the superstar. They have a wide variety of animals displayed so you will enjoy your time here even if you have visited aquariums before.

If you want to take the 15 minutes boat ride (2 departures at noon every day), you will have to register at the locket near the entrance gate and need to pay additional cost. If you are traveling with kids, they will love this attraction, but for an adult solo backpacker, you might want to think twice, unless it already included in the ticket (which is quite impossible due to the frequency of the boat departure)"
,,Not exactly a safari,4.0,,"I wouldn't call it a safari, more like a zoo.

We missed out on the boat ride, having arrived too close to closing time. However, I do feel this is the best time to visit, as the place was virtually empty and all the more enjoyable as we did not have to push through the crowds.

There were a lot more animals than I was expecting, and I found it very enjoyable."
,,Walking path suits more than River safari,3.0,,"We reached attraction by bus, then we bought entrance tickets 25+5 SGD and thought that there would be no need to walk, but River safari hides true!!! There is a path which leads trough out different continents (walk ~40min.). You can experience different fishes and animals living within the river basins of the biggest rivers of these continents. Following the path it leads to the river safari boat, time on which you have to book when entering the attraction, and at the end it appears that boat trip takes less than 15 min.! :( It felt bad.. I think that this attraction should come together with ZOO with one entrance ticket, then it would be nice, but it was not so.."
,,"Nice environments, mostly walking exhibits, 15 min river ride, overall okay experience",3.0,,"It was a nice place with good ecosystems built up - the animals all seemed healthy and able to move about comfortably (I always think enclosures are small.) It was mostly a self-guided walking tour though. Interesting and easy to read info available throughout. The actual ""river safari"" is only about 15 minutes from boarding to docking - which they do disclose on their website. It alternates somewhat with outdoor exhibits with shade and fans and indoor ones with A/C. It could be a fun place for kids, but it wasn't particularly outstanding for us as adults. Still a nice place, but just not super exciting if you've been to aquariums and the like before."
,,A let down.,3.0,,"This place is heavily promoted and looked forward to the visit.Whilst the various displays were good I was expecting more.The fish were amazing and so many kinds.Pandas ok.Didnt take long to get to the bridge to the Amazon boat ride.Found this all too rushed.The ride went fast,couldn't hear the commentry well because of that.The animals along the way we're scarce and again if there were some to see the boat flew past them.After the Zoo,a bit crap.Dont know if kids would like it.Think the SGD5 for the Amazon ride should be included in the admission price."
,,Easy to visit as an 'add-on',4.0,,"The River Safari is an attraction which is very easy to add on to a day at the main zoo as it is right next door.

I visited the main zoo as part of a tour with Viator to have breakfast with the orangutans. Instead of returning in the coach I opted to stay at the Zoo for a longer look around, after which I had lunch and then in the mid-afternoon, visited the River Safari.

The River Safari 'walk' is quite shaded and was a nice respite from the heat experienced at the Zoo. I found the displays very interesting and was lucky that one of the pandas was out and about, so I was able to get some nice pictures.

The panda enclosure was a little crowded, however the walkways in the rest of the attraction were wide enough so as not to feel 'hemmed in'. There are also benches along the way on which to sit if you become tired or wish to spend more time viewing a particular display.

I enjoyed it, and I believe it is worth the experience, however people might not find it worth the fairly long journey from the city centre if it was not visited in conjunction with the main zoo or the Night Safari."
,,Unbelievable experience,3.0,,"Our four years old grandson was looking forward for a cruise to the Singapore River Safari. After 15 minutes walk from the ticket office, we arrived at the waiting place. After waiting for 15 minutes, we were told that the boat had broken for the day. We asked for refund of our tickets but were not allowed. We could only exchange it for food or other stuff in the limited shop appointed by the authority. That's really an unthinkable thing that could happen in Singapore. The whole purpose of our visit was frustrated. Other attractions therein are also not much fun."
,,Different,4.0,,This is unusual in having fresh water fish in large tanks. It was exciting to see the manatees swimming around and the otters but the highlight for me was the panda enclosure as I have never seen a panda close up before. We went on an organised trip and could have done with longer there as we felt rather rushed by the tour guide.
,,Why not?,4.0,,"I was happy to see some of the South American animals, and it got me thinking about travelling there. The animals seem to be well treated, though some of them might appreciate more space."
,,Wasting time,1.0,,Very boring...over priced ...amazon river much better more exciting and only five dollars......maybe try night safari it might be better
,,Interesting and Different,4.0,,i really enjoyed this place. we went on both boat rides. both equally enjoyable.Its a very quick to get through i think we spent around 2 hours looking at all the displays.
,,Better if it was part of the zoo,3.0,,"I think this would have been better if it was part of the zoo rather than s separate park.

That being said the pandas are beautiful as is their enclosure, we really enjoyed the Amazon River Quest (went on it twice) and that manatee tank.

The manatees are beautiful and graceful."
,,Similar to an aquarium,3.0,,"We were a little disappointed after the Zoo. Most of the river safari was like an aquarium. Unfortunately the pandas were dozing. My daughter enjoyed the boat ride. On reflection, for the cost, I would probably give it a miss as we have already seen the pandas in HK at Ocean Park. Just my personal thoughts."
,,A wonderful place for the whole family!,4.0,,"The River Safari is a wonderful attraction for the whole family; from the very young to the elderly. What I love about the attraction is that there is just one path and one direction - really like an Ikea! There are no steps at all which is great for prams and wheelchairs and it is sheltered all the way so even if it rains (which sometimes it can very suddenly in Singapore) no one is soaked or dashing around looking for shelter. The whole attraction is very well designed with little air-conditioned enclosures along the way which is great respite especially on a very hot day. The pandas are adorable although they can be elusive at times.

There is a cafe within the attraction which serves asian fast food and isn't that great in terms of taste but there is a nice little Chinese restaurant at the entrance of the attraction and other eateries just about 100m front the entrance.

I love the River Safari and we have bought annual passes for the whole family two years in a row but the boat rides are really not worth it. You don't actually get to see much and its very short, plus a long wait for the rides which disappoint.

We have also learnt that 3-4:30pm is the best time to go because its feeding time and the animals are most active. Also, that's usually when there isn't a crowd at all so the kids can run along ahead and back and really have a enjoy themselves without having to jostle with the crowd and peer in-between shoulders just to get a peek!

Overall, it is a great attraction (we are there at least once a month!) but I would give the rides a miss."
,,"Weather proof attraction, suitable for old n young",4.0,,"Was there with my family of 2 kids. Its just next to the zoological garden which we were familiar with. No trouble in getting there at all. At least for the locals

Was greeted by the panda mascot at the entrance. The place was design like a guided walkway with shelter. All exhibits (fishes n animals) are situated along the way. You will not miss any while sticking to the trail.

We missed the boat ride as tickets to be purchase or collected at the entrance.

The panda is the most popular attraction among all. Its the one air conditioned area in the entire place. Once exit, there is a cafe selling the cute panda bun n souvenir shop right beside. I didn't try the bun as the Q was really long.

Overall the experience was ok, we took about 2 hours for the trail. Elderly n young suitable especially there arent much steps if i recall correctly."
,,Very well done,4.0,,This is a great concept. Where as no as fun as the night safari it is still definitely worth doing. The panda enclosure is very special.
,,Beside the Panda notthing much...,3.0,,"This animal reserve is a nice place to spend few hours walking around. It is not cheap. I think the facility do not justify the price, especially if you compare it with the other reserves.
However if you have kids, they will enjoy a lot. Ladies be ready to walk a bit, definitely you want to avoid going there with high heels. It sounds silly but I saw few girls wearing it…

LOCATION
River Safari is located just nearby Singapore Zoo. Very convenient if you want to visit both.
Not so easy to reach with public transportation; need to go to Ang Mo Kio and then change with bus 138.
Alternatively from down town there is a shuttle bus to Singapore Zoo. You can check the stations and the schedules at this web address:
http://www.zoo.com.sg/visitor-info/singapore-attractions-express.html

TICKET
The price ticket for the River Safari is s$28 per Adult, s$18 for children (3-12 years old). I suggest you to check the River Safari website, usually they have 10 to 15% discount if you purchase the ticket on line. You can even buy it 10 minutes before you enter. Then just show your confirmation email on your phone at the entrance scanner.

If you are considering to visit more than one reserve I suggest you to buy a multi-park ticket. There are 3 different formulas 4-1 (for 4 parks) 3-1 and 2-1. The ticket is valid for 1 week from the first park visit.

In the River Safari they will offer you to take a Boat Ride. It is an extra cost! 5s$ per Adult 3s$ per children, who has to be over 1m tall. The ride last only for 10 minutes and goes around few birds spots.

HIGHLIGHT
I suggest to bring a nice camera with a powerful zoom if you have it. You want to take some close pictures of the Giant Panda, which is the star of the ""Safari""."
,,Not worth the ticket price you re paying for,1.0,,Was surprised at the ticket cost more than $25 adult.Tickets are to expensive it should cost $10 after what I have seen. River cruise have to pay. Amazon jungle have to pay. Why have pay for all these?
,,Interesting if you have the time,4.0,,"It's quite a walk from the main zoo, and you have to queue up. But this artificial ride through an artificial Amazon river features animals you wouldn't have seen otherwise."
,,Panda was the star,4.0,,"The panda is the highlight of this attraction, and they are very cute creatures, but there is not enough other interesting animals to quote make the excellent mark. The Amazon river ride is essential, or you will miss the Jaguars and some other interesting creatures, but it does move a bit fast! Also look out for a window into the polar bear exhibit, especially if you are not going to the zoo."
,,River safari,3.0,,it is pretty expensive. We have not seen half of the animals on the short Amazon river adventure which is paid separately... Absolute highlight are the manatees which are wonderful!
,,They don't tell you when part of the attraction is closed,2.0,,"I took some friends here while they were visiting Singapore. The first part was quite good and the large aquarium at the end is good, but the boat ride in the middle was closed, this has lots of things to see so we were quite disappointed.. We spoke to the duty manager after and explained that we wouldn't have paid the full price if we had known. She got angry with us when I said I wanted some money back, terrible service. I was only asking why they didn't tell us before we purchased tickets! Won't be going back!"
,,Family River safari,4.0,,"Great animal attractions in the river displays. Boat Safari itself was a little disappointing, so don't rush displays to get there."
,,should do this river safari,5.0,,i am talking about the river safari which is right in the middle of the city not the safari which is connected with night safari or zoo. this one shows you a nice close encounter with singapore skyline on ur both sides. should go. check the map and get down at the place of your convenience
,,Expected more,2.0,,"The river safari was disappointing. I expected more from this safari but was disappointed because it was very basic. Out of the 3 parks (zoo, River safari and night safari), I would skip this one."
,,Misleading Information Timewise,4.0,,"Count on a long walk from the ZOO to the boat platform, thru a long corridor full of interesting information and fish from all over the world. The boat trip is lovely but the boats really move too fast. I think that the place would benefit from more cafes to refresh."
,,What a tour,5.0,,"This is worth every penny friendly staff, very pleasant tour does not take much time to finish the full tour, all under shelter therefore no need to worry about the sun , panda shelter was the best , mama panda kitchen you have to try the ice tea with chocolate custard, super"
,,Definitely worth doing,5.0,,"We visited in September 2013 so the boat ride was not open at this point. We stayed the most of the day at the River Safari as we took our time and listened to all the talks. It is peaceful and different to other attractions, it was amazing to see some of the aquatic animals there that you will not see elsewhere. One of the most amazing parts was the Mekong River display, this is breathtaking. I understand this Safari is not for everyone but if you enjoy seeing and hearing about different animals, or you are a fish enthusiast, it is definitely worth a visit. The panda exhibit is amazing and it is incredible to see them but do not expect them to do more than eat or sleep as this is their natural behaviour."
,,Zoo View with a Difference,4.0,,"As part of Singapore Zoo this is definitely worth a visit as one gets to see the animals in a more natural environment and in the comfort of a small boat with recorded commentary that gives a bit of insight into te animals and their habitats. My only criticism would be that the boats move too fast and it is easy to miss things especially if you want to take photos as you have to pay attention to both sides.

Would be a great experience for children 5 or older."
,,"Not really a safari, but still fun",4.0,,"It's really a long walk along aquariums and habitats about the worlds biggest rivers, but it then opens into a habitat for monkeys and for the Panda bears. There is plenty of room to stay and watch the Pandas, and they were delightful to watch eating bamboo and carrots. I'd do it again in a heartbeat!"
,,Don't purchase in advance and only 15 minutes long,2.0,,"Bit meh for the price considering it is a 15 minute ride. Big note that this is non refundable so it started pouring down with rain when we got there (thunderstorms were pretty cool but scary as it was just above our heads) so we sat and waited for about an hour waiting for the storms to finish before we could board. Cutting it a bit fine as it closes at 5.30 and the storm ended at about 5.15 but as it was non refundable we decided to wait it out. Pretty cool though you only really see 3 animals which you saw inside the zoo (giraffe, rhinos and some lizards- of which the rhinos disappeared and we couldn't see any lizards). Conclusion- zoo is enough :) not really any need to go on river safari"
,,"Well worth a visit, excellent.",5.0,,"8 January 2015 I visited the Singapore Zoo where I enjoyed 4 hours exploring the River Safari which was excellent. I was accompanied by my 2 grandsons, aged 13 and 11. We all found the attraction informative interesting and thrilling. The animal species are magnificent, well cared for in spacious enclosures and aquariums. The Otters were particularly wonderful to watch, lots of space, lots of water, do not miss them. The Pandas were feeding when we came upon them, what a treat to be so close to this animal. The waters were full of fish and wild life I never thought I would see up close. The habitats are so well designed, at one point we were walking under the water features, then above looking down into the aquariums.
If you are visiting Singpore for an extended visit or just stopping over on your travels to another destination, please do no miss the amazing River safari."
,,"An all-weather, outdoor wildlife park",5.0,,"This was my second time to this wildlife park, but I enjoyed myself as much as I did on my first visit. Unlike most people, the highlight of the zoo for me isn't the Giant Panda Forest, but the Amazon Flooded Forest with the manatees. I feel that these graceful giants were much more interesting to watch than the pandas. Besides these main attractions, the rest of the enclosures were also well-designed so that most of the animals could be clearly seen in their simulated habitat.

Weather wise: it was raining really heavily when we reached the park in the afternoon, but most of the park and its attractions were connected by sheltered walkways with handicap-friendly ramps, which suited my grandmother quite well.

Lastly, I suggest purchasing tickets online with your credit card as there is a 10%(or more) discount."
,,Empty enclosures,2.0,,"Been to the river safari twice...greater disappointment this time round.

1) There can be up to six display boards infront of any enclosure (i.e. info on six different types of animals) but most of the time the enclosures are either empty or only one or two different types of animals are present.

2) Speed of the Amazon River boat ride was too fast! We had to keep turning our heads just to make sure we don't miss any animals...it would have been perfect if only the boat travelled slower so that visitors are not stressed up in their viewing experience.

The only reason i gave two stars is because i managed to see kai kai n jia jia (the giant pandas), both feeding and were quite active. So...no regrets! But doubt i'll even return again."
,,Thumbs up for River Safari!,5.0,,"Visited the River Safari this month. Arrived in the morning about 10.30am on a weekday and was thankful that there was not much crowd.

What we enjoyed was the two lovely Pandas, you cannot miss this! Quite close proximity to the pandas which was great, go during feeding time so that you can see some action. Different kinds of fresh water fish, reptiles and other animals like beavers and otters from other parts of the world for viewing. The manatee or dugong aquarium was a cozy place to just sit and look at the slow moving creatures, a relaxing sight.

What we thought can be improved was the river boat cruise, it was a pleasant and smooth ride about 15 min, but not much animals to see. For $5 per person, you can just take it just for the fun of it and cruise the waters enjoying the view of nature instead.

What we missed was the Amazon river boat ride (also $5) as it is closed for maintenance on Mondays but we will be back again soon to see this.

Note, only Mama Panda Kitchen inside the Safari if you want to have a meal inside, a set meal sets you back at about $17.90 on average for a person. There is another restaurant near the entrance as well, both serve Chinese cuisine. We chose to have lunch instead outside of the safari at one of the eating areas near the ticketing booths.

Lockers available for rent at $3 if you have bags that you want to keep away for a while.

Tips: Got a free complimentary pass (applicable to the Zoo, Night safari as well) for visiting on my birthday which was awesome and 10% discount for my spouse for PassionCard user. Do check their website for other types of discounts available.

For sure we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back again."

,,Pre-book the Amazon ride,5.0,,"After a busy morning in the Zoo a few hours at the River Safari is perfect.

The trails are all enclosed / covered so provide nice respite from hot weather or rain.

Amazon ride is a must do and pre-booking is the way to go (was sold out the day we went by the afternoon).

Pandas were a highlight for us too."
,,Worth every penny !,4.0,,"Wonderful place for a full day family outing! Each zone is themed on famous rivers across the world and provides vivid details of the natural habitat of various species of fishes and amphibians found on these rivers. Kids would love this place, boat ride not to be missed !!"
,,"The place is fun to visit, informative and get to see some animals upclose",4.0,,"Took my parents there for a visit as they'd never been, was expecting a full day in the blistering sun. Turns out the place is pretty well designed and built. Most of the walkways displaying the exhibits are sheltered walkways, protecting you from the sun or rain. Some of them have AC, like the exhibits for the Giant Pandas and the Red Pandas.

Spent a little more than 3 hours there looking at all the exhibits. Personally, I would say the place is worth a visit, the otters were a delight to watch upclose while the alligators were terrifying at close range. The park is designed in a linear fashion so you won't get lost nor is there a need to backtrack to view other animals. Definitely worth the price of admission, however, I would advise to give both river cruises a miss. The main river cruise was nothing more than a leisurely 15 minute boat ride around the lake separating the River Safari from the Night Safari.

The Amazon Boat ride was even shorter, a short maybe 10 minute ride in a log flume (don't sit in the front row like stupid me), this ride is just not worth it. Most of the animals are hiding amongst the trees and the flume whizzes by where you have a 3-4 second window to try and spot whatever you're supposed to be looking at. The only animal I saw were the pink flamingoes who stood out against the green backdrop like a sore thumb.

And also, pack your own lunch or water if necessary. $8 for a cup of soda, you've got to be kidding me, seriously?"
,,Great concept zoo on river animals,4.0,,"Since river safari is a relatively new zoo, it was not crowded when I visited in the late afternoon.

The zoo has a great concept as it showcases most river animals around different main rivers in the world.

There is a panda exhibit which is a great highlight, In addition, there is a huge aquarium which is enjoyable to watch.

It is not a large area which takes around 3 hours to complete, though it is a great zoo to visit, it is a bit pricey given it's size."
,,River safari cruise Singapore $1 per animal,1.0,,"Cruise cost $5. We saw 2 giraffes, 1 rhino, 2 elephants, ie. $1 per animal. What a rip-off. Never again."
,,Good afternoon out,3.0,,"Nice zoo. Easy to get around, beautiful aquarium displays and informative talks. The spider monkeys were fun to watch and the Amazon River Quest was really good - shame it zoomed so fast past the animals you hardly got a look."
,,Eye Opener,5.0,,"Exhibits the aquatic species found in the rivers all over the world. Smaller than the zoo but worth the visit for its exhibits. The included boat ride is short. See the panda bears from China, eat at the cafe - panda buns and panda prints on your coffee. So cute."
,,"Do this early, it's great orientation",4.0,,"The electric boats provide a commentary as you travel down the river and around the harbour area. We found it really helpful in identifying what we wanted to see and understand the different activity on each side of the river.

We did this on the first day and it helped us to prioritise areas. Give it a go, it's value for money and gives respite from the heat."
,,I love Panda,4.0,,"River Safari is just beside the Singapore Zoo. I came here last Saturday and when I reached the entrance it was raining heavily. Luckily most of the areas are sheltered thus I could walked around with no umbrella. We managed to complete the place in 4 hours. There are many interesting big sea creatures. The Pandan Exhibit area is quite cold, it good to bring along a jacket. Must try the Pandan Bun ( Chocolate and Red bean favor) at the ""Mama Pandan Kitchen"" located in the middle of the safari."
,,Neutral feeling.,3.0,,An educational trip if you will. Great for family bonding with children. The main attraction is obviously JiaJia & KaiKai.
,,Great Concept to tour the World's Rivers,4.0,,"At first I thought it would be a boat ride on a river to view animals along the banks - going by the name. But was pleasantly surprised at the theme of going through all the wild life in and along the rivers of the world. A great way to see the variety of wild life in action - like otters, dugongs, turtles, etc. Only the gharials in the River Ganges did not look like live ones??? Kids with us loved it. The river ride was also a great treat. Overall a very good place to spend half a day. The Zoo and night safari are next door to complete a day full of wild life viewing."
,,Asia's only River-Themed Wildlife Park,4.0,,"It was a sunny morning at the River Safari, located at 80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826. It is also next to Singapore Zoo and Night Safari.
We started by walking along the Rivers of the World as the rivers are named after many Countries' Rivers.
We saw creatures like the Alligator Snapping Turtle, Mississippi Paddlefish, Giant Freshwater Puffers, Congo Tetra, Jewel Cichlid, African Arowana, Tiger Fish, Giraffle Catfish, Indian Gharial, Mekong Giant Catfish, Giant Freshwater Stingray, Crab-Eating Macaque, Giant Salamander, Sturgeon and list just goes on.....
The main Singapore Giant Pandas in their Giant Panda Forest is a must-see. The cooling environment of 18 degrees is sure a pleasant place to watch the Pandas. There are also some Golden Pheasants in the compound.
We then proceed to the River Safari Cruise which is a 15 mins ride along the Upper Seletar Reservoir.
Along the way, we spotted some Asian Elephants, Giraffles, storks and herons.
Even though the ride was short, but it was refreshing. After that we proceed with another ride at
The Amazon River Quest.
With this ride, we are in close range with the animals like jaguar, Brazilian tapirs, capybaras, Brown-Headed Spider monkeys, Giant Anteaters, Tufted Capuchins, Peccary, Scarlet Ibis, Caribbean Flamingos etc....
The duration of the ride was about 15 mins but you will love it.
We travelled along the Squirrel Monkey Forest after that and they are just right in front of your eyes. but beware not to feed and touch them.
We took a rest at the Mama Panda Kitchen. the Panda ""paus"" is a must try. they are hot and soft with red beans filling or in custards. They are shaped in the form of Panda's Head. The kids will loved them. You could also try the Szechuan Bamboo Rice and Prawn Dumplings too.
there is also a Tea House along the way.
Before you leaves, visit the R/S Shop where there are plenty of soft toys of Pandas, stationeries, nice key chains, T- shirts, hats and caps etc....
It is a nice place for families and tourists. You will love the River Safari."
,,Great attraction if you are a nature lover.,4.0,,"River Safari is well designed for local climate as most of the walkways are sheltered so no need to worry about the sunny or rainy day.

The park is not too big hence you will probably explore the entire park around half a day.

Kids will love it if they like fishes and the panda bears."
,,Up close and personal - in comfort!,4.0,,"Love the River Safari after my first visit! Other than the opportunity to catch the panda(s) - JiaJia is perpetually shy - we went in the afternoon after lunch which essentially provided an escape from the worst crowds. And even though it rained, the entire walk through was covered and comfortable.

Loved the many rivers from around the world, and only wished that each one could have been fleshed out more with more species of animals and fish. I especially loved the beavers and otters, and we lingered with the manatees for more than 30 minutes. The animal river ride was fun and we were lucky enough to get close-ups of all the animals along the route, including the jaguars. Truly beautiful experience!"
,,Decent informative attraction,4.0,,"This attraction is well laid out with several separate rivers of the world areas. There is lots of information about each river together with good exhibits of fish and animals that frequent these rivers. I found the information easy to digest, and clearly written in lots of languages. The areas are very clean and well spaced out. It was really interesting to see the different fish. Walking at a leisurely pace and taking time to read the information I was in the park for around three hours. All of the walkways are covered, and it was raining whilst I was there. The boat trips were not running due to the rain. All in all well worth a visit"
,,Park is very small for price of admission,3.0,,"I bought the park hopper, and it covers the Singapore Zoo and River Safari. I picked it because I thought it would be quite the different experience. The safari itself was good, though the issue is that it is WAY too small for the price of admission, only buy the ticket if you are getting the park hopper or you will feel ripped off. We were done with park in less then 3 hours. Inside the park, you will see lots a marine life, though if you only want to see that, you'd rather go to the SEA Aquarium. The main attraction was the Panda, it seems. I was very disappointed. The panda, Kai Kai was literally sleeping for the entire time we were there, inside a tiny little area which was too small for him. The other Panda, Jia Jia, was hiding in her quarters the whole time. There is also a boat ride through the park, the Amazon River Quest. Its experience is really tailored to your luck, all the areas that you will see the animals are hiding grounds for them, I did not get to see one half of the animals you are supposed to see. Also, tip if you do not want to get wet, sit at the third row or further. The front ""splash zone"" is actually the SOAK zone, you WILL get soaked if you sit in the front row seat. The second seat is the splash zone. Price for the boat ride is $10 for adults and $5 for children. Keep in mind if you do wanna sit on it, it is closed for maintenance from 5 Jan to 2 Feb. The overall experience is okay, just too small."
,,Dun have too high expectations,3.0,,"Comparing to that singapore zoo and night safari, river safari is an attraction i would recommend to give a skip. Nothing much even if you are panda crazy, have the time they are sleeping hence dun really get to pandas.

More can be done with the animals, shows and even activities at river safari. And the queue for the river cruise is totally NOT worth the 10-15mins ride."
,,A relaxing attraction,4.0,,"If you run out of attraction to go then this is a OK choice. The route in the attraction are all shelter except for the River Ride. So you don't have to worry about sudden rain. Need to buy the River Ride ticket and book the ride timing before entrance. The River Ride is quite fun though a bit short and fast, hence a bit difficult to take photos of the animals on both side. The panda shaped bun at the Panda Cafe is cute and nice to eat as it is very soft. The red panda is cute though the star is Jia Jia and Kia Kia."
,,Bit different,3.0,,"After visiting the zoo we decided to come here and thought we would spend a few hrs here. It was early afternoon and there was alot of school children which at times meant you couldn't get to see the animals.

This part of the zoo focuses on the animals who live in the river. There was alot of fish and eels but was interesting to see. You can pay $5 and go on a nice boat ride and see some animals such as marmoset monkeys. was nice sitting on the boat and not knowing if you would get wet or not.

In the middle of the park amongst the water animals is....... a panda house with 2 pandas! go figure. They were lovely and everyone loves a panda but where they fit in in the river safari is a mystery! Only took about an hr to go round and at times felt bit bored."
,,It didn't surprise us,3.0,,"We were tree days in Singapore and we decided to go to the zoo. When we arrived there, we saw the advertisment of river safari and we thought that it could be different. In fact, that place is ok, but it didn't surprise us. On the begining there are animals from world rivers and suddently... It appears one panda ! We didn't get the connection. We paied more $5 for the 10 minutes trip on the river. We didn't like it. We didn't see most of the animals because the area is big and it's a short time close to each animal. It's ok, but I think it would be better to choose the zoo."
,,Panda pleasure,4.0,,"I had not been to the Zoo here for years, and not at all to the new River Safari exhibit. As you might anticipate, this is mainly a series of aquariums with animals and fish from world wide fresh water environments. Mostly outdoors, but with cover from the weather, this was a very pleasant experience. By considerate design, both arms of this part of the zoo ends in air conditioned enclosures, the first for the panda exhibit, and the second for the sea cows. On this occasion we were very excited to be present for one of the panda feeding times, and it was wonderful to see the pandas exploring their enclosures for treats of carrots. The enclosures are well designed to allow the pandas a green environment for exploration, as well as ample opportunities to be observed. The sea cow exhibit is simply mesmerising, and one could easily spend hours meditating in front of their huge aquarium.

Recommended."
,,Simple Trip,4.0,,"I ever visited this attraction late last year. This time, I was here as a volunteer joining a group of children on an trip to River Safari.

Pros:
1. Fully sheltered attraction that is convenient for sunny or rainy days
2. Linear pathway that is not difficult to navigate
3. Usually quiet and not too crowded (except for my most recent visit as there was an event with large groups of children)

Cons:
1. Not a huge variety of animals
2. Sometimes forced to go through tourist traps like photo booths and souvenir shops, but the staff are not pushy

How much you enjoy this attraction really depends on personal effort in terms of planning and enthusiasm. If you go at a leisurely pace and actively engage in the exhibits, you can easily spend 2 to 3 hours here. Instead of just snapping photos and leaving, take some time to read the educational information panels, e.g. the panda enclosure has many interesting exhibits about their diet. For parents with children, you can also encourage them to observe the animals' behavior, e.g. how the baby crab-eating macaque hangs upside down from the parent's stomach. If your child has any favourite animal in River Safari, you can also follow up by showing them Wildlife Reserve Singapore's YouTube videos.

I also suggest that you take note of the feeding times, animal shows and boat rides while planning for your trip. (The boat rides require additional fee; you can view a YouTube video featuring the full ride to decide whether you want to experience it.) While they are not extraordinary, including these can ensure you maximise the value for the admission fee. They also provide interesting photo taking opportunities, e.g. the squirrel monkeys will all appear in front of your eyes during the feeding time.

If you are looking for a simple, quiet trip, then River Safari is suitable for you. Otherwise, if you are looking for a variety of animals and activities, it is definitely more economical to purchase Park Hopper tickets. This will allow you to visit different attractions like the Singapore Zoological Gardens, River Safari and Night Safari."
,,Good Concept,4.0,,"I must appreciate Singapore creativity to come up with this new concept of zoo. It's basically a zoo, but they twist it to become a river theme zoo. So we can see all the animals that lives in the river all around the world.

The only anomaly of that good concept is the Panda show, eventhough we like Panda attraction so much. What is the connection between Panda and river :D.

Well beside that, everything is good. My kids like to see a rare animal, that they never see in the ordinary zoo. All the journey in the zoo is equipped with a canopy, so you're safe from direct sunlight or rain. It's pleasant.

We skip the boat, because it's very hot at that time, and most of reviews say that we can't see most of the animals.

The journey is only takes 2-3 hours, and the price of ticket is more expensive comparing to other zoo attraction in Singapore.

We take our lunch at KFC outside the zoo, 'cause it's more suitable for our taste. They have a very good Panda theme restaurant inside."
,,"Good visit, worth it just for the pandas",4.0,,"Bought a joint ticket online with the night safari. Reasonable price and better than at the gate. Some nice exhibits on the way around but the pandas were by far the best. Lots of opportunity to see them from different angles and as it was a Thursday afternoon, very quiet. The amazon aquarium was really cool with different ways to see the manatees. We don't have kids but it looks especially great for them."
,,Peaceful surroundings,4.0,,"When you enter you are greeted by sounds from the forest and river. You walk down towards the the river cruise and you see animals, insects and birds in cages, of course, glass cages. Of course the main attraction were the two pandas from China, Jia Jia and Kai Kai. They were in very clean and comfortable surroundings, well fed and looked after well. The Amazon Quest is a must for parents with children. Children would love the little slides that the boat has to go down the river, to them it is exciting."
,,It was Ok experience,3.0,,Give a miss to river cruise inside river safari bay and take trip through amazon river. It is great view of Jaguar in the Amazon river ride! Go for your kid otherwise miss it for a better location
,,River Safari,5.0,,This was a great place to visit. Great variety of species and much of the walking was in shaded areas that kept us from getting too hot.
,,River Scam,3.0,,"This is one of the newest attractions in Singapore so my friends and I did the combo pack to include the Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari.
The River Safari definitely was not as advertised and also was confusing as there were two types of boat options you can take, however which ever one you are paying the extra for no one seemed to be able to specify. So the boat ride to us was no good because you don't see any animals on them, but the rest of the park was nice which is why I'm making this as Average instead of Terrible.
The biggest attraction here at the moment though seems to be the Pandas which had a large crowd swooning over them. That is pretty much it though..."
,,Good for half day,3.0,,"I felt that the area is quite small and the number of species were not so great. Good thing is that we went there on a day when it was raining very heavily but to my surprise this place is sheltered and we managed to see most of the attractions. They opened the amazon river quest and river cruise after the rain stopped. My kids enjoyed the amazon river quest but the river cruise is very disappointing.

Better avoid the river cruise. Don't miss the amazon river quest."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"went to River Safari Park, primarily to see the giant pandas. Used public transport which was reasonably easy, just make sure you have the right change for public buses as no change is given. As is typical in Singapore it has a tropical climate so the day we went it was raining (all day). No problem in this park at all as all the walkways are covered so no need for an umbrella. Also if this had been a hot sunny day then the covered walkways provide shelter from the sun.
This is a themed pard following the rivers of the world. Brilliantly themed areas, and as you would expect in Singapore spotlessly clean.
All the animal/fish enclosures are clean and animals and fish look well looked after.
Got to see the pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia, again this is a well looked after and clean attraction, the pandas have a large well themed area to stroll around in, with outdoor space if they want to go outside. Their enclosure is air conditioned so has a nice constant temperature.
Food inside the park is a little on the expensive side but you can leave the park (get your hand stamped for re-entry) and go to one of the food outlets just by the parks entrance.
We found this a fascinating experience, well themed and totally clean park well worth a visit at S$25 to enter.
The only gripe is the number of people who take pictures with flash when there are many signs telling not to use.
All in all a great day out if you are in Singapore."
,,Another option for zoos,4.0,,We both enjoyed is well set out and caters to family's well. Enjoyed the experience and would recommended . We have been several times to Singapore and I still feel that there zoos are one of the most amazing in the world
,,"If You Are An Animal Lover, You Will Appreciate It!!!",5.0,,"First and foremost, I would like to state that this review is honestly .... One year late.... I first visited this attraction last year on my birthday with my wife. I learnt that locals (Not applicable to foreigners) visiting this attraction will be granted free entry on their birthdays. So I decided to give it a try. True enough, I was given free entry . So I also bought another ticket to Singapore Zoo for my wife as we had not been there for quite some time now.

Back to this River Safari attraction.... To save your reading time, I will just say this....

My Personal Ratings ( I am an animal lover) => 5 Stars

Highly Recommended => YES!!!

Number of Times I had visited since last year (Sept '13) => 7 or 8 times

Did I join its Annual Membership program ( Known as Friends of River Safari)? => Yes

Am I an Employee or Affliated to River Safari in any way? => No

Do I know any person from the Management Level or know any staff there? => No

This attraction is sheltered so the chances of you getting wet in case of rain is minimum. Once u reach the attraction, please first turn LEFT after showing your tickets to the entrance staff to a "" not so prominent"" sliding door entrance which is dimly lit .... After that it is sheltered all the way for this attraction. The only non- sheltered areas are the River Cruise, Amazon River Quest and Squirrel Monkey Forest.

This attraction is quite well laid out so u are fine as long as u follow the shelter walk way. This attraction showcase the different types of animals found in different major rivers of the world. Hence, for eg, for the Congo River exhibit area, we had a chance to see the famous Tiger fish up close. This is what we can only see previously from the National Geographic channel .... A little info on this fish .... A lot of people do not know, this fish is perhaps one of the most difficult to catch as the Congo River is fame for it's its huge underwater currents and rapids. So catching them definitely poses great challenges.... What u will be seeing is just small to medium size specimens, the larger ones are not available but nonetheless, to me, it's still a wonderful sight.

After walking for a while, u will come to the star attraction which is the Panda forest. A tip here .... Try to reach the Panda forest by 1400hrs or 1600 hrs .... These are the Panda feeding times and the best time for taking pics ..... The attraction has 2 pandas .... The male one is always outside but the female one is the shy one ..... She will only come out during feeding time so the only way to get a glimpse of her is during the times I mentioned above.

Next, u will come to a long bridge across our reservoir. Once on the other side, if u are looking to take both the River Cruise ($5 per adult) and the Amazon River Cruise ($5 per adult), then turn to your left immediately. There are also a couple of small exhibits near the cruise entrance. But if u are not taking either of the cruise, then please u- turn back and continue your journey.

Qn: Are the rides worth taking? I personally ( with my wife) had taken both cruises. Honest opinion? For River Cruise, u will not miss anything if u skip it. Why we took it is Because of 2 reasons ..... The first is curiosity and the second is bcos since we are both animals lovers, if the $10 spent can go to the better being of the animals, then why not since we are already there.... For the Amazon River Quest, as being reported by a number of reviewers here, it ended in about 10 to 15 mins .... If you are going to choose between the 2 cruises, then I will recommend this one coz there are more animals to see ..... But honestly, u will not lose much if u forego it.... Like I mentioned earlier, if u think the extra dollar u spent will go towards the better welfare of the animal, then go for it .... But if u are on a tight budget that every cent counts, then just skip it.

There will be a couple of attractions more before u come to the ultimate Amazon Flooded Forest. I just love it here ..... My record, I personally sat here for close to 30 mins before I left.... Once u are there, u will know why I love it. I will not reveal too much for now.

This whole attraction can be covered in about 2 to 2 and a half hours at a leisure slow pace for first timers.

All in all, the information I provided above is best to my knowledge that I have. I only reveal the more important ones so that first timers can take note.

To end, please let me say this, if u think the attraction is fantastic, please help to spread the word around. For me, this attraction for once, let me have the feeling that the organizers had put more soul into it which is what I like. No doubt the entrance fee is high to many people, once u immerse yourself into it, in fact to me the price is still ok. In fact after every trip, my wife and I will make a small donation at the exits. There are a few man-made ""Pangolins"" around the entrance and exit areas. Some are not so prominent. But if u think u have your money's worth and u think the animals are in need of better help, please do your part by donating a bit which my wife and I have always done.

For Summary:
The Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari are side by side. If u coming by public transport, first take a train to Ang Mo Kio. Then from the bus interchange, take bus no. 138. It is a looping service. Meaning the service will end at the Zoo before making a ""u turn"" back to Ang Mo Kio. The bus ride alone will take about 30mins (plus and minus 10 mins) depending on traffic conditions.

Best time to come: To reach the attraction1200 hrs to 1230hrs or 1400hrs to 1430hrs. Why? Coz that will give u sufficient time to reach the Pandas enclosure in time for their feeding times and picture taking.

For locals, please try to come on your birthday itself coz u will save on the entrance fee.

The best is this: since u are coming to River Safari, u might as well combine the Night Safari attraction to your itenary. After u have finished River Safari, u can take a rest, have a slow meal at the restaurants u find there or there is also a "" food court"" at the Night Safari area. The latter opens at about 1730 hrs if I am not wrong. Please correct me if I am. After recharging your batteries, u can then have energy to continue the a night Safari tour. :)))

I will not write about Night Safari here. I will leave it for the next review.

Bottom line: doing River Safari and Night Safari is time saving. Purchasing both tickets in advance on their main web page offer u discounts as well.

Just a final bit on my part, in this review, I highly mentioned River Safari and finally Night Safari.... Tongue in cheek, u fellows out there will know what I mean .... :)))

For now, just enjoy your time when u are there. To every one out there, have a great time, take care and good luck.... :)))"
,,Fun Time with Kids,4.0,,"A friend of mine recommending this when I was planning a short trip with my 3 girls: 6.5yo, 5yo and 3.5yo. We stayed at Killiney Rd and took a more or less 40mins cab ride to reach this place. We came in on Sunday, luckily the crowd was not so bad. The place is not too big to explore, but if you're visiting with multiple young kids (and their grandpa & grandma) just like my hubby and I were, you'd appreciate it. We arrived around 11.30AM and finished around 2PM, which already incl. snacking and lunch and 2 toilets stop. We didn't do the boat, but we enjoyed the Wild Amazone Quest ride which took just a few minutes, but for the kids, it's entertaining enough, and that's important to us, entertaining the 3 kids without getting too exhausted. For first timer (young kids) I think it's quite ok. They have few cafes and KFC. The toilets area are decent. I also like that 2 of our bigger girls were excited to read map on their own whilst they're here. All and all, adults might feel it's not that impressive, but the little ones were quite happy they thank me for taking them to this River Safari."
,,A safari with a modern touch,4.0,,"Spent about half a day at river safari, although adults without young children could probably cover it in 2-3 hrs. The people behind the place has taken into consideration Singapore's weather, thus it is mainly sheltered. There was a pretty good array of animals, with the Stars being the pandas including the red one.

Overall enjoyable, however I suspect the avid animal lover might just be a tad disappointed over the number of animals (could have been more)."
,,A 1 day trip to river safari,4.0,,"river safari was a great experience for families, couples, or for yourself, especially the 'river quest' ride. The river quest ride was really fun to me as there was a small slope for the boat to slide down and water to splash you a the beginning. However, I think that it would give a bad impression for those who did not like roller coasters and log rides. but I also enjoyed the different types of rivers like the mekong river and so on. After all, it's still a great experience to me:)"
,,Great Rivers of the World,5.0,,"This new attraction is adjacent to the Zoo and Night Safari. Don't get over excited - I reckon it would be darn near impossible to do justice to all 3 in the one day let alone, I reckon it would be physically impossible. Zoo or River Safari followed by the Night Safari would even be a challenge for those of us getting on a bit.

There are so many 'must see' attractions in Singapore and this is yet another. essentially giant aquariums 'landscaped' (some how that doesn't sound right) allow you to view the fish and other water based creatures of the worlds great rivers. ie the Nile, Congo, Mississippi, Ganges, and Amazon to name a few. Even Australia's Murray River was represented. T

We took a ride on the Amazon River Quest (a flume ride in some theme parks). It was great but went too fast and was over too soon.The rapids creating the fast water flow were fun but a slower more sedate ride would have given more time to see the animals that were supposed to be the attraction.

One of the other attractions which seemed a bit out of place were the pandas - both red pandas and the great white pandas. The enclosures were well designed and the animals actually seemed to be enjoying life.

Another land based attraction was the cheeky little spider monkeys. They were a delight to watch. It was amazing how creatures so small could make such a big noise

he Amazon Flooded Forest is reputed to be the worlds largest fresh water aquarium - an eye opening finale to the safari. All in all a great but tiring day"
,,Expected more,3.0,,"I saw banners advertising River Safari back in 2011 and got excited then. Perhaps it was the graphic on the banner but I was expecting a 'bigger' representation of the river. It wasn't too bad but I felt like I was just looking at aquariums and pools rather than cross sections of the different rivers. It does not feel like a new experience - more like a typical well-maintained aquarium. For the entrance price, it is a bit small so you feel that it is a tad pricey.
There are two rides - River Cruise and Amazon River Quest were reasonably priced at SGD5 per person but I would suggest giving the River Cruise a miss. It was just a short ride around the lake (reservoir) and the only animals you see are the giraffes and elephants from Singapore Zoo next door. The boat guide, while pleasant and friendly, gives the impression that she has gone through her spiel multiple times.
Amazon River Quest was better but it ended all too soon. If you have to pick one ride, take this one.
Other attractions that I enjoyed were the panda area - here you can see red pandas and giant pandas; and the two-level pool with manatees."
,,Pleasantly surprised,4.0,,"This attraction is new since my last visit to Singapore, so had to be added to the list of parks to be seen. We went on a week day after visiting Singapore Zoo, and found it quiet in comparison, pleasant and easy to get around. We took a ride on the Amazon River Quest which was far too fast to get a good look at the animals, much less take photos. I didn't mind paying the extra $5, but the trip was over too quickly. The exhibits were well set up, and it's virtually impossible to get lost and see the same exhibit over and over, unlike the zoo. The panda exhibit was a surprise, and they looked very happy and cool. Having seen them at the Chengdu breeding base in China, I thought this exhibit was very well laid out. My big thrill was seeing the giant river otter exhibit where mum, dad and the two youngsters were full on! We watched the interaction between this cute family for quite a time and it was very entertaining. Also seeing manatees for the first time was special. Their part of the aquarium is boasted to be the largest freshwater exhibit in the world and they - and in fact all the animals - looked content and very well cared for. I actually preferred this park to the aquarium on Sentosa."
,,Fantastic - well worth seeing,4.0,,The River Safari did not disappoint. It was set out well and the animals looked very well looked after. The panda bears and the spider monkeys were my favourite. The only disappointment was the Amazon Quest Boat ride which was great fun but went way too fast. Other than that it was a fabulous day!
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"My husband and I had a great time at River Safari. We went to the zoo in the morning and had some spare time so decided to go to the River Safari in the afternoon - we are glad we did!! We loved it so much more than the zoo. It is smaller than the zoo but the lay out is fantastic, minimal walking between exhibits, all under cover so when it rains you don't get wet. There are some great fish to see as well as some animals. The pandas were fantastic. The ""Amazon River quest"" boat ride was well worth the $5. It's a water ride (you won't get wet) that takes you around to see about 12 different animals (you have to look out for them - you may miss some of them as the boat is continually moving.) The ride is enjoyable even if you don't see all the animals. River Safari is well worth the trip and would be great with kids!"
,,Mixed feeling,3.0,,"The river safari is one of the latest wildlife attraction in singapore..as a local, i must say its still nowhere near our famous singapore zoo and night safari..but still there is a good side to this new attraction..

Pros:
Its a sheltered attraction..plenty of seats to rest..clean environment..clean restroom..friendly staff..the red panda were super friendly giving potential photographer ample opportunity to snap good photos..good variety of river creatures to learn from..

Cons:
Find it abit expensive considering the prices is almost on par with the singapore zoo but much smaller in terms of size..no halal eateries for muslim traveller like the singapore zoo..the river adventure quest boat ride were too short n fast..should not charge it as an additional attraction..

Tips:
Give the river cruise a miss..save S$5..its just a 10min cruise on the river..book online to get additional 5% discount..

I clear the river safari in 2.5hrs at slow pace..

Nevertheless it still worth to give it a try..would be better if they expand the river safari collection.."
,,Outing with Family,3.0,,"We went with children below age of 12 and Grandparents. Compared to Singapore Zoo, the area is smaller and we had no problems walking around it. There are plenty of seats available for you to take a quick rest at all junction. The main attraction for us would be the Giant Panda Forest and the Amazon Flooded Forest. We had a great time watching the Red Pandas. One of it was super friendly and was looking at cameras, posing for us (unbelievably cute). The Amazon Flooded Forest was beautiful and with varied fishes. Thou, it was sad that some visitors refused to switch off the flashes when taking pictures. I hope management can station some staff to monitor this situation so that the animal in the aquarium will not be affected by the constant flashing lights. Overall it was a good visit. We spent about 3 hours there."
,,Love pandas....,3.0,,"More fitting as an educational field trip for children. Suggest to combine with a visit to the nearby Singapore zoo to make the day worthwhile.

If you love pandas...then make the trip there. They are truly adorable. There is a lot of walking if you intend to see all the ""rivers"" in this safari."
,,Its different,5.0,,Imagine being on a small boat and going past a live Jaguar or a flock of pink birds or some really cute monkeys. Or seeing some realy massive sting rays in action and some really rare sea creatures. Walking past the legendary rivers of the world. This one is a must.
,,Great pit stop when it rains!,4.0,,"If you're at the zoo and a sudden downpour happens, make your way over to the River Safari as it's entirely under cover. It's not as great as the zoo but there some nice exhibits with interesting facts. It's also got one of the best panda enclosures I have been too (have seen HK and Scotland). I didn't go on the amazon cruise but my husband went and said it was pretty good.

Seeing the different species in different types of rivers was interesting and the bite sized facts provided were interesting. I don't think it's worth a trip by itself, but if you're going to see the zoo, it's definitely worth paying a bit more money and spending 1-2 hours at the river adventure."
,,"A poor choice, I'm afraid.",2.0,,"I am often the kind of reviewer that can find something really positive about an attraction, a hotel or a meal, and make it the highlight of my review. Sadly, I struggle with the River Safari because it did not meet any pre-conceived expectations nor did it set any expectations either. I had heard great things about the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari from other travelers, so I presumed the same could be said for the River Safari. I booked a tour through the hotel tour desk group for the River Safari and the Night Safari combined. I was genuinely excited when I first arrived. I then began my journey winding back and forth through the various river systems. I thought that this would be a Safari adventure on the water, but soon realised that it was like any other amphibious and aquatic zoo. I felt the exhibitions were really underdeveloped given that the focus was on major river systems of the world. Surely this can't be the extent of the exhibits and the information? Don't get me wrong there were some great moments like the Panda exhibit (would we consider them to be River Safari relevant though?), and the Giant River Otters (very cool!); but all in all, it seemed just a bit, well, dull. There seemed to have been more effort made on the Halloween adventure for kids than anything else! Anyway, my face lit up when I read on the map that there are Safari boat rides! Maybe this first part was just the lead up to something bigger and better! I get to the River Cruise line only to be told that I have to pay an additional fee to go on the boat. Excuse me? You trade under the name 'River Safari' not 'River Safari at an additional price'. I decide to pay the money ($5 pp) and take a boat ride around the reservoir because I certainly don't feel like I've got enough out of this place yet. The boat ride lasts about 15 minutes and we learn about Singapores water supply, see a couple of giraffes and a couple of elephants from a distance. Boo, hiss. I start winding my way through the second part of the exhibit and read about the Adventure Cruise. Upon arrival, what's that? Another $5 pp please. This is getting ridiculous now - but if you want to see some of the more cooler exhibitions, then tourist, you're going to have to pay for that. The Adventure Cruise is akin to the log ride at Dreamworld, though I found it to be too fast to enjoy the animals or get a good snap of them. I must admit it was quite peaceful floating around the exhibit on my own - 1600 seems to be a kid-free and line-free time.

All in all, a real disappointment, and given I only had limited time in Singapore, I'm gutted that I chose the 'Not-so-River Safari' over the Singapore Zoo. There needs to be a lot of development of this site; and/or combine the admission price/entire location for the RS and the SZ; oh and stop the tourist trap rubbish and making folks pay for what ideally should be an included service. At this stage, I do not recommend."
,,An educational tour,4.0,,"You may consider this trip as an educational tour where you meet exotic animals and fishes such as Pandas, polar bears, dugong, giant catfish, etc. Learn Geography about the world's river system and Science about the land and water creatures of the world.

Not to be missed are the Panda exhibits Jia Jia and Kai Kai and the world's largest fresh-water aquarium. You may give Amazon River Quest a miss as it is only 10 minutes and too fast to see anything. Also, some animals may disappear and go to sleep zzzzz. Ha ha. Not worth the S45."
,,The river cruise is not worth it!,3.0,,"Overall, it was a very nice place to spend time with the kids. The whole area is almost covered and the panda exhibition was a joy to watch.

Things which should be taken note of:

1) The polar bear exibition: The Big bear was too far away and could hardly see it.
2) The Amazon Cruise was too fast so u would not be able to take a good look at the animals.
3) The river Cruise: It cost SGD5 per person and all u do is to ride around a lake for 10 mins. For the price, it is not worth it. The value of the ride is only worth SGD1 in my opnioin"
,,River Safari,4.0,,I can say that River Safari is worth to visit. After so many years I have not been to the zoo. Please bring more water as the weather is hot there. The prices there is slightly higher so advisable to buy before you come. Camera is another thing which you should bring along. I am happy to see more attractions at the zoo.
,,Very Good experience,4.0,,"We went there yesterday. Amazing place for kids to learn about the fauna of major river systems in the world. Singapore is quite hot and humid, and you need to walk a lot to cover this safari. But it is worth as you get to see many varieties of fishes, crocodiles, Panda (my daughter loved it), Polar bear, jaguars, water monitor lizard and many more.

Pros:
1. Huge collection of species
2. Very informative display
3. Entire area is shaded to beat the sun
4. Panda is a huge attraction
5. Very clean and well maintained place
6. A must visit for kids

Cons:
1. It can be very tiring walk due to Singapore weather
2. The River cruise is not worth, please avoid it. Instead take Amazon boat ride, which is fun and kids would love it

TIP:

The combo ticket for river safari and ride entitles you only for one ride out of cruise and amazon boat ride. Opt for the later as river cruise is of no use. You can not spot animals.

They have height restriction for amazon boat ride, so please make sure about the height of your kid before purchasing tickets."
,,Not worth it unless you want to see Pandas,3.0,,"We purchased a package that included the river safari. Keep in mind if you actually want to ride the river boat this coasts extra and don't see anything. The Amazon river ride is hight restricted so my two youngest childern (4 and 2) could not ride it, again you had to pay extra.

I was thinking what a waste of time and money until we entered into the Panada exhibit. I, nor my family, have ever seen Pandas so it was a treat to see the Panada's, this saved the experinced for me. I think we spent an hour just watching the Panada's.

If you have already seen Panadas or they don't interest you then I think the rest of the exhibits may not be of interest and best to save your time and money. I would still recommend the zoo and the night safari."
,,Enjoyed with kids ages 9 and 11,5.0,,"We are an American family with 2 girls ages 9 and 11. I agonized over which to visit, night safari zoo or this River safari. In the end we decided on this mostly for the Pandas. I'm glad we did!

We arrived at 9:30 on a Sunday, it was not crowded at all. The weather was hot and humid which was worrisome for us but there was plenty of shade and air-conditioned areas.

It's set up as a route all going one way so it's difficult to go back to anything (you would be going against the crowd). I wanted to stay at the panda longer but our amazon river quest boat was booked for 11 so we needed to move along. Going all the way back thru would of been exhausting so we didn't.

The amazon river quest was fun but quick and better suited for younger kids. Saw a few animals but not a ton more. Annoying that it was an extra cost.

We finished up in about 3 hours.

We packed water and snacks and brought them in no problem.

Have fun!"
,,A great experience,5.0,,Our hotel organised for us to be taken and collected from the River Safari. We had the entire afternoon to wander through the exhibits. The fish and wildlife of the rivers of the world were brilliantly displayed and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. There was quite a bit of strolling around (fairly level) and we were entertained at every part of the experience. Loved the Pandas and the jaguar! Would recommend to friends.
,,Must go.,5.0,,"My 5 years old son enjoyed it do much. Worth the price or not really depend on whether you like the environment or not. For me, I think it is unique in Asia. I think you should not able to the similar well organized river park in Asia."
,,Overall it was pleasant visit,4.0,,"Visited it on tuesday so there were barely no crowd. Separated from the main zoo, so you need to pay separately if you want to go to both. Loved the big river and the nature, like you were not in singapore. Actually there are more indoor exhibit than outdoor so you won't get exhausted cause the heat..a lot of fresh water fish, some are really big, like fish from amazon.. the main object, of course the panda. This big cute bear will attract crowd, although do not move too much, but seem happy. I took a log flume that go through some animal exhibit, but seem the animal are pretty shy at that time, so no much too see
The main aquarium tank is pretty big, recommend to see.
You could also eat panda look buns, which actually to cute to eat.
A lot of haloween decoration, since it was halloween time when i visited it. The exhibit information is informative yet suitable for young age"
,,Great addon to the zoo,4.0,,"This is not as big as the zoo and can be covered in 3-4 hours. We reached here at around 1 pm after we had covered the zoo. Unfortunately the Amazon River Quest ride was suspended until further notice on the day of our visit. The main highlights for us were of course, the pandas, red panda, squirrel monkeys, crocodile."
,,It was fun,4.0,,Enjoyed this attraction last May. We chose this over Singapore zoo because we have seen lots of zoos already. We wanted to experience the boating quest. The Amazon river quest boat ride was kind of short though and didn't see the jaguar. Anyway the giant Pandas were cute.
,,"Great for kids, but overpriced.",2.0,,"Summary: If you've been to the Singapore Zoo and could live with not seeing the Pandas, you may skip this. If you must see the Pandas and able to shrug off the little naggy feeling of being ripped off, it's still a good experience.

River Safari is, as the name implies, a river-themed park. The experience is rather linear, ie your typical adventure will start from the entrance beginning with the 6 iconic rivers of the world, Panda, cross the bridge over to Boat Plaza for the Cruise & boat ride, head towards Amazon Flooded Forest, end. It's much smaller than Singapore Zoo and generally 2-3 hours is sufficient. More if you intend to read every explanatory boards. Most of the park is covered, so it makes checking the weather forecast less of a major concern. As you go through the 6 rivers of the world, there is very few memorable experience except maybe the up close encounter with the big croc at Ganges River, provided it is resting by the glass and you can examine it closely. If not by the glass, you can't even see it because the water is murky. The rest are mostly freshwater fishes, more fishes and oh, have i mentioned fishes? That's all I have to say for the 6 rivers, let's get on with the rest of the attraction.

We visited early in the morning on a weekday. I suggest you make a beeline to the Panda first thing in the morning when there's no crowd. We're lucky because the Pandas were active when we visited providing lots of photo opportunities and selfies if that's your kind of thing. Also because there're just us with virtually no one else so it's a leisurely and peaceful experience. If your timing is less fortunate and visit during their nap time, you may see KaiKai napping in the exhibit enclosure and JiaJia retreating to her ""private chamber"" you can view her through live CCTV feed. The Panda exhibit is very kid-friendly. In fact, so do most of the theme park. Take note it's air-conditioned and could be a little cold for some. So a sweater may be a good call if you plan to spend a long time with the Pandas.

Besides the Pandas (which is undoubtedly the main attraction), there are few other highlights. Let's look at some of them.

Cruise: Not included in the entrance ticket, pay separately. Decided to give it a try for the kids even though I suspected it will not be worth it and I was proven correct. The cruise started off with the friendly guide giving some safety instructions and introduction to the tour. The cruise goes around a circle hugging the coast line in a clockwise round turn so I suggest you sit on the left side to have closer view to shore. As it cruise along you hear some commentaries but i wasn't paying much attention to it cranking my neck trying to see any giraffes, or elephants. The ride is super smooth (umm, you're in a reservoir, not open sea) and it provides a new perspective looking at the reservoir from the water. It takes about 15min for a round trip and for you to realize ""dang, could have skip this"".

Amazon River Quest is a fun boat ride taking you through many turns and exhibits. Again admission fee is separate from the entrance ticket so you need to purchase separately (you will be asked at the ticketing counter if you want this, can add on to the entrance ticket). The problem is, the ride is very short only about 10min or maybe less but the worst part is during our visit most of the animals are in hiding. According to the park map there are about 11 types of animals for this boat ride but we only managed to see 4. 2 types of monkeys, flamingo and scarlet birds. Yes you've been pre-warned that you might not get to see all animals. I can understand that and was prepared not to expect to see all of them but still, less than half is hugely disappointing. If you're lucky and get to see most of them, this is definitely a fun & exciting adventure, despite having to pay extra for a very short experience.

Squirrel Monkey Forest was one of our look-forward to exhibit but unfortunately it was closed for maintenance. Lesson learnt: do not trust the website 100%, because no where it was stated that it's closed for maintenance (you get to see lots of pop-up reminding you when the Amazon River Quest boat ride will be closed). With not much else that's unique in River Safari, this closure is a blow and another let down, especially when it's not made known on its website despite being a long closure (over few weeks, not just a day). Tip: call to ask any exhibit that you planned to see is closed.

Next notable mention is the Amazon Flooded Forest. which is my personal favourite and one of the few places that's air-conditioned though not as cold as Panda's. There you get to see otters, manatees, sting-rays among others. It houses the biggest aquarium display River Safari has to offer. Not to be missed. I would prefer that there are more different ""behind the scenes"" educational videos instead of a short same video that keeps repeating. If you've been to Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan or Okinawa Churaumi, this will pale in comparison but then again it's not a fair comparison. My point is don't get your expectations up too high.

Wrap up:
If a friend asks me whether it's a good place to visit, I would say it depends on a number of factors, putting personal interests aside. I'll just repeat my first opening paragraph here and add on to that:

If you've been to the Singapore Zoo and could live with not seeing the Pandas, you may skip this. If you must see the Pandas, and able to shrug off the little naggy feeling of being ripped off, it's still a good experience. If you're going with kids, it's still great for them. River Safari is very new in 2014, if you can wait, give it time to mature and hold off your visit till 2018 or when there is a great promotion to take advantage of (like, 1-for-1 promo).

For me the overall park experience is 4-star out of 5. Minus 1 star for the steep price considering the size, number of exhibits and paying extra for rides, and another star for all the negative experiences. At the current price structure and its overall experience, I suspect this will be our only visit in the next 10 years. Many rooms for improvement, and it will only get better."
,,Thoughtful exhibits but only two highlights for me,4.0,,"What has been done here with the quality of some of the enclosures and exhibits is admirable. However, I cannot help but feel a sense of cynicism that River Safari was created as a separate attraction and the pandas placed there to create a second entry fee point. Let’s face it; in any zoo around the world, the pandas are generally a star attraction. If you want to see the pandas in Singapore, you have to pay to also come to River Safari as well as the zoo, because they are not at the zoo, situated right next door. OK, that’s my gripe, now to the review. The River Safari is organized according to the major rivers of the world i.e. Mississippi, Congo, Nile, Ganges, Mekong and Yangtze. Whilst the attraction has over 6000 animals on display, including 40 threatened species, many of these are various types of fish. It has the world’s largest freshwater aquarium. The kids, and there were many thousands of them attending the day we were there, were enthralled by the giant catfish and other huge fish on display in the aquarium. We rushed past those to the Yangtze enclosure to beat the crowds to view the pandas. This enclosure is toward the end of the River Safari enclosures. This was worthwhile. We got a great view of Kai Kai sitting eating his bamboo for quite some time. Jai Jai is not so laid back and seemed agitated and just wanted to get back into the area where she would not be on display. The red panda was cute. The flooded Amazon Flooded Forest was an excellent exhibit. We didn’t do the River Safari boat ride because the location where it is situated on the river was just so unbearably humid that we couldn’t face it. We really felt that we had seen the best of the exhibits by walking through 3/4 of the area on foot anyway. After about 90 minutes we headed next door to the zoo. We got the park hopper ticket including two attractions for SIN $50. We bought it online and got 5% discount. The 20% discount that they advertise online is only for Singapore based credit cards."
,,A Must visit if you want to see the Panda & Amazon Animals,4.0,,"Earlier it was Singapore Zoo itself
Presently it has been divided into Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari.
All have a fee for their visit.
River Safari ride is good and the amazonian river quest is a nice ride.
Best place to see the Panda.
would prefer a combo of Zoo + River Safari + Jurong Bird Park
Night Safari could be optional and is nothing great as advertised and as it was earlier."
,,Good for Panda,3.0,,"We visited only for the Panda. Otherwise it is very normal with lots of fish, croc, turtle etc. If you visit SEA and the Zoo, you can skip this.

BUUUUUT the highlight is the Panda and the Jaguar. Panda is so cute. Saw the Jaguar in the Amazon boat ride. Boat ride is good eventhough it is very quick one."
,,River Safari,4.0,,I was a little disappointed that the boat was not in operation during my visit however River Safari still has lots to offer. Very pleasant but not as absorbing or interesting as Singapore Zoo. Good to see the Giant Pandas 😄
,,Some nice spots but over-priced on the overall,3.0,,"Was here with family. There are a couple of pretty well-done up exhibits - the Mississippi river-themed one and also the Amazon Flood Forest were especially memorable. But the overall experience was disappointing; the park is much smaller than the main Zoo just beside it, and too many attractions required additional charges. Making matters worse is the relatively high-admission ticket prices for just main entry. Lastly, the Squirrel Monkey exhibit was close on the day of visit.

On the plus-side; the place is more weather-friendly than the main zoo, in that most of the park is sheltered. We can easily spend 4-5 hours at the main zoo and still feel as though we haven't spent enough time soaking in all the sights. At the River Safari? We saw all we wanted to see in less than 2 hours."
,,Interesting fact-filled Safari,4.0,,"Was a fantastic fact-filled morning, kids soaked up all the information readily available at each point along the paths. Very informative - extra points given for wonderful information. We all learnt something from our visit. Displays were nicely laid out. If you are visiting the zoo, make sure you include this in your trip - a couple of hours in the morning here and then the zoo afterwards, a great day out. We missed the River Safari Boat by choice, looked a bit boring but did the Amazon log ride - which was great! The monkey house was a huge hit too - the kids were fascinated being so close to little creatures running around right in front of them!"
,,An interesting alternative to the zoo,5.0,,"you visit the different rivers of the world and discover what lives in and around them and also the issues surrounding water and wildlife. Really nicely done, zones to chill out in (esp Manatee section) River safari boat ride was closed which was a shame but we had a great time when we doubled back to see the pandas late afternoon when they were active. Allow about 3 hours to do this properly (more if it is busy)"
,,Loved It!,5.0,,"What a great addition to the amazing experiences that Singapore has to offer. This was a great and educational walk around with some of the best displays I have seen - and of course those Pandas! I could have sat and watched them for hours.

As a family we really enjoyed our time here and it is great value especially if you take it as a package with the Zoo or book on line prior to arrival."
,,Exciting adventure,5.0,,"This safari is not one in a tour as I had thought but sort of like a mix between a zoo and an aquarium that you walk around yourself. It was very educational and I saw lots of amazing animals, many I had never seen before. Really enjoyed my time here :)"
,,Worth it for the Pandas,5.0,,"Well this is brilliant and so lovely walk round and boat ride and well worth the cost is considerably cheap for experience. It is worth it alone to spend some time of the Panda home...we were in there for over an hour watching them eat, play and sleep was an experience we will never forget. Like the zoo do not be afraid to get the mtr and bus there it's easy to do and soo cheap. You don't need to taxi or private transfer,"
,,Panda Heaven!,5.0,,"The River / Night Safari and Zoo are a reasonable distance from the city centre (a taxi or the MRT & bus away), but, it is well worth the trip to see them (They are side by side, and it's possible to do all three in a day if you choose).
The tour takes you along several of the worlds rivers, with the animals related to them. The enclosures for the animals seem to be large and well suited to the animals. Sadly the Amazon Boat Quest was closed when I visited, however, the highlight of the River Safari are the Pandas. They are in a large climate controlled habitat which allows you to get close to them without disturbing them.
There are numerous food outlets and gift shops which allow you to spend a pleasant day there."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,This is a great place to spend a couple of hours! Highlight was definitely the pandas!!!! Unfortunately the amazon river boat ride was closed for maintenance but nonetheless we had a great time! There is only one path around the entire park and its all shaded which is great when trying to stay out of the sun! Plenty of air-conditioned areas and the squirrel monkey forest is a blast. The monkeys are all out in the open and will even jump on the rails or onto the path you're walking on. Make sure you stop at Mama Panda's for a coffee and snack!
,,Great experience,4.0,,"We were a group of adults and we thoroughly enjoyed this attraction. I can imagine how kids would love this place. It is really a walking safari, but undercover (the river safari part is a minor part of the attraction). The pandas were delightful, the large aquarium interesting and the monkeys very cute- you can get very close to them as they are free to run within their enclosed area. Take the kids if you are in Singapore."
,,Suitable for children,5.0,,"If you are a family with little children, then you have to visit this place. We spent half day in here, much longer than what we planned. Because lot of fun things that my boy loved it!
We get cheaper tickets, thanks to our hotel's concierge, we can get 10-15% disc for the entrance ticket, and its better deal than buying online.
Overall its a good experience, our family enjoyed it!"
,,There's room for improvement,4.0,,"Pros
- River cruise was a disappointment, nothing much to see. its a 10 mins ride (or shorter)
- Best to arrive at 9am to enjoy the morning with very little crowd, best to take photo.
- Eateries are located everywhere.
- Overall, it was very educational and fruitful trip.
- This trip takes about half a day to complete.
- Take bus from 'Choa Chu Kang' bus terminal for bus no. 927 or 'Ang Mo Kio' bus terminal for bus no. 138. Both frequency are rather fast.

Cons
- Make sure both amazon cruise and river cruise are fully open.
- One of the Amazon cruise was closed for maintainenance (but able to view again within one month from date of purchase)
- Suggest to purchase ticket online to avoid long q at entrance.
- Sovernior shop have very limited gifts for purchase.
- There's no 'live show' like zoo

check out my photos!

Cheers~"
,,Absolutely wonderful.,5.0,,"I think we have been to almost every zoo in the world, and we found the River Safari amazing. The enclosures are certainly world-class, and there were a great many unusual animals. We usually are not too thrilled by aquariums, but these had us spell-bound. Watching a mother otter teach her cubs to swim was magic, as were the red pandas, giant pandas, and spider monkeys. In the heat, I thought that my husband would do well to spend 2 hours there. He eventually came away after 5 hours! Of course, some exhibits are air-conditioned, so that definitely helped. I would HIGHLY recommend the River Safari to anyone who likes animals."
,,VERY BAD!!!,1.0,,"It was a bad experience.it was not a safari at all but just a simple stupid boat ride.we paid much at the entrance and we were shocked when we came to know that it was just a entry fee,boat ride fee was inside. We were four people and we paid at least 80 dollars for entry fee. I am suggesting u that please don't go there and waste money."
,,Excellent place for kids,5.0,,"If you've time to go to only one place in your Singapore visit, River Safari should be in the top of the list. Not because it is fun or anything but that it is educative, it has beautiful exhibits covering the different river systems of the world and for kids, it has a couple of fantastic river rides.
And instead of the 2 hours we planned, we ended up spending twice the amount of time there. The other attraction of the River safari are the two Giant Pandas. Though we've seen the Giant Panda's in an exhibit in the Atlanta Zoo some time back, here it it more closer and with no glass wall in between, it was fun to watch. Again, the kids had loads of fun here with not much crowd, we could hang around for whatever time we wished to be around."
,,adorable,5.0,,loved seeing the pandas eat and the polar bear swim. enjoyed the river safari too. mind the time some attractions like the pandas close at 5PM
,,Singapore never disappoints you!,5.0,,"I had visited Singapore Zoo and Night Safari earlier in 2010 when River Safari was under construction. Once it was completed, I could not wait to be there again.

I visited River Safari in August 2014. It was an unforgettable experience. Both the Amazon River Quest and the Cruise ride were amazing. The approach of the Amazon Quest is another adventure in itself with amazing display of aquariums around you.

It usually rains almost everyday in Singapore, see if you could check the weather forecast before getting on the river cruise."
,,"well organised, clean, natural landscape, well maintained",5.0,,"It's my first time visiting river safari. I visited during Chinese New year abd there were colourful blossoms and decoration of the Chinese animal zodiac at the entrance. The staffs were friendly, helpful and welcoming. The park was divided into different zone themes, mainly Yangtze river where u find the pandas, Amazon river, Mekong river with big cat fishes, Ganges river which have crocodiles. It's well laid out and the animals and fishes look happy. The mama panda restaurant is ok priced and offer oriental food and a special panda faced design Chinese bun.very sweet amd iunique. Best time to visit is the early morning to avoid too much sun but there'd pllenty of shelter and drink kiosk so hydration. is not a problem. Overall, a new, nice exotic park to see marine animals"
,,skip it for the other parks,3.0,,"The only thing that is worth visiting are the Panda bears, all other animals are much better to see either in the Zoo or the night safari. We would not do it again and recommend the other parks instead."
,,River Safari: An enjoyable walk for family and kids,4.0,,"Reading some comments about the River Safari, it looked like there were mixed reviews.

The River Safari is conveniently located next to the Singapore Zoo - I think from a day trip planning perspective, if you want to do Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari all in a day (little aggressive I know.. but do-able), you can allocate 1.5 to 2 hours for the visit (without the river cruise).

The River Safari was opened in 2013. I don't have the full history but some animals might have been moved over from Singapore Zoo. Obviously many more fishes and animals were added. My wife and I liked their idea of zoning the park based on the major rivers of the world - the Missouri, Nile, Ganges, Mekong, Chang Jiang etc.

We enjoyed the River Safari a lot. Give it a go!"
,,"A bit costly for a ""mini zoo""",3.0,,"The usual price for the ticket is about $24-25, i bought it at a discounted price $21.50 at groupon. You have to pay extra 5 bucks for each boat ride. The river cruise which cruise around the reservoir and the amazon quest which tours around the small river. We went for the river quest whereby you need to queue at the entrance for about 15 mins to get the time slow for the ride. If you buy online first it may save sometime. The river quest ride is very short say 5-6 minutes and too fast to capture the animals and take picture. Some stations you do not see the animals , it is dependent on your luck. If you do not take this ride you will complete the second half of the tour real fast.

It takes less than 30 minutes to pass through the exhibits and animals to get to the boat ride. After the boat ride you get to see the monkeys followed by a giant aquarium and then to the exit.
The rest of the animal and fishes exhibits are just ok. The fishes are somewhat similar to those at SEA aqurium at sentosa.

The highlights will probably be the pandas. The red pandas are real active and they do pose for picture taking. Whereas jia jia panda can be quite shy hiding in one corner. Kai kai is more active , he will move around and around.

If you stroll real slowly and look at each exhibit , you only need less than 1.5 hours for the whole river safari. a bit pricey for a small attraction."
,,Singapore made the River so amazing!,3.0,,"You cannot expect to view variety of animals like zoo here. As it is name as ""River safari"" , most of the animals living in water except two cute and lazy Panda (Jia Jia and Kai Kai). Not to miss the short river cruise ($5 for about 7 mins only)."
,,Pleasant Zoo,3.0,,"The plus side here yes it is a well shelted, good place to visit compare to other attraction on a hot humid day. I went on a Sunday, not crowded, easy to buy food compare to my experience at the main Zoo.
But if you have to choose between the main Zoo and river safari, main zoo has more to offer.
The exhibit here is kind of small scale, does not have wow factor."
,,Panda's !!!,4.0,,This is a leisurely walk around the enclosures and aquariums and there is a short river cruise as well. The highlight of course is the pair of pandas on loan from China. They are so cute. You can also add the Night Safari and/or the Zoo to the day's activities as they are all in the same place.
,,Interesting but not fantastic!,4.0,,"My 2nd time there with the kids. 1st time the boat ride was still not ready.
The panda exhibit is the most interesting followed by the squirrel monkey encounter.
Red pandas are very active.
The squirrel monkeys are playful and not afraid of strangers. They do all sorts of funny actions in front of us and we are able to take close snapshots of them playing and swinging from tree to tree.
The river adventure ride was a little disappointing as we didn't get to see all the animals featured. Guess the weather was too hot and they were resting under the shelter.
The big boat ride took us around the river part that covers night safari & singapore zoo. We were able to see the elephants, giraffes and rhino from the singapore zoo when we were on the boat.
The restaurant sells interesting panda bun with either chocolate custard or red bean filling. 1 bun for $2.90.
Overall interesting but not fantastic. There is still room for improvement."
,,Amazing - Lovely unique educational experience,4.0,,"It's exotically different! I loved it and it made me think. I have been to China's Yangtse River and did not get to see what I saw at River Safari. Even if I traveled to the Amazon, Nile or Congo I realized I saw here what I would NEVER see even on-site!!!
The only species I had seen before was in the Mississippi area and only because I lived in the US for more than a decade, and fished around the tributaries of the Mississippi. I've been to Monterey Aquarium many times, that is an on-site aquarium and this River Safari is still unique.

Yes, I've previously seen Pandas as I had been to the Panda research centre in Chengdu China....This place just made me THINK - we've all seen spectacular aquariums!And some of my friends had been to Egypt, saw the pyramids and historical places and fabulous artifacts, but did not see much of Nile water/""marine"" life ! I've been to Brazil - I saw the mighty Iguassu Falls but saw nothing of the riverine life. And the mighty Amazon tank here is amazingly large...I spent close to an hour here, cool if not colourful
The park is shaded throughout, with several airconditioned sections and all very well-paced. There're live riverine creatures to see every few steps, well explained and compared (how its different from those in other parts of the world) and featuring strong conservation messages throughout. Is it important to be good stewards as we all share planet earth, and want our future generations to see nature and what we can see today?
In fact maybe a third (30%?) of the living creatures at this river safari are on the verge of extinction so even more reason to go.
There is a short boat ride and while it's not my ""must do"", going just before park's closing time showed the fading colours of the day, a lovelier side of Singapore.
To beat the humidity, I would get here around 4 and see this just before night safari, with a dinner interlude outside night safari, in between. I think there are specially priced 2 park in a day packages. I think this River Safari is a wonderful complement to Singapore's outstanding zoo and night safari!"
,,Quite Good!,4.0,,"Had a good family time in the morning for a good 3 hours. Very interesting exhibits and the pathway through all the exhibits is sheltered or air-conditioned so it's good for young kids and not as tiring as the other WRS attractions. The distances between exhibits is short, so the kids have something to see almost all the time and are kept occupied constantly. Boat ride is quite disappointing, else it would have been 5/5.

Overall, a reasonably solid attraction worth at least a visit."
,,River safari is excellent,4.0,,"The boat ride,did not dislike anything,all the shows are great,exotic animals,bird show,everything is excellent"
,,Slight disappointment,3.0,,"Good afternoon spent in the river safari, wasn't sure what to expect, I bought it was all a kind of river ride along a path spotting wildlife. Turns out this is not the case, you can pay extra to do this for 5/10minutes though which isn't worth the extra money. A log day and a lot of walking if you do the zoo and safari together on the same day. Not many places to eat inside and the Chinese restaurant had a queue out the door! I would recommend spending the full day at the zoo or safari not rushing around doing both as we did!"
,,A must to visit,4.0,,"Asia's first and only river- themed wild life park.
This safari takes us through several of the world's river systems,viz.The Mississippi, Yangtze, Murray, Nile, Congo and Ganges. The panda exhibit is very popular.A must to see giant Pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia.
We get a chance to see various animals and different species like Anaconda, American Beavers, Mekong Fresh Water Stingrays, Giant Catfish, Jaguars, Giant Otters etc..
The entrance fee is SGD.5 and for Child SGD3/-
Worth the Visit."
,,River fishes & Panda,5.0,,"My first time visit to this place. Went with the wife & 2 daughters. The place is wheelchair & stroller friendly. The whole place is fully sheltered thus no worry about rain nor hot sun. It is still outdoor though so dress light.

The place is basically an aquarium for river animals (mainly fishes, turtles & crocodiles). Major attraction is the pandas that were on loan from China for 10 years.

There are 2 optional rides inside: river quest & river cruise. Each ride cost $5 for adult & $3 for child (3-12 years old). My kids are below 3 years old so they ride free.

Did not go for the river quest due to height limitation (1.06m height min.). It is unfortunate because some of the exhibits can only be seen through this ride. You need to book the timing for the ride.

Went for the river cruise. Basically a 15-20 mins ferry ride that will went pass the rhino, giraffe & lion enclosure (zoo side exhibits). Whether you can see the animals really depend on your luck.

All things consider, it is a nice albeit small place. Can finish the whole place in around 2 hours. There is 1 restaurant inside the place (just outside the panda enclosure) but more choices outside at the zoo entrance. They allow re-entry, just get the hand stamp at the exit.

Tips:
- buy ticket online. You can buy combo tickets for zoo &/or night safari. Its cheaper & save on queue time.
- go early if you are planning to go on river quest so that you can get favourable timing. You can purchase the ticket & make the booking at the ticket counter at the entrance.
- dress light. Its warm out there.
- cash is king. Most places dont accept credit card. There are atms at the entrance to the zoo (not river safari).
- if you are planning to visit the zoo & river safari, I suggest to go for the river safari first early in the morning. 2 reasons: 1) book early to get favourable timing for the river quest. 2) zoo animal feeding times are in the afternoon.
- Night safari is open after the other 2 are closed so you can squeeze that in if you are strapped for time. The entrances are within walking distance of each other.
- bring own snack & drinks to save money.

Have fun!"
,,River Safari Visit,4.0,,"We visited River Safari last Sunday early morning. We were glad that most of the places are sheltered, even if it rains, we can still continue the trip. Jia Jia & Kia Kia are the main attractions, Kia Kia was sleeping but Jia Jia was moving around non-stop, it was really entertaining.

We tried the Panda Pau & Panda Cappuccino as we wanted to take the photographs. But they tasted quite good.

The fun part is taking the Amazon River ride, we enjoyed whenever the boat goes down the river and water splashed onto us. Other than that, there is not sure to see.

Overall still a fun trip with family."
,,Rivers of the World,5.0,,"For a nature lover, the animals, the environment, and the serenity of the adventure is worth the time spent."
,,Really Love The Panda..,5.0,,"Really Love The Panda.. Jia Jia and Kia Kia.. The Panda Pau and the Panda Cappuccinooo.. Other than that, the amazon river is also nice.. but the animals is less and sometime, we could not find the animal.."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We traveled here after seeing the zoo 4 years ago. While not as impressive as the Singapore Zoo, it has an attractiveness of its own. The safari takes you walking through several of the world's river systems, including the Mississippi, Yangtze, Murray, Nile, Congo and Ganges, and displays fish and wildlife of these rivers. The panda exhibit was popular, as were the polar bears. The Amazon River quest was SGD5 and for that its was worth it, but most of the animals were camera shy on the day we went. We also chose the SGD5Cruise which went past the zoo and the night safari, and we were able to see rhinos, giraffes, elephants."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"An excellent display, loved the pandas will recommend this attraction to friends. Although a wet day almost all is under cover"
,,"Small, but world-class attraction",4.0,,"I am a local here but I have not been to the River Safari since its soft launch or official opening until now. The actual park feels small as compared to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. The layout is extremely clever though. You have an overview of the whole park upon entering. You can virtually see all the exhibits and what you'd be seeing as you transverse the clever layout.

You can start clockwise or anti-clockwise and it basically takes you on a journey to learn about all the major Rivers in the world. The multi-million investment by the Singapore Government on building this new attraction right beside the Singapore Zoo seems to pay off quite well.

The Amazon River Boat Ride, while great in concept or amusement parks, moves the boat far too quickly. The moving speed of the boat should have been slower for you to see the animals. I could also hardly see any animals when the boat was rushing through the exhibits. On top of that, when I do spot the animals and want to take a clear photograph even at 1/250, I cant because the boat is moving fast. I only remember seeing the Leopard and a few others. My partner and I could not spot the monkeys at all. The ride needs to be improved for this very fact. That being said, we are able to get so upclose and personal with the Ibis and a few other animals, literally able to touch them (of course we didnt!)

The other exhibits, while great, are not mind-blowing, like the Singapore Zoo ones are. The memorable ones are the Indian Gharial and the freshwater exhibit. The best exhibit is surely the Panda. Kai Kai and Jia Jia are truly treated as the ultimate gems of the attraction. They are treated with the most love and care. The intricate thought to detail, landscaping and all is amazing.

The perfectly air-conditioned exhibit is definitely refreshing for both the visitors and the animals inside. Honestly the pandas are much better treated and cared for than the pandas I have seen in China at Beijing Zoo/Aquarium.

It's a great complement to your whole-day trip to the 3 zoos - Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari."
,,Full of amazing in River Safari,4.0,,"There are so many kind of rare fish in River Safari,and cute panda ,Especially I like the ship trip of Amazon.It's amazing!"
,,Quick Trip through River Safari,4.0,,"We found that we had a small amount of time between the zoo closing and night safari so we decided to shoot through this place in 30mins
The amazon river quest is a must do it was an awesome ride to see some beautiful and interesting animals. however don't sit at the front of the boats (unless you want to get wet)
We used out i-venture card to see this and would highly recommend it!!
Also make sure you pack the bug spray"
,,Big fuss,2.0,,"Why this is created - duplication of Aquariums - we have two in Singapore. Except for Pandas, nothing much to see. A Long walk. Vegetarian food is difficult, unless you come out and go to Singapore Zoo Entrance."
,,Brilliant!,4.0,,"Worth visiting alongside the main zoo. Set around a beautiful lake, the arrangement of the park as you walk through each river is brilliant. We were absolutely mesmerised by the pandas, could have stayed and watched them all day! There were a few too many things not included with the ticket that you had to pay extra for and couldn't see certain animals without, but honestly I would have paid the entrance fee just for the pandas!"
,,Pandas !!!,4.0,,"Actually, like most people have mentioned, it's better to combine visits to the Singapore Zoo, the River Safari and the Night Safari at the same time as it's in the same location. The location is also pretty far from the center of Singapore City.

When we went last year, the river cruise hadn't been set-up yet. However, I found the aquariums and the info on the fishes and creature were well set-up. We enjoyed seeing the pandas in their habitat and managed to see both of them.

Good place to bring the kids along."
,,Worth the visit.,4.0,,"Visited the River Safari yesterday, enjoy the site. Interesting and informative for family with children. Regrets that the exhibits range is rather small and most of time difficulty to see the exhibits. Can improve to have more exhibits and also information on the exhibits to be place on TV or monitor screen as notice that the information are place too low thus blocking other from looking at it. On the whole enjoy the visit. Thank you."
,,"Interesting Park, worth a visit",4.0,,"River Safari, Singapore Zoo and Night Safari are all located at the same place. It is a good idea to visit all three parks within the same day, as the parks feature mostly different animals. We arrived at the River Safari at about 10 in the morning and managed to cover the park in about 2 hours. Most of the park is covered, and although it was drizzling, we were not much affected. Since it was raining, we skipped the boat rides. Still we enjoyed the park."
,,Much better than Singapore Zoo,4.0,,"River safari is much better and has more variety in animals than the Singapore Zoo. The boat ride is nice and the amazon ride is ok. They have a walkin queues if you have booked your ticket and its not necessary to rush if you have fixed up a time for the ride. We were miscommunicated about the same and rushed through the park for our 3pm ride, however we could do the ride beyond 3pm. Overall a good experience."
,,A different safari,4.0,,Looks like a combination of zoo and aquarium. Can go quite close to animal is some section. Although some section is like aquarium but it do have some fishes that you will never see in normal aquarium. Not even in SEA aquarium in Sentosa. Amazon quest river ride is exciting. The animal are closer to you then that in night safari. But the journey is a bit too short.
,,Lovely walk,4.0,,Nice walk. Don't need a full day so can combine with Zoo next door. Silly height restriction on the safari boat so my 2 year old missed out. Lack of eating places so take your own snacks. Beware the mosquitoes!
,,"Pandas, spider monkeys, quick boat ride, 2 hours, done!",4.0,,"You should go to Night Safari or the Singapore Zoo rather than River Safari, if you have to choose. But if you don't, River Safari is a nicely-designed, efficient and manageable (somewhat small but not too exhausting) way to learn more about freshwater habitats around the world. Good emphasis on ecology--I didn't realize before how dams also trap pollution upstream, in addition to blocking fish migration routes. Do take the short Amazon boat-you can't see many of the Amazon exhibits and especially the monkeys otherwise. Morning or late afternoon would be better times to go, when these animals are more active. We went on a weekday when Singapore school was in session and River Safari was blissfully empty. Both pandas were snoozing in plain view. Don't miss the spider monkey enclosure. Undeterred by the early afternoon heat, the monkeys chased each other, hung upside down, took flying leaps and grabbed leaves. Great huge aquarium at the end with wonderful manatees. Note that if you buy tickets online, you need to be able to open them on your phone. No water fountains inside- bring your own water. In short-River Safari is nicely designed and laid out, and not too exhausting!"
,,OK for kids.....,3.0,,"We visited this ZOO because we wanted to see the pandas, there was meant to be 2 but there was only one when we got there, and even that panda was hiding or sleeping somewhere apparently. The boat trip was closed, overall, we didn't see/got much for what it cost us to get there and get in. Again, this attraction is for kids, we should have known better..."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"So many animals to see here. Panda's were my favourite and squirrel monkeys were very cute also. Boat trip was lots of fun, we did it 3 times!! Very happy animals here. Definitely worth a visit, you will not be disappointed."
,,River Safari was awesome!,4.0,,Best part of river safari was Panda's! and second best was Amazon river quest ride.. a must take ! it mostly had aquatic animals.. you would love it more if you are fond of fishes.. But do keep in mind that you are going to cover underwater world/ sea aquarium at Sentosa too.. So plan accordingly.. I covered underwater because I did not want to miss the dolphin lagoon show.
,,(for us) the latest one at the Zoo and very informative !,5.0,,"When we planned our Singapore trip we noted that there is a new part at the zoo - the River Safari. After the zoo, before the dinner and the Night Safari we decided to spend some time here. The latest spot reflects the various rivers of several continents and besides interesting animals one has a lot to read (and to learn) !!

We had to acknowledge that we learnt a lot during our visit."
,,Good but short,4.0,,"It's more like a ride at a theme park than a river safari, I imagined being on the river in a boat, instead it was a ride but still enjoyable."
,,Much better than the Singapore ZOO itself,5.0,,"Comparing the ""River Safari"" with ""Singapore ZOO"" parks I must say, as opposite to many reviewers before, that I like the River park more than ""ordinary"" ZOO.

First of all there are Giant Pandas there. Also the Squirrel Monkey forest is quite unique - the closed area with free-ranging monkeys that come really close to you without any barrier inbetween. Watching them play from close distance is a great fun.

But, apart from that, the River Park offers something, that I have not seen before. There is a number of aquariums with fresh water fish and animals there. Unfortunately the number of aquariums is not very high, but still the selection of fish (didn't know there are fresh water fish of such size!!!), crocodiles and other animals is quite impressive. All of that presented in areas devoted to the biggest rivers in the world!!!

You can see different sea animals in many places in the world. The exhibitions for fresh water ones (at least of that size) are not so popular. This is why River Safari is such an interesting Park to see.

In my opinion it is the Night Safari and River Safari Parks that make Singapore ZOO so unique and interesting."
,,Relaxing,4.0,,"It is a good place to visit, to relax (very spacious) to watch the pandas' actions or just to watch the large fishes swimming but really, if you combining the Zoo and this attraction, you will end up exhausted! By the time we hit the 6th hour, we just wanted to sit down. Best to combine Zoo and Night Safari or River Safari and Night Safari but not the both - with excellent weather, it was too much for us as the Zoo has added quite a number of new attractions!"
,,Hit and misses,3.0,,"To be honest, without Jia Jia & Kai Kai this river safari might turn out be a ghostly safari.

River boat ride SGD$5

Kinda disappointed,the ride is less than 10 mins and the animals were hiding under the shelter from the scorching hot sun... we saw the flamingoes and another animal (can't rem the name). Some of the animals weren't even at ""home"", basically we were looking at the greens more than animals.

Jia Jia & Kai Kai:

They were kept in an air conditioned room, surrounded by cameras. If you're lucky you could get to see both of them having their lunch. Their neighbour lives a red panda. It's super adorable that I took countless of photos.

Panda restaurant:

A casual dining eatery to fill your stomach. I suggest you pack your lunch. The eatery is forever full house and the Q for getting food is ridiculous. We Q up to 40 mins just to get 2 bowls of noodles.

Surprisingly, the noodles was tasty and springly. The prawn dumplings were fresh. And the drinks filled in a reusable tumbler.

Overall experience:

Visit once is enough"
,,Worth it just for the Pandas,4.0,,"River cruise is a new attraction as only opened in 2012 it's worth a visit but if you want to spend time here don't book a trip via your hotel as they pick you up at 12.30 only to take you in the wrong direction to Chinatown to pay and then the opposite side of the Island via coach and you will be lucky to arrive by 2pm and the bus returns back at 4.40pm!
Worth a visit to the Pandas but felt sorry for them, after seeing them last year in Chengdu happy in as wild conditions as they are going to get these looked very bored pacing around their small enclosure.
Best to combine with the night safari, the river park closes at 6pm and the night safari opens at 7 (recommend queuing from 6.30pm) to be on one of the first four trams which depart shortly after 7.30 at dusk as difficult to see animals then rather than in total darkness, and flash photography is not allowed at any time. the team takes 40mins per circuit and finishes in time for the first night show at 8.30 the bus back to the hotels departs at 10.10pm but park does not close till midnight."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"I wasn't intending on doing this in addition to the zoo but while waiting in line they had advertisements on the televisions overhead playing what was inside the river safari and I was completely sold. You do need to pay extra to get in but it's only $50 for entry into the zoo and river safari. The exhibits are based around some of the great rivers of the world including the ganges/mekong and amazon rivers. The aquariums are magnificent and the information given is short and sweet. I also love that they emphasise the impact that humans are having on these ecosystems. Whether it's made a difference or not is another question. Definitely a must see if you are coming to the zoo. I didn't go on the amazon river cruise - it seems more geared towards children so I can't comment on it. They really save the best for last though, the underwater forest exhibit is simply breathtaking!"
,,Nice zoo,4.0,,"This is basically in the same area as the main Singapore Zoo but is a more water/river themed zoo than the traditional zoo. If you want to see the pandas, you need to come here, they are not at the main zoo. The landscapes are also very nice here. They break a lot of the regions in this zoo down by what part of the world the animals are from."
,,Totally great experience!! Singaporeans: it is worth your visit,5.0,,"I am a singaporean and was initially very very apprehensive as to whether to visit the river safari because i received so many negative comments abouy the place. I finally decided to give this place a try.. and i must say that my family had a blast of a time here!!
Well, my family hated the sea aquarium in sentosa. We found it too cold, crowded and lacking a special touch.
The river safari, however is different. They might not have as many species of fish as the sea aquarium, but it was extremely interesting to group the fish/mammals according to their living habitat. It was a very good learning experience for my family with consists of 2 children, 4 and 5 yrs old.
The amazon ride was too short for us as we totally enjoyed the experience. The staff were also very strict about the height restriction of a minimum height of 1.06m before allowed on the amazon ride. Luckily my 4yr old daughter made the height limit.
The other boat ride taking us on a round of the reservoir however was boring . Nothing special to look out for and we would definitely give it a miss on my next trip there.
There was also a huge tank similar to that of the sea aquarium for visitors to ait and enjoy the enormous manatees swimming. It was awesome.
Overall, my family would definitely be back.. This time i would be bringing my elderly parents on a wheelchair with me as the place is very wheelchair friendly."
,,Very good,4.0,,"First time here since it opened. Very nice. Worth coming back again, even just for the always cute pandas!"
,,"Spacious, less touristy, breezy and well-sheltered",4.0,,"Thumbs up for the 2 pandas and cute little fire foxes. This place feels a little bit like the Sentosa SEA Aquarium (Which i did not enjoy, except for the Jelly Fish)
If River Safari includes the Jelly Fish similarly to Sentosa SEA, personally I would think you can give Sentosa's SEA a miss!"
,,The Pandas is our sole reason for visit,3.0,,"I dont find the place special, indeed the concept is wonderful but it's quite tiring.. The pandas on the other hand was the reason why we visit this place. There are red pandas and giant pandas.. You can even be as close as 1 meter with the red pandas.."
,,River life is more than just a river!,4.0,,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to try River Safari initially as there were quite a few very negative reviews on River Safari on Tripadvisor. But everyone sees things differently so we decided to go and try it. We were glad we did as we had such a fantastic time. We bought a 3 in 1 Park Hopper ticket which enabled us to go to Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari for $83 which was a great value. There are many more different Hopper Tickets so I would recommend to have a look at the website and buy them online prior to the visit so that you can avoid the ques when you arrive to the parks.

We already have visited Zoo and Night Safari but we still had a great time there learning about different fresh water lives. I have never seen so many fresh water fish in one place before and it really was interesting. The place is divided into a few different sections to focus on different rivers from South America to Australia to Africa. Each river has completely different habitat and comapring them was quite fascinating.

There was also an area where you can see Panda and Red Panda. They were absolutely gorgoues and it can easily be the highlight of your visit.

The Amazon boat ride was fun too. Some reviewers complained that they couldn't see anything or the ride was too short. For me, it was a fun experience. Yes it is true you may not be able to see everything they may point out but we could still see majority of them. You just have to really look for it! The ride itself was probably about 10 minutes but so it really depends on how you see whether you think it is too short or not.

The park is not as big as Zoo or Night Safari so you may not need as much time as the other places. We spent around 3 hours including having a little snack break. We still got to see and experience everything but you could take longer time and go slower if you wanted to. If you are in Singapore for a day or two, then I would go for Zoo or Night Safari and leave River Safari for another time. If you are staying in Singapore for longer, you could allocate a day for each places so that you can really enjoy them without being too tired which we did. I know some people tried to squeeze all 3 places in one day and they all complained how tired they were and couldn't really enjoy it. It's good to leave some place for a next visit so that you have something you can look forward to!"
,,More than a (short) boat ride,4.0,,"We only decided to visit this attraction when lining up for tickets to the zoo. It was different to what we expected as we assumed it was a ride on a big boat through different areas with animals on display. The boat ride, while pretty good, only lasted 10 minutes and half the animals couldn't be seen as the boat passed their enclosure. The other issue we had was the lack of signage giving directions to the panda enclosure (you'd think it would be their main attraction?). We had to ask two employees and ended up walking in through the exit doors. We found out later that we missed out seeing a lot of other animals as we didn't go the right way due to poor signage. FYI - to get there walk along the bridge over the river and turn left along the boardwalk before you reach the cafe / gift shop. Not cheap but worth the visit."
,,Very small but interesting,3.0,,"The place is tiny, can finish walk within a hour.
The animal not a lot, main purpose is the see panda but Jia Jia and Kia Kia are so shy!!! Other animals are mostly imported from zoo. Not much to wow.
The layout is easy to walk around, safe for kids. Convenient for old fork with wheel chair as all flat flooring."
,,Good place for children,3.0,,"I went there with my friends to attend our best friend's wedding. Before the wedding, we gave a visit to River Safari Singapore.

Quite interesting, lots of species and story telling involved in this place. Recommended for your family trip. Your children will love the Dugong section :)"
,,Nice to visit especially during hot or raining day,4.0,,"We bought a double pass with entitled us to visit the singapore zoo and the river safari. Since it was raining heavily, we decided to skip the zoo and visit the shaded river safari. It is more like a giant aquarium that have different theme. The safari boat ride is pretty disappointing as we are not able to see half of the animals during the ride."
,,Enriching day to spend at,4.0,,"Visited this place 3 times since their opening as am lucky to get free tickets though company :-)

Was abit dissappointed with the boat rides as it was really a small section.

@ the panda zone with the red panda and with our Star of attractions Jiajia[ female ] and Kai Kai [ Male ].
it really depends on your luck to see JiaJia as she's so shy that out of the 3 visit I went, had only saw her once.
Love this aquarium area where I could just sit there and relax looking at them swimming around.

Overall, in Singapore a small country this is definitely a place to visit!"
,,Amazing river life,4.0,,"A nice attraction with lots of fishes from various rivers like Amazon, Yangtze, Mekong , Ganges etc Highlight were the cute pandas in air conditioned comfort Huge aquariums and shaded walks is comfortable. Not to be missed if you visiting the Zoo next door !"
,,Worth it to see the Pandas!,4.0,,"A very popular location as the River Safari and Singapore Zoo are in the same location. Easy to get to by taxi or bus. We didn't arrive till nearly midday, which would explain the huge queue at the ticket office as people queuing to buy tickets for the Singapore Zoo as well. I ended up at the back of a huge queue, but was greeted by a staff member who pointed out the sign that tickets can be bought online and then the email shown to the staff at the gate. I did say to the staff member that I have a UK phone, but she said it was fine as the Zoo/Safari has free Wifi (best signal I've come across at any attraction here!) Followed the online steps, just selected what I wanted and entered my card details. Didn't want to wait for my emails, so showed my receipt to the same staff member who took me to a ticket booth, printed off my tickets and voila! Moral of the story is book in advance!

The Pandas are a must see, lovely sight. Seeing the female Panda is hit or miss so I would suggest going in the morning I was told...oh well!

A calm walk around the 'park', nice places to eat for lunch, nice merchandise, which is very tempting (cute Panda toys etc...not cheap though)

The fish are huge and it was nice to see 2 large crocodiles and as you exit the Panda gift shop, you should be able to see a huge Polar bear, which is part of the zoo exhibit swimming around.

There are places for lunch, I would recommend the restaurant inside River Safari as you exit the Panda gift shop (apologies, I can't remember the name) nice food there.

There is a taxi pick up point which can get busy so be prepared to wait, but taxis are fairly frequent.

Lovely trip for younger kids, not a mass of things to see, but the Red and Giant Pandas are definitely worth it."
,,Pandas were nice but the boat ride not so,4.0,,The pandas are the main attraction for this place so make sure to visit them and takes pictures and videos. You can skip the boat ride since for S$5 it was not worth the price. The trip was too short and we were not able to appreciate the animals along the ride since they were probably hiding. Singapore Zoo was way better.
,,Skip the boat ride,3.0,,"The layout of the river safari is quite nice. It's green and peaceful and a nice contrast to the buzzle of the city.

Other than the pandas, which are really special, the rest of the river safari is not very exciting, however:
Many many fish, but since these are river not saltwater fish, also not the most interesting ones; have seen more beautiful and colorful fish in diverse aquaria.

The boat ride on the river is really a joke, very short and rushed, you don't have a chance to see the animals (blink once and you missed it). Not worth the money nor waiting for it in line. Also wondered why you would e.g. put the jaguar (or was it a leopard? Don't know-we had about 5 seconds to look), one of the more spectacular animals to see in the park, not in the part of the park which you can explore at your own speed. Like this you have no chance to really admire this animal.

With regard to the pandas, while it is very nice to have a chance to see these animals, it gave us a double feeling:
You are instructed when entering to be quiet around the pandas, but nobody is there to enforce this. The young girls walking around silently with notice boards to remind the visitors to be silent are simply ignored by the crowds, so that seems pretty pointless and ineffective.

Also, we were surprised how small the enclosure of the red pandas was and how many people were standing around it, even trying to touch the animals. One of the red pandas made a pretty stressed impression, walking around endlessly and leaving its mark, not sure if this is normal behavior."
,,Nice for a Late Afternoon Visit,3.0,,We went late afternoon after visiting the Singapore Zoo (basically connected to the zoo). There weren't as many tourists when we went around 4pm. The panda's were really neat to see. We did the boat ride as well which we really enjoyed. It was a quick visit but worth it. We did the iVenture pass so it was worth the quick visit.
,,Nice afternoon visit,4.0,,"Visited this rather new attraction of Singapore on a weekday afternoon. Having heard much about this place from our friends (mostly young families), our expectations were high.

This place is more like an aquarium really, displaying a diverse, and some really valuable, collection of marine life in various major rivers around the world. Don't fret if you are not a fan of fishes, there are two lovely pandas waiting for you there.

Overall, the experience was good. The heat was somewhat unbearable though. Thank god for the air-conditioned panda enclosure!"
,,"Packed, not a lot to see, lame ride, but the Pandas were cool.",3.0,,"First off, this should just be part of the zoo without extra cost other than the ""ride"". The idea is that it's a zoo attraction with a theme of different rivers of the world. I loved the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari from previous trips, so I had to come.

I went on a Saturday morning and spent $25 total, including the ride. Unlike a zoo, which is pretty open, the initial portion of the River Safari is a pathway with exhibits on the side that you have to follow. The day that I went it was so crowded that there were tons of people crammed up in front of the viewing areas for the exhibit that you had to wait or push your way in. It was shoulder to shoulder, so for some of the exhibits, I just lost my patience and moved on. For many other exhibits, more even than a typical zoo, the animals were impossible or near impossible to find.

Again, seeing the different animals of the different river areas was pretty cool, but for many of them there were just fish and things that you could see better in an aquarium or, again, a zoo. Honestly, I don't remember seeing anything particularly unique along the main part of the trek until we got to the pandas.

When I got to the pandas, which doesn't take long at all, because there aren't many other exhibits, there was a very long queue to get in. So you wait and wait a video screen of the panda’s arrival. When you finally get to the front, they advise you to be very quiet and respectful, blah blah, but when you get it it's, again, ridiculously crowded. The first things you see are the red pandas, and they're awesome! They weren't very lively that day, but it was nice and cool in the building and they seemed pretty relaxed.

The next part was the first of the Pandas, and he was actually out and about. Seeing him was difficult since there were so many people crowding around the sides, and people were NOT being very quiet. There were lots of loud kids... The other panda was a bit shy and stayed further away. The pandas were pretty interesting though and were probably worth the trip.

Next up was a gift shop with more Panda junk than you can imagine, and then it was time to eat. The cafe had a 30 minute line and the food wasn't exactly stellar, but not as overpriced as what you would expect in the states. After that, there were a few more exhibits, and then the ride.

The Ride was like a log ride, but short and not any splashes other than the initial descent, then a slight chance to see some animals. It was a joke. I would not recommend it. It was about 5 minutes and I barely saw anything, most of which I could have seen from the exhibits.

The only other really good part was the squirrel monkey area, where you could go in and hang out with the squirrel monkeys. They were cute and active, so this was also a good point.

Final thoughts: If you can get discounted tickets, you've never seen pandas before, and you go on a weekday when it's less busy, then this might be worth it. Otherwise, go to the Singapore Zoo. There's a part of me that wants to say, ""Stay away"" based upon my principal belief that this should be part of the zoo - especially the pandas (doesn't make sense to be part of a river exhibit really), but I can't completely say that. I did have some fun."
,,Some amazing sights,4.0,,"We had an afternoon visit of 3 hours to River Safari and we really enjoyed ourselves. There were lots of amazing animals to see - pandas, manatees and flamingos being some favourites. My reservations were: 1. many of the animals were only seen briefly on the 10 minute Amazon River Quest boat ride and my 3 year old was not tall enough to ride. 2. I didn't feel that many of the animal's enclosures were as comfortable as those in the Zoo. It's still definitely worth a visit, though."
,,Very good attraction,5.0,,It was a nice place and mostly covered. The bridge walk was relaxing with the breeze and so was the boat ride. The highlight was few minutes spent with the Pandas. They are lovely sight and well kept in conducive environment. Our only purpose was to see them. The other attractions are good too... We liked to see the information about river Ganges.
,,Peaceful River Safari,4.0,,"We went to the River Safari on a Thursday morning. We caught a taxi (just over $20) and were there by 9.30am. I had thought about pre-booking to get our choice of time on the boat ride, but decided to play it by ear in case the weather didn't look good. I could choose any time for the boat ride and decided on 11am. We walked through the various river exhibits with only one or two other small groups of people around - so peaceful for a major attraction in Singapore! When we got to the panda exhibit you could see that sometimes there is a huge crowd as they have ropes set up to deal with the queues. We walked straight in and spent about 10 minutes watching one of the red pandas run madly around his enclosure, including out onto a branch that was only slightly above our heads. We then moved on to see the giant pandas. Unfortunately the female was in her den and remained there the whole time (you can see her on the web cam) but the male panda put on quite a show. He was lying down looking sleepy, but the keeper threw some bamboo in and he lumbered over to it and then lay oh his back facing us as he enjoyed his meal - so gorgeous! We then crossed the bridge over the reservoir to get to the boat ride. We were 10 mins early, but went straight on. As others have said the ""boat ride"" is more like a gentle theme park ride that lasts 10 mins. However, unlike others, we saw plenty of birds and animals, including the jaguar roaming backwards and forwards right up against the glass near us. It's a shame it doesn't go slower, but I suppose when it's busy they have to push people through. Of interest, when we were crossing the bridge, we saw some real cruise boats with ""River Safari"" written on them anchored in the reservoir. The staff told us that these will be operational within the next 6 months.
Moving on, we went through the enclosed small monkey forest, where you can see and photograph at very close quarters - plenty of them to spot running on branches etc. Next is the flooded Amazon exhibit whioch is similar in design to the large aquarium at SEA Aqurium at Sentosa. So peaceful to sit and watch the huge mannatees(spelling?) and all the other river creatures - it's quite mesmerising. We left after 3 hours, having thoroughly enjoyed all the exhibits and creatures (especially the pandas). I must say this attraction outweighed my expectations."
,,Amazon Flooded Forest is amazing!,5.0,,"Went with my wife on a Tuesday afternoon. Be prepared to see some really amazingly mysterious creatures from all over the world! Was taken aback by size of the indian gharial (alligator).

We love the pandas enclosure (partly because it's air conditioned!) and stayed there for sometime to see Kaikai & Jiajia from China. Do not expect too much from them though. There is the beautiful fire fox as well.

Next up the Amazon River Quest. We booked a time slot online and were there early, the kind staffs there accepted our request to join the ride earlier. We find the ride too short and too fast. Could have been longer and slower.

The last and best part of our journey is the finale at Amazon Flooded Forest, which makes our trip all the worthwhile. The giant aquarium here took my breath away. I loved the manatees, red-tailed catfishes and arapaimas in the gigantic blue glass. We can even walk up and see the view from top.

Would certainly recommend River Safari because of the main attractions, Pandas enclosure & Amazon Flooded Forest. Worth the money. 5 stars."
,,nice experience,3.0,,"nice to see the new and the old combinations of the building near the river , a good experience overall"
,,A bit expensive for what it offers,3.0,,"We visited again as the first time we went, the boat ride was not yet operational. I must admit it was disappointing as we did not see some of the animals as it moved on too quickly for us to catch sight of them. Considering that you would prob need a max of 2 hours to walk through the whole park , we felt it was a bit overpriced. Singapore Zoo offers more value got the price you pay. Good points: it is disable friendly with lots of ramps. In addition most of the exhibits are under shade, giving a little respite from the tropical heat. Our favourites were the panda exhibit, it helped that it was air conditioned . And the large aquarium with the manatees . It was soothing to see them serenely swimming about . Disappointments: Ice cream cart was not open on a hot hot day. Only ice cream available was an expensive looking small tub of sorbet when my children were looking forward to a Solero! More water coolers would be good. I would suggest if you would like to visit this attraction to combine it with either the Zoo or Night Safari. Trekking out all the way just for this is not worth your while."
,,It's an okay add on.,4.0,,"Since we were spending all day to do the zoo and night safari, we decided to do the river safari park as well. The pandas were great, as was the spider monkey area where you are in an enclosure with them. Honestly, the amazon riverboat ride was very hokey - it went way to fast to see anything, and lasted 10 minutes. Not worth doing, especially when you have to pick a time in the morning and arrange everything around that time! We spent a less than 2 hours in the River Safari park before going back to the regular zoo.

So, in one day we did all three zoos - so it is possible - but it made a for a long day! We certainly loved the zoo best, and if you have time for just one - make it the zoo! The other two parks appear to be them capitalizing on the success of the original zoo."
,,Ok,3.0,,We arrived with much anticipation. Everywhere you look in Singapore the River Safari is advertised - showing pictures of boat rides and wild animals. It was a little more subdued than that! The boat ride is only a small part - perhaps 10 minutes only and a little too fast - it was easy to miss the animals. Highlights were the manatees. What amazing creatures. Don't miss the feeding at 5 pm. The pandas were beautiful too. Allow perhaps 2 hrs max here.
,,Great Place To Visit,4.0,,"Took a friend to visit the River Safari. A bit on the high side for at most a two hour visit; but then again, things in Singapore are expensive. Nevertheless, River Safari is quite a great tourist attraction for those intending to visit Singapore.

The attractions are mainly a lot of fish, some crocodiles, some monkeys and the star attraction is the Giant Panda.

If you are on a walking tour, then it would take you about an hour to get through the place. Either way, do have fun. I love the dark ""cave"" where you can just stare into the water and see the giant fishes and just get amazed at the creatures there."
,,Still needs some time to make things better,3.0,,"Visited the Singapore River Safari earlier today and it was a nice experience. Was there with my wife and 2 kids. We went without any expectations and therefore were pleasantly surprised with a few things. Firstly, we liked how the Safari was organised by the different rivers in the world and personally I learned quite a bit about that during this visit. We really liked the red panda as well as the 2 panda bears. The good thing about the River Safari is that you can make your way through the whole park with a roof over your head which means you don't really need to be out in the sun much (excellent in a hot country like Singapore).

What I wasn't too happy with were:
1. The Amazon River quest boat ride had a height restriction of 106cm and above which meant that my little one who turns 2 later this year could not get on the ride. This is ridiculous as the majority of visitors to the River Safari, Zoo etc are family with young children. As a result of this restriction, the whole family ended up not going on the boat ride and we missed out on numerous attractions. This restriction should definitely be removed as each parent should be allowed to hold a young one on our lap.

2. A lot of the animals on showcase were unique especially the upside down cat fish, the Indian alligator with a funny snout, red pandas etc, however we left that place feeling that we wanted to see more. In one of the exhibits, we actually saw angel fishes being on display... the normal kind that you would see for sale at any aquarium shops. I believe it's because the River Safari is still relatively new and ought to be given a bit more time to develop and improve.

3. Being set up in such a hot and humid country, I believe water fountains or refilling stations are essential. We saw a few stalls and vending machines along the way but they were selling either ice cream, flavoured water or carbonated drinks.

4. There needs to be another alternative place for dining. We had lunch at the Panda restaurant and it was packed as. The prices were a bit on the high side especially the Panda pau for $2.90 each (lol!) but you'd expect that at a place like this.

Overall it was an enjoyable day and would take up 2-4 hours of your day depending if you're with your kids and how long you stay at each attraction. However, there are obvious areas to improve as mentioned above."
,,Nice but go to the others first,3.0,,"The River Safari park in Singapore is located next door to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. It's a decent size park with heaps of easy access walkways and lovely scenery. The boat ride is definitely hit and miss- it would be possible to miuss out on most of the animals depending on where they were in their enclosures, but it reasonably priced so worth a go. I have been to all parks out of the four now and if you were going to do just one I would say go to the regular zoo, one of the best ever that I've been to, and the second choice would be Jurong Bird Park which is really spectacular too."
,,"Scenic, Serene And Family Oriented",4.0,,"During early June 2014, I brought my New Zealander Friends to the River Safari. Their country possesses a lot of natural beauties. Singapore is a small tropical island with high humidity most of the time. At the River Safari, we are brought into another world of its own. Suddenly, you don't feel the environment to be small. It was airy and the open river sight becomes scenic and serene. The fishes, reptiles, birds and animals are well documented based on different regions and their living and eating habits. There is a short boat trip which is good for family or friends to sit together and enjoy the river sight and the animals or reptiles to be discovered. I wish it was slightly longer. No feeding attraction like the night safari or zoo. Handicap friendly. Last but not least, we saw the lovable Panda. No KungFu Panda chopping around. We end with a good lunch at the chinese restaurant. Most of all, my friends enjoyed the visit with many pictures to bring home."
,,The non river safari,3.0,,This is an open air aquarium with a number of river themes and regional fish. The big attraction is two Giant Pandas there is also an Amazon cruise which is a canal with some animals along the banks Go to the night zoo instead unless you love Pandas
,,Wouldn't bother if going to zoo/night safari,4.0,,"Although interesting with some good animals and marine life (pandas!) the river safari isn't worth a visit if you're going to the zoo or night safari (do both!).
If you do go, make sure it's first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon as the animals are very quiet in the peak of the hot days. Obviously this doesn't effect the fish!"
,,Cute animals everywhere,4.0,,"It wasn't any other zoological garden. The river safari in Singapore is special because it consists of animals that live near rivers or water, such as the pandas, many different types of fish, foxes, bears and even red pandas. Especially their enclosure containing pandas and red pandas. Visitors can see those animals up close, and red pandas are free to roam around, but they won't let you touch them because they are scared. But I failed to visit it early enough to take the boat ride which would have let me see more animals. They really should make the boat ride available throughout the operating hours and not on a first come first serve basis"
,,So much Fun!,5.0,,"Though the boat was mechanical, it was definitely an awesome experience. Different wildlife from the amazon were showcased and the most exciting part was the Jaguars! It's my first time to actually see some of the wildlife in the flesh and would love to do another round the next time. Don't skip it, it's worth the extra coz inside the River Safari complex are the very cute Panda bears!"
,,Well-sheltered from the rain,3.0,,"First time to the attraction and it was raining quite heavily when we got there at 10am. However, except for the boat ride, the trail is completely sheltered, so no problem with that!

Eventually the skies cleared up and we got on the boat ride. Unfortunately, the ride didn't live up to our expectations of a ""River Safari"". The ride was way too short and to compound matters, we found the boat travelling too fast for us to ""spot"" the animals at each station.

Overall, it's more of a walking kind of attraction. We did learn something about the major rivers of the world. But the pandas were kind of out of place in there. No complaints though. They were cute."
,,River Safari Singapore : Take Note (with Children),3.0,,"Visiting River Safari Singapore is like walking through a large aquarium. As the name suggests, there are lots of fish and pretty big ones too... to excite the kids. Not forgetting the Pandas! However do take when bringing your kids, the Safari has a river ride (which they charge in addition to admission fees) that takes you round another part of the park. This ride however restricts children who are below 1.06m tall. So if you have young ones, do take note!"
,,Go if you're under 10 years old,2.0,,"A very small area designated to each of the largest rivers in the world. Some animals were in hiding, couldn't see them. If you're going for the boat ride, go for an earlier one, so you can leave the park earlier. It takes around 4 hours to cover everything if you're a snail-speed walker. Oh, there's giant pandas to see too."
,,Great fun until the flamingos.,4.0,,"This is a very well set out and huge themed zoo. We had to revisit the next day because the river boat ride was being serviced. Advice is to call from your hotel first.
The Amazon boat ride is really only a minor aspect and we were flat out spotting any wildlife as most of it was either hiding or not there. The Flamingo exhibit really stunk something awful. Maybe they should flush the pond more often. The 2 standouts for us were the walk in monkeys and the aquarium exhibits. If you only have one day then don't sweat it if the boat ride is unavailable. 90% you can see on foot. There is no inner transportation.
btw The best and cheapest way to get to the zoo is by MRT to Ang Mo Kio then by bus from the interchange linked to the train station. On day one we tried it via Yishun. Tourist info said bus to within 800 metres of Zoo entrance but it was more like 2 kms...lol Via Ang Mo Kio is the go."
,,Not up to expectations,3.0,,"We have been to Singapore many times and have visited most attractions. However, the expectations we had of the River Safari were based on the amazing experiences we have had at the zoo etc. and were unfortunately not met here. From our impression of the marketing brochures, we were expecting a type of 'river cruise' through the various river themes, but the River Safari is conducted on foot, peering into tanks and reading signs. The pandas were wonderful, and we were lucky enough to see them out and about in their enclosure, but once they went into their houses to eat, many visitors would not have had the opportunity to see them at all except on a tiny CC camera. The only boat ride was the Amazon River, at extra cost. It was a mechanized theme ride that rushed through the various habitats so quickly that one was lucky to see an animal, let alone take a pic of one. There were two attractions we thoroughly enjoyed however. The spider monkeys and the up close view of those great little animals was most enjoyable. The other highlight for us was viewing the otters, amazing fish and huge manatees in their enormous tanks. The hand feeding of the manatees was an unforgettable sight. Overall we were a little disappointed with the experience and won't be returning."
,,Enjoyed ourselves very much,5.0,,"Our second time here. Great way to spend a morning. Slightly crowded on a Saturday morning but still enjoyable. Exhibits are breathtaking and informative. Park is beautiful, layout well-thought, lots of shaded areas. We also loved the boat ride. Overall, highly recommended."
,,Amazing,4.0,,With River habitat displays and animals from around the world also a boat ride along the Amazon River Quest a very enjoyable day.
,,"Relax, enjoy the nature",5.0,,"My girl kept asking for this & I saw quite a bit of fb posting by the youth. So decided to pay a visit during a saturday. We found out that buyibg online was cheaper so we used our smartphone to book it, received an email & that can be used for scanning. Need not print out hardcopy. Boat ride need to separately purchased. Highly recommended if u r going w kids. It's a little bit like a mini themepark ride, that explains the steepness of the ticket price as such ride defintely required maintenance. I feel like it's a very educational trip. Efforts can be seen in displaying,explaining and designs accomidate to the natural surrounding. Love the various exhibits. Food is also not extremely expensive but crowded. My girl loves the trip, will be back to spend time w nature."
,,Fun!,4.0,,"This was our first time in singapore and only stayed 3 days. We didnt get to go to all three theme parks - river safari, night safari and the zoo. They're all next to each other.

We only got to go river and night safari. I think the night safari was overrated. I personally thought the river safari was much cooler. We did decide last minute to go to the river safari, but I was a little disappointed that the river cruise was sold out. From memory its only $5 a ticket but you walk around and see everything anyway

If you're up for it, ask the hotel for directions to get there by train and bus. Its a lot cheaper and the transport there is awesome. Always runs on time."
,,Nice small jewel surrounded by nature,4.0,,"We visited this place with our teen aged daughters and loved the 2.5 hours we spent there exploring this park.

We had booked our tickets online including the boat ride slot at 10am. We reached there sharp at 9am when the park opened and went straight to the Panda enclosure which is located at the end of the park....a 10min walk from entrance without stopping and looking at anything on the way. That was the best plan as literally we were the only people there and could enjoy watching both pandas munching on their bomboo shoots. We spent almost 30 mins there with hardly anyone else.

The boat ride was very enjoyable and since we had prebooked our time slot; there was no need to wait.

After completing these two activites we visited rest of the exibits; stopping and enjoying the sights. The underwater fish exhibits were veey nice.

By 11am the park was crowded and we noticed there was a long queue to visit ghe panda enclosure.

Overall a good experience and from there we visited the zoo next door and spent rest of the day enjoying there.

Vijay"
,,Panda is jjang!!! (Great),4.0,,"I got the ticket for adult 1 day, for around S$25. Cheaper than Singapore Zoo ticket.
I went there on weekday, so not very much crowded, but of course the weather is kinda hot. Bet you have to prepare hat/cap, UV, and sunglasses.
I bought the ticket online, and they offered the boat ticket for S$5 the same price as if you bought the ticket on the spot. This boat has around 12 persons capacity, and going around some spot of the River Safari about 10 minutes (around 15% of it).
So mostly you have to walk around the safari. As the title, you will find river animal mostly. Fun to see them, and take pics. Many of them are the 1st time for me to see directly. There's a cute crocodile, like a mini one.
And above of all, the main attraction is the Panda! Kai Kai and Jia Jia! They ARE so adorable! Walking around their path, and eating bamboos while relaxing. You could see them from a very near spot. The panda conservatory is really cool! The temperature is low (so kinda cold) but isn't freezing, it's comfortable. Maybe they have to match the temperature with China as the Panda's home. So after you got sweat from the outside, it's really good when you got in the Panda's conservatory.
And there's Red Panda before you meet the Panda, which just beside the Panda. Kinda looks like koalas, because the sleep on trees, just like hanging there. The fur is so clean, and looks soft, made just wanna touch it (because so near). Just like a walking plush. Wanna hug them!"
,,Rivers of the World,4.0,,"Nestled between the Singapore Zoological Gardens and the Night Safari, River Safari is a river-themed Wildlife Park that is distinctively unique.

In our lifetime, few of us would probably have a chance to come up, close and personal with the land and aquatic animals from the great rivers of the world. River Safari with its collection of 200 species of freshwater-dwelling sea creatures as well as land animals that make the rivers their home, is certainly a place worth a visit in that aspect.

Personally, I have visited quite a few wildlife parks, aquariums as well as zoos but am still amazed at the number of creatures that I got to see for the first time at the River Safari, such as the Alligator Gar, the African Dwarf Crocodile, Tigerfish, Chinese Giant Salamander, to name just a few. The star attraction is doubtlessly, the Giant Pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia but personally, I find the pair of red pandas simply irresistible and absolutely adorable! I've seen red pandas on nature documentaries but in flesh, they look even cuter than on film.

The River Safari, is a weather-friendly destination, as it is almost entirely sheltered except for the Amazon River Quest which is a 10-minute boat ride along a Amazon rainforest setting. The cost of this ride (S$5) is in addition to the admission tickets to the park. Do note that there is a min height requirement of 1.06m and the ride is NOT for those who are unable to transfer in and out of the boat unaided. Also, there is no guarantee that riders would be able to see all the animals featured during this ride, which might be hiding at some obscure corners, sleeping soundly somewhere or simply too well camouflaged to be spotted. The fact that the boat moves relatively quickly makes the task of spotting some of them even more challenging. If you're short of time, or are faced with a long queue/sold-out tickets, it wouldn't matter much actually to give this a miss. On the map, it seems to be a large part of the park but in reality, it is not. In fact, I went for the ride and it didn't leave much of an impression. (It was 10 minutes of ""where are the animals?, where are the animals?"" And before I knew it, it was over!) Perhaps I chose the wrong time slot (1.30pm) when most of the animals were enjoying their siesta? For those who must try it, maybe an early morning time slot or a near evening time slot would yield better prospect of spotting the animals.

The highlight of River Safari, for me, is the Amazon Flooded Forest which is the world's largest freshwater aquarium. It was truly an eye-opener to witness how the the annual flooding of the Amazon rainforest would look like with its inhabitants, through this special exhibit. It is difficult not to be awed.

There are two eating outlets at the River Safari, namely, River Safari Tea House (where we had our lunch and tea) as well as a more casual fast-food style outlet ""Mama Panda Kitchen"" with both indoor and outdoor seating. Very near this outlet, one can get a chance to take a glimpse of Inuka, the polar bear (which is housed in the Zoo next door) swimming in his tank through a window in the wall! One can also see the white rhinos (also located at the zoo) from afar whilst walking on the bridge that links the Panda Outdoor Viewing Gallery and the Wild Amazonia.

As the park is just within 5 minutes walk to the Zoo, there are other options such as KFC, Ah Meng Kitchen, Ben and Jerry's very close by.

For those who drive, it's a good idea to park at the multi-storey carpark than the open surface lots, even if it means a slightly longer walk to the attraction, because given Singapore's hot and humid weather, it's always great to climb into a 'cool' car rather than one that feels like a sauna. Parking charges are S$3 for the first hour, S$2 for subsequent hours up to a maximum of S$8.

Those traveling by public transport can opt for either bus 927 or bus 138 as well as bus 926 (which only runs on Sundays/public holidays). At the bus bay, there are also special buses for those intending to go for the Hippo-Duck tour after a visit to the park. There is a taxi stand as well.

Also, do purchase the multi-park Park Hopper tickets if you intend to visit the Zoo, Night Safari and/or the Bird Park besides River Safari. There're 2-in-1, 3-in-1 and even 4-in-1 multi-park tickets that translates to good savings. These tickets are valid for 30 days so there is no pressure to cover them all within a day. It is also a good idea to purchase the tickets online. This means not only enjoying a discount but also saving valuable time queuing at the booth itself. Purchasing online is super easy and fast. Just make sure you key in a valid e-mail address to which the electronic tickets would be forwarded. Faced with a long queue at the booth, my husband purchased the tickets online using a smartphone and a credit card, whilst standing just outside the entrance. Then all we'd to do was to show the electronic tickets (in the phone) to the staff and get them scanned before being let in."
,,Surprisingly Educational and Well-designed,5.0,,"I was not expecting much from the River Safari as it was just a ticket included in my package. I had been expecting for he S.E.A Aquarium more. However, when I showed up at the place, I was taken aback.

I was surprise at tanks size. It went from this surprise to another. The tank for Mekong River and Amazon River were amazing. I really loved the huge catfish, the lazy yet huge dugong. They were very lively at scene too. I enjoyed the walk through squirrel monkey forest. They were very nice and energetic. It was a very good way to educate children to blend themselves into the nature. Ooh, don't forget to check out the otters, very active and cute.

The sign boards were very informative, almost every information we need from the river. It is a good way to give your children practical lessons on wildlife. This could be a perfect choice for school trip and field trip, so as to raise awareness in protecting the nature and the environment. The sign boards were designed really nice, especially, the sign board for ""Don't feed me, your food will get me sick"" in the Squirrel Forest.

I could not visit the two pandas as the line was long, and I don't have enough time left for other attraction. You could really spend 2 hours here. They got attractive merchandise too. Make sure to buy the tumbler for only S$7, on sale now.

In sum, I enjoyed myself here, it was a getaway from the urban life and a good place to enrich your knowledge on mother nature."
,,"Interesting, Well-Designed & Informational ""Wild-Life"" Experience",4.0,,"A well-designed route which leads to an educational & enriching experience.

Although the pandas Jia Jia & Kai Kai were the main attraction, most of the other exhibits are

Take note of the bridge linking the 2 sides over a body of water. On one end there is a ""colony"" of storks. Ever so often, a stork or two would take flight & perch themselves on the top of small trees at the other side.
The small trees are near to the visitors.
It is quite easy to capture the flapping of the stork's wings - quite a rare moment of nature.

Tip: The queue for the boat ride is a rather long one. Advisable to purchase beforehand rather than do so at the premises.

The exhibits/enclosures are designed such that you can be very up close & personal with the animals, eg red panda, spider monkey.

The trained staff also do bring out some exhibits (bearded dragon, American hedgehog, etc) & allow visitors to have physical interaction, eg pat & stroke them.

There are many informational storyboards to educate the visitors.

We enjoyed the attraction very much.

Half a day is just about sufficient to cover the place."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Nice place to see marine life up close. The gigantic glass tank above the walk through tunnel enhanced the experience. And they have 2 red panda and 2 black and white pandas. Stay for their feeding time if you can, they are so adorable."
,,Pandas!,4.0,,We went after the zoo around 4.30 midweek so got plenty of good panda photos minus crowds :) the ride is not that long so u can wait for each other if u have a baby since little ones cannot go on the ride.
,,A bit of an unfortunate day,3.0,,"We went to River Safari on the 15th June, which was a bit rainy and your typical garden-variety hot humid Singapore day. The exhibits are very interesting, combining an aquarium and a land zoo into one cohesive location. It's a bit crowded, but nothing surprising considering how popular the place is. Going to this particular part of the Singapore Zoo triad with infants/toddlers is a bit difficult, since the Amazon River Quest boat ride (which makes up a large chunk of the park) has a 1.06m height restriction. Unless you want to leave your child alone, it is a great idea to have someone who is willing to wait for the rest of your group and keep him/her company. This leads to the fact that we were drenched due to a massive downpour during the boat ride. A tarp ""roof"" to cover the boat during the rain was much desired, as umbrellas are not allowed (presumably so the animals are not harmed). If you want to go on the boat ride, you should book the boat ride about an hour to 90 mins after the time you enter the park. This gives you plenty of time at the aquariums and the panda exhibits that you will encounter en route to the River Quest entrance. The panda conservatory is very nice and air-conditioned, at the very least. The panda was sleeping in a corner and people, including us, were crowding to photograph it.
Once back outside of the panda room you will cross a long bridge which offers a stunning view of the real natural Singapore. It is sad Singapore is building so many artificial ""natural"" areas when the country itself has amazing natural beauty.
After the boat ride, you will visit a squirrel monkey ""forest"" and another aquarium called the Amazon Flooded Forest, probably the best part of the trip. A large group of at least 10 giant manatees were in the aquarium. It was their feeding time, and pans full of heads of lettuce were thrown into the aquarium, and they were all fighting to get a share; definitely a pleasant surprise to see."
,,Rare species on display,4.0,,"The river safari is great for an ""add on"" to the zoo. Total time to see everything is only about 2 hrs to 2 1/2hrs. The walk is on a set path way and leads to the one ""ride"".....The aquariums along the path are well set out and very interesting.
BUT the ride is not that exciting. The boat takes you past several enclosures, but it's hard to see some animals and even harder to get pics as the boat doesn't stop....
The best part is the huge aquarium at the end... full of incredible species including about 10 MANITEES.... they are beautiful and wonderful to watch in the water.
Along the way there are opportunities for closeups with certain animals and even touch a few...so watch out for the keepers walking around with black microphone bags.
Only one restaurant and a few expensive drink stations... so best to take your own drinks."
,,Not as excited as expected,3.0,,"I have been to Night Safari, Singapore Zoo. I have seen the brochure and excited. I went there with my son and daughter. The Safari is not as big as expected. The idea of separating by river is cool. But the boat trip is not nice as expected. Difficult to see the animals and not so enjoyable as Night Safari. Overall, I think going to Singapore Zoo and Night Safari is better but you have gone to them all. River Safari is a choice but do not expect much."
,,Left wanting more!,4.0,,"We were a little disappointed because there more more fish than animals on show, although one aquarium in particular was the largest I have ever seen., I had hoped to see more of the furry variety .Luckily after completing the circuit and not catching a glimpse of the pandas, we went back a second time and for a few minutes, they sat and ate whilst everyone hurriedly took photos. They were a joy to see. The boat ride was over so quickly it was a shame. I have been to the zoo before and enjoyed it, but this time my sole intention was to see the Pandas and I am so happy I did. I think it was a little expensive for what is actually there."
,,Average. Boat ride is bordering scam.,3.0,,"Wide selection of fishes and marine life. Variety can be improved though. Some of the fishes did exhibit visible signs of stress due to poor water maintenance. There are a sore lack of of native aquatic plants in all exhibits. Forget about the boat ride. Other than a few flamingoes and a jaguar, there is nothing to see on the 10mins ride. Not worth queuing for it."
,,Put it on your itinerary,5.0,,I had heard about the place but wasn't sure what it really is. This place is one of the best fresh water aquariums in the world. The way they have organised it unique with every famous river has its own section with its own environment and habitat. The panda enclosure is fabulous and the amazon river ride is amazing.
,,Good to visit...,3.0,,"Overall ok, but not managed to take the river cruise as fully booked due to school holidays. A good place for kids even adults to learn :)"
,,Good but not exceptional,3.0,,"A pleasant walk by the reservoir (which looks like the river).

Essentially an aquarium with river themes.

Highlight are the pandas, whose enclosure is air-conditioned and so very comfortable.

We did not go on the boat ride, as there was a long queue.

A good attraction, but not exceptional. The night safari and the zoo are better.

Worth a visit if you have half a day to kill."
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"I prefer the zoo and the Night Safari. The river safari is a bit small in my opinion, but it is sheltered, good for families with young children and elderly."
,,Skip the boat ride,4.0,,"I went for the manatees and pandas and they didn't disappoint. I went on a Sunday around lunchtime, there was quite a queue to get the tickets, but it moved quickly and efficiently. The exhibits were clean and the water in the tanks was so so clean that you could see even minute details on the fish and animals. I saw the male panda in his enclosure and the female panda is shy and so you'll be lucky to see both out and about. You do get funnel through the pandaemonium of merchandise afterwards, should you need panda slippers, this is the place to get them. The manatees were phenomenal, we got there just as they were being fed, they were so beautiful and there was so many of them and so many windows to see them through too. The viewing deck on the top of the tanks was really cool and gives a great view of the otters if you didn't see them in the tunnel. The river ride was short and not worth the extra $5, it was really hot and you speed past the enclosures. Your feet are the only part of you to get wet despite the small raids. The flamingoes are very pink, which is great, but unless you need to see the jaguars I would suggest you give it a skip."
,,A learning journey,3.0,,"It's like taking a trip down the various rivers.. The Amazon, Ganges, Murray , Mississippi , Mekong and Yangtze ..featuring the species found and it's unique features. The highlight would be the 2 pandas, if you are lucky to see it. Not many eatery once you are inside, so timed yourself to end the tour near lunch hour , where you get more choices at the exit."
,,It rained...,5.0,,"We were excited. We paid and we're ready. But it rained!!!

It was very informative. We saw a lot of different animals including the panda which I like. But unfortunately it rained so hard that they canceled the river cruise. Good thing the area is equipped with different restaurants to relax and wait.

We spent a lot of time traveling via MRT on our way there from Carlton City Hotel. Then took a long bus ride back. Got to the hotel around 11:30 PM.

Will definitely go back and try again... no rain pls."
,,Erm......it is just another Zoo,4.0,,"Pretty much the same except, there are new additions llike pandas, piranhas & themes about various jungles like the amazon etc. Expect so much about the boat ride but end up dissapointing. Fret not, place are well covered by shelter. Eateries are good. Overall, well done but still preferred the original..."
,,River Safari,4.0,,"My family and I went to River Safari on 12/06/2014. It was a rather warm day. Nevertheless, we had lots of fun. We enjoyed ourselves a lot. My boys love the different rivers theme. They get to know more about different rivers in the world. Which is the longest, deepest rivers....... We saw lots of fishes. Some of the enclosures are air conditioned which is nice as the weather is very hot here in Singapore.
The river cruise is only 10 mins, too short. River Cruise fee is not included in the entrance fee. Children must be at least 1.06m to thake the cruise. Those who want to get a little splash should ask for the front seats.
The pandas are so cute. It's so enjoyable watching the pandas, especially in the air conditioning encloure. There are gift shop selling souvenirs but a bit pricey."
,,More informative than entertaining,4.0,,"This is a very good attraction, just not as entertaining as the bird park and night safari. It contains a lot of interesting information but is more focused on different habitats than animals. I appreciate that most of the park is covered from the sun. One major area for improvement is the boat ride. It reminded me a little of the jungle cruise at Disney World. I appreciate the effort it took to plan the ride, but the boarding and disembarking process was surprisingly inefficient for Singapore. This process took more time than the actual ride! I think this attraction is worth visiting once but not if you only have limited time in Singapore. I recommend taking water and snacks, since dining and concession options are very limited. If leaving by taxi, I would pre-book as the line gets very long."
,,Informative and Fun,4.0,,"River Safari is a part of Singapore zoo. We went there using MRT and Bus. Alight at Ang Mo Kio MRT station and catch bus #138 for the zoo.
It's advisable to buy tickets for Zoo+River Safari Combo. First go for River Safari.
We got to know many interesting facts about the mighty rivers of the world like the Ganges, Nile, Amazon, Yangtze, Mekong. We also saw Red Panda and White Panda! You get an option for a boat ride in River safari. It's okay but cheap so you can as well buy those tickets. We could see animals living near river shores.
Overall, a very good experience!"
,,Not as good as the ZOO but has pandas!,4.0,,"I have visited twice since the River Safari has opened. There are few interesting animals you can't see at the ZOO like beavers and of course the pandas. You can also learn about different rivers around the world and ride a boat on a small river. The boat ride is not essential as it takes about 7-10 minutes and if you are not very lucky you might not see many animals on the way. I also like to stop at a cafe by the panda enclosure for a chocolate custard panda bun and some lotus fried chips, yum :)"
,,Great day out,5.0,,"We spent the day at the River Safari and the zoo. My adult son is a huge panda lover, so it was a delight to see these lovely animals close up. We went on a Tuesday, so the queues weren't too bad. The actual river safari, which takes around 10 minutes, could have been better designed, but that is a minor gripe. The actual river exhibits were very good and showed fish and mammals that I haven't seen before, even though I've visited numerous aquaria throughout the world.

Well worth the visit."
,,Not as great as it sounds,2.0,,"Very disappointed with the river safari. Not a lot to see in there, and even less on the boat ride (which is an additional $5 per person). The boat ride is basically a ""log flume"" ride from an amusement park, without the thrills. You go past some animal enclosures and you're lucky if you see half of them. It doesn't help that there is no option to try to see these animals unless you go on the boat ride!

Only positive from this place was the Red pandas and Giant pandas - I'm sure they are only placed in the River Safari to make sure people have to visit the Zoo AND the River Safari. Pandas in a RIVER safari? Yeah right."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Its a difficult (if not impossible) task to represent a major river's ecosystem if all you have is few fishes+reptiles. And that's where the River Safari fails. Each of these rivers are the lifeblood of their respective countries (Congo, Nile, Mekong, Ganges...) and each is represented in 10-15 metres of space; showing the above mentioned fishes+reptiles. One just does not get a feel for this
The boat ride is really bad - its about 10 mins long & a lot of animals were not to be seen.
The pandas have an enclosure of their own and are nice to behold. There was a short show with iguanas & a kite, which was also good. The Flooded Forest exhibit was good too.
Restroom facilities are inadequate, so go to the loo just before you enter.
Thankfully, I did not pay for the tickets,(I got a free pass for me & my family from my employer) which was the best part of this excursion (its still a pretty penny by taxi from the city centre)"
,,Safari in the River,5.0,,Newest attraction around Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. Many interesting zones. Don't miss the super cute Panda and take a ride along the river.
,,"Once, is enough....",3.0,,"A shadow of what the Singapore Zoological Garden and Singapore Night Safari has to offer. Disappointing trails and almost below average River Boat ride. For the price that you pay, it is just ""average"" or worse, ""disappointing"".

Some saving graces though: The monkeys (which run free in some enclosures which are open to public) and the Red Pandas (which are SO CUTE!).

If you can spend beyond 3hours here... you MUST be a real animal lover. Or just a slow-walker."
,,Nothing special. . . a bit disappointed truthfully,3.0,,"I was a bit disappointed to be honest.

I had pre-booked everything online (online discount), including the 'boat ride'.

The exhibitions are okay, the zoo is definitely more exciting.

The Boat Ride was very disappointing in my opinion. Make sure you get there at least 45 mins before hand so you can look at the animals on the way to the boat ride and don't need to rush. (which is located pretty much in the middle of the Safari).

Ok for dates, although the restaurants there suck."
,,Overcrowded in school holidays. Avoid,2.0,,I am sure off peak it is better but in school holidays I could not move and in the heat it was extremely uncomfortable. The giant pandas were well done but again the crowds were relentless. Best exhibit was the manatees.
,,Love the pandas!,4.0,,It's advisable to go here if you're travelling with kids. There are a lot of animals to see especially the cute red pandas and the black and white ones. Be sure to try the Mama Panda Kitchen as it serves cute Panda Pao's which are really cute to eat and $5.50 coffee. Quite expensive but is really worth a try.
,,Very clever marketing !! Not worth,1.0,,We absolutely did not like this place ... only think good here were the cute pandas... but we felt it was a waste of money !!! Not recommended ... It just another zoo ... and mind well to book boat ride in advance as it's usually full....
,,Average Attraction,3.0,,"Singapore River Safari is situated next to the Singapore Zoo. Transport to the attraction is convenient, you can either drive there, of take public buses or taxi. The park was built to house the 2 giant pandas loaned from China in 2012. The size of the park is only a third of the zoo next to it and the ticket is priced at SGD23.00 with additional SGD5 for the river boat ride. With SGD5, I think the boat ride is a rip off as it finished in 10 minutes and the speed of the ride was so fast and we hardly able to properly admire the exhibits along it. The park attractions are mostly covered and shielded from rain and shine. The food in the Panda Mama Kitchen is surprising good for a park attraction especially the ramen."
,,nice day out,4.0,,"My second visit. Tuis time the amazon river quest ride is open but I did not get on it because there is a min height of 1.06m which none of my children have met, no worries about rain or sun because the entire place is covered with a sheltered walkway and airconditioned at the very end where the manatees are. Love the pkace and is a wonderful half day out. We concluded the ebtire walk in abt 3.5 hours."
,,Great esp for the pandas,4.0,,"A great mini version of the zoo, the highlights being the pandas.
It has a lovely theme running throughout,which is very educational and informative
The size of the park makes it ideal for little kids.
The panda cafe was great for a snack, both the gyoza and wonton were very tasty"
,,River Safari -,4.0,,"Do’s and don’t’s.
DO wear some comfy walking shoes. This place covers 12 hectares/30 acres so expect to cover some ground.
Also DO take some water with you. It's a hike and on a humid day you'll need something to sip on.

DON'T go with a tour group.
Of all the things we did in Singapore we spent more time traveling to and from this attraction than any other.
In addition to that Chinatown is the mustering point for a number of tours so by the time you are picked up at your hotel, pick up other guests from their hotels and then dropped at Chinatown then sorted as to what site you’re visiting and then buy your ticket there’s another ½ hour gone so, in reality 1 & ½ hours of your morning or afternoon tour is taken up with travel and logistics.
We found that our group split up very quickly once we got to River Safari and because we knew we were on a tight time frame it added some stress to the trip that we didn’t need, constantly trying to find the other group members.
We could and would have spent more time here but ended up going on a “speed tour” and didn’t see nearly everything that we wanted to.

Anyway, to the highlights
The River Safari features enclosed areas that are themed to 5 different major river systems from around the world with plenty of vantage points both above and below the water line.
There are a huge number of animals on display and the manatee was probably my favourite.

I’m still struggling to work out what river system the polar bear comes from!! :-)

The Giant Panda Forest is a special climate-controlled display with conditions that are programmed to change through the year to duplicate the seasons they would experience in the wild.
There's Red as well as your standard B&W pandas!!
This display had only been open for about a year when we visited but I would have expected that there would be better management of the public because the viewing areas are fairly limited for the giant pandas, which most people seemed to want a picture of, and it was difficult to get up close.

OK!! The theme park ride.
If you have no expectations then you won’t be disappointed.
I’m saying that because this thing from what I’m told is NOT working more often than it is.
I’m going on what our tour guide told us and apparently it had been out of action for a number of months just prior to us visiting and it broke down again when were there, costing us more time on an already tight schedule. We eventually got on board and there are some great animals to be seen but enclosures are very small so I did feel sorry for the animals.

Overall the River Safari was good but I wouldn't recommend going on one of the package tours unless you go in the morning, take your time, and then make your own way back."
,,I love it so much a highly recommend place to go,5.0,,"a handicap friendly Safari , staff are friendly and helpful, I bring my old parents there and they find 2 wheel chair for us .
We enjoy the whole trip . everywhere are sheltered so even raining still can enjoy our walk.
I love the small money run over and come toward us within contact range
the Panda are so active, clean and lovely
Specially the raccon is so cute
you can also find different cocodile , fish in different part of the world
The stars are Otter and Mermaid( what is that -find out by yourself)"
,,Worthwhile trip...educational too,4.0,,"The walk around the safari is well-sheltered so even on a hot day, it was a pleasant stroll. Don't have to worry about being in the hot sun. The river cruise was a disappointment though....the speed could have been slower to give us more time to spot some of the animals and/snap photos."
,,River Safari,4.0,,Quite a nice to place to visit with kids because they can get to know more about the sea animal and of course panda. Just that the river boat ride not so fun because too short journey and nothing much to see.
,,Boring.,1.0,,"Went there because we got free tickets from our company. I was with my husband and 2 children, 6yo and 2yo. Got boat ride tickets also but my 2yo and I couldn't go on it because of height limit. So there's NO way at all to see the animals that you can see if you had the boat ride, which is reallyreally ridiculous. At least have a walkway, so famillies with small children can still see.

No halal food available at all. It's like being in a zoo at China, with all the China-themed restaurants inside.

Don't waste money. Don't bother going. We spent barely 1.5 hours in it."
,,Wow,4.0,,"Get in early between 9am to 10am to see the pandas in action. The panda will be moving around and eating during this period, and will ""sleep"" after that. So make sure that this is the first stop of the day.The red panda is essential active all day long. As for the river safari boat ride, its about 8 mins, and you can view travelers' experience on youtube. Personally, it depends on your luck to see the animals, but for me, the animals were ""hiding""."
,,Very Informative and Engaging Experience For Children,4.0,,"We had taken a trip down to the newly opened attraction in Singapore - River Safari. The theme park is very educative for young children as they get to view a variety of Aquatic animals from all over the world. The entire safari is neatly grouped in continents and acquatic creatures are housed accordingly. There is a big variety of species and it is a very engaging experience. The Plus point is to watch Giant Panda and Red Panda in the enclosure. And.. the short boat ride is also very interesting.

Overall a good expereince and is very informative for the children"
,,Not up to expectation,3.0,,"I went to the river safari because my company gave me 2 free tickets. Thankfully, I did not pay for the tickets because it was such a huge disappointment. The boat ride was sold out when I got there at 11 am and the other attractions did not justify the price of the tickets.

I would give it a miss unless there are free tickets as it is absolutely not worth it."
,,Disappointment Safari,2.0,,"Went during the week, the boat ride was closed. Boat ride is an extra $5, so we were not charged for it. However looking at the park map, half the animals are along the boat ride. So we did not get to see half of the animals there, we were very disappointed."
,,Boat ride disappoints,3.0,,"The short boat ride and the need to book a slot do not justify the time, effort & cost. There isn't as much to see. The name 'river safari' conjures something big and exciting; what one saw during the boar ride is neither. Indeed the highlights are the Pandas (including the red version), which is a better fit with the zoo proper."
,,Family visit to here,5.0,,Visit this place with my 3 teenager sons. Surprisingly all of them enjoy this place very much. This place is definitely worth a visit. The aquarium is very impressive. Book online to avoid disappointment on the river boat tour. You get 20% discount on the ticket too if book online.
,,Short distraction for the kids,4.0,,"The themed sections was good info-tainment for the kids. By the time we finished visiting all the sections, they were tired and called it a day. Particularly loved the cute pandas and the Amazon flooded forest."
,,Mystic and wonderful place!,5.0,,Must see at 8-9pm as most animals are awake. The tour train is a great experience and one gets to see different species of Fauna. Keep about 2 hours for the tour + Dinner. Dont miss out on the shops around especially one place where you get foot cleansing massage from several little squiggly fish!!
,,An amazing River-themed Wildlife Park,3.0,,"When my husband informed us that he had 4 complimentary tickets to River Safari, my daughter and I were less than keen. We were sceptical about what to see there and figured that we would finish exploring the whole place within an hour. We were definitely wrong because we ended up spending 4 hours there.

River Safari, Asia's first and only river-themed wildlife park, is nestled between Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. When we reached there at 11 am, we had already missed the timing of the boat rides and had to settle for the next available boat ride at 2.30 pm. As such, it is wise to go to the park early and book the boat ride time slot at the ticketing counter as there are limited seats available and are issued on a first-come-first-serve basis.

There are two zones in the park - Rivers of the World and Wild Amazonia. There are 7 rivers to explore at the Rivers of the World zone, namely Mississippi, Congo, River Nile, Ganges, Murray, Mekong and Yangtze rivers. The Mississippi river, is home to the beavers, alligator gar and paddlefish. All exhibits are in a glass viewing gallery so that we can come up close and personal to the water creatures. We spotted the African dwarf crocodile at the Congo River and learned that this crocodile is seldom hunted because its skin is too rough for good quality leather. We were amused to see the Tiger Fish with its sharp teeth exposed as it has no lips. River Nile is the longest river on earth and houses the giant Puffer fish, which when alarmed, will inflates its body to scare away predators. Ganges River has the Indian Gharials and we spotted two ferocious ones lying beside each other. Mekong River is the 7th longest river in Asia and is the most productive river in the world. Here we saw the Mekong giant catfish and the giant freshwater stingray, both were very impressive in size. We also learned that the scales of the giant Siamese carp are used to make shuttlecocks. Yangtze River is China's longest river and we spotted the Chinese giant salamander and the rare Yangtze alligator here. We also learned that the shallow waters of the rice fields are homes to a variety of wildlife such as the lesser adjutant stork, cattle egret and elephant trunk snake.

Our next stop is the Giant Panda Forest, which is always popular, with long queues. This place is home to the Golden Pheasants, Red pandas and the adorable two resident Giant pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia. We were fortunate to catch the Giant pandas in action as they were awake at that time. Kai Kai was happily eating his bamboo leaves and was simply basking in the adoration and attention by the visitors. It was hilarious to see his playful antics as he rolled on the grass after his meal, as an insect had bitten him. Finally, he went to his bamboo resting place to take a nap and it was such a blissful sleep. Jia Jia, on the other hand, is shy and was strolling for a short while before she retreated to her den.

As we strolled along the viewing deck to the Amazon River Quest, which is located at the Wild Amazonia, we took several shots of the scenic and calming view of the Upper Seletar reservoir. We took the boat ride to the Amazon rainforest for more sightings of the animals and spotted the collared peccary, Brazilian tapir, jaguar and the Carribean flamingos but I wished the boat had stopped at a few designated stops for us to take photos as it is difficult to take photos from a moving boat.

The common squirrel monkeys at the Squirrel Monkey forest live in troops and are excellent climbers and you can hear their lively chatter at this tropical forest. The monkeys were leaping from trees to trees. There was a sign to warn us about urine wash and we experienced urine droplets from the trees. We found out that the monkeys rub urine on their bodies to mark trails for troop members to follow and we were fortunate that we had our hats on.

Our final stop is the Amazon Flooded Forest where we saw the electric eels, the red-bellied piranhas, Royal Panaque catfish, graceful manatees and the playful Giant river otters at the aquarium exhibit.

After the tour, we have a different perspective of the thriving aquatic wildlife and land animals. We were amazed to learn so much about the river-dwelling habitats and their behavioural patterns. It was an interesting and educational trip and our knowledge and IQ index definitely shot up after our trip to the River Safari!"
,,Tag it with the ZOO visit,5.0,,"If you are planning to visit the ZOO, remember to visit this first and then the zoo, You shall save a lot of time and will be able to visit all the attractions.
The safari is divided into few parts and the attractions are placed so. The must visit is the Giant Panda section and Ganges RIver..."
,,2-3 hours,3.0,,"It takes about 3 hours to see the animals in this new well-maintained attraction. Good to go early so that it is less hot. Bring some water along as there are no water coolers but there are restaurants and drinks/snacks for sale around. The interesting animals are the manatees, red pandas, active squirrel monkeys and pandas (was sleeping when I was there). The place is not very big so it will not be too tiring for the children but the zoo is more interesting with the shows and more animals to see in terms of value for money."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Not up to the standard of the zoo or night safari, however the Pandas make up for the rather dull river experience - the parks in its infancy, I imagine it will develop as time goes on."
,,Don't miss it,4.0,,"Went on bus from DuckTours (catch outside Suntec). Queued up for boat ride which was worth the $5 but take photos quickly as it's only a short ride. Everything very enjoyable and interesting aquatic creatures from all over the world. The pandas are cute. Only downfall - not enough seating for elderly or disabled especially on a crowded, hot day. Souvenirs a bit pricey."
,,Pandas were nice!,4.0,,"The park is a nice layout with a big loop. When we were there, the water ride was not open yet. We did this as part of a pass with the Singapore Zoo and the night safari over a couple of days. I enjoyed looking at all of the aquariums, and the Pandas were situated in a perfect place as a thunder storm hit about the time we got there, so we spent extra time with them. The food was good. we ate right next to the Panda exhibit as itw was still storming and the bridge on the next part of our walk was closed due to the weather. Foor id a bit pricey, but not unusual for such an attraction. The grounds are beautifully maintained. My husband is going back during his next trip, since the River ride attraction is open now."
,,Pandas in the safari!,4.0,,"Unexpected pandas in the River Safari! No queue, no crowds and nice cute panda bun! The cruise ride is a little too fast and $5 is quite expensive for the ride."
,,Fun date,4.0,,"We went during a weekday and it was not crowded. We got onto the 11am River quest boat ride, which was about 10 minutes. It was fun and we could see all the animals however a slower ride would give us more time to take pictures. There are outdoor and indoor areas so it wouldn't be too hot. There are many exhibits as well of how man activities have destroyed many of their homes and the environmental implications which is very educational. It was a bit short but I loved the experience there."
,,home of the panda,4.0,,"The main attraction for river Safari are the pair of panda which Singapore has received from China, Kai Kai and Jia jia. In addition to the panda enclosure, the park offered knowledge on major rivers around the world and what species can be found.

The information is interesting and enriching. It provides a different view to the Zoo that focuses more on land Animals. The park is not huge thou and so can be completed in a morning, or just slightly after lunch if you start early."
,,River of Life,4.0,,"River Safari is not established like the Singapore Zoo or the Night Safari but it still boast an impressive collection of wildlife there. You can get up close to the river creatures like the humongous Mekong catfish and the gigantic Arapaima. The main attraction is of course the 2 pandas, although one is always sleeping while the shy one is always hiding in the den, hence leaving the mischievous Red Panda to mostly entertain the visitors."
,,Day out with family ...great bonding with family,4.0,,"We went to River Safari on Vesak day yesterday. .it was very crowded and bought the tickets at Membership Service Counter-saved us time as we are also members of the theme park :)..
it is worth to join as members, make 2-3 trips and is worthwhile, ,rather to pay full price tickets plus your family must love the marine creatures-sharks, manatees, ,otters, crocodiles, fresh water&salt water fishes etc..totally abit different from zoo..

the staffs were great and helpful..
it is a great day morning trip out with my 2 teens n my youngest 8 year old gal ..
We had panda faces Paos in the family restaurant, just outsude the panda exhibits..adorable food..
took short walk to have Ben&Jerry's ice cream at the zoo's entrance. .have 10% discount. Great deal..
oops forget to mention. .free parking for members too ..
great great deal to join as members. .nvr regret!!"
,,Not much in there,1.0,,"Well very small and not much there to see any way. The boat ride which cost extra was just artificially ridiculous, not worth the extra money."
,,Nothing Special,3.0,,Was excited to go there with my toddler in tow. Was hoping to see the panda but I only saw one that was sleeping. Halfway through it rained but the walkway was covered so it was fine. Although I would recommend going here compared to the aquarium. It would only take est 2-3hrs to go one round.
,,Not Quite Up to Singapore Standards,3.0,,"In the category of animal attractions, the latest River Safari does not quite compare to the Singapore Zoo or Night Safari, especially since the price is similar.

Personally, I felt the S.E.A. Aquarium at Resorts World Sentosa is more interesting for marine/fish seeing, but of course the River Safari mainly boasts fresh water species and is different from marine species.

There isn't a lot to see at the River Safari, and its saving grace are the 2 pandas (although almost always sleeping haha), and also the huge manatees which were impressive to see.

The 'Amazon River Quest' boat ride was disappointing to say the least. Most of the animals were hiding in their shelters, and the ride was so short, by the time you reach the end everyone felt 'That's it?'.

Considering that it is located just next to the Singapore Zoo, so if you only have time to cover one attraction, I would strongly advise that you pick the Zoo, which definitely provides more value for money."
,,Good day out,4.0,,"A great day out although the title of it is slightly misleading - You walk 95% of it, only a 10min short boat journey at the end gets you physically in/on the water - And that costs $5 extra. It's worth taking the Zoo pass whilst you're there (Same place). All in all though its very good & quite educational. Would visit again."
,,We loved this gentle attraction,5.0,,"We visited this with our children, and got tickets for the Forest Ride too. Some attractions (the polar bear in particular) are also part of the zoo - but you see the polar bear swimming at the river safari. The pandas were fantastic. We liked the way this attraction is arranged in ""locations"". It was not a huge place, but that is what we liked about it. A manageable size, with good, clear information and unique animals, well arranged.

BUT NOTE - we got tickets for the River Safari starting at 2.30pm. We got there at 2.15pm. We sat in the waiting area. What we did not know was that because not all tickets for the 2pm session had been sold we could have just got on when we arrived at that part of the attraction rather than waiting until 2.30. So note if you get there earlier, you may be able to get on quicker if the boats are not full.

We really enjoyed this."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"I had a good time at the River Safari though it felt less like a zoo and more like a well-curated animal museum. There aren't many animals but worthwhile displays include the adorable red pandas, pandas and squirrel monkeys. The manatee enclosure is just magical and there are 2 amazingly active otters which provide a great deal of entertainment and photo-ops.

The ""boat ride"" is actually more like an amusement park ride than the leisurely trip down the river I had imagined. There are several animals which you can only see along the boat ride including an elusive jaguar so it is worth a try. If you want pictures though, be prepared and be quick as the ride does not slow down.

The park is sheltered almost all the way throughout and a couple of the enclosures are air-conditioned if you are looking to escape the heat. There are food and beverage options available but I would recommend you consider bringing your own as it can be overpriced.

Personally, I find the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari have an edge over the River Safari. If you are planning a visit, it is worth visiting at least one of the other 2 attractions at the same time for a complete experience."
,,River Safari,3.0,,"River Safari is a part of SG Zoo, designed to show species in different rivers. My favourite is African Arowana which is my first time watching the real fish. Other faunas such as giant catfish, freshwater stingray, salamander, panda, etc. are also shown.

The Amazon Forest Ride is ok, not really so excite like in theme park. You could see animals from Amazon forest in short period as the boat keeps moving. Therefore, close your preview function, lock and keep shooting. The habitat is so dense, so you could have only a fews 10s to find them and take a shot. Additional 5 SGD is charged and you have to book the schedule at ticket office. Anyway, we really love the Manatee tank in Flood Forest. They are truely cute.

TIps
- Better get the ticket from kiosk at the airport or on Orchard road to avoid long queue and get special discount. Make sure you get all tickets, as some staffs may blur and haven't given you every purchased ticket.
- Some tanks are not really in or outdoor and you may have reflection on the acrylic. Make sure you have rubber hood for your camera lens and tripod. Really difficult to take good photos.
- Avoid visiting during the weekend, as you will meet a lot of people. The bus from AMK Interchange takes about half an hour to the zoo. It may take longer during rush hour.
- Switch off preview mode in Amazon Ride, you have about 10-15s to find the mammal and take picture. I recommend to sit in the back so you have other people help you to find them.
You may not see all animals as they may hide during the day."
,,Go early!,3.0,,"As the River Safari and the Singapore Zoo are just next to one another, we decided to go there on the same day. We bought the tickets via their website and got a discount and were also aware that we needed to buy tickets for the boat ride at the River Safari counter.

1 May is a public holiday in Singapore. We planned to take the 9:30am shuttle at the Safari Gate as recommended by the website when we bought the tickets. It costed $7 for a single trip. Unfortunately, it took us more than half an hour to go from Mandarin Oriental to the Suntec stop as there were constructions around, the map downloaded from the map did not show the location clearly, no signage in all the buildings inside Suntec, and even various people were being asked, nobody could show us the exact direction. We arrived sharp at 9:30am, but there was one customer at the counter...we missed the shuttle. We took the 10:30am shuttle and arrived slightly after 11am. There was a long queue at the counter for admission tickets including the boat ride. We asked the staff, one told us to queue and after some more than 15 minutes of queuing, another told us we could queue at another side for ticket-holders for buying the boat ride tickets. There was only one counter for ticket-holders, another one for members. We finally got the tickets for the ride at 4pm at 12 noon.

Then we need to queue for lunch and run between the River Safari and Zoo as both would close at 6pm. Both places are worthwhile visiting, but you would need more than one day if you go on a public holiday.

As mentioned in the other reviews, you can finish the River Safari in two hours, not counting the waiting time for boat ride.

We found there was a free shuttle back to the MRT when we left. The departure frequency is much better than shuttles."
,,Great and could improve,4.0,,"My wife and I visited this during the month of April. We booked it through a 4 in 1 ticket pass. The place could be accessed with busses going straight to the site which made it hazels free to get to the location. It's great to see the large variety of fish divided respective to their country. Gift shop was a little expensive.
The boat ride idea was great, HOWEVER their was not much to see and was a bit of waste of time and money."
,,Tuesday morning visit - great experience,5.0,,"2 adults and 5 year old had a great time. Highlights were the giant pandas and the squirrel monkey enclosure. We arrived at 8.50am and were near first purchasers of the 10am boat ride ticket. Had a really smooth ticket buying (had purchased 3-in-1 pass online)/entry experience. All the staff smiling and helpful. We only saw about 3 other people in the first hour we were there (there were lots of schoolkids on the boat ride, though), and got to spend as much time as we wanted (about 20 mins) in the giant panda enclosure, with only one other family in there at the same time - an amazing experience. The boat ride was OK, but quite a let down after the giant pandas. The squirrel monkey enclosure is great - it is off to the side after the boat ride and we almost missed it. The monkeys were very used to people and were running and climbing along the path and were great to observe in their element.

Many of the animals in the rest of the park we had seen before, but still good value for money (particularly when combined with Night Safari/Jurong Bird Park etc, which are available on the river safari website).

You are undercover most of the time in the park and there is probably no need to wear insect repellant (a hat is useful on the boat ride). Even though we dawdled it only took 2.5 hours to get around everything.

Taxi to and from central Singapore (Queen Street, near Bras Basah station) was SGD28 (during peak hour) and SGD19 (around lunch time) and took about 25 mins each way, so a convenient option if you're pressed for time (had zero wait time for taxi from River Safari, as they were queued outside the venue)."
,,River Safari - liimited animals but overall alrght,3.0,,"The place felt like a giant aquarium or underwater world than a zoo, albeit it being a river safari.

There were lots of enclosed glass areas where one could view the sea creatures in thier natural habitat - we managed to see many different species of fish and really huge manatees, and otters, stingray etc. It was rather interesting, and the kids enjoyed themselves.

As for the boat ride, it was full so we did not get to ride in it - I had wanted to cruise along the river because there were quite a few animals I'd missed out on seeing - those that could only be viewed by those on the boat. I hope they would increase the frequency and number ot boat rides overall.

There were some birds here and there, but the exhibits were rather limited .

The red panda and normal (Black and white) pandas were the highlights. They were absolutely adorable, even though the red panda refused to look at us at all. It perched on the tree branch but faced the other side so we could not take photographs of its cute little white face.

For the giant panda (Kai Kai) he was happily sleeping but he looked so lovable, especially when he kept shaking his upturned feet.

,,amazing also for adults,5.0,,"great idea, great realisation , this attraction is a definite must for children but also adults. I had never seen some of those animals despite visiting many zoos in various continents. Giant otters of the amazon and manatees but also Gharial and those mississippi paddelfishes.
The size of the aquariums and the clever viewing platforms thanks to modern technology are so impressive you could easily spend hours there.
Too warm? go to the panda dome to cool down or the amazon flooded forest;
Raining? no worries, it is all covered
I suggest to start your day at the zoo, then do the river safari when it is really hot, and finish the day with the night safari;
Travelling with small children? do not miss the tour where they bring animals for children to touch (snakes, lizard, etc)"
,,Fun & educational - perfect for kids,4.0,,"We did enjoy our visit to River Safari... our favorite were the cute pandas! We liked the manatees and giant fishes from the Mekong River, too. The boat ride was a tad bit short; around 10 minutes, and unfortunately we didn't get to see some of the animals during the ride (some were either hidden or asleep). While you can roam the entire park in 3-4 hours, it's still advisable to go there early if you wish to avoid long lines for the boat ride (the rides are also limited, it could be fully booked for the day if you're not early)."
,,My son loves it...,5.0,,"We have an annual membership and we go every fortnight. My 5 year old son enjoys it very much!

The boat ride is short but fun. With the aanual membership, it's complimentary. One setback is there's limited food in this park. You need to walkover to the zoo for more variety of local food and desserts."
,,Pandas great. Rest educational.,4.0,,"Spent a few hours on an afternoon which was a good time to go. Little crowds. Information for each river area very interesting and informative. Boat ride okay as we saw most animals. Highlights were red pandas, giant pandas and manatees."
,,felt like cheated,1.0,,"We have visited the River Safari on 1st may, 2014. I have read other reviews and was expecting a fun day out.I have to say that I was disappointed. The name River safari is misnomer. more than 50 % of public cant enjoy boad ride. How can you call it River Safari. The first thing which dampen our mood, was boat ride. it was full for the day, so you can not see 15% of park as they publicize in their brochure. Second thing after being so many wonderful places in Singapore, River safari seems a waste of time. It seems that they wanted to en cash the success of night safari (which by the way is 100 times better than River safari) without giving any thought and to my disappointment, It was crowded and people are spending their hard earned money on this rubbish.
There were different river sections. such as Mississippi river, Congo river, Ganges, Mekong and Amazon. All these section are having fishes and another animal according to their habitat. Maybe we are not enthusiastic or we like sea aquarium more. We agree that this is meant for River animals but it was not at all attractive."
,,Fun and Enjoyable for Kids,4.0,,"River Safari is a newly open zoo park and the admission fees are not expensive. You can see different type of fishes, especially the 2 Lovely Pandas which came from China. Kids enoy the boat rides and is fun. Worth visiting.."
,,Not worth the trip,2.0,,"The river safari comprises of a walkway through a series of aquariums, a panda enclosure, then the ""riverboat ride"", then a walk through a monkey enclosure and more aquariums, culminating in a final large aquarium with large manatees and a few other fish species. The riverboat ride tickets must be purchased on site at the attraction, and the queue to do this - on a busy day - was 40 minutes. With four of us at $5 each, that was 40 minutes and $20, all for an approximately 8 - 9 minute ""ride"" through a channel which is bounded by some small animal enclosures. About one third of the animals could not be seen as we went past; the water in the channel flows relatively quickly too, so you do not get to see much of the animals anyway.

Food options inside the attraction are limited to just one Asian venue, where the food was expensive, oily and not at all enjoyable; in addition, the wait time for service was over half an hour (again, on a standard busy day) and there weren't enough tables.

For a family of four, this was a SGD$120 day out (excluding food and transport) just to see a few acquariums, and a few animals, and really not worth the cost or time. The zoo and night safari - both next door - are much better world class attractions and highly recommended."
,,educational,4.0,,"brought my gals here few days ago, i am quite amazed with the park establishment. we bought combo tix (zoo and river safari) so the best way is to come here in the morning and finish the rest of the day at the zoo. Its great that we came on a weekday hence no queue. the pathways are mostly shaded so even though it was drizzling a little when we we there , it didnt bother us at all. and they are also 100% stroller friendly so its definitely a plus for me who came alone with two kids! my children really love the aquarium with the manatees and enjoyed seeing the pandas. i went there by taxi we didnt have any trouble to hire one on our way back. i wish the park is bigger though, we covered all the rivers in 2 hours (minus the boat ride) . a great place to visit with kids!"
,,Just rock up,4.0,,"We nearly didn't go, we wanted to book the boat section, but online booking kept saying full, no go.
We asked at our hotel & they believed the boat was not running.
Nicole wanted to see the Panda's so we turned up at the Zoo to do the River Safari section anyway.
Lo and behold at the ticket desk there were 140 slots for the 3.00pm run @ more for the 3.30pm.
We got to the landing at 2.45 and we're told we could join the 2.30 tour!
I get the feeling that it just doesn't run to schedule,so they say you can't book online.
It was great & even if for some reason you can't do the boat (which is only around 10 minutes) it is well worth doing.
Also did the Night Safari another day, brilliant, walk it first, then do the tram ride."
,,Fun day out,4.0,,"The river safari was a very well laid out and wheelchair friendly attraction. We spent around 3 to 4 hours there on a weekend. Would recommend going early in the morning as the place got more crowded in the afternoon.

Entrance tickets are $25 for adults but there is a 5% off if you buy online using certain debit/credit cards. We also purchased the boat cruise ticket ($5) on the actual day and booked our slot for the boat ride. There are 2 areas to purchase tickets, one near the zoo and the other at the entrance of the safari. I would recommend going directly to the entrance of the river safari as the queue was shorter. Although we booked the 11am slot, we could actually board the ride up to an hour early as the staff were quite flexible.

Highlights of the visit would include the red panda, pandas and manatees. The cheetah could only be seen during the boat ride. We were disappointed with the boat ride as we found it too quick and some of the animals could not be seen (guess it depends on your luck)."
,,Panda Panda Panda :-),4.0,,"we visited the park when it was not fully operational .. in fact the river cruise was not up and running and our viewing was restricted...

however we enjoyed the day out and this was more due to the detailed explanation which was provided :-) ... the place is broken by rivers and we were exposed to things which we did not know and sighting the animals, reptiles with this knowledge made it a good experience

the Red & White Panda are a star attraction and when you see them you understand why :-) :-) ...

My reco's for the place are

1. Come early in the day to avoid queue .. the place is quite outside the city and so you will have to plan your travel accordingly .. Taxi queues at the time of exit are very heavy and so if possible plan a pick up thru the Taxi call center
2. Pick the Map and spend time reading thru them .. this is a large place and this exercise will help you optimize your walking
3. Vegetarians need to plan their meal in advance and mostly bring it along :-) :-)
4. Memorabilia is expensive and can be skipped"
,,Much More than Just a Boat Trip,5.0,,"The safari was much more than just a boat trip which was also fun for children and adults alike. You get to see a lot of different birds, animals, and fish (in an aquarium). I liked it much more than the Zoo which was nearby."
,,Enjoyed the different focus of this zoo - and loved seeing the Pandas.,4.0,,"This is really an aquatic zoo divided up by River systems and it is an interesting format. Some of the regions don't have much detail to them, but others have a lot of different displays. There are boards with interesting facts and there is a strong environmental protection focus. Highlights were the manatees and of course the pandas! We did the river ride, and my son was disappointed that he DIDN""T get wet in the front seat splash zone!"
,,Great afternoon out,5.0,,I'd read about the River Safari before leaving and put it on the 'must do' list. Be aware that there is an extra cost S$5 per person to do the boat cruise but it's worth it. We had ample time to have a look around and read all about the different 'river systems' they display. Panda's at the end are great! The Panda enclosure is state of the art.
,,Only just opened and already looking tired,1.0,,"My family and I have been to Singapore Zoo many, many times over the last few years as our children are young and love the place. We have always enjoyed it hugely and been members for a number of years. Unfortunately, the decision was made to expand the park with the River Safari - not a great decision! Although the attraction was only just recently opened fully, it's already looking a little tired and as for the pandas... well, suffices to say that I found them looking quite distressed with the huge number of LOUD people passing through the enclosure.

Today we had a particularly bad experience at the park: Bought tickets to go on the river ride and found that children have to be 1.06 metres tall to go on the ride. Our son was measured when we bought the tickets as he is exactly that height. No problem - or so we thought. As we turned up at the actual ride (with a long queue), we were stopped by the unbelievably incompetent robotic staff members and told that our son was too short and therefore couldn't go. At the same time, a family with a girl of exactly the same size turned up and were told the same. They had also bought tickets beforehand and had experienced no problems with this. Seems the measuring signs at the ticket counter and at the actual attraction differ in height...

We were offered a refund which was all well and good, except this could only be done at the ticket counter which is at the other end of the park and they did not offer any kind of assistance! What appalling customer service. Anyhow, we decided to leave (our one of our children had bawled his eyes out for long enough), but as we had turned our backs, and walked off... the other (local) family was miraculously let through. So either their dughter grew very quickly, or we were basically being discriminated against. When we went back and confronted them with this, we were let through too. Shameful behaviour.

The staff handling customers and queues at the boats are shockingly incompetent and were falling over each other trying to direct people and the ride itself is hugely disappointing (some enclosures were empty as well).

There is no decent food to be had in the park so bring your own or eat elsewhere.

Will certainly not go back and would not recommend to anyone."
,,Good and will get better,4.0,,"At the time of my trip this attraction was still having its finishing touches put on. But in essence it is quite lovely. Based on the idea of showcasing the ecosystems of rivers this is a fun idea and allows the place to show a range of animals not always found in standard zoos. The way it is laid out makes sure you see basically everything without doubling back and you can saunter along at your own pace reading all the information and there are easily enough amenities available. Food options are OK too and of course the gift shop will help you lighten your financial burdens.

Being Singapore it is all spotlessly clean and well organised and the staff were very friendly and chirpy. The walkway is suitable for less mobile people and the setting is nice as well.

Oh - and the Pandas are here. What more could you want?

Just have your transport options sorted before going as just like the Night Safari and Singapore Zoo proper it is not just around the corner from the CBD and hotel districts."
,,"Good collection ,,,...",5.0,,Well maintained. I specially liked the Polar bear put inside a very big Pool. And they have new attraction......Panda .
,,Whole family enjoyed,4.0,,Visited with 76yr old mother and her grandchildren 11 and 14. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed. Great setting and majority is in the shade so it is a comfortable experience. The river Safari part is more of an adventure Park type ride than a boat ride but fun nonetheless.
,,Great morning out,4.0,,"This was our first trip to the River Safari with 2 young children...and we loved it! Firstly, it is not as large as the regular zoo (which is good for the legs) but also it's nearly all undercover which means that you are mostly sheltered from the sun or rain making it an all-weather option. For a rainy day in Singapore, this would be my choice of destination.
The river boat wasn't too exciting for adults but my kids absolutely loved it...so I am giving it a big thumbs up.
The squirrel monkey enclosure is a must do stop as they come right up to people giving you the chance for great photos.
Food options were limited but fine enough considering you didn't need to be there for hours and hours."
,,Excellent,4.0,,"The presentation of the main rivers of the world with their associated species (not just fish but many mammals as well, and birds, reptiles etc) and info on the rivers is a much better (and more educational) way of presenting things than the usual haphazard scattering of enclosures in most zoos. We really enjoyed it and found it quite thought provoking.

We didn't do the boat trip so can't comment on that. The full walk round took about 2 hours.

We went to the zoo as well, this is more of an interesting/different experience, so if just choosing one I'd go for the River safari."
,,Squirrel Monkeys are the highlight,4.0,,"River Safari is a great aquarium - unique concept too with the set up of different river systems from around the world. It's a much better aquarium to visit than Underwater World, unless of course you desperately need to see dolphins.

We visited the River Safari after spending most of the day at the zoo. Visiting as a tail-end of an overall zoo experience is plenty - it only took about an hour and a half to get around the whole thing, including visiting the squirrel monkey exhibit twice.

The squirrel monkey aviary is by far the highlight of this attraction! The cute little guys follow you around and become particularly inquisitive if you have a bag - there might be food inside!"
,,Nice day out,4.0,,"I really enjoyed the Singapore River Safari. It's a different way of presenting and experiencing a zoo/ aquarium. The walk through the rivers of the world was good. Highlights including seeing manatees and pandas. I concur with other travellers that the river boat ride experience goes far too fast and it's difficult to spot and enjoy the animals along the way. I would recommend doing it as part of the experience.

Tips
- go early to avoid the major crowds
- I couldn't find any drink fountains so take bottled water"
,,Relaxing and educational attraction.,4.0,,"Unlike the hectic (although nice) zoo, the river safari is a bit slower in pace and educational as you go through exhibits of all the major rivers of the world. Don't worry if it is raining. Most areas are sheltered. Best exhibit is the Panda exhibit."
,,Very poor by Singapore standards,1.0,,"We had high expectations of the recently added Singapore attraction, the River Safari. On paper the concept sounded very interesting. However in reality it was very poorly executed. The only saving grace was the feeding of the Manatees and the Panda display. The information about environmental concerns was appreciated but the main attraction, the amazon river experience was terrible with little or nothing on display as you travelled in a conveyor-belt ""boat"" along a narrow con crete channel only to finish sitting in the sun as you were rammed by the boat behind!
The Pandas would have best been placed in the excellent Singapore Zoo together with the Manatees and the River Safari rip-off closed down. We have been to Singapore 7-8 times and this attraction is by far the worst we have experienced."
,,A good day out but misleading name,4.0,,"My family of 5 aged between 90 and 19 had a lovely morning at the river safari this week (mid April 2014). There is a lot of walking but they provided good wheel chairs to push the old folk around. It's really an aquarium divided into various rivers of the world. The exhibits are interesting and well laid out with informative signs. The boat ride is a mild type of theme park ride lasted about 10 minutes which goes through various enclosures (rather too fast to see things clearly) but we were lucky enough to see a jaguar swimming. The pandas were great and in a well laid out enclosure. The flooded forest was very impressive. There were no queues while we were there. My advice - go early. For those confused by the title of the park - it's a walk through aquarium, themed by rivers of the world with an optional (at small extra cost) short boat trip in a boat on a mechanically steered fake river. It's fun though."
,,Well laid out and great displays,5.0,,We took a tour bus and had just over 2 hours to look through the exhibits. The 7 longest rivers are represented with various fish and animals from the regions. The big draw cards are the Giant Panda who have an amazing life inside their climate controlled enclosures. Jia Jia and Kai Kai can been seen clearly. The boat ride wasn't operating on the day we went due to bad weather but the rest of the park is pretty much undercover and easily accessible for all.
,,Beautiful Zoo in lush tropical garden,5.0,,"Our first intention was to see the Giant Pandas and from the map given to us, we thought we would have covered this zoo in 2 hours and we ended up spending the entire afternoon here. The zoo is comprehensively laid out with different sections representing different regions such as the granges, the Amazon, the Mekong. The displays were beautiful done if not very impressive. The manatee display / sunken forest was a huge underwater gallery where you get to see not just these giant mammals but also assortment of giant amazon fishes. The jewel in the crown is definitely the panda enclosure done like a forest where you get to see the delightful pandas chewing bamboo. There are actually 2 enclosures for the male and female pandas. The female was not in the enclosure when we were there but the male panda was and he was certainly amusing to look at. The boat ride is also recommended. We did not buy a ticket at the main entrance but at the entrance to the boat ride itself. Its a lovely 10 mins ride along a 'river' where you get to see monkeys. flamingos and even the jaguar ! We really enjoyed this visit to the River safari. Its like a walk in a lush tropical forest . River safari maintains the same high standard and beauty like the main zoo. If you love zoos, a good recommendation to to spend the morning here at the River Safari and after lunch to go to the main zoo. Amazing zoo ! Highly recommended !"
,,Nice afternoon out for kids,3.0,,"My 5 year old nephew had fun but it really wasn't much for the money we spent. The boat ride was just 6 minutes, not the 10 advertised and the boat went too quickly for us to take decent pictures. Overall the concept is very good but still needs more work. Video screens were out of order, not enough information on the exhibits, the glass tanks were scratched badly in some area making picture taking that much more difficult. I loved the red pandas but am still wondering why the pandas were there in the first place."
,,nice place and close to the zoo and night safari,4.0,,Great for lovers of animals. Easy to walk around. Pandas and manatees r cool to c. Can't wait to visit
,,Nice place!,5.0,,"It's really nice to go there once a while to see our famous panda, kaikai and jiajia. And great place to explore other animals as well, must visit!"
,,River Quest at Singapore Zoo,5.0,,"We knew we had tours of Singapore later, so this day wanted to stroll and relax. The zoo is quite a way out, but taxis are not that expensive. The River Quest deals with all the rivers of the world, and we found it entertaining and interesting. Its a pity they don't give you a time-table when you go in of whats going on where because we missed the polar bear feeding time. The only slight disappointment was the boat ride at the end, which was a bit like a poor Disney ride, but it did not spoil the trip and I would recommend this part of the Zoo at least."
,,"Overpriced, too short trip",1.0,,"We spent 120 SGD for combo 4 ticket of river safari and 4 ticket of amazon river quest. After all, the trip is ridiculous, very few animals which can be seen, it is totally not worth at price 25SGD per pax."
,,"Nice to see the panda's, boat ride is totally useless",3.0,,"We heard and read a lot about this 'star attraction' and it was really nice to see the panda's. Earrly on a Friday morning, no queue at all, relaxed atmosphere. The river themes differ a lot in attractivity. Some are just dull and liveless, others are interesting (active crocs!).
The big disappointment however came with the boat ride. This is an absolute waste of time and money. It is a less than 10 min. ride and there is nothing to see. No jaguars,no capybara's, no howler monkey, nothing except for the signs that mention that the animals should be there. So, enjoy the panda's and forget the boat ride."
,,River safari is fun educational,4.0,,"Went there with my daughter march 27th, since it was our first experience. The entrance was next to the singapore zoo entrance. The down part was one of the panda was on medical assistant. The route was very clear and decor was thrilling. Totally different than the zoo and amazing new experience. Tried the boat ride, a must thing to do here. Total time spend for one route around one and half hour, so still enough time for lunch and visiting the zoo next door. And later for night safari. It is really on stop place for animal fun recreation and education."
,,overpriced,3.0,,I went there only to see the pandas. Most of the attractions there are just average and not in any ways fascinating enough to be worth the money I paid.
,,Good but a long way to walk and only a short ride,3.0,,"I noticed that the River Safari was extensively advertised in Singapore including on the MRT trains and stations. I had been looking forward to the boat trip part and I left the zoo early that day. When I entered there was a ridiculously long way to walk through the complex to the boat and the boat trip itself was enjoyable but rather short.

I never knew that Ibises could be a scarlet colour before. There were some other good parts of the safari such as the fish that produce caviar and the pandas. It would be good if the boat ride could include some of the other river displays (which I had expected) and/or if there was an alternative to walking all the way especially for older people.

The Zoo and the River Safari are a fair way out from the city by public transport so it may be difficult for those who are in Singapore for a short visit. It's a shame that the MRT doesn't go closer.

The River Safari is a good idea but needs some improvement and should perhaps be integrated into the adjacent zoo."
,,"Small, but novel",4.0,,"It gas well defined sections based on major rivers on earth and its fishes, reptiles and mammals. Can be done in 2.5 hours if you skip amazon boat ride. Good concept. The Pandas are out of place in river Safari, but a good attraction. There are little informative entertaining shows which was a little downer but then one can not make crocodiles jump through hoops. Still something could have been there to add a show flavour. Best to combine with night Safari."
,,"Overpriced, small, and disappointing",3.0,,"Singapore is expensive, I get that, but to spend nearly $100 SD for a family of 4 to go here is rediculous! We went through the entire thing in an hour, and that was with going SLOWLY as we were trying to make our visit last until our scheduled river ride. We couldn't drag our feet any longer and finished up the entire park, went out into the common area for lunch (which is a whole other disappointing story), then returned 45 minutes later for our boat ride. The boat ride was sad. It was over in 5-10 minutes and the only animals we saw were a few birds, and a sleeping leopard in the distance. My 6 and 8 year old asked ""it's over?!"" when we got done. We all felt ripped off. The panda section - loved the red panda- is nice and I liked that there were so many different languages on the exhibits. Save yourself some money and just enjoy the zoo next door. It's amazing and much more worth the dollars spent. The safari seems like a side attraction of a zoo rather than an entire different park. You can tell they are squeezing every dollar out of tourists by having them separated."
,,not completely ready .........,3.0,,"not completely ready .........
since we have been at the zoo many times we went to the river safari also we were told that the boat-ride was not available. it was rather disappointing .....

wait until ready and then combine with a visit to the zoo."
,,Not really worth the effort,3.0,,"Average at best. Lots of fish tanks. Nice setting but not worth getting all the way there and too expensive for what it is. The place is organized along 5 rivers. Most of the exhibits are not too interesting and the odd ones have too few animals. Apart from a lot of fish you get to see sea lions, a few crocodiles, one sleeping panda, two cute red pandas and a large polar bear. Buy your tickets online to skip the very long queues in the weekend or better, go during a weekday, don't waste your money on the river thing, it's too short and you see pretty much anything. Overall if you go to the zoo you can dispense with this."
,,Singapore River Safari,3.0,,"I found that the river safari was not that what I expected. Only the Amazon boat ride was nice. For that we had to buy tickets paying another S$5.00. But we could not see most of the animals at the time we had the ride. S$ 25.00 is too high for this river safari. Not worth for it.

There we went on our own using public transport which is cheap in Singapore. So I would like to advise all visitors to these attractions using public transport and travel there on your own is very much cheaper than using tour agents because if we go on our own we can go there early and also save our hard earned money."
,,Loved the Pandas...they should be part of the Zoo not the River Safari!,3.0,,"We only went to see the Pandas and they didn't disappoint and having them in a large air conditioned setting was a bonus. I'd give them 5 out of 5! The 2 pandas are in separate enclosures and were sooo cute, we found the one as u enter more entertaining. We were lucky he/she not sure, was so close to us and wide awake, either lazing back eating bamboo or moving around a lot. The river boat wasnt very good, luckily there was no line at all and we got on imediately b4 time. If i had to wait a long time I would have been let down, so if it's busy...don't bother. The large tank near the end was interesting. Wish there were other ways to get back to the Pandas, but it was just not worth the long walk to get there n back. We finished in probably 2 hours and continued on to the zoo. Shame these 2 are not combined, or would have been better for the Pandas to be part of the zoo not the River Safari."
,,"Been there, done that and bought the T-shirt",3.0,,"Have to hand it to Wildlife Reserves of Singapore (WRS) for another amazing attraction. Getting up close and personal with the animals was a great experience. Only disappointment was the river adventure..was hoping something a lot more ""natural"" but felt more like an amusement park ride instead."
,,Great marketing!,2.0,,This is just an add on of the zoo. Not really worth to pay a TEN minutes boat ride if you been to the zoo or the night safari.
,,Interesting,3.0,,"This was a very interesting place, combining a very diverse range of freshwater fish from different parts of the world.

Unfortunately when I was there, not the entire park was open, they were still finishing up some parts. Therefore I could only imagine that more fish was added later. Overall has lots of potential and I would still recommend the visit."
,,awesome reptiles n fishes,4.0,,"My whole family visited river safari just few days ago.We joined river safari membership in order to make uteem trips and cut off the Q...awesome trip...
my kids just love mantees and otters..very interesting...
plus some marine n reptiles from amazon river, mekong river and other rivers..
The boat ride was v good ..slow and can take lots of pictures. .."
,,Awesome day,4.0,,"Great day at river safari. The theming is great, the exhibits are plenty, and best of all it's mostly sheltered. We recommend starting the tour from the left side once you pass the turnstiles. This will bring you to the smaller aquariums first, then the pandas which are one of the highlights (strangely), followed by the ten minutes boat ride then finally to the BIG aquarium. This way you get to do the real highlight of the river safari (big aquarium) last, which gives a very good conclusion and climatic ending to the trip. To get the boat ride, you have to be at the purchase counter real early, something like 830am should be a good gauge. The ride is disappointing as it shows you land animals and is really short ride. Lunch is expensive at the restaurant near the boat ride, which is at the far end of the water safari."
,,Not as great as the Singapore Zoo.,3.0,,"We are great fans of the Singapore zoo and take our 4yr old boys to the zoo at least once a month. So this year, when we were renewing our zoo pass, we also decided to take the River Safari Pass for a year even though we had never been to it.

Which was a big mistake as our first experience was pretty disappointing. It is probably okay for a one time visit but it is definitely not a place you will come back to again and again, unlike the Singapore zoo.

The queue for the boat ride is just too long. We stood in the queue at 11 and were told our turn would come only around 2.30. So unless you intend to spend the whole day at the zoo, it is best to avoid the boat ride. We decided to not take the boat ride and just walked around.

We went on Friday morning to avoid the weekend crowds and it was still really crowded. One of the reasons for this is the initial part of the route is designed such that it becomes very congested with small aquariums around. But as you go inside it opens up into larger spaces and is no longer congested or crowded.

Also it is mainly an aquarium - there are very few animals around - a few beavers, otters, the pandas and monkeys. The River Safari mainly exhibits fresh water fish and even though some of the fish are really interesting, if you have small children and have taken them to Sea Life Aquarium, then they don't find this as exciting when compared to the sharks, dolphins etc..

Having said that, the panda exhibits are quite nice and so is the walk through the squirrel monkey area. My kids really loved that and also the giant tank with the manatees. I wish some of this came first instead of being at the very end of the route.

On the whole, I'd say do not expect this to be like the zoo where you can take your kids every month and not be bored as there is so much to do - from water play area to shows to different animals to see. This in my opinion is good for a one time visit; and even with the yearly pass, I don't think we will be going back to this any time soon."
,,Never never go again,1.0,,"The queue to buy boat ride is long and absolutely not worth it. The boat ride is nothing more than a 10 min resting time. Just a few animal and birds along the way and does not live up to the hype and time spent to get the ticket. Food quality is bad and expensive. The route design is one way and that added more frustration to visitor who need to go back to the boat ride after completing the park tour. See more concrete and glass than ""feel the wild"" as overwhelmingly claimed in poster and web. River Safari is overselling what it is delivering."
,,Love the pandas! Good exhibits,5.0,,Had a great morning at River Safari. Unfortunately I was there on the one day where the boat was closed due to maintenance but you can still see 85% of the displays. I had a great morning. The displays are great and very informative. And of course the Pandas are just beautiful.
,,It can be Great,4.0,,"Curious about Amazon River Quest boat ride, I decided to took my mom to visit River Safari. I thought it will be more relax coz of the boat ride. Well, my thought was wrong.

River Safari is next to Singapore Zoo & Night Safari. Its not to difficult to reach. You can used MRT to Ang Mo Kio and continued with bus 138. Or choose direct bus which is SAEx Bus. Luckily, I stay at Beach Road so I can wait the bus at Shaw Tower at 9.08. Only cost SGD5, the bus directly took us to River Safari.

Booked the ticket from Anaya Tour (4 dolar cheaper then the counter/ticket), we have to walk to the front gate. Again, the ticket include a boat ride so I don't need to buy boat tickets.

Unfortunately, we have to walk through the complex before entering the Amazon River boat ride. My mom aint complain about it, cause all the different freshwater fish. The good things are the complex are also and clean, though in some area we can smell bad urine.

The boat ride at Amazing River only took 10 minutes. My schedule are 11.30, but until 12.00 we are still cant get into the boat. They said they have a technical issue and the women in the ticket line gave us a voucher worth SGD5 as compliment. Luckily I makesure again to the front gate, which they told to customer to comeback at 13.00.

The man help us out to check either we can comeback to queue the boat ride and returned the compliment voucher. Another lucky was, instantly the techical problem was solved and they ask us to come into the boat. How lucky we are, even it only 10 minutes ride.

Overall, River Safari is worthed to visit especially if you love freshwater fish from around the world. There are also two big panda, who fell asleep when we visit and cute red panda with big and long tail. If you are hungry after touring, no worry there are food corner outside near Singapore Zoo Gate, but its quite crowded by lunch time. In fact I finished River Safari Journey less than 3 hours.

Personally, I definitely comeback to enjoy more time at Amazon Flooded Forest, which it claim as a world largest freshwater aquarium."
,,Avoid the boat trip,3.0,,"The zoo is quite interesting as it has an aquatic theme which complements the neighboring zoo. Don't bother with the amazon boat ride. The queue is long despite bookings, hot and crowded, it took us over an hour past our booking time to get on a boat, terrible if you are with children. The actual ride lasts about 15 minutes and is underwhelming with regard to the wildlife you can see. The rest of the zoo is quite interesting and could be done as an add-on to the neighboring Singapore zoo."
,,Small and underwhelming,3.0,,"Yeah yeah there are Panda but that's about it. Singapore zoo is full of activities and have a large variety of animals. Over at river safari, it's just a mere few animals that belong to the other side of the world. It's small and I went at 0930 and finished at 1230 after going for all the feeding sessions. The extra boat ride is boring as it's too quick to look and most of the time I don't even see anything. Ultimately I would say the Singapore zoo is still the best while the safari is small, boring and if it wasn't for the pandas, the entire idea would be non necessary."
,,The Panda was Reason Enough,4.0,,"I visited the park while killing time before leaving Singapore. The attraction is next to the Singapore Zoo. There's an SAEX shuttle that stops by Bus Stop B05 at Hong Lim Park in Chinatown. You might want to check their website for their timetable. The shuttle charges 5 SGD for a one-way trip. Another option is to take Bus 138 from Ang Mo Kio station, which is about a couple of dollars cheaper, depending on where you're coming from. The entrance ticket is 25 SGD, but you might want to check your hotel if they can find you tickets at a discount. It will allow you to go through the park and visit several attractions and even interact with animals. The park exhibits animals in varying regions, mostly those living close to famous rivers. There were several parts of the park that I thought was great. The Giant Panda forest where you get to observe Kai Kai, a giant panda, is one. He is so adorable and is probably worth the entire ticket. If you could only go over the fence and give him a hug. Another part of the park that I found interesting was the Squirrel Monkey forest. The monkeys are so close you can practically tell them bedtime stories. I also found the Amazon Flooded Forest interesting. It was an education in rivers and the lives of animals whose habitat depends on it. The Amazon River Quest Boat Ride is charged separately at 5 SGD, so don't be surprised if it's not included. I think that it's worth getting the boat ride to experience the rest of the park. I visited the park midweek and there wasn't any queue. I highly enjoyed the experience considering I visited just to kill time."
,,A very enjoyable ride,4.0,,I would not mind waiting for 40 minutes again in queue for the river safari ride. There were a wide variety of animals to be seen and the ride was very informative as well.
,,"Long Queues, Boat Ride not Worth the Wait",2.0,,"The river zoo itself is quite good but our experience was marred by the ridiculous wait to go on the boat ride. When you buy tickets at the park, you can buy an additional $5 ticket for the ten minute river ride. They even purport to give you a reserved time. It is a big lie. We showed up for our 1230 boat ride at 1215 and there was a long pre queue. When we were admitted at about 1230 we were shuttled to a second queue. At 1245, we entered a third queue with over two hundred others people. Most of these people were leftovers from the 1200 reservation. We finally got our boat ride at 1320, one hour and five minutes after we started waiting. They are poorly organized and over promise and under deliver."
,,Long queues,2.0,,"Having pre-bought tickets we were not expecting to wait hours more to book the actual river safari before we entered the park. We then queued another 1.5 hours inside the park to get on the ride. It totally spoilt the day. If you want to ride the main attraction, avoid the weekends!! We won't be doing it again..."
,,Badly organized,1.0,,"I have been in two hours of queues so far and have just been told it is another 30-45 minutes wait for the boat ride, which appears to be the only way to see quite a lot of the animals. Also, food and beverage is very crowded and poor quality. Won't be coming back here. In fact, just considering blowing off the rest of the visit and going home even though I have hardly seen anything. Stick with Night Safari, it is really good."
,,"Good, but could be great.",3.0,,"I liked the RIver Safari, but I can't help thinking how much better it can be. We went here in the morning, the first stop of a zoo marathon (Singapore Zoo & Night Safari as well). This is the newest park in Singapore and it is designed as a one-way tour. Meaning there's basically only one way to walk, from A to B with the various animals (manatees, otters, freshwater fish, crocodiles, birds, turtles, reptiles, snakes, and pandas) along the way. The place is well designed, but it feels as if the only reason people come here is for the pandas. This is noticable in the way the area is designed. Don't get me wrong, the red pandas and black & white pandas are extremely cute, but I feel the other animals should get the same treatment. It's not a bad place, and it can be a great park with some more improvements. BTW, when I visited this place the boatride attraction wasn't completed yet. Maybe this thing is awesome and worth the visit alone."
,,Fantastic new addition to Singapore,5.0,,"We've seen all the others, Jurong bird park the Zoo and this was just as great . Where else can you see Giant Pandas and Manatees . The river ride was good too . Take the kids they will love it ."
,,"Latest Addition to Singapore animal attractions - like others, first class",4.0,,"In any other country, River Safari would be five-star - but among the ranks of the world-famous Singapore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park, it ranks third. But as a bronze medal winner, my, it's very much still first class. In short - if you can do all three of Singapore's attractions - do them, and enjoy. If you can only select one or two, don't do River Safari. Ok, enough negative. River Safari is located to the right of the Sing Zoo entrance. It's a very well designed ""path"" in which you discover fishes, pandas, birds, monkeys - what more could you want. I didn't realize it was almost entirely covered, and thank goodness - otherwise, you'd fry in the sun. The crowds are heavy, as you expect, but today wasn't terribly bad - we got to see everything we wanted. My four-year-old daughter and I also loved some of the up-close encounters - like the little monkeys and even this huge stork. This is a great, leisurely two-hour or so stroll which is logically structured - so a nice bolt on trip to the Zoo. In fairness, we did not do the River tour because my daughter was just a couple inches too small, so I can't report back on that. I'd highly recommend it, but again, remember the rankings in case you need to make choices."
,,"Small, doesn't compare to its zoo and night safari counterparts",3.0,,"Located next to the Zoo and the Night Safari, the River Safari is the smallest of the three, and probably the least exciting.

The focus of the park is on the great rivers of the world, and the flora and fauna around the rivers. Unfortunately, you can't really interact with fish.

There are a few exciting exhibits - the giant river stingray and eight manatees in two (separate) giant tanks are great. There is also a Panda exhibit which is the largest draw card. Our favourite was the squirrel monkey house where you walk on a path and the monkeys play around you rather than in cages.

We went on a weekday so there was no line and we got in very easily. The boat cruise is a little disappointing - you have to get there very early to secure a seat but I wouldn't cry if I missed it.

Food wise - we ate the the Panda themed restaurant. I'd avoid that - it was pretty crap. The panda pau is probably the only thing worth eating!

On the whole a three, the zoo and night safari and even the Jurong Bird Park are more exciting."
,,River Safari - Small Attraction that is worth going once...,3.0,,"My wife and I went to the River Safari on 27 Feb 2014 which was a Thursday. When we arrived at 9.40am, we went to the ticketing counter to get our Boat Ride timing and we got a 10.30am timing.

We took a walk around the first attraction, The Amazon Flooded Forest where we saw Huge Manatees, Arapaima, Pacu, Electric Eel, Sea Otters and of course the piranhas. The best attraction here was obviously the manatees and the sea otters.

After this, we went to queue for our boat ride at 10am. We heard from a couple in front of us that you can actually queue for your boat ride ahead of schedule and they will probably let you take the earlier ride. The Boat Ride as people have mentioned is pretty average. There are many animal enclosures along the boat ride but it really depends on your luck whether you can see the animals.

After that we went for our lunch at the Mama Panda Kitchen. Food there was surprisingly not bad but pretty expensive.We then went to the main attraction, the Pandas. In the Panda Exhibit, you will see the pheasant, red pandas and giant pandas Jia Jia & Kai Kai. For the Giant Pandas, it is advisable to view them at around 2pm. When we were there, we saw the zoo keeper placing fruits and bamboo shoots at various locations in Kai Kai's enclosure and when they let him out, he basically went around eating the food that they had placed for him. There are many photo and video opportunities at this time.

For the rest of the attractions, it is basically a collection of fishes and reptiles that you will seldom if ever see outside their native habitats.

So is the River Safari a MUST Visit attraction in Singapore? I'm leaning towards YES due to the fact that there are not many places in the world where you can see Giant Pandas.

Anyway, the River Safari isn't that big. You can probably complete the attraction in about 3 hours or so. So my advice is that if you are going there, bundle the trip together with the Zoo and if you get a late afternoon timing for the boat ride, go to the zoo first and then to the River Safari nearer the time of your boat ride. Do take note that it takes about 10-15 mins to walk to the boat ride from the entrance of the River Safari."
,,"OK, but a bit disappointing",2.0,,"We thought we would try the River Safari as we have always enjoyed the close by Night Safari, but were a little disappointed with this one.
The boat rides were virtually full when we arrived (at 10am, we were just able to get tickets (currently free) on the last of the timed rides between 16:00 to 16:30, which was quite a long time to wait (we didn’t in the end). You can still see around 85% of the animals, though, without going on the boat ride, but in this case I think visiting the Zoo instead would have been a better option.
The star attraction was the Giant Pandas though, and I guess predictably, there was a very long queue to see them (again we didn’t bother in the end), which again shows how much interest there was in seeing them but devalued the experience especially for hot, bored young children and their long suffering parents.
If you go to see it, I would suggest getting there VERY EARLY, a soon as the park opens, otherwise I suggest seriously considering visiting the Singapore Zoo instead."
,,Fun for a few hours,4.0,,"We visited on a quiet Monday morning, ideal as we missed the queues mentioned in other reviews. When it's not busy, you only need about 3 hours to see the whole place. If you're looking for a full day out, the Singapore Zoo would be a better option but for a half-day this is good fun. We particularly enjoyed the pandas and red pandas, where the staff gave us lots of information about the animals."
,,not worth the time / cost,1.0,,"To go to singapore and expect to see anything extrodinary when it involves more than a shopping mall is expecting a lot. I knew that going in, but frankly, the whole thing is just to small and uninspired. Give it a pass."
,,Trip to River Safari with my son,4.0,,"The main attraction of the park to us is the pair of pandas and tree pandas. The ride on the river turn out to be so so only. The waiting time is far longer than the actual ride. For those in a hurry, you can miss the boat ride without missing much. If the food outlets inside the park is not to your likings, there is a KFC outside the River Safari and you can get permission from the staff to go out of the park and re-enter again later. There are public buses going to the park from MRT stations."
,,Short and enjoyable,4.0,,"This is a lovely and relatively short day out in Singapore meaning it's great for putting in a few hours but doesn't leave you absolutely wrecked at the end of it! We arrived at 12 and were done by 3, waited around for our reserved boat trip at 4. The ticket price is good and includes the pandas and the boat trip. We liked that the majority of the park is under shade so it's a relief from the sun.

There are plenty of interesting fish & mammals to see and information dotted all around on how each one helps the environment and hence should be protected.

Some tips:
If the queue for the boat trip is massive just skip it. It's actually quite lame, much shorter than we expected and we saw very few animals. it's the only feature that lets the park down and it's really not worth the queue. If there's no queue then it's ok if you have kids as they might enjoy it, it's not in any way as exciting or dangerous as is implied in the park and you won't get anywhere near soaked either!

We got a taxi to the park, $21 from Raffles Place which was well worth it. The queue for taxis back was insane. Round the corner from the bus stop there is a 'deluxe' coach service which will take you back into town for $5, much handier than waiting for a taxi and we were back in around 30 minutes.

Although your ticket says you can't, you can indeed leave the River Safai part of the complex by getting your hand stamped which allows you to re-enter. This gives you more options in terms of places to eat as there's only one food place in the park serving only Asian food (so not great for vegetarians like me).

You could combine this with the Night Safari for a longer day out. The Night Safari is also very leisurely and not overwhelming in terms of size (plus a good part of it can be seen from the little train available) and very enjoyable. The Night Safari also has more options in terms of places to eat."
,,Enjoyed the Pandas most,3.0,,"This is a separate attraction (with a separate price), its next to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. What can I say, it was okay but the best part was actually the Pandas and the Red Pandas part of the walk through."
,,The Weakest Link...,3.0,,"That is not to say the River Safari is bad, it is not, I am glad I went but I would not go again. All in all the park took us about two hours, we then had to kill more time waiting for the River Quest boat ride.

In some way I feel this park was built to get an additional fee to see the pandas and everything else was a bit of an afterthought. I'm sure that is not the case but overall I feel this park has some evolving to do.

The boat ride was an anti climax. I'm really not sure how necessary it was and whether the same trail could have been constructed for people to observe the animals on foot. The Night Safari tram is in my opinion a better example of this sort of attraction.

That said the flooded forest was wonderful and the Eco messages throughout are necessary. I enjoyed it but the zoo and night Safari are better overall in my opinion. Still worth a visit to make up your own mind!"
,,Excellent New Addition,5.0,,"The last time we were in Singapore in 2012 this was under construction. It is now finished and well worth a visit. The River Safari is a separate area of the Zoo and you can buy a ticket just for it or, a multiple pass that will get you into the Zoo, the Safari and the Night Safari, for example. The Amazon Experience is a free boat ride included with the River Safari. It is basically a boat ride down a winding channel with three sets of rapid-like waters. These are gentle slopes that the boat slides down. Despite the various warning signs, there is no real risk to anyone's health by going on this ride. It is intended to duplicate to some extent the upper regions of the Amazon with the appropriate plants and wildlife. The River Safari is a pathway that you walk along and as you go, you will see depictions of 8 great rivers of the world. Both of these new exhibits are well worth a visit, even if you don't like Zoos. Great for families or just a couple. We highly recommend it."
,,Long waiting time for the boat ride,2.0,,"Went on Sunday morning, reach the ticket counter 10am (it opens at 9am), and was allocated a boat ride earliest at 4pm! I asked the reception what could I do while waiting for the boat ride, and was proposed to tour the park for about 2 hours, had lunch, then come back for the boat ride. And wait for another 3 hours?? =.=""

My advice is, avoid the weekend if possible, I was told normal weekday the usual wait for the boat is immediate or within 2 hours.
Otherwise, bundle your visit with the zoo next door while waiting for the boat ride. Or, you gotta come very early to redeem a decent timing."
,,Refreshing experience,4.0,,"We visited the River Safari along with another family in Dec 2013. Had been contemplating to visit as soon as it has been open for the past few months, however could only make it when kids were relatively free during the Christmas break. Its a very well designed park with themes built on the basis of major rivers of the world (depicting key flora and fauna). It's a small place compared to Zoo or Bird Park or the Night Safari. However, we could see some rare species of wildlife belonging to these river basins. The Amazon River Quest (boat safari - which was then free on promotion, not sure if its still free now!!), was short but quite impressive. Its a must see at least once to have a good grasp of civilizations that dwell along these rivers, the human and animal activity, etc. Especially interesting are the two new Pandas added to the River Safari, don't miss this. However I wish there were more shows added, in addition to the live exhibits of few animals brought out to the visitors.
In case you wish to visit over the weekend or during school holidays, make sure you arrive early or be prepared for the long queue. I strongly suggest purchasing the tickets online and taking the print outs."
,,Stick with the Zoo and its feeding trail,2.0,,The boat ride lasted 7 minutes and was nothing like the numerous advertisements plastered throughout Singapore. We went through the park in about 2 hours. The highlights were the manatee and otters. The pandas were underwhelming. Simply not worth the money.
,,Small but enjoyable,4.0,,"It is a much smaller attraction compared to the Singapore Zoo but with a different theme to present from the Singapore Zoo. It features on exotic and rarer seen animals in tropical Asian countries like animals from Amazon, Egypt, India etc.. My favourite would be the pandas and manatees of course.

About 4 hours should be sufficient to cover the attractive, provided that there is no long queue at the free boat ride. Go early at 9am when the crowd is smaller, the later you go, the bigger the crowd. The boat ride is complimentary for the time being, not sure when they will start charging, so go visit when you can now. The boat ride also has limited quota, so if you go later in the day, they may just not be available anymore.

The Amazon exhibit is great and has good variety of animals on exhibit. It is also very informative, so we hardly have any chance to get up close with animals from that region. Overall, it's a great place to visit with friends and family, especially those with young children."
,,ticket in the internet is cheaper than at the door,4.0,,"buy online its around 8usd cheaper

idk why there are so many bad reviews here.....

I ve been to many aquariums in japan and usa... and I guarantee this one is really good

and UNIQUE - only fresh water ... there are not many places to see a massive exclusive fresh water aquarium in the world.... amazon and mekong tanks are amazing ! also the indians crocodiles

howerver ... the boat ride depends on ur luck,,,,, i did not see many animals...."
,,River boat ride is amazing,4.0,,"The boat ride was outstanding. It is out of the ordinary. Food was ok, but expensive. The design and concepts was interesting. The panda enclosure was the best i've ever seen but it is too big for just 2 giant panda, 2 red panda and pheasants. All the enclosure was amazing but too boring as there is mostly only fish. I would recommend the zoo or night safari more."
,,WOW what a great extra Giant Pandas and Manetees,4.0,,"Wandering through the river areas of the world, we saw some great exhibitions. The layout was good and the way the whole are was landscaped and fashioned on the particular part of the world was great. We really loved seeing the panda's. They were out and eating and playing. A special moment. Another equally fantastic part was the manatee tanks. So many.
Could have done without the boat ride. I like to watch the animals not have a spotting competition as you flash past.
Worth the visit. Better than the night zoo. We did not bother going this time."
,,Not so interesting,2.0,,"the Amazon river ride is nothing more than a boat ride, didn't sight much animals during the 10 mins ride. Suggests to take the afternoon ride rather than morning ride as most animals still falling asleep."
,,Decent if you beat the crowd... but very small park & short boat ride,3.0,,"Most of the animals & fishes in the exhibits were a great view. The Pandas were especially nice.
However the park is TOO small. ""IF"" there is no crowd, could easily have finished the park in 1 to 1.5 hours. The ""boat"" ride was decent, but some animals were ""lost"" or probably somewhere zzzz as the boat went past them. It's also too short a ride if taken into account the queue for ride tickets.The staff were good,mainly saw youngsters at the service side, patient and courteous. Tip is to go early 8.30am and get the boat tickets and then proceed visit Pandas once you enter park (no panda queue when we did), because there will a large crowd and queues soon. Ticket price not exactly tasty..Value for money? hmmmm"
,,Get there early,4.0,,"We arrived before the gates opened as we had been warned about long queues to get the boat ride ticket and again at the boat ride itself. Arriving at about 8:45, there was absolutely no queue at the ticket counter...bonus! We decided to wander the 'wrong way' through as that looked to be the shorter way to the boat. Good decision as got to see the flooded amazon exhibit with no one else around as well as the squirrel monkey forest. Then not much of a queue at the boats. Yes the ride is only about 15 minutes, but worth it. Getting in early also meant no waiting and few people in the panda enclosure. I would recommend making a day of it and head into the zoo afterwards to make the trip out to Mandai worthwhile."
,,"Nice place to visit, relax and enjoy the walk and boat ride",4.0,,"The first time we went to the River safari, as we planned to visit the night safari, just think maybe we just go earlier and take a look of the River safari. We spend about 3 hours there, enough time to take the boat ride and have a leisure walk going through all the Rivers around the world, meet with the giant panda. Very relaxing, nice view, as the time is approaching closure of the park, no need to queue up for long time, not so hot either! We enjoy the park very much."
,,"Lovely outing, panda show the best!",5.0,,"We were lucky to see both pandas out in action - walking, eating, climbing trees....

The place is well constructed with shades all along the way. The free river cruise (limited time only) is also quite enjoyable. We didn't expect to see real animals along the cruise so it was a nice surprise.

I suggest to visit in the mornings to see the pandas in action. Many of my friends visited in the afternoon and said the pandas were hiding!

Anyway the pandas' home is air conditioned and thus the nicest part of the park!"
,,Great trip!,4.0,,"Went to the River Safari with family (4 adults and two young children) and reached there around 9.45am. Was in time to book seats for the boat ride at 10.30am, would advise to reach there earlier in order to book the boat ride andthe signage to signify that the ride for the day is full was out by 12pm. From the entrance of river safari, you will need to turn right and walk all the way to the end of the park in order to take the ride. If you turn left, you will be walking towards the panda enclosures and you will need to cross a long bridge before you can take the ride. Was a pretty long walk but the very good thing is that the park is 90% sheltered which allows me to enjoy the trip more rather than melting in the sweltering heat and humid. Along the way, you will see sea cows, aquatic animals, stingrays, toucans, and many other amazonia animals.

The boat ride was fun and we were able to see the colourful ibis birds, iguana, flamingoes etc. However, it would add to the comfort level if the boat is sheltered. Nevertheless, as it took less than 10 mins (8 mins to be exact, as counted by my son), you will not be exposed to the sun for too long. Managed to take a pic with the panda mascot at around 12.15pm

The main highlight was the two giant pandas housed in airconditioned comfort, which further enhances my visit. Kai Kai went into the den and didn't come out, the good thing is Jia Jia was very active, eating bamboos, walking around and you will see throes of people fighting to take her pics. The red panda was very adorable too, sociable and strolling from branch to branch.

We bought a panda lookalike red bean bun ($2.90 for one) at the mama panda eating house along with two plastic souvenir cups of soft drinks (each at $3.90) , which to me is a good buy especially as memento. The prices of the food are not cheap and neither are the merchandise. But this is to be expected as it is a tourist attraction. We had our lunch outside the area, (do get a stamp on your hand for re-entry) at the Tea house restaurant. The trio combination (roast duck, char siew and chicken) was excellent as well as the tofu hotplate. Curry chicken was too mushy and nothing spectacular about the fried prawn noodles. Set me back at $85. Take note that a bowl of plain white rice is sold at $2.00.

As compared to the zoo trip last month, I will say that my family and myself enjoyed this trip a lot lot more primarily because the area is sheltered and therefore a lot more comfortable. So yes, I will say it is worthwhile to go again :)"
,,Disappointing in comparison to Night Safari and Singapore Zoo,3.0,,"The River Safari did not meet my expectations. It has interresting and nice-looking animals to see such as the giant pandas, red panda, capibaras, tapirs and fish from many different ecosystems around the world. However, it is smaller in comparison to the Night Safari and Singapore Zoo. It's fares are also not value for money.

The rides in the boat to do the safari are too short, less than 10 minutes after nearly two hours waiting in line. It took a while to get the ride, because the boats security system were constantly displaying alert messages that had to be checked by safety experts. It's good that the River Safari wants to make sure everyone is safe, but they should have informed better the costumers about the problems, so people wouldn't have stayed in line for too long.

The best was probably the Giant Pandas. If it wasn't for the existing animals under display, I would give this attraction a lower score than the one I am actually giving."
,,"Singapore, you have done and could do better!",2.0,,"As a several times visitor to the zoo perhaps our expectations were too high.

The River Safari the animals that could be seen were great and the fish and other creatures were well displayed in the the other extensive display areas however, the poor signage and long wait did nothing to overcome our dissapointment with the 10 minute boat ride!"
,,Very good wildlife park,4.0,,"This park has a lot of beautiful aquatic animals. Many of them are endangered. I went to River Safari when the boat ride hasn't opened but I had a nice day. the queue are just 15 minutes, not one or two hours as they said. Nice park."
,,Thank goodness for the pandas,3.0,,"Must say that the river safari ride itself is over hyped - more 'small world' than safari! Lots of walking and not the ambiance of the zoo or night safari. That said the aquariums are pretty special and the pandas go a long way towards making up for other shortcomings.

I'd suggest combining the river safari with either the zoo or night safari for best experience."
,,Overated,2.0,,"The highlight of the River Safari are the pandas, Jia Jia and Kai Kai. We waited abt 1hr in the queue for less than 10min boat ride, definitely is a waste of time. Animals here are 10% found in the big rivers like the Amazon, Ganges, Yantze River etc, so they said. Overall ticket is overpriced for the unimpressive experience. The staff were nice and friendly though.

If given a choice to go to the Zoo, Night Safari or River Safari, I would rather choose the Zoo then Night Safari."
,,"Panda, manatees & river ride",5.0,,"Adorable red panda, amusing panda, awesome manatee and cool river ride pretty much sum up the experience for me. Plenty of shades and air conditioned environment helps in the hot humid climate."
,,Not worth your money or time,2.0,,"It was disappointing especially being one of the Singapore wildlife reserves Park and after the very successful zoo and night safari. The full prices of about S$25 and S $18 for children are certainly overpriced especially when compared to these other parks. Although you book a seat in advance for the boat ride, you end up waiting about one hour as there is only one boat loaded at a time, so be prepared to be in the que when you turn up at your alloted time. The boat ride lasts for only 7 minutes and we saw less than half of the animals as the boats do not stop and animals are not always visible. It's a joke. They should have left theme park rides to people who do theme parks and should have stuck to what Singapore wildlife reserves parks do best-that is animal exhibits, conservation and animal breeding. Management should fix the issues quickly as we overheard many saying they would not come back. Unfortunately the negatives overshadow the large aquariums that seem to be lame replicas of the aquarium in sentosa. Bring the manatees back to the main zoo. Make that the best zoo in the world. No, there is no need to give River safari a try. Spend your time next door at the zoo or night safari instead."
,,The new Panda enclosure is brilliant,5.0,,"Singapore zoo really is the best In the world in my opinion. The new river safari park is brilliant. (Although the river boat ride is terribly naff, so don't be too upset if you miss out, because you need a ticket when you enter! It is just a boat ride through a few enclosures and you can see them all without the boat!)
The panda exhibit is brilliant and huge. Jia Jia and Kai Kai are adorable. Jia Jia is shy and might be in her cave, but she did come out. It is so fabulous seeing them so well cared for. Great merchandise too.
The squirrel monkey exhibit lets you wander around a large enclosure and get very close indeed. It tells you not to approach them, but the monkeys loved my shoes and kept coming over to investigate. Brilliant. They are very very cute. Also, don't miss the feeding of the manatees or the polar bear (the polar bear enclosure is actually visible from both parks as it links both)"
,,Rip off place; overrated,2.0,,"Trust me, if you're not in line by 8:30 am, you're not getting on the boat ride, which is the ONLY reason to go on a ""river safari"". we decided to try to get on, and they said there is no way to get on without a ticket reservation. We had been given some false information, so they agreed to let us go sort of standby. They said it would be another 15 minutes. After waiting 90 minutes, we gave up. The line didn't move a single inch in 90 minutes.

The rest of the place wasn't that great, other than the tank with the manatees in it, which was quite spectacular. Only one panda was available to see, but it was a nice setup, and they don't allow too many people in at once, so it makes it a bit better.

Gift shop was typical Singapore zoo rip off: $33 to $36 for a simple t shirt. do the math. Total rip off. The river exhibits weren't that interested, and way too crowded to see much up close or comfortably. Admission price is not worth it, and the only real attraction is to see a live panda. Nice, but not worth the effort, heat, costs, crowds, rude pushy people, etc."
,,An interesting day,4.0,,"We spent half a day at the river safari, that is plenty of time to see everything there. They have a huge array of fish from all over the world as well as other animals. My favourite enclosure was the squirrel monkeys where you walked through their cage and they came right past you and crossed your path. The boat ride was good but was much shorter than we expected. There are some good animals to see on your ride though. The Giant Pandas were lovely to see. There are very few places to eat in the park and we didn't see anywhere to buy water etc. except at the eating places so make sure you have plenty with you."
,,Go for Panda and not the boat ride,3.0,,"Boat ride is really boring and doesn't live up to its hype. The ride is very simple and does have a minor 3 bumps and thats it!!

The best part and value for the money spent is to meet the Panda and that's obviously a great experience and the only experience."
,,DON'T BUY THE TICKET IF NO BOAT,2.0,,"When i get there, the staff inform me that the boat are totally full, but when i go to the pier (around 4:30 PM), i see no one in the queue and no boat at all. :(

DON'T BUY THE TICKET if there's no boat service on that day, else you'll spend 35 SGD with only few animals to see."
,,amazing river theme park,4.0,,Amazing theme park. Went there couple of months ago. Nice to see Panda Jia-Jia and Panda Kai Kai. Amazing animals from different countries.
,,Panda's are the highlight,3.0,,"If you like fish you will love it of course from it's name there is a clue it shows different species from the rivers of the world. The panda's were a bonus and we were lucky enough to see them. Unfortunately we didn't actually get to do the river cruise we didn't have enough time to queue, to be fair they did warn us that it would be a long wait and they didn't start running the cruise boats until about midday for some reason which was a shame as there was a few more animal species we missed, but for us it was worth the entry to see the panda's alone."
,,Waste of time and money,1.0,,"We got there at 3pm right after the zoo, and even though we bought the ticket, we could not board on the cruise because it was already fully booked.
The person at the entrance told us the cruise was just 15% of the park so we wouldn't miss much, the fact is that half of the park is watchable only from the cruise...
Could not get some refund as well.
So in the end it's just a long empty walk. Only noticeable thing is one dirty panda.
Go to the zoo and only the zoo. Or jurong bird park. The rest is crap."
,,Don't expect too much,3.0,,"Having previously enjoyed the night safari, we were anxious to try this new experience. The concept is good, the pandas are gorgeous but the boat ride, which was what we looked forward to was only a 10 minute ride. Disappointing. Best done as part of a zoo visit or the night safari, don't go just for this."
,,VERY BAD!!,1.0,,"I went there with my wife and 2 kids (4 and 2 1/2). After a first very long queue, they told us that our daughter (2 1/2) is to small for the ride!!! ""It's a bumpy ride"" they said... So my wife stayed with her. The ride is 15 minutes, nothing interesting to see at all and no bumpy rides... Nothing dangerous for a child accompanied by their STUPID... But its Singapore, the country where people are afraid of EVERYTHING . So almost 1.5hrs queue for a 15 minutes ride... Where you can see 3 monkeys, a jaguar, some birds and some wild pigs... DONT GO THERE!!"
,,MUST-GO,5.0,,"You will not only meet animals and fishes in endangered but also learn about them and their environment.
Dugongs eating fishes shocked me as we had only seen them eating vegetable.

One thing you should not fail is to check the time-table of the shuttle bus services backing to your Hotel or City.
Otherwise, you will queue for a Taxi and wait for a long time."
,,Can be better!,3.0,,"Failed to get a boat ride first time round; tried again when we went there a second time, still no boat ride despite being there very early! A great disappointment - this is something the management should be addressing. We ended up walking all the way. Overall it is a very spacious park; we went there on a quiet weekday morning. It was pleasant. The main attraction being the pandas, other than that, honestly, nothing much to look at. You could have seen other animals next door at the Zoo."
,,"If Pandas are your thing, don't miss this!",5.0,,"Try to be at the Giant Pandas pens at approx. 3-3.30p.m. when they are fed- with luck the shy little female will be enticed out - to complete the Panda experience there a Red Pandas as well! This is a new attraction, comprising eight river habitats e.g the Yangtze, Mississippi, excellent signage accompanies the walk through exhibits of of flora and fauna plus manatees, crocodiles and fish in the aquarium areas. Finish your trip (book for later in the day to avoid crowds) with the river ride, you may see some big cats if you're lucky!"
,,Not perfect but GREAT!,4.0,,"Advice who want to go RS (River Safari) BEST day would be Friday. Better on weekdays. Avoid weekend.

Reason:
Weekdays (Mon-Thu) would be a better day to go due to less crowd BUT high chances of maintenance in some certain area.
Weekend (Sat & Sun), To avoid disappointment, pls try to avoid this 2 day, High chance of NO slot for The Amazon River Ride and they will open queue for the Panda section due to high demand on Panda bears.
Friday is the BEST day to go. If u wanna enjoy the whole RS, Best time is 10am since RS open @ 9am. A lot of slot for The Amazon River Ride. NO maintenance is done due to start of the weekend.

*Reminder: PLEASE bring your own water! $$$ there so freaking exs and hot weather from around 11am-1pm."
,,Not as good as Singapore zoo or Night safari,3.0,,"This place is situated right next to Singapore zoo and night safari, so in short u can do 3 things in 1 day, morning zoo, then river safari then night safari.
Overall this place is just OK, with lots of various aquariums of different kinds of fish categorized into various areas.
Panda thing is also just OK OK.
I think a total of 3 hours is more than enough for this place.
There are no shows per say in this park like in zoo or night safari so u can visit any time. Even the boat safari (which is too much hyped) us just OK OK, nothing great. All in all just OK experience."
,,from a logistical point of view...my verdict is FAIL!,1.0,,"queued up for 30 minutes, the staff told me, BUY TICKETS ONLINE. my response? I told them their online ticketing DISALLOWED SENIORS ABOVE AGE 60 FROM BUYING THE DISCOUNTED TICKETS thus i had no choice but to waste time queuing up because of the FLAWS OF THE TICKETING SYSTEM :(

when i arrived at the BOAT RIDE@ 10am, it was SHUT DOWN due to full capacity, WHAT KIND OF ZOO OR ATTRACTION builds a boat ride which can only handle a limited ride load?!? Terrible, unacceptable & 100% i am NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE UNTIL THE MANAGEMENT realises that it is unacceptable to run the RIVER SAFARI in this manner!

left the place disappointed, disillusioned & with shock that wildlife reserves is continuing to give this kind of sub-standard visitor experience to hundreds of visitors like me =("
,,New and exciting,4.0,,"It is a brand new venue and suitable for all ages. I brought my kids here and even though it is very far (took around 1:30 hours by train + bus), the trip was worth it.

They have a wide collection of river animals including the giant manatees and Giant Panda. My kids love them! They also have this boat safari which was still free and my little girl just made the minimum height requirement (1.06 meter). The ride was exciting as we went through shallow stream and some small waterfalls!! It is safe but expect a little splash here and there. And no, it is not scary at all.

Totally worth it."
,,Pandas worth the visit,4.0,,Combined River Safari with morning at the zoo. The boat ride was closed for maintenance on the day we went - the girl told us it was only a 10 minute ride so we opted not to come back another day. Was very interesting but for us the highlight of the visit was the opportunity to see a panda! There were no queues at all and we had an uninterrupted view of the male panda as he lolled about the enclosure eating. Got some great photos with plenty of time to take them as hardly anyone else there. I think we were very lucky as we could see the roped off areas for crowd queue control all empty.
,,Absolutely disappointing,1.0,,"With the amount of hype this attraction has been receiving, one would think it would be amazing place to visit. Well it is amazing. Amazingly bad! I don't know if they rushed to complete the park but the overall feel of the park is 'cheap'. Its funny how the normally white and black pandas are black and brown here. There's only one part of the park that I truly liked. The manatee exhibit! This says a lot about a supposedly multi million dollar tourist attraction. My advise is to save your money and visit the Singapore Zoo which is just next door."
,,Go Early. Book Early,3.0,,"that is essential. There's a feeding session starting from 9 a.m. from the start of the safari. so you get to catch something. Don't go expecting to see quick moving animals or animal shows.
This is the RIVER safari. So a lot of what you see are in the water. (not exactly responsive to humans!)

Book your slot for the Boat Ride early (do it online before you go!, the queue to book at the counter is long!!) The boat ride is short, and really nothing much to shout about. But it is an ride to see and check out a few stuff up close.

The best part for us was the Amazone Forest. It was an amazing exhibit. Very educational. But again, I must stress. There are no animals that are responsive to humans there. Everything's in the water."
,,Definitely good for one visit,3.0,,"We went on a weekend and having been told to anticipate long queues, we tried to be there early. We could only be there around 9.45. There is a separate queue (took us about 25mins) for the river ride which is basically a timestamp. The river ride lasted only about 10 minutes and it is the only way to view some of the animals such as the anteater, jaguar, iguana and the flamingos. The ride itself was enjoyable and pleasant. If you are seated in the front row, expect to get some minor splashes. It is not enough to soak you to the bone, but you'll need to keep away your cameras and phones, etc from time to time.

The flooded forest was amazing, I like the high glass and it was nice to see the manatee, among other aquatic animals. The river otters were nice, graceful swimmers and we stopped there for quite a while. Several fish species (including piranha) were to be seen and they were very interesting.

My personal favourite was the squirrel monkey. The rivers themselves were very informational. There is a fair bit of info and to digest all that, one should plan for quite some time. If visitors are not interested in diverse fish species and other aquatic life forms or do not stop to read the info panels, they will be done in an hour and will return with the impression that ""it's just fish"".

Coming to the pandas section, there are the red ones and the giant pandas. We were fortunate enough to see all of them. I was told that sometimes one or both the pandas are resting/sleeping in their enclosures. During our visit the male was resting and chomping on some bamboo shoots and carrots. The female was endlessly pacing, so basically there were good photo opportunities in seated as well as moving postures. We also got to see a bit of the polar bear swimming in his own enclosure. Was a sight worth seeing, a polar bear (or any other beast of that size) swimming underwater.

In summary, I would recommend it to people who are interested in diverse plant, animal and bird species and also have some world geography idea. A little bit of prior research is needed to know what is in store and whether that matches one's expectations and interests. There is not much of a point driving up/ taking a bus from Choa Chu Kang/ taking a cab here and standing in queues for hours only to give a cursory glance at something that arouses no interest."
,,The JK Pandas,4.0,,"* At first we thought the pandas were at the zoo but it turned out they weren't there.

* So we went to River Safari and found out there were pandas there. This is the highlight of our trip.

* We missed out the boats because they were fully booked but it didn't matter because it took me 30 mins to finish walking the whole River safari. The most worthwhile time is looking at the pandas.

* Then we waited till 7pm for the Night Safari which everyone was waiting for it in the evening."
,,waste of time and money,1.0,,"went there early, like 9 am. no crowds at all, not even for panda viewing. we were told complimentary boat rides start at 12, and so we booked our slots for 12. but then, by 10 am, we had toured the whole park. so we walked another round, had a snack and proceeded to the boat ride waiting area. we were shocked that queue already started at 11.10 am. and we ended standing in the queue for 50 minutes before we could get on the boat. nothing great, but at least, we could finally rest our legs.
children agreed this will be our first and last time to river safari. in our opinion, river safari was a colossal failure compared to the zoo and night safari, which we went so many many times as still find good to go."
,,Horrible- don't waste your money!!,1.0,,"I'm usually give quite positives reports, but not in this case!! This is quite frankly a waste of time and money. The day didn't start well when the coach from Vivocity never arrived. After several calls to be told "" it's on it's way, it's broken down, it's been replaced"" we gave up and got a cab. Probably should have done that in the first place as only 3SGD more for the 3 of us. The other family waiting, who has small kids, gave up and went home to swim. We should have done the same!!
The attractions are very mediocre and the displays are very boring. Had to keep reminding myself that this whole place has only recently opened. Looked like it was outdated already.
Arrivingl late, of course there were no tickets left for the boat. This was a shame as it's the only way to see some of the animals. The red pandas were great, but the panda's generally were disappointing. The female one is so shy, that she spends most of her time hiding under her bed in her cage, which is relayed to the public via CCTV......the park has no water fountains anywhere, so on a hot day the only option is to buy water from the store, so make sure you take your own.!!! Oh and at the end of the day we had to join the taxi queue and wait 90mins for a cab along with zillions of other people including tired little children. Not a park official in sight to try and organise the random arrival and disbursement of taxi's....couldn't figure any other way to get back to the city. Give this attraction a miss!!!! The night safari is fantastic!!"
,,You can give it a miss...,2.0,,"The River Safari was touted as the latest and newest attraction in Singapore. First of all, only two ticket booth and you have hundreds of visitors queuing to get the tickets. Next you will need to join the queue if you want to take the 10 mins Kiddy Safari Ride as you need to book a timing to go for the ride.

The main attraction is the pandas and with kids and noisy tourists around, the pandas seemed stressed and hide in the enclosure rather then coming out.

The Safari ride is over-rated. It's just a 10 mins kiddy ride along a 4 feet wide drain, but the wait would be an hour or so."
,,To to the night safari or zoo instead,2.0,,"I have brought my kids there twice, hoping to catch the boat ride. Both times we got there in the morning but the boat ride was already full for the whole day. From the other reviews I read, it sounds like we didn't miss too much. Nevetheless what's the point of designing a park whereby quite a number of animals can only be seen from the boat ride, but that ride does not have the capacity to cater to all your visitors? To add insult to injury, they still charge the full price for the tickets even if the boat ride is full for the day! The saving grace is the pandas which is a good attraction, although be prepared to brave the huge crowds to see them. The flooded forest is nice too, although the question you need to ask yourself is whether you would pay this price and fight your way through the crowds just for that. My advice - go to the zoo or night safari instead..."
,,River Safari Singapore more like an Aquarium Museum,3.0,,"I went to River Safari for the first time, to my surprise, the welcoming place is the fish in the aquarium. To my disappointment that the boat has already fully booked and no way of using the boat for sight-seeing.

Indeed, an unforgettable place to go to see the 02 Panda and the Squirrel Monkey. That will worth of all..

It not a big area, hence, 1-2 hours will be able to finish the whole area other than queuing up to see the Panda. i will not go again if i have another opportunity."
,,What a waste of time and money.,1.0,,"There are three star attractions here. The Pandas, the Manatee and the Jaguar (I think, it's one of the big cats). The Jaguar, and other secondary star animals (like the giant ant-eater) could be seen only from the boat. It was impossible to get a ride on the boat. They should have known that there will be more people visiting the park than could possibly fit on the boat throughout the day. Plus, some poor sod who got his ticket for the boat ride at 11:30 AM for the last boat ride at 5:30 PM would have to wait 6+ hours at the River Safari before he could get on the boat. Terrible organisation and planning. Very disappointing, as it seemed to have so much potential. They should integrate it into the zoo."
,,NOT a safari and hugely understaffed,1.0,,"We were so disappointed with our experience, particularly as the Night Safari (which we visited on a previous trip) was fantastic.

First off, if you decide to visit this attraction after reading my review then I strongly suggest you book ONLINE and print out your booking to ensure fast entry. We arrived at 11am and we queued over ONE HOUR just to get our entry tickets on a Friday morning after Christmas. There was only one person selling tickets on the desk and the poor girl was being worked to the bone. In fact, the whole place was hugely understaffed and because of this people couldn't find anyone to answer questions and kept interrupting her which delayed the ticket queue even more. By the time we finally bought our tickets we were feeling irritated, hot and unhappy and my back and feet were hurting from standing for so long.

Worse still, the Amazon River 'Safari' was sold out and had been before we'd even arrived in the queue, so the main attraction we wanted wasn't available to us.

When we finally got in we were surprised to find that what we entered was a series of aquariums, not dissimilar to a sea life centre. The fish/mammals on display were not impressive and we'd seen most of them before in smaller aquariums. The 2 crocodiles looked miserable in their small, glass box. When we entered the Panda enclosure there was a huge queue again just to get in so we decided to skip it completely having been already fed up with queuing for the day.

All the restaurants had queues going out of the doors, so again we went hungry and skipped eating. At 1pm we walked past a couple of mobile hot food and drink stalls and their display cabinets were empty - hot food was sold out. I almost treated myself to an icecream but then saw the prices, laughed and turned away.

We walked past the queue for the Boat Ride and, despite the fact that these people were lucky enough to have tickets, they were still queuing for ages.

The only bit we genuinely enjoyed was the monkey enclose as we were able to walk amongst the creatures and they were such fun to watch.

We were so relieved when we finished the tour and came out of the exit!! We couldn't get home fast enough, even though we had to then queue half an hour for a taxi.

All in all, this might only be fun for very small children. I cannot see how many more people would have a good time here. It pains me to be so negative, but I feel you should hear the truth!

Go to the Night Safari instead - that's wonderful."
,,Misleading advertising equals very disappointed,1.0,,This was very different to what I was expecting. From all of the advertising it looks as though you go on a river safari and see all of the animals from a boat. So not the case. The river safari is actually a walking loop that showcases the different rivers and their wildlife around the world. There is a huge lineup to see the panda's. There is a theme park type ride that takes you around a little water channel but you don't see much and only goes for about 5 -10 mins. I think they need to re-look at their advertising or rename the river safari as a journey through the rivers of the world. Very misleading!!
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"My husband and I and two children visited the RS on January 7, 2014. We arrived by approx 10 am and we're informed that the boat tour was closed for maintainance. Given the fact that 20% of the park needs to be seen from the boat we were expecting a discount on our tickets but none was given. This was very disappointing and we were surprised by the lack of good basic business practice: if you can't provide guests the full experience, offer them a discount or some other form of compensation.
Our experience in the park itself was underwhelming for what we paid for the tickets. We have been friends of the zoo for 9 years and have always found that to be a worthwhile investment. We would not join as members of the RS unless a very good discount was offered.

We found the staff in some cases to be uneducated about the animals in the park. When I asked a group of staff members if there were any river dolphins in the Yangtze River section (as displayed on signs), I was practically laughed at for my seemingly ridiculous question....not very professional. Our young kids were told to be quiet by the staff attending to the pandas even though they were just quickly passing through! Needless to say, we felt very unwelcome in this exhibit and so we left quickly.

So these are a few negative experiences we had for you to consider. Of course, there were some positive ones too. I wonder what the future of the RS will be if it's competing with other more fabulous Eco-parks in Singapore...."
,,Go to Singapore Zoo for a wow experience rather than this one,3.0,,"I am an avid fan of Singapore Zoo, so I expect this one gives me the same experience. Unfortunately, this isn't the case.
The animals are too few, the fish are so-so (I understand that since it bears the name 'river', it shows river animals, which is nowhere as attractive as sea fish in terms of colors and shapes.
The River Boat ride that they boast, turns out to be an average. This time they still give free charge for the rides. But if they want to charge it on top of the entrance fee? I don't think I will want to ride it.
Prefer Singapore Zoo 10 times than this one."
,,Not as good at the actual Singapore Zoo,1.0,,"We did a Singapore Zoo/River Safari combo and in comparison, the River Safari is not worth the visit. Nothing much ""River"" about it and the Amazon quest boat ride (that we had to queue for despite having booked a time slot?) was a total joke - over in two minutes, barely got to see the animals. The star attractions, the pandas and the manatees, are of course a delight but it feels like a ripe-off that they are not part of the zoo. Great way to milk out an extra 25$ in entrance fee... The rest of the time we walked around looking a fish - if that´s what you want to see, go to S.E.A. Aquarium instead."
,,Go & See The Pandas & Manatees,5.0,,"We went there on Boxing Day with all the expected crowds The exhibits were fabulous and realistic. We found that the setup very unique & well designed - especially the walking patio which was excellent in rainy condition. The pandas & manatee was the highlight - will be our main reason for a 2nd visit.

Boat ride was full but that's does not deter us in any way. Do bring along some snack as the restaurant is a bit pricey & less option (there is only a chinese restaurant and a panda themed fast food joint)

I do agree (not all) that there is some need for certain issues but it aint that bad...."
,,nothing really special and too much crowd!,3.0,,"We went there during the peak season of Chirstmas. We knew how heavy the traffic will be so we went there early. 8:20 am we arrived and there were already que for the boat ride. Bring lots of cold drink, and I saw a lot of people having their pack sandwich while queing at the entrance. I was lucky as I got into one of the booth selling group tickets and got a booking for the boat ride without having to que up at the entrance. I didn't really enjoy much of the park since there was just too much people around. I like the area of the aquarium where you can see the sea otters and the mantee because it is airconditioned. The river boat ride was just ok, nothing special.. too few animals to see and nothing really interesting. The whole park's animal were good since it is a bit different from other zoo's animal. The lineup for the panda was just terrible so we didn't go in anymore. I've seen the panda in China before so didn't feel it was something worth queing. By 11am we left the place already as the crowds were just too much already and we had browsed through the park already. It is also very hot and humid during the day so be prepared with that. Overall nothing special and the boat ride is just not worth paying for if they do ever decide to put a premium on that."
,,"Pandas are cute, rest of day wasted!",2.0,,"You must be able to walk/wheel chair the entire time. Very few seats to rest, toilets are soooooo far from each other, one place to buy food half way through the safari. Only worth going to see Pandas, but I heard others say that often they can't be seen. The River ride was a 1.5 hr wait on your feet in the heat, for ten minute ride that went so fast you couldn't see the animals. Singapore Zoo has a long way to go before this attraction is worth the time and money."
,,Feeling Cheated,2.0,,"The concept, design, and environment were good, some of the animals in the safari were an interesting bunch probably not seen anywhere else in Singapore.

However, the crowds were crazy even at 11am. The worst was that at that time, the boat ride was already fully booked. Given that everyone has to pay the same entry price, a large number of people being unable to view about 35% of the animals in the safari (on the boat ride) is extremely unfair. The entry price should be lowered and a separate fee should be charged for the boat ride. This was a huge negative point for us. Not being able to see the jaguar? Feels like a big missing out.

As you'd expect in such a location, the price of food is exorbitant. The long slow queues were a downer as well."
,,moderately attractive but such a long queue!,3.0,,"probably my bad as I went there on a end-of-year Sunday.

the first queue started with queing for the boat cruise time slot (we booked our tickets online but couldn't book the boat slot. $25 for admission. cheaper if u purchase a package that visits other attractions like zoo/bird park/night safari), that itself took 1 hour and by the time we reached our turn it was 11am and we got 3.30pm slot (think last boat ride is 5pm).

got in, the first part that u'll run through would be the different animals/fishes for the various rivers. first impression it looked like any ordinary zoo but when u reach the huge aquariums it really is very impressive. the fishes are so fat that i swear they probably weight half as much as i do.

the 2nd queue starts at the panda observatory. have to queue to get in as they kept the pandas in an air-conditioned observatory. that itself probably took half hour plus. the 2 famous pandas from china weren't really visible, one lying on its stomach sleeping and the other sleeping in its den (only visible via CCTV). the ones that are more attractive were probably the red pandas.

the 3rd queue starts at the restaurant. in the entire river safari there's only one restaurant. there're 2 small kiosk that sell drinks and chips. wish they have more food stalls that has hot dogs. coz queing for the food is a pain. the food weren't fantastic. it is so call 'szechuan' cuisine but essentially chinese food la. i guess they tried to do it as a fast food chain but this is really very hard to operate as a fast food chain with the type of food they had. so advice would be: bring your own food from outside, there're places that u can sit in the open air and eat.

the 4th queue starts at the boat cruise. our boat slot is 3.30pm and the paper slip states we should be there 15 mins before. we waited from 3.15pm all the way to 4pm in order to get into the boat. the boat seats 10ppl, each row of 2 ppl. i didn't think it was impressive, there were animals that we couldn't see. the boat ride itself took roughly 10 mins.

the aquarium with the manetee is absolutely breath-taking.... if i ever go back it would probably be for this.

i'll give credit to the staff there though, helpful and organised. handled the crowd brilliantly."
,,worth a visit,4.0,,"Smaller compared to Zoo. The only disliked will be the going for Panda visit required long que and we didnt manage to get the boat ride since over crowded and over booked.T

The good point will be whole place are under sheltered area which are much better than the Zoo. Not so hot if on sunny day."
,,Feeling cheated,1.0,,"The River Safari is not worth the time or money, period. Go only if you have free or heavily-discounted tickets.

The nice:
- Sufficient shelter and covered walkways so you can hide from the sun or rain.

- Err… I’m hard pressed to think of something else good, and you can read from my other reviews I always try to look at the positive and negative.

The not nice:
- Food is very, very, very, very expensive. Only two places you can buy food from and they are no better from food court food. One set meal costs $15.90, and it’s not filling too. Add on other food or drinks you need to buy multiplied by other family members’ food you need to buy and you get the idea. (Hint: bring your own food)

- The animals are nothing special, really. Once you have been inside the zoo, you’ll think the animals in the River Safari are about the same. Even the much-hyped special animal exhibits are not worth the hype e.g. the piranhas are housed in a small glass ‘container’. There are so few of them. Looking at them, anyone can be forgiven for thinking they are just… fish.

- As for the pandas, it greatly depends on the time you go. When I visited the pandas when they first came, all I saw was one black-and-white stuff toy’s backside. This time round, at least they were awake, up and about. But then, Kai Kai was so stressed by the ooh-ing and ahh-ing of the visitors that he retreated into his enclosure and refused to come out. No doubt you pay a small price to see a panda compared to flying all the way to Sichuan, but, it’s a hit-or-miss chance you have to take.

- And then the ‘largest freshwater aquarium,’ no doubt it’s different from the aquarium at S.E.A. Aquarium, frankly, the latter is way better, and cheaper too. Unless you are a ‘fish fan’ and particular about freshwater vs. sea water, go for S.E.A. Aquarium.

- The Boat Ride is the biggest rip-off. It’s an 8min ride. Most of the time you cannot see any animals because they’re either hiding somewhere or they are hiding somewhere, and obviously you cannot stop halfway to look for them. Some of the animals were transferred from the zoo e.g. jaguar, so, if you have seen them before, there’s nothing new. The Boat Ride was complementary when I took it. I don’t know when they’re going to start charging for it. Don’t pay a cent. Not worth even an extra cent from the main admission charges.

Conclusion: if not for the fact I had free tickets, I would have come back feeling very, very, very cheated. Even then, I still felt cheated, that I have wasted the day there instead of taking my family somewhere else.

P.S.: I read many comments here about long queues and long waiting times. My family was a victim too (1hr queuing to buy lunch, 1hr queuing for the boat). However, I bear in mind that we were there during the school holidays and everywhere is crowded during the school holidays, so it’s not fair to complain about the queues and waits.

If I had paid full price for everything (food and tickets) I’d have spent about $210. I don't think it was even worth $21."
,,Rivers of the World,5.0,,"The sheltered walkways all around the park allow us to stroll leisurely in the shade. My favourite attractions are Amazon flooded forest, the Panda gallery & the Amazon river quest boatride.

Do arrive as early as you can, about 8.30am-9am so as to secure your desired time slots for the Amazon river quest boatride. Collect your complimentary boat tickets at the entrance. Yes! It's complimentary for now, so do come soon in case the boat ride becomes chargeable!

From the entrance, visitors can choose to turn left or right to start their walk. Most choose to go left. I suggest right, as there's very little crowd on the right. Best of all, Amazon flooded forest is the very first attraction on the right!

As for the panda exhibit, there's a snake like queue at 12 noon. I strongly suggest you visit the panda before 11.30am. There's a panda restaurant selling panda buns. Again, visit the restaurant early to avoid the crowd.

We finished 2 rounds of walk around the park in 3 hours. So it's possible to visit the river safari in the morning, then the singapore zoo right after. The entrances are just side by side. In fact, you could end the night with a visit to the night safari right beside the zoo too! Remember to buy the park hopper tickets for discounts."
,,The least interesting zoo/aquarium in Singapore. Very bland,3.0,,"As the most recently opened zoo in Singapore, the expectations were high, especially after a very exciting advertisement campaign.

Unfortunately, the River Safari is currently disappointing.

The good: very modern infrastructure where almost all the walking paths are covered, protecting you from the rain and sun. The manatee exhibit is gorgeous, the spider monkey enclosure is fun, and the red pandas are very cute.

The less good: many enclosures feel rather empty, with very few animals visible. While a lot is made about beavers in the first exhibit, there aren't any available. The park is rather small compared to the other Singapore zoos, and feels very clinical. Food/drink options are underwhelming.

The bad: the advertisements for the ""Amazon River Quest"" shows a small boat on an exotic river, surrounded by plenty of animals. The reality is a Universal Studios-style barge capable of seating 19 people, speeding through a concrete channel, with animal enclosures left and right. The barges run so fast that it is impossible to spot more than 10% of the animals that are supposed to be there.

The boat ride is currently free, but you need to book your time slot in the park, queuing 3 times: once to book your slot, then to enter the attraction a few hours later, and then inside the attraction. You are only allowed one ride per day per person, so you can't go back to try and see what you missed the first time. All the queuing will probably add up to 2-3 hour for an underwhelming 5-10 minutes ride.

We enjoyed our stay in the park - it is nice - but think that it could have been so much better. I don't think we'll return unless it is improved dramatically.

Make sure you do not come on a busy day - call them in advance to check how long the queues are expected to be that day."
,,Shockingly disappointed,1.0,,"Reasons
1 this is quite a walk from singapore zoo ,
2 1-2 hrs que for 10 mins boat ride
3 rest of the zones of river safari very basic
4 nowhere mentioned that the ride will b just 10 mins

Worst I ever visited . Not worth spending money"
,,Nice but the long awaited boat ride is a laugh,4.0,,Nice addition to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari but the long awaited boat ride is much ado about nothing. Manatee and otter aquariums are stunning. The cramped and refrigerated Panda exhibit disappointing. The much advertised boat ride was a laugh. I suggest you don't consider it when they start charging you separately for it!
,,The boat ride seems to be always full !!!!!,3.0,,"The main attraction of the River Safari which is the boat ride was full for the entire day!!! So we missed half of the animals.

However, the other sections were pretty decent and we got a chance to see the Panda bear which made the trip fruitful. The fishes are also nice especially the Mekong catfish.

U can skip it if the boat ride is full and see the Singapore Zoo instead which is close-by along with Night Safari

P.S - There are various combo offers which can give you access to all 4 attractions namely Jurong Bird park, Singapore Zoo, River Safari & Night Safari at a better rate. The Singapore Zoo, River Safari & Night Safari are in the same premises whereas the Jurong Bird park is at a distance of 20 kms hence covering all 4 parks in a single day is virtually impossible. Choose your combo passes wisely"
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"We went to the River Safari through Tour East. We were there for around 2 hours which was mostly spent at queuing and riding the boat ride which wasn't really that good. There was even a problem in the ride where the boats piled up at the loading station. Good thing there was a platform to our right so that we could go down because we were three boats away from the loading station.

If you plan to ride the boat, don't sit in front because there is a small drop at the start which will get your pants wet. But nonetheless the whole park was a disappointment."
,,The boat trip is painfully frustrating.,2.0,,"Its quite nice,
BUT the main attraction is the boat ride, which has many animals not visible on foot. And its is terrible! Here is the issues:
1. You have to book a boat ride,... usually 4 hr's after you arrive is the earliest available.
2. You arrive 15min before your time slot and the queue is long... then you get put into another queue which is long... so that then you get put in the 3rd queue.... in total queuing was 1hr, and I think we were on a quiet day.
3.the boat ride is only 10min long (after 1hr queue)
4. All the 'speed up' sections get you moving so fast you miss 2 of the 3 species in the area. The only animals you see are the birds. The unique animals like howler monkeys, ant eaters, Mara are missed because you don't have time to look to left and right.
5. Photography is virtually impossible. Because of the speed and how animals are changing species left and right so fast its just frustrating.
6. They really should put a walking path through these animals, because on the boat you miss them."
,,"Overpriced - only go very early, otherwise avoid",2.0,,"We went to River Safari on Dec 29th 2013 and were disappointed to learn that we had no chance to join the main attraction of this place: the river ride.

As others have commented, it is always full. An employee explained to me that they have 14 rides pr day (every 30 minutes). Each ride can take around 200 people, so only 2800 people get to enjoy this ride each day.

This ride makes up 50% of the whole River Safari, so if you cannot take it, this attraction has an extremely low value for money. We were informed that we could come back the next day which was not possible as half of our group left the following day.

I would suggest that the management of this attraction considers 2 possible actions to avoid disappointing many more people:
1) Increase number of boats from 14 to 28 (why is there only a boat every 30 mins) to accomodate more visitors
2) Half the ticket price for the River Safari and then start charging for the river ride. At least this way, all the people who get on the boat pay for it while people who miss the boat will feel that the ticket price is fair.

Bring your own food as there is only 1 restaurant half way through the park and here prices are also much too high compared to what you get.

The only thing I enjoyed during our visit to the River Safari was the aquarium with the Manatees. Very impressive."
,,Irony of Star being biggest turnoff,2.0,,"This River Safari concept is great but the premise is too small to feature such diverse theme. As a result, it is like a Jack of All Trades but Master of None. In fact, you can cover this attraction entirely in an hour. Still, the attraction is tourist-friendly with covered walkways in most parts.

Ironically the main star of the attraction, the Amazon River Ride is the biggest turn-off!
It is not child friendly (at least 1.06m tall) and no modified boat for wheelchairs. It was listed on the website as ""limited in number"" but to me, it seemed like everybody who queued will be issued a ticket. Unsurprisingly, crowding is the top complaint in TripAdvisor.

At the entrance, I queued for 30 minutes to get the complimentary tickets to the ride. I was given a time-slot about 2 hours later so we did a leisurely walk through the entire attraction. Then, we started queuing at the River Ride entrance for 40 minutes. Past the entrance, there was no sign of any boats but yet another 30 minutes queue. The staff did a great job organizing people into boats but I wished the speed of the ride was slower.

A few tips for a better experience:
1. Book tickets online - the scanners can read the barcodes of the e-tickets on your smartphone (no need to print).
2. Go as early as possible to get the River Ride tickets; do the ride before the queue starts to form.
3. Don't buy the Ice Slush (Lime or Mango flavor), you are better off drinking mineral water.
4. Do this attraction early in the day, then go to the Zoo and finally, if you have the energy, do the Night Safari.
5. Don't go during mid-day because of the crowds and to avoid watching sleepy animals. Yes, even the fish looked lethargic!"
,,River Safari was a great surprise,4.0,,"To start off there are 3 zoos (the zoo, river safary and bird park) + the night experience so a total of 4 options. Due to time restrictions we opted for the zoo and river safari. The zoo was ok, I meam we have visited Auckland, San Diego, Werribee, Taronga zoos so unless there were dinasours alive it was going to be difficult to get impressed. A great surprise was the River Safari zoo, which is themed based on great rivers around the world, something I haven't seen before. The amazon boat ride is a must do but needs to be booked in advance as it sells out really quick"
,,Victim of its success,3.0,,"Going in the middle of the school break between Xmas and NY was not a clever idea. The River Safari was totally packed at 10am and the boat rides were fully booked for the whole day so we missed half of the animals.
Jia Jia and Chai Chai the pandas were also out of reach unless you were prepared to queue for a good hour and a half.
The park is victim of being recently opened and of not being able to cater for the high demand. Surely things will get better in a few months and off peak."
,,Great experience!,4.0,,"Brought my 2 kids and my mum to river safari in April 2013. At that time the river cruise is still not opened so won't be able to comment on that. We went on a weekday so it wasn't crowded.

Pros:
1. The walkway is all covered so no need to worry if it's too sunny or raining.
2. The whole place is stroller/wheelchair friendly / good for kids
3. The panda themed restaurant is nice, try their panda pao and cappuccino , very cute and taste good too, price also reasonable
4. Loves the manatee and panda. Very nice to see, and it's air con...

Cons:
1. It is relatively small compared to singapore zoo, so the entrance fees are considered steep.
2. The animal show is totally a waste of time. The bench to seat is very minimal and the show is not interesting at all. It is more like for kids to get close encounter with the animal but u can only do that when there is less people. During peak time, can hardly see the animal cause there is no stage and very minimal seats.

Overall, still quite fun as the kids love panda and I love manatee. Can really spend time sitting down n watching them
:))"
,,Left feeling cheated,1.0,,"One of the newest attraction in Singapore, I decided to check out River Safari on 30 December. Upon reaching the destination, I was horrified to see at least 80 people queuing for tickets. It was a good thing that I could quickly go online and buy the tickets on the spot, hence no dramas. We were told that the boat ride in the safari was full. Not knowing the significance of that, we thought that it was still alright to visit as we were happy to walk instead of riding a boat. My first impression of the place was that there wasn't much animals / fish to see. The theme of the safari was river animals of course, but most of them were focused on fish which was really not quite exciting. In addition, the place is really small. It was only when we walked to the boat ride area then we were told that there were some animals that could only be seen during the boat ride. After checking the map, I realised that it meant that we miss out on seeing quite a number of animals. I felt really cheated as even though the attendants did emphasize the boat ride was full, but they failed to notify visitors that we will miss out on many animals if we do not take the boat, which was the single main and most important thing to point out. At SGD25, that was a total rip off. We finished the park in less than 2 hours. I will never go back again and will not recommend anyone to do so as well."
,,Too many lines! Avoid the River Safari Boat Ride – an hour in line.,3.0,,"The River Safari section of the zoo requires a separate ticket and overall it is very well presented.

There was an even larger line for the Pandas that I estimated to be at least an hour long so we skipped them. This was a big disappointment.

We got tickets for the boat ride at 1:30 pm. We arrived at 1:15 pm and did not get into the boat until 2:20 pm. It was a short, boring ride. Sitting on a boat and going quickly past animals is not a good way to enjoy a zoo.

Be aware that the bird park is 30 minutes away. We did not realize this when we booked the combination ticket."
,,Great setup premises wise but lack of value for money as no interest for the visitor,1.0,,"If you must choose between this and zoo, I will take zoo at all time. The place main attraction river ride is always sold out, the facility for kids like stroller, pull wheeler like in the zoo either not available or costly, so it is not very kids friendly. There is no feeding time like zoo, there is no place to put stroller if you bring your own for the panda exhibit, really as if it doesn't want kids to be there. For Singaporean zoo over value for money especially with the NTUC, while river Safari is commercially driven!"
,,Not a good experience,2.0,,"Wouldnt really recommend. Crowded, and nothing very special at all. The pandas were sound asleep, and one wouldnt come out of it's den. And having to queue three times to get on the boat ride (not including the one to get tickets for general admission) was just quite ridiculous.
Unless you really run out of things to do, and/or really love watching sleeping pandas on TV (yes, one of the pandas was only viewable on a small CCTV), give this a skip. Not really worth the time."
,,"New concept, obviously growing but a good start",4.0,,"We packaged this visit with a Park Hopper to include the the Zoo and Bird Park, so it became very good value.

The layout was easy to follow, and made good attempts to have quite a world wide experience of river inhabitants. The Pandas were active and a delight.

The river boat ride was efficiently organized, and staff kept passengers flowing. For a very popular part if the park, it appeared well managed. The ride itself was ordinary, providing a different way to see certain exhibits. Downside is that you only get a short view of those exhibits, and there did not appear to be a way to revisit most of those on foot.

A good theme, which can only improve with age."
,,$25 you got to be joking.,3.0,,"River safari

Prebook the ticket online to save time for lining up at the main gate. Catch the tourist bus from the city for $5/pp per trip. From bus stop B12 right across from Mandarin Gallery.

The exhibit divided into different world rivers system; Mississippi, Congo, Ganges, Mekong, Nile etc. at the end is the star attraction of the show, the Panda couple (Kai Kai and Jia Jia). Unfortunate Kai Kai was sleeping and Jia Jia is in her den. Took us 30 mins to get into the Panda forest.

At the end of the Panda forest is a Mama Panda kitchen and crossing the bridge will take you to;Amazon flooded forest exhibit, squirrel monkey forest (a walk through and yes the squirrel monkeys are quite take and will come right up to you) and boat ride (at this time the ride is free but need to pre book ticket online).

Overall the attraction is basically an extension of the zoo. I have seen pet shop aquariums stock more fish and bigger specimen then the River Safari. Personally I don't think it worth the $25/pp. The boat ride was ok and make sure you stay away from the front few rows or you will be drench."
,,Hardly worth the visit or the price,2.0,,"This is a very limited attraction. Visitors are limited to raised walkways from one so-called region to another. This park is supposed to represent the great rivers of the world.

The Mississippi river at the start has the look-and-feel of a Disney or Universal Studio theme park, and it goes downhill from there, literally and figuratively. Africa's Congo River, Egypt's River Nile, India's Ganges, Australia's Murray River, Vietnam's Mekong, China's Yangtze River are mostly fish tanks of various sizes. Yes, it's a glorified aquarium with limited views especially when the park is crowded - not difficult since the walkways restrict movement and there are hardly any places to sit and rest.

15% of the park is accessible via the Wild Amazonia boat ride but access to this ride is by booking seats - usually full by 9.30am!

The chief attractions of interest are the Giant Pandas (if you don't mind the queue - the queue to join the queue snaked all the way to the Mekong River exhibit, preventing others from viewing those tanks!); and the Amazon flooded forest which feature otters and manatees in a gigantic tank. The jury is still out for the boat ride since we couldn't get on it.

If you plan to visit: go way early and head for the Visitor Information Center to book a seat on the ride (the queue grows fairly quickly and you may even end up getting a late slot, say 3pm!). Then, make a beeline to the Giant Panda enclosure. Once you've completed these two, take your time to see the others. The Squirrel Monkeys are cute but can get aggressive if they see food on you. The otters are graceful in the water. The manatees are so laid back - nice!

I think the park is built as an excuse to make money for the upkeep of the pandas. There isn't much to see in terms of variety of animals (fish and more fish, with the odd beaver, polar bear and alligator or so); and not much to do to engage young children."
,,Clever Marketing - Don't fall for the hype,3.0,,"Verdict - Don't fall for the hype - it's basically a glorified Aquarium.

The highlight of the place is the squirrel monkey open enclosure.

But BEWARE! Don't get too close to them. One of them bit my daughter on the hand!!! They have lost their fear of humans. It could have been serious. If this wasn't Singapore, I would have sued. It is a serious potential health and safety risk.

Clever marketing gives the impression that it is a ""safari"", playing on that word. But don't be mislead. It is nothing like the Night Safari, which is excellent. There is a fraud boat ride, for which you probably have to line Up to separately book for up to an hour. The ride itself is unremarkable.

I would not go again and I certainly would not recommend it to a friend. You would be better off with the zoo and night safari."
,,Badly Run - Hire More Staff to Enforce Safety of Both Animals and Visitors,2.0,,"My experience at River Safari was pretty disappointing after years of appreciation for the general quality of the Singapore Zoo. Besides the incredibly long line for the Boat Ride, which we begrudgingly had to skip (I was told by a staff member that the system of reserving tickets on-site only was 'fair;' I don't think it's any fairer than allowing reservations online, seeing that by 11.30am they'd run out of tickets for the day. We were also told there was no stand-by line, even though it didn't seem like every boat was full. These improvements shouldn't be too difficult to implement), I had concerns about the lack of manpower throughout the park's exhibits.

On the whole, there should have been a lot more staff positioned around the park. Every so often we encountered a docent standing by an exhibit, but most of them didn't seem particularly efficient in the (extremely important) task of crowd control, to the point where I was concerned about safety. In the Spider Monkey Jungle, where visitors walk through a large, contained enclosure full of spider monkeys, I witnessed many people ignoring the signs posted at the entrance saying not to touch, get too close to, or otherwise provoke the monkeys (they can bite). A family had pushed their baby prams within centimeters of a group of monkeys (who, I should add, looked really interested in the baby...), and one man tried repeatedly to touch the monkeys, until I pointed out that they apparently attack humans. Throughout this incident, no staff were in sight; only later did a young girl docent appear, smiling meekly and nervously. Surely when letting crowds of humans loose into the territory of untamed spider monkeys, more supervision is required than expecting people to read signs? Many tourists don't read the languages on the signs, and anyway, many people just don't read (as that family proved).

Another example of overall negligence: at various tanks, including the huge manatee window, tiny ""No Flash Photography"" stickers were pasted in obscure corners of the glass. Was anyone paying attention? Of course not. Flashes went off every second. Post a docent at that extremely popular tank to enforce these rules.

Obviously this makes for an off-putting experience for visitors, but I was worried it was affecting the animals - the red pandas, for example, have their enclosure basically in contact with the walkway, so they can easily come within a couple meters of a visitor; the big group of people crowded around them seemed to be aggravating them as they were pacing continuously in anxious, stressful circles, eying us humans the entire time. The one thing I ask from a zoo - much less one as prestigious as Singapore's - is that I don't come away distressed and concerned about the animals' emotional and mental health. I can't say the River Safari convinced me, and that was the most upsetting part of the whole trip."
,,Better to visit other places,3.0,,"This place opened to much fanfare. However, I would say the only major attraction to the River Safari are the pandas. Apart from the pandas, the other animals on show are not that interesting. A visit to the zoo would be more worth it."
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"Arrived about 30 mins after park opening and the queue for the boat ride (River Quest) was absolutely horrendous.
Wasn't prepared to stand in it so walked around the park.
Pandas were cute (hence the 2 point rating), took abt 75 mins to walk around by which time all River Quest tickets had been taken for the day so felt rather cheated.
Felt there were insufficient eating/refreshment venues inside, although you get a re-entry stamp to go to eat in the ticketing area just outside the park."
,,It's just not ready and badly planned,2.0,,"The walking half of the park is good, the pandas are great. But then there are the ques and the boat ride. In total we qued about 2 hours for a 5 minute boat rude in which we saw 5 animals. Pretty disappointing.
TLDR; Do the walking half, don't bother queuing for the boat ride."
,,Not that great,3.0,,"To me the name is misleading. The rive safari is a mix between a zoo and an aquarium. Done well but if you visit it after the Singapore zoo you're bound to feel let down a bit. The Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari are all in adjacent campuses and we did all of them is a single day. I would recommend doing just the zoo + night safari and skip river safari if you like. Gives you more time to explore the zoo that way."
,,Don't go here..,1.0,,My family and I had terrible experience here..it's the worst attraction in singapore..there's very little to see..animals are very few..the ventilation system inside and outside are poor..it hasn't been prepared for high season..very crowded..there's no enough amazon boat..how come??? it never happens in another attraction in singapore..and the mineral water vending machine was broken..it took 4 dollar and nothing came out..we have to go to mama panda restaurant (around 150 metres) to get our refund..in a very crowded restaurant too..luckily we can get the refund..
,,Worth a 2 hour visit,3.0,,"Visited the River safari this week with the kids and they loved it. It is co-located with the famous Singapore Zoo and the night safari and owned by the same company. It may be worthwhile to buy the bundle tickets where you get admission to both the zoo and river safari as the river safari is much smaller compared with the zoo and night safari. Unlike the other 2 attractions, the river safari is well designed with lots of covered walkways. There are some places to sit and rest but no many place for 'picnics'.

Try to arrive at this attraction early (say before 10am) as the timed river quest complimentary tickets issued at the visitor services centre runs out by about late morning. The tickets are for a ride on the river quest boat (lasts about 5 minutes or less) which feels very much like a slow ride in one of those theme parks. Don't fret if you miss the ride. You would get to see jaguars and some other land animals but you wouldn't miss much.

For my visit, I happened to chanced upon a free guided tour where the guide explained the highlight and unique feature of each species and this was timed with the feeding. This experience really made the river safari come alive. There are also many places to look at the fishes and I like the manatee enclosure which had a big underwater glass wall for visitors to look at the gracefulness of these creatures.

Food was expensive and it made sense to eat somewhere else. The park allows for re-entry so be sure to get a stamp on your arms when you are exiting the park.

All in, it is a small and good size aquarium that would be good to spend two hours out of the sun while admiring the many fishes, crocodilians, reptiles, birds from around."
,,It is better to spend your money elsewhere.,2.0,,"Overall experience: 2.5/5.
Other than the 2 pandas, there is no reason to visit River Safari. The Zoo and S.E.A. Aquarium have better displays.

The Amazon River Quest boat ride is so-so, nothing exciting or fantastic. Despite all the hype, the ride - scenery and ""river"" - is too artificial. Seating in the boat, I do not feel a single element of cruising down a river, not to say the Amazon River. Small selection of life in the Amazon are simply placed along the less-than-10-minute route.

Currently one pays $25 to enter River Safari and the boat ride is complimentary. Guests have to book a slot for the ride and it is limited to 3000 a day, while ""stock"" lasts. If it rains, one will have to forfeit the slot - no refund/replacement.

Fees may increase in the future. Frankly I will not pay extra just to take the boat ride. And with a $25 entry ticket, I would advise tourists
to spend the money on good food (which Singapore is famous for) or to visit the Zoo or Resort World Sentosa.

Anyway pandas in Singapore are limited to the two small mammals - one simply eat and sleep whole day (Jia Jia), the other walk in circles or hide in her cave (Kai Kai).

Overall, the entry fee of $25 is, in my opinion, not worth the spending."
,,Fun half-day but not for the river ride,4.0,,"We arrived here and were informed that the river cruise part of the zoo is free until further notice, but the que to enter the ride is over 2 hours. We wandered around the zoo before deciding to try our luck at the huge line. we waited for well over 1 hour and 45 minutes and finally got to go on the boat. We were a bit disappointed however, as you couldnt see very many animals form the boat. The rest of the zoo ( that you walk around) was however outstanding, with the manatee tank and panda enclosure being a prime attraction. Would thourougly recommend."
,,River safari Sigapore. Do not be fooled.,3.0,,"Brochures depict tourists in a boat admiring animals. It is a walking safari with an opportunity to jump on a boat if time permits. Avoid the organised tours as they only take you to and from the destination. It is cheaper and more satisfying to make your way to the zoo, buy a combined ticket to the zoo and to the river safari 2 minutes away. The zoo is good value and if you like walking do the river safari afterwards. The main feature on the river safari is giant Pandas on loan from China. You wiil need about 5 hours at the zoo and 2 hours on the river safari."
,,Fun Morning at the River Safari,4.0,,"we recently visited the River Safari on our trip to Singapore, and enjoyed it immensely, it's easy to get being adjacent to both the Zoo and Night Safari, and a fun and educational experience for all ages, you walk through direct exhibits reflecting the great rivers of the world, including the Mississippi, Yangtze, Congo and the Murray, before reaching the Amazon where you both can walk and ride the (newly opened) boat ride, animals you can see include Giant and Red Pandas, Manatees, Spider Monkeys, Anaconda, and Jaguars.
As the amazon boat ride has only recently opened it's very popular, and often books out by midday, so it's recommended to arrive early to secure a spot.
All in all an entertaining and highly recommended venue."
,,"A worthy sequel to the award-winning Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, but avoid the public holidays!",5.0,,"It can never be imagined that such a small tropical island of Singapore can boast wide-ranging species from diverse climates. Its existence as an attraction warrants a visit based purely on this unique aspect of Singapore.

The animals that we see in River Safari comes mainly from the riverine environments with the majority from the mystical Amazon. It is not everyday that you get to view the Paddle Fish, gigantic arawanas, playful manatees and even a huge anaconda. River Safari has really outdone itself, not surprisingly given the standards set by its partner zoos. A great wonder is the huge freshwater aquarium where you get to observe the manatees and other riverine creatures in a ""natural environment. It was pretty surprising to note that the perennial flooding in the Amazon can be as deep as 8 metres! It is also interesting to note how River Safari has taken advantage of the adjoining Seletar Reservior, enhancing the riverine feel of the whole attraction. Go to see how they actually built a big climate-controlled enclosure just for the Pandas (and red pandas).

Some pointers to note:

1) Do not visit the place during weekends and public holidays. I know it's really a point that need no reminding for regular travellers, but it is important enough to avoid a 100-metre queue to the ticket counter. Purchase online in advance if possible.
2) There are basically 3 eating venues within the attraction and they are not grouped together. These venues serve food that are expensive and, unfortunately, almost unpalatable. Better to eat before entering the attraction where you can find KFC, Ben and Jerrys and other cafe at the entrance of the Singapore Zoo. Pack it in too if you want but take note, there's not that many picnic places or sitting area within the attraction.
3) Do make it a point to go early in the morning when the animals are more active (including the Pandas). Go in the afternoon and it is not surprising to see most animals being very lethargic and hiding in their cubby holes.
4) Most part of the attraction is sheltered so no headwear needed, really.
5) You may want to make it as a joint visit to the Night Safari if you go there in the late afternoon.

I may be a Singaporean, but the existence of this attraction did not lessen my wonder for the determination by Singapore Wildlife Reserves to to make it happen. So do visit!"
,,Go early!,4.0,,"We just came back from a visit to the River Safari. It is extremely crowded due to the festive season. To beat the crowd, we bought our tickets online and arrived half an hour before park opened.

We managed to get tickets for the first Amazon River Quest ride batch between 10 and 10.30 am. They start issuing tickets for the ride around 8.45am. 15 mins before park opened.

Upon entry, we went left to the Amazon flooded forest to see the giant manatees and the piranhas. Great choice as we were among the first inside and had uninstructed view of the fishes in the tank. This turned out to be our favorite exhibit together with the pandas. The spider monkey enclosure was next. Those monkeys were really cute. We were done by 9.30 and went to wait for our boat ride. It was the right decision as a queue started forming around 9.35am.

We got into one of the first few boats. I was prepared for a boring ride after reading all the reviews. But as it was early, all the animals were active and the ride was pretty enjoyable.

After the ride, it was off to the panda enclosure. There is a queue here as they control the no of people into the enclosure. But it was a short wait about 10 mins only. The panda is very cute. Kai Kai was eating his bamboo! Jia Jia stayed indoors and never came out. Apparently she prefers to hide inside away from the crowds. I don't blame her.

After that we went to the mama panda kitchen for brunch. The panda buns very cute and quite nice but very ex. 5 of us spent close to $100. When we were eating, we notice the restaurant filling up by 11am. I guess it will be packed by noon.

When we were done eating, we notice the queue for the panda enclose has become extremely long. As we walked down to the Mekong River, Murray River, Ganges River, River Nile and Mississippi River exhibits, we notice the crowds getting bigger. Luckily the exhibits thereafter were mainly fishes so it was ok. Glad we were already done with the major attractions.

We left the park just before 11 noon. The crowd at the ticket queue at the zoo which sells both the zoo and river Safari tickets were horrendous! The queue for the River Quest ride was all the way to the side of the zoo. It is also very hot by noon time and I won't be surprise if some animals will be in hiding in the afternoon.

All in all an enjoyable visit. But I am sure it would have been less enjoyable if we had to wait in long lines and jostle with the crowd to see the exhibits. At $25 for adult and $16 for kids, it is pretty expensive considering that the park is significantly smaller than the zoo and night safari. We were done in 3 hrs from 9-12."
,,Oh well..,3.0,,"Visited RSS on Sat 21 Dec 2013.

Weekend crowd. Waited 1/2 hr in line for tickets... another 1/2 hr in line to see Kai Kai (Jia Jia no show) Another 1/2 hr for boat ride.
Very disappointed ...ride about 15 mins only....expecting river cruise but if you've been to USS n took the Madagascar ride, you get the picture.
Whole area approximately 1/4 of the Singapore Zoo.Saving grace is the covered walkway, shelter from rain & shine. The otter antics & gorgeous manatee in their giant tank...could have stayed there for hours if not for for the screaming children allowed by their insensitive parents to run around and treating the enclosed space as their playground:(
If you are animal lovers like us, would strongly recommend to spend the morning @ the Zoo then hop to River Safari after lunch for the full therapy. Put on good walking shoes and happy clicking for the perfect shot!!!"
,,An unpolished gem,4.0,,"River Safari is a very unique themed park – one that supposedly blends aquarium life with the excellent collection of animals that the world-class Singapore Zoo already possesses. While the theming of the park is easy to navigate and highly informative, the high price ($25 for now; $35 from next year onwards!) as compared to the existing Singapore Zoo, Bird Park and Night Safari, as well as the hyped-up marketing, seem to set high expectations for the park. Unfortunately, it left me pretty disappointed – 1) I was unable to access the much-talked about Amazon River Quest as they had stopped people from queuing as the estimate of the queue was 3 hours long; 2) the park was pretty small – I managed to view all the exhibits within 1.5 hours! Imagine that – methinks that even if you had viewed all the information panel and had taken an extremely leisurely pace, you would have completed the park in 3 hours anyway.

For more, see pictures and read my journal entry on: http://travellah.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/river-safari-an-unpolished-gem/."
,,Great way to kill a few hours,5.0,,"We had a morning to kill before a flight and decided to see the Panadas at the River Safari. A quick 15 minute $20 taxi ride later (from Orchard Rd) we were there.

Lots of fish and wildlife associated with rivers around the world. The manatees were a real surprise as were the giant otters.

Loved the spider monkeys

Sadly for us on panda was asleep and the other was in its den, so not much action there, but in can at least say I've seen a live panda.

Tickers cost $25 per adult and if you want to do the cruise you need to select a specific cruise at time of booking and when we were there it was booked 3 hrs in advance, so get there early. It's not essential to the experience though."
,,River Safari,3.0,,"This is by far the simplest park to walk through and see within the Singapore Zoological Gardens (Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari). Each section of the park has a theme based on different rivers around the world, from the Nile to Ganges and Yangtze, and many more. As the name implies, most of the creatures are mainly aquatic, with the exception of the pandas and monkeys. A little disappointed though with not being able to get on the Amazon boat ride as it was fully booked (on a Monday too!). The Amazon flooded forest section is definitely the best part of this park as it play host to the largest number of dugongs and manatees in Singapore. You can even see the interaction between these creatures and the divers during feeding time - it's quite a rare sight!"
,,Really well done and fairly unique.,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the River Safari experience and found the aquarium displays superior to those at The SEA aquarium on Sentosa ( thought lacking the colourful saltwater fishes). Comparing this attraction to the neighbouring zoo and night Safari is to do it a disservice. You won't be able to experience the same things at either of the other two. Also it's best to think of this as a River Habitat experience rather than any sort of Safari.

The boat ride adds little to the animal experience ( unlike the tram ride at the Night Safari) and seems to have been added to lend some credence to the ""Safari"" element in the attractions title. It was free when we did it, so no complaints, the the kids enjoyed the 'ride'.

The Pandas are another attraction though a tenuous link to a River! I felt that they would have been better off at the zoo, leaving the the River Safari for more waterborne creatures.

Most of the River Safari is covered or has covered walkways so it relatively rain friendly compared to the neighbouring attractions. Also the scenery and views of the natural surrounding is great. Not much in the way of dinning options with the the attractions but plenty by the main entrance nearer the zoo ( re entry is allowed). There were regular tours by park rangers who walked from one enclosure/ tank to another describing the fish, pointing out bits you might have missed and also presenting interesting facts about them. It's free to join and we found it added greatly to the experience.

We visited on a Friday during the School holidays, and purchased the 2 in 1 combined Zoo and River Safari tickets at 9 am and there was no queue to purchase tickets and we got the first time slot for the Boat ride too which was at 12 noon on this day. Purchasing tickets to two neighbouring attraction allowed us to pop between the 2 so we could catch the times shows and have something to do before the boat ride.

Fairly unique, we have never visited a river themed attraction before, it kept us all interested so it five stars from us."
,,Don't just go there for the pandas/boat ride,4.0,,"I visited the River Safari wondering if the pandas there were like the pandas at the San Diego Zoo (always sleeping), and yes, sadly, the one I saw was (I couldn't even see the other). That being said, there's a lot more to be seen than the pandas, despite how everything in the park seems to have been panda-fied.

For starters, if you like fishes and reptiles, the alligator gars and the snapping turtles are always delightful to see, especially if you managed to catch them during feeding hours, as are the various species of catfish. There are many other fishes, half of which I probably can't name, but they're mostly big and great to observe just swimming around. A couple of birds reside here and there, too, but it is a ""River"" safari and Singapore does have a Bird Park in another part of the island.

I honestly wasn't impressed by the pandas, but another inhabitant of the panda forest, the red pandas, provided loads of photo opportunities for visitors. They scurried around, lazed on the trees for a bit, generally ensuring that those visiting had at least some photos other than a sleeping giant panda's butt. There wasn't much of a queue when I went to the exhibit.

The Amazon River Quest Boat ride, on the other hand, had a ridiculously long queue. Even though we reached the River Safari just past 11am, the only available rides were at 4.30pm. The queue wasn't properly handled outside the attraction, where a show was taking place, so visitors got confused about the queue and some even jumped the line, leading to some frustrated bloke shouting at them (to no avail). After queueing outside, there was another queue on the inside as each ""boat"" could only take a certain number of passengers. I say ""boat"" because it is hardly a boat, it's more like a partially submerged amusement ride. Be careful with your expensive cameras, cause ride does accelerate downhill a bit, and water can splash inside. The ride took more than half an hour to queue for, but only lasted about 10 minutes. And you might not even get to see some of the animals as they might be sleeping/hiding. Quite a bummer.

The best part of the park, in my opinion, has to be Amazon Flooded Forest. The main attraction is the huge tank full of manatees happily swimming around together. I could spend hours just sitting there watching them.

One good thing about the River Safari is that there's pretty much shelter everywhere, unlike the zoo, so the only worry about wet weather is the availability of the Amazon River Quest ride. If you're going there to take photos, though, you might have to fight it out with legions of smartphone/camera-toting kids in front of the various exhibits. Hopefully it's just the local school holidays.

As some other reviewers have noted, it might be best to buy the tickets online so as to avoid having to queue at the attraction itself. Overall I'd give it 3.5 (a Good, not Very Good) but tripadvisor doesn't allow that. And I was impressed enough with the place to feel it deserved more than an average. If you're interested in going to the zoo, or other parks like the Night Safari/Jurong Bird Park, there's a special park-hopper package you can get which will help you save more than a couple of pretty pennies."
,,Pleasant but not amazing!,4.0,,"I visited on a Saturday so this attraction was very busy with locals. In typical Singapore style the place is immaculate and the exhibits are very well laid out with covered walkways taking you through different geographical river experiences. If you are not very interested in fish then this is probably not for you! However, there are some very cute creatures along the way including otters and of course the pandas. It was fantastic to see a panda so close, happily eating his bamboo oblivious to all people and cameras. I also enjoyed seeing the spider monkeys and the manatees. The river safari boat trip was not open when I was there so I cannot comment. Getting back to the city was interesting! There was a huge queue for taxis and when in the queue I was approached by a man who said he had a mini bus and would take me to the city for S$35 - about S$15 more than the taxi fare. There were several other tourists in the bus all paying S$35 so this driver did quite well from the trip. Although I felt a little ripped off we got back to the city quickly and I felt it was worth it as I was only in Singapore for a day and did not want to waste it in a queue."
,,River safari,4.0,,"River Safari is unique and nice place, the atmosphere is very nice, the scenery beautiful, Kai Kai and Jia Jia are very adorable, and the giant ""dugong"" aquarium also very entertaining, though it's not as what we expected as we saw in the advertising, since it's new, many fishes are still small and unfortunately we can't joint the boat because of too many visitor and they already reach maximum capacity, but overall it's one of must visit place while in Singapore."
,,Underwhelming attraction,3.0,,"Visited on a Monday during the school holidays, it's very packed. Fortunately I manage to avoid the queue by buying the tickets online. You need to proceed to the visitor services counter to book a boat ride slot else you can't ride at all.

The specimens on display were river creatures and frankly, it was underwhelming since the zoo is just next door. The pandas were a joy to watch and I think many found reprieve for the heat with the air conditioned enclosure.

The big issue I have is the lack of food eateries inside and the big loop you have to go round just to exit and eat at KFC outside. The panda themed cafe was super packed and definitely unable to handle the crowds. We had to back track through the Ganges, ,Mekong rivers enclosure to exit and have lunch. You will get what I mean by looking at the layout on the map.

The boat ride which was pretty hyped about was disappointing. It was very brief and the animals were having their naps during the afternoon. Save for a couple of gentle slopes and splashes, it's not worth queuing for. And I won't want to pay the full price ticket just to get onto the ride.

The things I like were the sheltered walkways, manatee enclosure and giant viewing tanks. There it's very elderly and stroller friendly."
,,River Safari,3.0,,"River Safari was not upto the expectaion. Comparatively zoo and night safari was much better than this. Only pandas was good and nothing more.... Boat ride was really very poor... Actually they said to us boat ride was booked fully and there is no vacancy but later when we enquired in the visitors information counter they gave us the tickets ???!!!! ........

In short river safari is not worth of spending or sight seeing......."
,,Waste of time and money,2.0,,"Visited the river safari seduced by the publicity. Queued up for 1 hour to be told that due to technical problems there would be a wait of at least another 2 hours. Decided to leave the queue and went to view the giant pandas. The enclosure is amazing, seeing the pandas so close with great photo opportunities. After viewing the pandas, we noticed that the queue for the river safari has gone down and was at last moving so decided to rejoin it. Queued for another 2 hours for an experience which was equal to a forth rate Disney ride. It lasted less than 5 minutes and was such a let down. IT REALLY IS NOT WORTH QUEUING FOR. You hardly get a glimpse of the animals."
,,Asia's first and only river-themed wildlife park,4.0,,"A new concept to see the wild life. Meet over 5,000 aquatic and terrestrial animals representing 300 species at this place. At River Safari, one can explore eight river habitats (Mississippi, Congo, Nile, Ganges, Murray, Mekong and Yangtze) and meet river giants and megafishes such as the giant river otter, giant salamander and the critically endangered Mekong giant catfish. Visit giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia (gift from China) at the lush Giant Panda Forest -the largest panda exhibit in Southeast Asia. Also sharing this climate-controlled bio dome are the rare red pandas and elegant golden pheasants. It is surprising to see white bear in ice cooled water pool through a glass window. Be amazed by the world's largest freshwater aquarium at the Amazon Flooded Forest along with Squirrel Monkey forest."
,,A lot to improve for the River Safari,1.0,,"As compared to Zoo and Night Safari, expectation is high for its sister and neighbor. But it will not be worth to spend the admission ticket price for the current situation at River Safari. Boat ride is yet to open and 35% of the site is yet to be opened with attractions. Hope this will be better by mid 2014?"
,,Unique but incomplete!,3.0,,"It was a great experience and the safari was well maintain clean with a beautiful lake. But too bad the amazon river quest boat ride has not operating till Dec'13.
Furthermore, me and my sis have a glimpse of polar bear from Singapore Zoo, and it has a huge aquarium that will attract you too!
But because of the boat ride has not open for public during my visit in Nov'13,so it's really a waste and i don't think i will go there again just for the ride."
,,The boat ride was an absolute waste of time!,1.0,,"My family and I went to the River Safari this morning and was told that the newly opened River Boat Ride would only starting at 12pm. So we took our time visiting other parts of the RS and like most kiashu Singaporeans, decided to go to the boat ride waiting area half an hour earlier to avoid the crowd. We were so wrong. By the time we reached there, there was already a long line of people waiting patiently there. It took slightly more than an hour before we could even see the 'boats'. Sitting in our 'boat', we imagined really going on a mini 'quest' (as coined by RS) and exploring realistic habitats of exotic animals... we were very disappointed. Most of the animals were so well camouflaged that we only managed to see some pink flamingoes and a green iguana.

The entire 'quest' took around ten minutes. Just before 'disembarking', our boat was left under the midday sun and we were baking under it. My mum took out an umbrella to shield us from the heat only to be told by an attendant to close it. Out of curiousity, I asked the 'friendly' attendant why umbrellas were not allowed at that moment. She gave me an impatient look and explained that the umbrella could injure the animals. I asked her if that meant even the umbrella was so small that it didn't extend outside of the personal space (note: we were already at the disembarkation area where there were no animals)? She responded with a rude ""yes"". Granted that we did not have to pay extra for the boat ride but this experience has convinced me never to visit this place again if I could help it."
,,A Very Unique Safari Zoo,4.0,,"Out of the three attractions(SEA Aquarium and Gardens by the Bay) that we visited in Singapore, the kids enjoyed River Safari the most, as the animals and fishes attractions are all based along the river theme, except for the Amazon River Quest Boat Ride. We had to waited for 2 hours for the boat, firstly due to the thunder and rain storm(45 minutes) and then technical breakdown (45 minutes) of the boats in which some visitors were trapped in their boats! The main attractions of the River Safari are the Red Pandas (very active!) and the two giant pandas, as usual they were sleeping in the day time, one in the open gardens and the other inside. By the pandas are housed in the own air-condition enclosure and makes a nice cool break in the hot and humid conditions of Singapore!"
,,"Ok, but make sure your kids are tall enough!",3.0,,"We visited the River Safari the same day we visited the Singapore Zoo.

When purchasing tickets, we asked at the counter if they could measure our youngest child to see if she would be tall enough to go on the boat ride (1.06m). The lady said that they didn't have anything to measure and we could only measure at the ride once we were inside. We took the risk, and she ended up being too short, so we had a very disappointed 4.5 year old and a parent that also missed out on the ride. This needs to be improved, particularly once they start charging more.

The panda attraction was great. One was asleep and the other quite active. The pathways were all undercover, which was great for shade on a hot day."
,,Land & sea creatures in one place,4.0,,"At the entrance of Amazon River Quest, guides warn you that the queue could take as long as an hour. We waited for about half an hour only. However, we had to hold on for another 1 1/2 hour for thunder & rain to subside. Then the earlier boat got stuck, so we got out of our boat & another hour is used to wait for technical fault to be fixed. The ride took about 10 minutes. Boat ride was a little fast for photo-taking. I had to alternate between protecting my phone from the splash & taking photos. About 3 low level splashes to be anticipated. The main highlight was seeing 2 jaguars tearing meat up for their meal. Rather gory for little toddlers to see red blood oozing out but this is often shown on National Geographic as well. Overall, the place reminds me of Australia's Sea World. Oh, we also chanced upon a live bat (not captive) in the cave for manatees & stingrays. This is definitely different from the zoo & Night Safari. They've got both land & sea creatures in here."
,,Great attratcion,5.0,,"You can't fault this place for a part of the grounds not being ready yet. What is open was great. Many animals that are not in the zoo. Yes just an extended zoo, but still very interesting. They house the famous pandas and red pandas. Recommend this place for all ages."
,,Nice but incomplete,3.0,,"This is a good attraction, but the river attraction was not ready, so the fee was discounted by S$10. Without the river attraction this is nothing more than a smaller zoo of river critters. Best part was seeing the Pandas,... the red Pandas were the best.

Would recommend waiting until the river attraction is ready before visiting here."
,,A new experience,4.0,,"The recently opened River Safari show cases the wildlife of several rivers such as the Mississippi River, Congo River, River Nile, Ganges River, Murray River, Mekong River and Yangtze River as well as Giant Panda Forest and Wild Amazonia.

The area is very much sheltered so in case of rain, you still can enjoy the attraction. The main attraction of this park is definitely the 2 Giant Panda - Kai Kai and Jia Jia. Try to be around during their feeding time at 12pm, and you will be treated with a view of these 2 much loved Pandas. However, depending on their moods, they may not be out to see you. So good luck!

The queuing time for the newly launched Amazon River Quest may take up to 90mins so be prepared to wait, though the trip lasted only 12 mins.

Come with a pair of good shoes (especially for the elderly) as it can quite a bit of walk around the park, there is no tram to move around the park."
,,Nothing more than a zoo,3.0,,"Repeating the same mistakes of the night safari, WRS management passed off this zoo as a safari, creating a fake safari. Anyone with common sense should know Singapore cannot have a safari, not to say two. What visitors would most likely want is just a simple zoo, not a safari! Creating the stupid boat ride, which nobody would appreciate is a great mistake. If you like long queues, a short boat ride, which lets you see very little, compared to a simple zoo with a proper walking trail, come here, if you prefer seeing some freshwater fishes and turtles more than seeing land animals, then come here, else go to the Singapore Zoo, you are better served there. The boat ride is not for the wheelchair bound or handicapped people but you pay the same fees anyway."
,,Boring..,2.0,,Not worth the value. Especially bringing kids below 1.06m. They are unable to ride on the Amazon river boat ride quest. And half of the animals can only be viewed via the boat ride. Theres no live exhibition but only info signs along the broadwalk.
,,great adventure,3.0,,"this new concept of river themed attraction is quite new and is a very good place to learn about the river and its ecosystem. animals are great but the tank is not decorative enough. it can be quite boring for teenager or adult that is not interested in animals. The design itself is phenomenal as they can bring visitors to the rivers of the world. the atmosphere really fits the area.

the show is not WRS quality.the show is the worst from the three other parks.

the amazon river quest is great. it really brings you the amazon river to Singapore. the presentation of the ride is great. it looks like the ride from universal studio. i think the amazon river quest should have more trees to make it look like the amazon. just one thing, in the jaguar enclosure, the glass should be clean to make the illusion of being face to face with the jaguar. the enclosure should be cleaned daily.

the giant panda forest is the best. it really recreate the bamboo forest. i just think it is too big for just 3 species of animals.

the zoo is nice but the park is so pricey. it cost a lot of money. the zoo is also small and it should be bigger."
,,Red Panda is so cute...,5.0,,"I love this river-themed safari park, there are many adorable animals such as red pandas, pandas, River otters, beavers, manatees and etc... nice place for family with kids, it is wonderful!"
,,Good place to learn about the major rivers in the world,4.0,,"The best thing about River Safari is that it is fully sheltered. Thus, you do not have to worry about wet weather.

The park is not very big and you will probably take 3 hours (depending on your speed) to visit the entire place. It is definitely worth visiting this place as you can learn about the various major rivers in the world.

Amazon River Quest is also ready though it is nothing spectacular about it."
,,"Best of the 4 ""animals/birds"" park in Singapore, IMO",4.0,,"Rate highly as I will re-visit even as a local. Best among the ""park hopper"" package of Zoo( big and comprehensive, but tiring, too hot when sunny or too wet when raining! haha), night safari (Too dark to see anything and part of the park can only be via a quick tram ride), Bird park (only birds and same problem like zoo being a outdoor park)...

River safari: Likes:-
- very well organised, u just follow the pathway and everything can be visited. Unlike the zoo where you need to decide which way to go to be more ""efficient"".
- ""weather-resistant"", it is mainly sheltered or indoor, so no worries for rain or shine!
- good mix of fishes, animals on land and water
- the river cruise boat ride is quite a good idea, with some gentle slopes to add to the thrill! (Do note that the boat ride is not officially opened yet, I happen to chance upon a trial run, should be opening soon)
- the finale of the big aquarium with giant Manatees is well placed, good resting air-conditioned area.

Cons: - it's a bit small, probably can be covered in less than 2hours.
- more animals or exhibits should be added
- parking at the area is too expensive!!"
,,a big disappointment,3.0,,went to see the river safari as it was the latest attraction in singapore and was disappointed as it had the giant pandas and a anaconda only other than the zoo-the amazon cruise was not operating
,,"Nice ""All weather"" Zoo/Park",4.0,,"When we booked our ticket which was a park hopper for both river safari and Night safari, the website already warned that the River cruise ride was not yet operational so the tickets were discounted. So that was not a surprise to us. The kids actually enjoyed the River Safari, because it included not only fishes and animals but also some amphibians and insects as well.

Everyone agree that the Panda display was one of the highlights, and even my toddler got excited when she saw the panda. My two other kids were so excited to see the Red Panda as well. After the Panda Exhibit, there was a big window/Aquarium which showed a big Polar bear, which wasn't in the map, might be a part of another zoo that was shared, but it was a hoot to see the polar bear swim, the kids said they enjoyed that as well. We also loved the Manatee aquarium, spent quite a lot of time there as well, first time for us to see these cute creatures, we even got to see them being fed.

As per the Title, I think that of all the attractions in Singapore that we visited this trip, this was one of the best ""All weather"" zoo, with the walkways all covered, allowing us to keep dry even when the rain was pouring badly that we almost can't see the other side of the park. The River cruise might not be protected from Rain though, so during downpours the river cruise might get stopped (when it becomes operational) but hey I might be wrong and the boats might have roofs! (TRIP ADVISOR should have an ""All weather"" rating so that reviewers can rate how good or bad a park is from inclement weather). If there is, I'd rate River safari as Excellent.

I highly recommend that you book to go to River safari in the afternoon, and time it so that when you finish, you go to Night safari and have dinner in their restaurants to wait for the 7pm opening time. This would time and cost effective, coz you save on transport cost as well as not need to go back in the same place to see the other on another day. Heck I'd say plan to get to river safari by 3 or 4pm and finish by 6pm then transfer to Night safari."
,,"Its open, but not ready to be opened",2.0,,"We went to the Singapore Zoo, and decided to see the new ""River Safari"" attraction for a change. This was a mistake, because they have opened the site without finishing it! One ends up walking down a covered path with fish tanks on either side, ending at the Panda enclosure. And less face it, Panda's are only interesting because the Chinese have practically exterminated them. The River Cruise, representing over half the park, is not open. And even when it is, I suspect it will not be as good as Jungle Cruise in Disneyland. We tried to make the best of it, after paying $25 per adult for a ticket, but this place is basically a rip-off. One is much better off and happier staying with the Zoo (only $22 per adult)."
,,Worth a visit once fully operational,3.0,,"Pandas are the highlight of the river safari! Won't be worth visiting until fully operational, slightly disappointing visit because of this..."
,,Average Experience :(,3.0,,"Boat was not operational when we went there. We did not find anything really new after spending 3-4 hours earlier in the Zoo. Pandas were, I think the only saving grace for River Safari. We saw only one Panda & he too was sleeping. He looked pale & weak (contrary to the photos shown). Probably it will be a different experience while riding on the boat. Otherwise very average !!"
,,Wait for river quest to open,3.0,,"Once the river quest is open I believe it will be much better. The walk-through each river sone is really short. The Giant Panda house is a great air-conditioned relief from the heat and amazing to see the panda's. The flooded amazon part is huge and on the back of the river quest section will be even better.
Hold off until the river quest is open. If we are back in Singapore some day we might go again for the river quest.
We came here after the zoo and went through it quite quickly, not many people either and no queueing/booking to see the pandas."
,,So so experience,3.0,,"Ok I went before the river cruise was up and running, so I can't comment on any river experience. The big fish and sea manatees were a real treat to see! However I must say the panda enclosure is a real disappointment. Seeing what my taxpayers money paid 2million for, one would think that we could at least have a good view of a lazy panda. the enclosure was seriously too small for anyones comfort, ppl were pushing, shoving n trying to take pics of an overpriced panda. i wonder if the panda feels bad for all the money spent on them that couldve been used feeding hungry children etc. really not worth the visit if the pandas were what u wanted to see. there was no talks/shows/presentations etc. the enclosure with the large crocodiles were so murky u could only see the croc if u put ur head in its mouth. n its supposed to be newly built. i saw much larger crocs in australia. really hope they clean it up at least else someone is bound to get too close."
,,not finished but worth a visit,4.0,,We enjoyed our visit to the park which we did following the zoo as the properties are adjoining. We loved the pandas and the walk through aquarium. Areas of the park are still under construction and the boat ride isn't operating as yet. I recommend purchasing tickets online as we did. You save money and don't have to queue up for entry. We took a taxi from our hotel and had a short wait when we left for another taxi back. Overall it's well worth a visit along with the zoo and once the next stages are operating would be a awesome day out. Loved it (especially the pandas)!
,,Highlights!,4.0,,"To be fair, this place is well mapped. I had a great time, it shows you history of great rivers. well just like the title, highlights!... 1. River Monsters 2. Panda 3. squirrel monkeys"
,,Shoild be good when fully open,4.0,,"It's a bit unfair and premature to be writing a report on an attraction that is not fully up and running. All the publicity material features images of happy and excited visitors in boats. The reality is different. There are no boats. Obviously the Zoo management have decided to open the attraction with only 80% of the display functioning (October 2013). Perhaps, in order to compensate, they have included two pandas in the tour.

The River Safari was very devoid of visitors on the day we were there. As we do not like crowds, this was a good thing for us but should have been worrying for management - maybe it's busier at weekends?

The safari consists of a linked route through thematically related displays of aquaria and animal compounds. The thematic link was the great river systems of the world (Europe excluded).
The first few displays seemed unimpressive but slowly the experience began to improve with increasing levels of display standard as one moved through the sequence.

We'd really not been too excited by the prospect of seeing pandas but quickly warmed to seeing these adorable animals going about their routine of eating bamboo like charming, animated plush toys. It all happened right in front of us and seemed so natural and captivating. We were very quickly won over and must have spent over half an hour watching and filming. Excellent and most enjoyable.

Moving onwards, we visited the spider monkeys. The novelty here was that we went into the monkey's enclosure. They were all around us and were fast and agile in their activities. Some came to within a metre or less and it was an intense experience.

Finally we were enormously impressed with the dugong exhibit where these graceful aqua-ballerinas floated effortlessly in a vast tank.

Although it was raining when we arrived, the entire River Safari is under cover. It also keeps you out of the heat of the sun.

Overall, whilst we were disappointed that the Amazon section was not fully open, the experience was good - so good that we were nearly late for our bus back to town. This was mainly due to the pandas. Overall a most enjoyable visit.

Just how long the River Safari can survive without its headline promise is a big question but knowing the Singapore drive for efficiency and perfection, I'm sure that it will all be sorted quickly and will become a top attraction."
,,Fruitful walk with good mixture of indoor and outdoor,4.0,,"Located at out skirt of town, but however it is easily accessible by using bus or train, taking the bus will be much more economical and as public transport in Singapore does not require one to wait for long time, it is totally acceptable to use the bus as a mean of transportation. Upon arrival, we are bombarded with long queue from other tourist, purchase your ticket earlier give you an advantage, you may purchase your ticket here: http://www.riversafari.com.sg and trust me, you don't want to wait under the hot sun.

The river safari offer a fascinating walk, giving us good combination of outdoor and indoor walk, each offering different wild life experience. From the outdoor, front we are offered a range of wild life including monkeys, lizard, alligators and some birds. While for indoor, you get to see lot of fishes and some are real big fish, really big fish. The explanation and information displayed give us a good read on what the animals name is, and what they feed on, indoor had a good air conditioning system, it gives you the cold comfort as you walk, spending two hour is quite normal if you take your time to walk and look around.

In between you can see the giant panda too, named kai kai and jia jia. Both are asleep most of the time, thus if you see them moving when you visit them, it is a lucky day for you. The panda reside inside a air condition room with some birds around, so it is never boring with only one animal at one time. There is a restaurant using the panda as a theme, and there is a ""Pao"" labelled as must try, but it is not special at all, just a normal ""Pao"" with some red bean paste.

Transportation out of the safari is quite difficult even with taxi as there are long queue again, thus taking the bus again might be a better choice since both are going to wait anyway."
,,"When it is finished, this place will be awesome",5.0,,"The River Safari may have not been finished yet, but judging by what I saw, it is already awesome. My favourite part was seeing Kai Kai and Jia Jia in their spacious and beautiful enclosure along with red pandas and golden pheasants. I also loved the Mekong River Area as well as the Amazon flooded Forest. Can't wait to see the River Quest. So excited."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"We were not sure if this would be a good attraction because we haven't heard much about it before. Our 7-year old son is a great fan of Jeremy Wade and the River Monster show so he insisted that we go. It turned out to be a great place and the whole family had a great time.

The place was nicely layed out with most areas shaded. It makes it bearable even in the middle of a sunny day.

Major rivers and the many special fresh water fish, reptiles and amphibians from each part of the world are represented. Unless you are an expert in the field which you may find the explanations to the exhibits superficial, most people should find the information provided educational and easy to understand.

The pandas seem a bit out of place in the River Safari. But it was nice to go through the air conditioned room. We saw one of the pandas very close up and took great photos.

The place is not big so if we stroll along in a normal pace, you probably finish in a bit more than an hour. But since our kid is a great fans of fresh water fish and he has read a lot about them before, this place was amazing for him. He said he liked it a lot more than the night safari. I can understand some people may find it not so interesting. Afterall fresh water fish are not as colorful and eye catching."
,,underwhelming!,3.0,,The place doesnt match up to the promo that the place gets on the net ...the Sea Cows saved the day ....else it was a boring walk through the different river themes that are created out here....there is a amzon river sections that is still to be opened to public...hope that adds some punch to the place...there are a couple of pandas on show...hmm...well my tip is ..when you plan for the singapore zoo /night safari trip...squeeze this is on the same day if time permits...not worth spending another day just for the river safari...
,,Half baked,3.0,,"Yet to fully get operational till the end of this year. hence not much of a thing to see. More of repeats.

Their major attraction are the 2 pandas, but this cannot be the only point to spend money and see the place.

If you are still interested than for your information the panda enclosure closes at 5.15 and the park max by 6."
,,Good arrangements of animals and fishes in accordance with famous rivers round the world,4.0,,My family went to River Safari recently and enjoyed it very much. The big fish enclosures where all kinds of fishes can swim freely is simply amazing! I have been to Queensland recently and have seen their displays and they are no match! We like the way the exhibits are displayed and found it very educational! It is a pity that the Amazon River cruise is not ready. I will definitely go again when it is ready!
,,Excellent adjunct to Singapore Wildlife attractions ......,5.0,,"We REALLY enjoyed this attraction even though it is still the ""soft opening period"". It will be interesting to see how crowded and noisy it gets once all the attractions and river cruise are in place .... for once we did not emerge from a ""zoo"" exhausted by the heat and crowds.... the exhibits were excellent - you could see the creatures really close up and the information was helpful. I have not really focussed on freshwater creatures before. It is all covered too which makes for a much more comfortable experience. The Indian Gharial was pretty impressive and the squirrel monkeys took a real interest in my daughter's red toenails! The highlight for me were the manatees - we were lucky to catch the feeding sessions - both underwater and on the surface - one baby manatee seemed to be ""hugging"" the diver ... wonderful animals.... the Panda forest is good - loved the red pandas - fine healthy looking exhibits ... only saw one of the giant pandas as the other is rather shy! I was not keen on the cartoonisation/branding of the pandas but I am an old fuddy-duddy! Will definitely come again ....."
,,It could be good if it is open 100%,3.0,,"By the time we go there is almost same when we go there previously..

Panda is the 1st and a must see in this river safari
Plus some aquarium contain fish, aligator and some animals..

The boat not yet in operation..

Panda Bao is must try item here.. Is a panda head steamed bun with red bean filling.. so yummy.."
,,Pandas saved the day!,3.0,,"Deceived by the brochures showing boats filled with visitors passing through a river lined with freshwater creatures large and small, I wasted time and money on the River Safari. The boats were non-existent and the creatures were all in tanks and enclosures.

I must say that the displays were attractive.

I did see the Giant Panda and the lovely red pandas, and that was some compensation."
,,Disappointing and expensive,3.0,,Not fully completed yet. So quite expensive and disappointing. Better go to the new Aquarium at Sentosa or focus on the Zoo or Night Safari.
,,Above average but not excellance,4.0,,"Compound is not as big as I had expected. It's still on it's soft launch phase, another 1/3 of animals have not been exhibited. Looking forward to the increase of collection of animals living around the river. Good concept river theme park anyway."
,,Average Visit,3.0,,"Park is not completed yet as the river boat isn't available till later this year. Not many collection. Highlight is the Panda, but seemed rather lonely."
,,Want to see more types of fish,4.0,,"I thought I could watch many types of fish here but perhaps it was in construction so that there were a few kinds of fish. But the other animals made me interesting. Particularly the cute and giant panda.
The attraction was a very good outdoor scenery and nature reserve. This place was in good condition and kept clean well.
I wish they had finish the whole place so that I could be more enjoyable.
I think I will be back!"
,,Good although not completed,3.0,,"We went there in April this year, but they hadn't actually completed the actual river safari portion of the place, which takes about 1/3 third of the place. But the other exhibits were open, and its more like a hybrid between an aquarium and a panda zoo, although only two normal pandas. Luckily they discounted the price, the map of the place and the way they set it up is quite nice actually

I will definitely go back when the finish the river safari portion"
,,Good outdoor scenery,3.0,,"The attraction has very good outdoor scenery especially the nature reserves, the forest and the swamps. However, not many exotic fish were seen up close. Some of which were placed in a big tank and the fish were faraway from the people. Liked some of the sectors which have aircons. When the river boat quest opens, hope is a better improved place of interest."
,,Still work-in-progress!,2.0,,"This is my first visit to River Safari (10 Oct. 2013). The Amazon River Quest boat ride and animal exhibits along this ride is only ready at later part of the year, as stated in the map.

On the whole, I was underwhelm. Other then the Panda Enclosure, the whole park is more of a work-in-progress! 2 Red Pandas were around during our visit, but for Giant Panda, only Kai Kai was around (and appeared bore!). Jai Jai was sleeping in her dent. The enclosure is cool and appear comfortable for the animals.

The park suffer from identity crisis of whether it's a zoo or an aquarium! At the moment, it's definitely have more fish then animal! Yet, even the fish are not exactly enough, which make the park very boring! Many tanks are empty or with few fishes, as compare to SEA Aquarium in Resort World Sentosa, which are fill with fishes!

The few exhibits I like other then the Pandas, are the Golden-headed Lion Tamarin (very lively bunch of animals) and the Squirrel Monkey Forest, which the adorable monkeys running and playing around us! Cute!

At S$25/pax (Discount price as the boat ride is not ready!), I feel it's a little bit overpriced! S$15 is more like it. Better go to the zoo next door! In fact, I think it should be co-operated as part of the zoo instead of a separate attraction!"
,,Great when it is will be finished,3.0,,"We enjoyed our visit but it will be great when it is finished and you can go on the boat cruise through the Amazon.

The first part (before the pandas) was a little disappointing. I wasn't particularly impressed by all the different rivers of the world which only really had 2-3 aquariums for each river with a couple of river animals/reptiles/fish per tank. The pandas were nice but one was hiding as very shy. The other was gorgeous but a bit sad to see such a spectacular animal in a relatively small enclosure. Once we crossed the bridge we got a bit of a look at the Amazon exhibit but the boat ride is not operational until the end of the year. Our kids really loved the Squirrel Monkey enclosure that you get to walk through. They loved the monkeys jumping and playing around them as we walked through. Worth a visit but not as impressive as Singapore Zoo (next door) or Jurong Bird Park."
,,Not impactful.,3.0,,"Visited the River Safari due to free pass. I think it isn't really worth it, unless you are a marine life enthusiast.

Since the river cruise is not operational yet, there were basically just many exhibits of marine creatures to watch. It gets boring after a while seeing these marine creatures. Because all they do is just, swimming around in their enclosures.

For now, I guess the giant pandas and red pandas are the only ones that are worth visiting. It's nice to see them rather close up in their own space eating, and hanging around. However, their enclosures seem too small for them to wander around. The pandas don't really seem happy and comfortable. They prefer to hide behind the leaves to facing the crowd. The pandas' butts were facing the crowd most of the time.

In conclusion, it was not an impactful or memorable visit to me. I would not think of going back again."
,,Pandas!,4.0,,"The entry fee is worth paying just to see the Pandas - they were lovely to see close up in their enclosures eating and eating and sleeping! This is a new attraction - the river section was not open at time of visit but the entrance price is reduced, hence the 4 star rating. Its still worth visiting to also see the aquarium and other wildlife though and the walk around the park and across the lake is lovely."
,,Good for all kinds of weather!,5.0,,"I am a friend of the Singapore Zoo, so I wasn't too keen on paying extra for tickets to the River Safari. It's not cheap, but I dare say well worth the money. Some observations that might be helpful:

1. The Amazonia quest boat ride is not ready yet. If you can wait, wait till that is ready (end of 2013?) to get full value for your dollar. (Tickets are now discounted though, to make up for that)

2. All walkways are fully sheltered. It's a great place to visit even in the monsoon season. In fact, it might be better in the rain, given our recent hot weather.

3. The main attractions - the panda exhibit and the flooded amazon forest are indoors and air conditioned. Wow. The pandas are the closest I have ever seen, and both Kai Kai and Jia Jia were feeding and active when I went at noon. Fantastic. There are seating areas in the flooded amazon forest and make for great manatee viewing. V comfy, cool and nice. And the manatees don't disappoint. We had one pooping (sounds gross but hey, that's Mother Nature) and lots swimming around. :)

4. Need to eat? The panda tea house is the only one inside the park. the other one is outside the safari entrance. Both eateries are pretty small and get loooong lines at lunchtime. You might be better timing your visit so you eat before or after at the eateries outside the main zoo area. The pizza place does pizza by slice AND sandwiches that are great for kids and taste quite decent. The coffee shop will sell cups of fruit. :)"
,,Panda is the only attraction,3.0,,"Agreed that it is a good attraction for kids. Pandas are the only reason why I brought my family to this place. For the price which pretty much similar to what they offer for Zoo, it is better to go Zoo. I would not visit any time soon unless more fun activities and attractions to be added. I notice the river cruise/ ride is not available yet. You may want to try the panda bun made of red bean paste which was quite cute and nice."
,,Very interesting and good for kids,4.0,,"Its opposite to the singapore Zoo. Now what you see in singapore Zoo are things you'd see almost in every other zoo, but with the river Safari you;d see the water wildlife in a manner I have't seen most aquariums do."
,,Giant Pandas,5.0,,"The star attractions at the River Safari are the giant pandas and red pandas. Located next to Singapore Zoo. Great for a look close-up of these animals (close as can be). They are star attractions here, and easy to see why. Comfortable viewing too, since they are housed in a cool climate house. The red pandas are almost within reach and are a real sight to behold. This is an attraction that should not be missed."
,,A MUST SEE ATTRACTION,5.0,,River safari is one of the newest attraction in Singapore co-located with the zoo and night safari. Although some of it is not yet open but shows life around some of the famous rivers of the world specially the flora and fauna. It has been laid out in a beautiful way to fit into the natural surrounding. Whole day can be spent to see the nature by combining this visit with the zoo & the night safari.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,This is well worth a visit in combination with a trip to the zoo (next door). As some of it is not open you get a discount - good idea to get a combo ticket with the zoo. Like everything in Singapore it is well organised and clean. I felt the animals looked healthy which is a good sign. A guide took a small group of us around and gave us a chance to get up close and personal with a number of (small!) animals. The manatees and pandas are sooo cute. When you come in just keep your eyes and ears open to catch a guide.
,,Get the view of many famous rivers..,5.0,,Good place to visit with family...kids would feel happy to see different type of fishes. We could see the Pandas as well...which is rare to see elsewhere .
,,Not fully open but liked what was available,4.0,,"Visited in September with the price reduced to $25 as some of the park was not yet open. We actually purchased a ticket for the river safari and the zoo to make a full day of it.

Took about two hours to visit the park. Panda enclosure was good and there was plenty of river life on how.

Overall, well priced and well worth a trip; perhaps coinciding with a visit to the zoo or night zoo."
,,Worth it if you're set on seeing a panda,2.0,,"I had high hopes for the River Safari. Unfortunately, the experience hasn't lived up to my expectation. The ride portion isn't open yet. Once it does open children have to be at least 3 years old to ride. The highlight is the Giant Panda Forest. However, this closes before the rest of the park. The day I was there it closed at 5:30 and the park at 6. It's at the back of the park so plan accordingly if you're going later in the day. As much as we enjoy this part of the park I still can't get over the value for the money, especially when compared with the zoo. Perhaps I just enjoy colorful fish and therefore prefer the SEA Aquarium."
,,Disappointing... wait until river safari boat ride is operational.,3.0,,"We visited the River Safari as part of its soft opening and were sorely disappointed. We were aware that the river safari boat ride will only be operational at the end of this year, but we were not expecting the dearth of exhibits and animals, a large chunk of which are not yet open to the public. A series of water enclosures with various forms of marine life from rivers around the world are open. However, my 7-year old twins couldn't help but exclaim that the Underwater World and SEA Aquarium were much prettier and more enjoyable! They did enjoy the red pandas and panda bears in the Giant Panda Forest, but this wasn't enough to redeem the park in my kids' eyes. I intend to wait till the entire park is open before venturing there again."
,,To be avoided,1.0,,"I visited the new River Safari attraction as part of a company function. Having visited the Night Safari I was optimistic as to what would be in store. I was especially interested in seeing the pandas. First, the good things: the panda enclosure was done well. It was a joy to see the red pandas and we even managed to glance one of the two pandas. Pity that you had to walk through the tacky gift shop as you exited. Many of the acquariums were also very interesting though you could do better at one of the other two acquariums in the city. The rest of the attraction was non descript. That is until you get to the polar bear. I don't know whose idea it is to put an animal that usually lives in sub-zero temperatures in a tropical environment where the minimum temperature is 25 degrees centigrade. The sight of this wonderful giant in a pathetically small pool made me disgusted at the whole effort made here. I will not be going back and I would recommend anyone who cares for animal welfare to avoid this place."
,,Educational Trip,3.0,,"It was well presented and very educational.
It's sad to see the pandas, they were in good condition and eating very well based on the displayed nutritional diet, they have a big enough enclosure...but they don't belong there, they should be in a sanctuary. While watching them you can't help but feel that it's just wrong.
The facilities are clean and spacious.
It was a nice journey through the different rivers of the world."
,,Getting Better as it approaches completion,4.0,,"Its understandable why some people are disappointed in the River Safari as it is a work in progress. If you know this in advance then you can enjoy the extensive collection of fish and mammals from the worlds rivers which is the major design theme of the River Safari - with the obvious exception of the highly publicized pandas from China.

The best, and most economical, way to visit this is with a Park Hopper Pass. We chose the 3 in 1 Park Hopper with the Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Zoo and River Safari. At S$ 59 per adult the pass is a great value and effectively gives you entrance to the River Safari for S$ 17 if you were to purchase tickets separately. For parents with children the discounted ticket may be worth the price to see the pandas.

I very much enjoyed the journey through the world rivers and expect it to be even more interesting when it is fully operational. If you have already been to SEA then you may wish to bypass this until complete. We visited both the Underwater World and SEA and still enjoyed this as there is always more to learn."
,,Impressive - even if not finished yet,4.0,,"When we visited the park in August 2013 it was not completely finished, so parts were not accessible. But anyhow the aquariums and shows are very nice and impressive and we loved - of course - the Manates most."
,,Only if you really like fish and aquariums,3.0,,"This park is sheltered all the way and you can still visit on a rainy day. However, it can get very crowded on weekends.

Exhibits are well maintained with lots of information. But you can complete the whole tour within Max 90mins (since almost 1/3 not opened yet).

Pandas are over rated. It was actually quite sad to see them being exhibited in a small area with lots of people taking photos of them. The pandas looked uncomfortable/scared.

I won't recommend this unless you have a free pass. Sea aquarium at sentosa is more worth it."
,,It's a let-down,3.0,,"Nothing much to expect, it's just another aquarium but accompanied with two famous panda from China.

If this place is part of Zoological Garden, it's worth while....but to charge another fee for a new attraction, it's not worth it!

The entrance fee is too costly for what you get to see. I rather go to SEA Aquarium in Sentosa.

Never to return unless I got free pass."
,,"I love the male panda,Kai Kai.beautiful and a lot of fresh water fishes.",4.0,,"U must try it!i love the fishes that they put there.Pzzzzttt,be quite when once u enter the place of Kai Kai and Jia Jia!u will find Kai Kai(the male panda) alwaz eating or sleeping.but not for the female panda,she like to stay alone in her ""room"",u can see thru the CcTV that they put in her room.
if u can see her outside..means u r soooo lucky!i was shock once I enter the lil forest where is the pandas lives there,u can see directly what are they doing at the moment,without any wall,even glass wall!!feels like u r into it!"
,,Cool Place To Be,5.0,,"Liked everything and the flora and fauna were superb. They have put together a bouquet of animals in a setting that would make some other countries in the region blush. When the river cruise actually opens out, it will be one great place to visit again and again."
,,Giant Aquarium,5.0,,"2nd outing and still feel that it's a giant aquarium with panda outing. Panda viewing is quite packed even on off peak days, but was a joy to see pandas.
The giant fish tanks makes me want to rebuild my home aquarium and I wish that I could have a reservoir behind my home so that I can always get fresh water."
,,Better than expected,4.0,,"I thoughts the pandas are the main attraction . Turns out that there were an excuse to make use of the natural reservoirs around the vicinity to a 'river safari' .
I had little expectation when I visited. But I found myself learning about the different rivers in the world. The setup around the reservoir is v scenic . Such views are not common in a busy city like Singapore . I was enchanted by the big aquarium with the manatees - sunlight filtering through and the low and unobtrusive sound of ocean
waves in the background ..
Oh yes - the pandas were there too !"
,,not River safari but an Aquarium safari,2.0,,"we have always admired the way the Singapore Zoo had operated. and particularly the Night Safari . visiting a zoo at night is just so different. and gave us a genuinely different experience.
so when we signed up for their River safari, we were expecting a surprising twist .

we were severely disappointed. when we booked for the river safari, we were told that for part of the tour was not available i.e. the boat ride through the Amazon. okay they were up front with us on that.
and we were given a discount for the minor inconvenience.

however what then remained of the River safari was nothing like we had expected.

it turned out to be a walk in a covered walkway, looking at an Aquarium . with lots of fishes in many tanks. some of the tanks were of course pretty huge. but nonetheless it would been better to call it the Aqaurium safari

adding a short boat ride and seeing animals in a faux pau Amazon wouldnt compensate for the disappointment of the long walk through the Aquarium.

i will try to visit again once the boat ride is available and to see if my original comments and impressions are correct."
,,Good to visit,5.0,,"This is pretty new and worth for a visit specially with kid, is like a small zoo and you can visit the Panda too. Normally people combine this with the night safai. You can get a 15% discount if you purchase ticket from the tourist centre."
,,Visit only when it's fully opened.,3.0,,"Don't waste your time here! It is not fully ready yet. It's like visiting the sea aquarium except that this place is non aircond. Spent around 2 hours max. If you have time, visit the zoo or the night safari and come back only when it's opened.

Tips:
1. Not crowded. So don't have to come early.
2. Bring water and snacks, drinks are expensive.
3. Visit the panda enclosure, it's a nice place to cool down besides looking at the cute pandas.
4. Located 2 mins walk from the Singapore zoo. Combine river safari with the zoo.

Hope it helps."
,,Good walk in the safari,5.0,,"This is the only attraction I wanted to come before my arrival this time. The place is stiuated in the north side of the island and the surrounding is still remain the same as 10 years old, quiet and pleasant, especially after seeing so much changes for the country over the week. The selection of creatures is well done. I like how it divides by region. The description is informative too. I guess the only comment I have is, I was quite disappointed when being told that the Amazon River ride and half of this region is not ready until end of the year. I didn't see any detail on the website before. Only later I heard, you need to click inside the map in order to know the detail. They should include this vital information on the front page of the website. I would still come and be prepared without any disappointment. In addition, if you want to use the locker, please prepare three $1 coin. The staff at the service counter might need further training in the customer service skill. Last but not less, I was thrilled to be able to see the polar bear!"
,,"Brilliant, If not better than the zoo!!!",5.0,,"We loved this place, located next door to the zoo. We visited before we went in the zoo. It's immaculate, well designed. Even though the boat ride wasn't open yet, it didn't detract anything from our visit. It's mostly under covered walkways, so nice and shaded. The animals on show were great to see, especially the panda exhibit. Nothing like Edinburgh's terrible exhibit! It takes about two/three hours to walk around. We would definitley visit again!"
,,River Safari - Not quite ready and not a safari experience,3.0,,"It was entirely reasonable to have high expectations of River Safari. After all, Singapore has had a reputable world-class zoo for a long long time. To have opened the place when only half the place is ready is surprising. I really can't recall a tourist attraction in Singapore that was open when half of it was not done up.
Yes, it is located at a river but a safari experience it is not.
Instead you will see tanks and tanks of fish. Actually when I was looking at the manatee theatre-like tank, I can be forgiven when for a while I thought I was at the S.E.A aquarium of Sentosa.
There is something in the design of the place that I just find disappointing- it is just boring and not exciting, despite the tremendous potential the location offers, being located at a nature reserve area. Considering Singapore always gets the best brains to do things, this attraction can be a letdown especially for discerning visitors. Seriously, even the souvenir store within the park wasn't inspiring, to say the least.
So, expect to see a good exhibit of cute Kai Kai and Jia Jia and you won't be disappointed (come in the morning coz they are active in the morning) but the panda enclosure is not as big as I had expected. I can imagine mayhem if you come during the holidays and cannot have a proper look.
Seriously, we were out of the place in one hour.
If you are thinking of taking your overseas friends to River Safari, you might have to apologise for the less-than-satisfactory experience, so think twice especially if they have seen pandas before. They will have a better experience at the main zoo or even the Night Safari.
Tip 1 : Arrive by 8.50am at least coz there is a queue to buy ticket
Tip 2 : Bring your own food because the food outlets within the park are not quite ready"
,,Hot ! Hot ! Hot !,3.0,,"A present or was there to introduce some rare animal, fishes around 3pm, along the animal watching, it's only a warm wind blowing, we were all sweating like sitting in a sauna room until we got to watch panda, in air cond room, many refuse to move around as it's too warm, young children got pinkish cheeck, and adult seem to look very tiring.

Got to enjoy panda bun in the restaurant next to panda show, along the walk way before reaching panda showroom, I don't see a drink vending machine along.

No river boat and animal along to show that how we gotnamdiscounted ticket price"
,,Pandas!,5.0,,"While the park is not fully completed yet (the Amazon River ride is still not open), the reduced entry fee (25$ instead of 35$) seems worthit for the Pandas. Go early in the morning, and you can (like us) spend hours watching these fascinating creatures eat, and pace around. What we did was skip everything,and head for the Panda Enclosure once we got in, then back track to take in the rest of the park. The rest of the part of also quite well done - it's also mostly shaded, so you are out of the elements if it rains. The Panda themed restaurant is expensive, but worth the visit for the Panda Pau - food was decent as well. The Panda exhibit was considerably better thought out than the San Diego Zoo equivalent, and larger. It's also fully climate controlled, which in Singapore is a godsend :) Woth a visit if you are a Panda fan, and want to see them up close and in action."
,,A very place to visit,4.0,,"I visited River Safari on a Singapore public holiday with my 3 year old son. This was my first visit after purchasing an annual pass. As I am local and will visit it again, I just want to look over at the various attractions.

One of my first advice to visitors is to go very early in the morning if it is a long weekend due to a Singapore holiday. The car park was full at around 11:30am. And there were long traffic jams all the way from the attractions to Mandai Road (about 1km away) as the incoming cars cannot get to a car park. the taxis and buses are also trapped in the same jam.

Since we were there at around 11am, we are able to take one of the last parking lots. There were very long lines at the ticket counters. Luckily, we have an annual pass and breeze right in through the gates.

One of my observations is that there is a lot of 'water' related attractions, seems to compete with the Sentosa underwater world? Also, I noticed that the area is almost completely covered. As such, visits there are not vulnerable to bad whether. There was a bridge over a body of water. I really like that walk, felt so immersed in nature and it was also cooling as there is shelter from the sun and a light breeze.

The star attraction is the Giant Panda. This attraction is air-conditioned and was in a very good temperature. There was also an enclosure with two/three red pandas (they look like raccoons but red in color). I noticed that these red pandas seems so healthy and clean. They were also very active and was running all over and climbing the trees and branches. There was a branch overlooking the pathway for visitors. As such, you can actually look up and see the red panda walking above you. I thought it was pretty neat.

After the red Panda, we saw the two Giant Panda. There were quite a few visitors and I guess the visitors have to take turns. One of them Jia Jia, was pretty lethargic when I was there and there were fewer visitors.

The other Panda Kai Kai was very active and was walking around his enclosure. There was a small pool of water and we saw Kai Kai 'taking a bath'. Everyone went ""ooohhhh"" when Kai Kai shaked off the water (like a dog).

I like the fact that the people who designed the enclosure eliminate the need for any visible boundaries between panda and visitors. There was no metal bars or glass panels. The Pandas felt very close and the visit was very intimate. I felt almost as if I am paying them a visit rather than looking at a display.

I left right after this. I will come back again to look at the displays in more detail and to pay the Pandas another visit."
,,Good visit to see the pandas,4.0,,"My sole purpose in making a trip down to River Safari is to see the pandas. Unlike the zoo, I felt the place was better positioned around the lake which gave the place a tranquil vibe. Other then that, the exhibits of sea creatures were pretty interesting and there were lots of air-conditioning (unlike the zoo). The enclosed full length area of the manatees resembled much of the one at Resorts World Sentosa.

Disappointed that only Kai Kai was out to entertain and Jia Jia as in her private quarters. Went back twice during the visit to see if Jia Jia came out but the second visit proved fruitless. Oh well.

Recommend to visit once the River Safari rise is open later in 2013."
,,Disappointing but not full open on our visit,3.0,,"We visited the River Safari as we got a discounted rate by due to the fact that the boat trip wasn't open and because it was cheaper when buying it along with the Singapore Zoo ticket. I wish though that we had just stuck with the zoo as it only took about 2 hours to walk around and there was very little to see really.
The manatees were really cool to see in the Amazon flooded forest and the giant glass windows that surround it make for great viewing. Also, it was amazing to see a couple of giant Pandas which was the main reason for us visiting this particular attraction.
The information on the various rivers around the world was interesting but overall there isnt enough to keep you here for that long and we got a little tired of seeing endless amounts of fish."
,,not the standard you would expect (not fully opened when I went there),2.0,,"Singapore's delivers some of the greatest zoo experiences in the world with their Night Safari and the zoo itself so you should expect great things for their newest creation but the River Safari can't live up to the standards of it's prodecessors unfortunately.

Now as mentioned in the title the whole park wasn't opened yet and I would think that when the Amazon trail will be the park will get higher ratings but for the moment it's not worth the trip.

They do however have pandas so if that's on ones bucket list this is a great place to go! you get up and close with them once you've pushed your way through the crowds :)"
,,Skip this until full attraction opens later this year,1.0,,"This is done very similar to the zoo, but in the absence of the actual river safari it is not worth even the $25, a discounted price since the river safari part isn't open. Skip this until they open everything towards the end of the year. Until then it seems like just another part of the zoo."
,,A new one to add to the ever growing list,4.0,,"Singapore's newest animal attraction! Firstly, a word of warning (the river boat section has not yet opened and will not be a part of the part till late August, there is a reduction in the price because of this). The consequence is quite a long walk around the park taking up to three hours to walk from start to finish however, there are cafes and restaurants on route and beautiful locations to have a sit and rest at.

The park is extremely educational and a great experience to have. Highlights for me included the amazing dugong tank, and the massive enclosures for two giant pandas, it also has many unique animals form the Amazon to those found in the Congo, kids and adults will love. I would not recommend the three park hopper until the attraction is open fully. To get to the Zoo, River Safari and Night Zoo its a 45minute ride by bus from inner city Singapore, so you might be tempted to do two or more in one day. however, try to spread them over a few days as you will get a lot more out of them. Animal overload can definitely occur if its squashed into a shorter time period than this! Have fun hannah"
,,A Return To Nature!,3.0,,"An interesting attraction that brings various kinds of animals, reptiles and sea creatures closer to us humans and allows us the opportunity to learn more about them.
Besides the stars of the show, i.e. the very adorable pandas (but they were not very active at all but were just lying around enjoying the A/C I guess) we really loved the huge aquariums.
One of our favs must be the manatees and we wished we had the time to stay for the feeding but we missed it.
What is unfortunate is that the park is not fully opened with the river cruise being non-operational. But, the visit was still worth it as there were many other attractions to see.
Be sure to also have a meal at their themed restaurants, my personal favourite being the one after the panda exhibit. The food was actually rather good but make sure you order the 'panda bao' (only 200 pieces are made every day). It was sooo cute but also quite yummy with lotus seed filling.
All in all, it was a most enjoyable time and do remember to bring along the camera for many Kodak moments."
,,Beautiful and interesting & cute pandas,5.0,,We loved the pandas - who does not? But the rivers were also very nice and explanations interesting. The aquarium with the manatees is impressive and the monkey forest fun. It will be even nicer when the boat ride on the Amazone is opened.
,,"Exotic sea creatures, Amazing Manatees!",5.0,,"For wildlife / sea creature lovers, there is a great variety of exotic sea creatures, including those that appear on the River Monsters documentary. My fave was the gigantic ""flooded Amazon"" tank with the manatee families! We spent the longest time there watching the manatees lounging and relaxing we felt super relaxed too! TIP: after the huge manatee tank, so stop by the smaller viewing area as the babies love to hang around the surface near this glass viewin area! Up close and personal with the babies! TIP2: food at Panda restaurant is nice (Sze Chuan food) but lunch queues can be pretty long. Do go earlier or later if you wanna have lunch there. TIP3: the river boat cruise is only open at year end so ticket prices are cheaper now. If you are a resident, try to get discount packages from People's Association Community Centres or your Residents' Committee. We only paid $20 per adult ($15 per child) for ticket, buffet breakfast and 2-way coach transfers!"
,,Can't wait for the fully open park!,4.0,,"Such a pleasant experience! The place is so beautiful, with the river in the middle of the park. The fresh water aquarium is so amazing, with a lot of fish that I had never seen before. Went ther on Monday, not so crowded inside, but the ticket queue was sooo loongg. But they also sell ticket without queue , just add 4 sgd, and they gave souvenirs too. Pandaaaa.. so cute!! Jia Jia and kai Kai both are so adorable ^^. The river safari boat still shut off, maybe next year they will fully open. Can't wait to experience the river safari boat.."
,,Will be fantastic when fully open,4.0,,"The River Safari is the newest addition to Singapore's assortment of zoos/animal parks. The park is designed to showcase species who thrive in and around rivers throughout the world. Unfortunately, we visited before the park was fully open (the entire western half of the park was still shut off) so didn't get the whole experience. Despite that, the park is still definitely worth a visit. All of the fish tanks are open to view, showcasing animals from all over the world, including several species of alligator and a family of manatees. The main attraction to most will be the pandas. The pair live in a very well-designed climate-controlled exhibit alongside their red cousins. I saw signs saying that you are required to book a viewing time to see the pandas, however, we walked straight in on three occasions, so I guess this is just for peak times. The price is very reasonable aswell, especially if you buy the park hopper ticket. I have suggested that the visit will take 2-3 hours, however, this could be vastly different when the park is fully open"
,,Go on weekdays for a better experience,4.0,,"I dropped by the River Safari on a Friday afternoon and found it pleasantly quiet. There was no massive crowd, which made it very easy to move around and get decent views of the animals - especially when it came to seeing the pandas.

The River Safari is basically a river-themed aquarium. It isn't as big as the zoo and isn't completed yet, but for SGD25 I think I got a pretty good bargain. I unfortunately missed all the feeding times, but that was no big deal for me. They have a decent variety of fish and other river fauna, arranged according to the major rivers of the world - the Mississippi, the Congo, the Murray River, the Ganges, the Nile, the Mekong, the Yangtze, the Amazon.
Highlights for me were the two huge gharials (though their enclosure seemed on the small side for two large reptiles), the sturgeon, the pandas, and the manatees. The crab-eating macaques were amusing too, with their antics in and around the water. You may also get a glimpse of the polar bear in the zoo - there's a viewing panel for the polar bear's tank right outside the panda enclosure. That was pretty cool.

Freshwater fish are not nearly as pretty as saltwater fish, so if you don't have as much interest in fish or in zoos you might get bored rather quickly. (I can imagine that it is quite possible to see the whole place right now in less than 2 hours, if you just hurry through it.) But for those who do have an interest, the River Safari is quite worth the money!

The place should be more interesting when it's fully open, but for now, SGD25 isn't bad at all.

* Photography tip: Using the normal built-in flash on your camera doesn't really help if you want to take pictures of a fish hiding in a dim tank of water. You'd probably get a glaring white spot in the middle of your picture as the flash reflects off the glass. Best to revert to high shutter speeds, if your camera has that capability. (I had my camera with me, but found that my iPhone took fairly nice pictures, considering its limitations...)
The glare of the flash is also not good for the fish. So do take heed of the notices around when they prohibit flash photography."
,,Love it,4.0,,It's very pleasant journey to saw all the beautiful animals there. My sons really impressed and learned a lot about the animals. The view of the lake were so peaceful. The panda bun and the panda cappucinno were cute. I'm sure the place will be more impressive after the boat ride open.
,,Do the night safari and zoo first until it's fully open,3.0,,"The title pretty much sums up my impression with the caveat that it may be better once the boat ride opens. I've been to the night safari and zoo several times and would definitely recommend these ahead of the river safari, with night safari being the must do attraction. Both the zoo and night safari have set a very high standard so the river safari has tough acts to follow.

It took me a little over an hour to go round the river safari and many of the displays were still awaiting their occupants. As I walked round I did find myself wondering, 'where is the river, in this river safari?' Essentially you follow a path through various aquariums and displays. I had hoped for a winding route past running water....like a river? However, if you have visited an aquarium before and a zoo then this experience will not feel vastly different. The panda, yes singular, did save the day and as it was very quiet when I attended (mid-week mid afternoon). I had plenty of time and room to have an excellent view of bamboo being devoured.

Overall, the panda experience makes the river safari worth visiting in it's unfinished form, but if you have a choice and can live without the pandas do the zoo or night safari instead."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"I went to this park today and I was totally impressed!!! There are SO many weird looking sea creatures that I never seen before and that totally blew my mind away. Some of the species really look like it belongs to the dinosaurs' family. Haha. I think the River Safari has done an excellent job in the layout of the park, ensuring it's eco-friendly but yet not exposing visitors to direct sunlight. With the huge water landscape and occasional wind, it does feel good and brings down the humidity level. Definitely work a visit and worth paying $25/adult per entry. Double the trip up with a visit to the Zoo!

Oh yes, they have strollers and lockers for rentals too."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"I didn't expect to be wowed by this place since the entrance fees seem steep for an attraction that isn't fully completed yet. Reluctantly, I dragged my feet to visit this place for my children's sake and boy was I surprised.

We were greeted by friendly and helpful staff at the entrance who provided us with lots of information about the various ticket options and annual pass promotions available. As we entered the River Safari at 9.25am, we were just in time for the feeding of various species of fish. The children were enthralled by how some of the fish feed and I was amazed at how close we get to observe the sea creatures. For the first time, I was able to see right in front of me how the teeth, scales and eyes of an Indian Gharial (crocodile like creature) look like as it was just swimming behind the glass enclosure. Have you ever looked a crocodile in the eye? Well, now I can say that I have! The feeling of seeing such a magnificent animal so close was breathtaking!

The world's largest freshwater aquarium was simply mesmerising. As you walked into the dimly lit aquarium with soft music playing in the background, you seem to have entered a magical fairytale like surrounding with manatees swimming all around you. I could just sit there for hours to admired the manatees. We were very reluctant to leave the place.

My children enjoyed seeing the pandas but I wasn't wowed. Jia Jia was very shy and we were very lucky to have caught a glimpse of her. Otherwise, I would have felt a little cheated. What River Safari could do better at the attraction is to train their staff to be more polite and approachable to parents when advising them about keeping their children's excitement under control. If they are overly stern to a point of being impolite then it really spoils the fun.

On the whole, we really enjoyed the experience so much that we bought the annual pass right after we exited. Thumbs up to the designers and creators of this attraction as it gives a truly wonderful experience that is different from the Zoo!"
,,Panda-monium,3.0,,"We went here to see the pandas. They were as cute as expected. But we were disappointed that there was really not much else to see. The only other thing that intrigued our 8 year old was the manatees. The monkey exhibit looked cute, but we skipped it as we have one at our local zoo.
We had a light lunch at the cafe near the pandas - quite tasty and decent value."
,,Disappointing. May improve when fully complete,3.0,,"As a family, we love visiting the Singapore Marine Life Park.

When the river safari opened up, we were really excited about visiting this new attraction.

First things first. As others have pointed out, this is a very small attraction currently.

Secondly, the boat ride isn't active which kind of defeats the purpose of a 'safari'.

Thirdly, the displays are small and on a typical hot day, one is left with the feeling of 'why did I bother...?'

Even tanks in the 'Indian' section were empty of any fish.

The Panda section is a welcome cool respite.

There is a show featuring some of the inhabitants from the safari and it can be easily missed. The show lacks the 'wow' factor of the ones in the bird park or the zoo (from a child's perspective).

Perhaps this will be a completely different experience when it is fully open but in my view, this is a complete miss currently."
,,Like it but to small,3.0,,"I wasn't having much expectation to this new attraction after hearing from my colleague that how small is the place, but I was still thinking, cannot be that small. However, when I was there, I really know what they meant of small. The area is really not big if compare with zoo or there have same compound but zoo definitely has more stuff to see than river safari. The highlight of the river safari is the few important river species in the world, the panda and the amazon aquarium. It is not fully open, almost 40% still in progress so kind of not very worth for the visit now to me for paying $25(Discounted Price due to incomplete, original is $35, Thanks to my company I actually got the access for Free). i finished it within 2 hours(with 30 mins of show).

It is like going to aquarium with all the reptile keep inside, so most of the place consider indoor, best even if raining you will not get wet. I especially love the panda forest(depends on your luck, best to visit them during their feeding time around 12 noon) and the huge aquarium at Amazon area. The other 40% will be open end of the year, hopefully when I visit next year it will have more fun. The incomplete one looks like a boat ride and you will see some animals."
,,"A breathtaking journey, but the enclosures can be bigger",4.0,,"The river safari is a new addition to the zoo, but it's an attraction on its own with separate entrance fee from the zoo and the night safari. The giant pandas and the manatees are the main attractions here, but there are nice presentations along the way, with an educational tour of the different river ecosystems.

As of this review, the amazon boat ride is not available yet, so the entrance fee is reduced to S$25. But rest assured you can see about 70% of the exhibits, which is awesome.

After the giant panda enclosure there is a little cafe selling Chinese food and various panda-inspired snacks, e.g. panda bun and ice-cream, so you can have the energy to see the rest of the exhibits.

I personally think it is very very well done, but I also think the enclosures, although very well designed, should be twice as big to be comfortable for the animals.

To avoid spoilers all I'll say is prepare to be blown away at the end of the journey. I highly recommend this visit."
,,Superb visit,4.0,,"Just came back from the River Safari. The Amazonian part is still not open but from the current attractions, this experience was top notch. The Mekong River, the pandas and the manatees from the Amazon Flooded Forest were star attractions. Go during the feeding times. Highly recommended."
,,"Packed, half closed and not much to see.",2.0,,"When we went, we knew that half of the park was closed, and this was reflected in the ticket price, as we paid 2/3 of the ticket price.

When we got in, it was packed, and there was no space to move around to actually see the animals.

The main exhibit was the pandas and it was a free for all when we got in, as there were about 100 people around the fence and would not budge so we rarely even saw the panda bears. This place would benefit from letting a few people in at a time so others do not have to suffer.

If you are tempted to buy 2 or 3 combination tickets to different parks, please leave this off of your plans, very disappointing."
,,River Safari beats Resorts World Sentosa's Oceanarium for experience,5.0,,"My expectations for the latest attraction in Singapore, the River Safari, were all about the pandas but the beauty of the global River theme meant that the pandas were just one of many things worth seeing here.

It's a very pleasant experience all round with the way that the park is laid out and themed. All undercover and all set in a vast reservoir its a very relaxing and enjoyable attraction that compliments the neighbouring Zoo, Night Safari and Bird Park.

The manatee attractions were especially amazing. Enormous underwater whale like creatures related to the elephants set in a mighty amazon themed tank that showed off their beauty.

The attraction is great for kids and kids at heart alike with some very entertaining monkeys and the space to enjoy the mighty pandas from many different angles.

Although the attraction is not yet complete it was still a more relaxing and enjoyable experience than the competing Oceanarium at Resorts World Sentosa and I would recommend it very highly."
,,Pandas are the star attraction!,4.0,,"This attraction is now a stand-alone attraction and you have to pay separately to the Zoo to visit. This is where they have a special enclosure for their star attractions the Giant Pandas Kai Kai & Jia Jia.
Unfortunately when we visited it is still not fully operational and the actual River Safari is not running yet. A small point they never mentioned when we were enquiring about it. Other than that it was worth the visit alone to see The Pandas. They are absolutely gorgeous even if the female Jia Jia is a little shy. You probably only need a couple of hours to do it so could probably visit the Zoo on the same day."
,,Excellent even for now! Can't wait for the rest to open!,5.0,,"I visited with little expectation but instead found it to be much better and more enjoyable than the zoo (the zoo's exhibits are clearly showing its age). The concept of displaying the majors rivers of the world and its inhabitants provide an excellent overview of the diversity of the rivers' ecosystems - I think it will interest the adults more than the children. Certain exhibits such as the manatee blew my mind away!

There is a guide that provides free commentaries (just tag along with her) - she is lively and certainly did a great job!

For those who like pandas - note that the more shy Jia Jia seldom comes out to meet visitors - best to see both would be during their feeding times! That happens several times of the day (check with the guides inside the panda centre). Personally, I prefer the red pandas.

The river safari is an excellent back-up plan if it rains - by far a very promising attraction at this present moment and one that I don't mind visiting again soon!

Note: Plan 2-3 hours to cover the exhibits."
,,"Just for the Pandas, it was worth it!",4.0,,"Even thought it is not fully completed, the main attraction for many families is the Panda. It is still worth going just to see the panda. Bring jacket along, it can be very cold in the Panda exhibition."
,,Just for the pandas!,3.0,,"Newly open and not many things to see. Panda is cute! Ticket is expensive and not worthy. The overall idea is good, shaded walk by the river. But I think this should be part of the zoo."
,,Mainly disappointing,3.0,,"Being a big zoo fan and knowing the Singapore zoo and night safari I was really disappointed by this one. The idea is nice, but the whole thing is so small that is took me less then an hour to see everything (I should be mentioned that parts of the park are still under construction). The panda exhibit is nice (but has nothing to do with the river theme) and the sunken rainforest is really fascinating, but besides these two hilights there is unfortunately not much. Would we a great extension to the regular zoo, but as an attraction on its on insufficient."
,,A riverside walk in the shade,4.0,,"This is a newly added attraction right next to the SG Zoo. It is so new that about half of the safari is still under construction and they give you a discount for that.

Though it is hot in day time, the whole safari is well covered that you can enjoy breezy coming in once in a while! And it is natural breeze!! In here, we visited the panda house. The pandas are just cute. And do not miss the crocodile tank where they have two big crocodiles with one swimming all the time close to the tank window, and is always ready for you to take ""group phote"" with.

Worth visiting again when they have the whole safari completed."
,,River Safari,5.0,,"We have visited the zoo many times and love it, the setting is so lovely in a rainforest. The new attraction River Safari, we really enjoyed it, to see the panda's was amazing, we stayed quite a while watching them eat enormous quantities of bamboo. The river safari bit wasn't up and running, but they charged us a smaller amount with this not finished yet, so next time we are in Singapore we will go and have a look at that. It was amazing to see the Panda,s they are so lovely. It is a well thought out attraction, and very educational. Highly Recommended !"
,,Shaded walk by the rivers,5.0,,"It was a hot hot Singapore day and we set out early so we could beat the heat, but to our pleasant surprise it is mostly covered, breezy and even air con in few places. So it was a pleasant and easy 2 hour walk. The river quest is to open later this year and so the fees is reduced by 10 SGD. Amazon region was the best though the pandas were adorable too. Some rare creatures, like beavers, manatees, squirrel monkeys were there to be seen. Overall enjoyable trip for me and my 20 year old son, but I will visit again when it is fully operational. Best combined with a trip to the zoo, bird park and night safari."
,,Adorable giant pandas,3.0,,"The river safari showed the major rivers in the world, although part of the park was closed. The highlight are the cute giant pandas. It's an easy walk around the park, but attractions are limited."
,,TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,1.0,,It is newest attraction in Singapore. It is from the house of Singapore zoo. It is basically a zoo with some part as aquarium. It is below average as per Singapore standard and it is only half operational and they are charging full fare. Singapore zoo or night safari are 100 times better than this. Only a panda is worth seeing otherwise total waste of time and money.
,,River Safari,2.0,,"Not upto mark as expected. No safari as such, only display of sea animals. Although set up was good. I pity the poor panda, don't think they liked staying there. Not recommended by me."
,,Great place dor children,4.0,,"Nice environment, very clean, good job from Singapore goverment. Nice place for learing about river species and environment. But it still not finish all yet. Also have Panda. Will back again when in Singapore. A very good concept"
,,Great park but wait for the boat ride,4.0,,"I love the park layout, its open, breezy and easy to walk around, given that I had 2 old folks with me. The main attraction was clearly the Pandas, though other wildlife are also worth its salt, such as the Indian Gharials, the Manatees, the Red-bellied Piranhas and etc. One tip, make sure that you clear your bowels before entering the park as the next toilet is located after the Panda viewing gallery which is quite a distance away from the entrance.I am quite sure that once the Amazon River Quest Boat ride is operational, it will bring the River Safari to greater heights. Glad to have such an attraction in Singapore as it adds some excitement to our urban city."
,,"Enjoyed ourself even though not fully opened, mostly covered walkways",4.0,,"We visited end-June. Although the River Safari is not fully opened, we still pretty much enjoyed ourself. We had a toddler so the covered walkways really helped shelter us from the heat.

The signboards with clear explanation as we move along. Overall it's a well organise river safari.
Will definately be back once the whole park is ready."
,,Beautiful environment,5.0,,"We felt refreshed when we entered River Safari for the first time a week ago. This was saying a lot as we went on a Friday morning where the PSI level hit 400 by 12 p.m. that same day! It was uncharacteristically quiet that day, with only another 2 local families and a family from Philippines, I believe. We went that morning as I had a voucher I needed to redeem to get our family membership for River Safari before it expired, and we knew we would not spend more than a couple of hours there. We were surprised by the fact that the entire place was sheltered and several parts of the attraction was enclosed / air conditioned. The kids (aged 4 and 9) were overjoyed to see the piranhas, the manatees and the giant sea lions. They had seen the pandas a number of times overseas so they were not too impressed by that, though Kai Kai (the male panda who is the drama papa) was really adorable. Jia Jia (female panda) was nowhere to be seen (again! the first time when we went to see just the pandas, entrance from the zoo, she was MIA too) but you could see her in her room, taking a nap, through the CCTV. There was an enclosure for the squirrel monkeys where you could enter and the monkeys are just going about freely. The Filipino family was stroking a monkey that appeared tame enough, but before long, we heard cries from their teenage daughter. Apparently, the monkey had bitten her and she must have been shocked, the poor dear. So, tourist (both locals and foreigners) tip: do not attempt to touch the monkeys. We had a snack at the Panda Cafe (ok, I forgot its actual name) and the kids enjoyed the salt and pepper chicken (two servings!) as well as the deep fried lotus root, I love their panda bun (filled with one of the smoothest red bean paste I had ever had) and hubbs had the panda coffee. A little over priced as you can expect from tourist attractions but at least the quality is not too bad =) The ""aquarium"" area was lovely, where it was air conditioned and you could sit comfortably and gawk at the manatees that were swimming at their own pace - very therapeutic! When the entire place is ready in December (with the boat ride), we expect it would be even better! Must go!!!"
,,Panda attraction,3.0,,"Main attraction would be the Panda, the river cruise is not ready yet so maybe it would be better when it is fully completed. Admission charges is on the high side as I would say there are more things to see in the Singapore Zoological Garden"
,,River safari without river safari...,3.0,,"We visited River Safari after th Zoo. I suppose, it will be great attraction after opening of boat ride and it'll be real river safari. Unfortunately, now it is not.

Some of the animals, we already met in the Zoo. Few water tanks were not very good cleaned.There is the green coat on the glass. I know that it is the typical issue for fresh water aquariums, but it must be cleaned!

However, it is worth to visit for following reasons:

1. Pandas. My opinion it is one of the best worldwide
2. Water tank with manatees. Great possibility to view manatees both through the glass and from the open top of the tank
3. Squirrel monkeys. You will get a lot of fun watching them
4. Small animal show near future boat ride. It was at 16.00 and we didn't find any announcement, so visited it accidentally. Nice interaction with animal in short distance. Interesting not only for kids."
,,Novel way to learn about rivers and the life within,4.0,,"An attraction with nuggets of information about rivers and its creatures and life around the world, presented in an interesting way. Very educational especially for nature and environment lovers. Thoughtful how it has been built with a sheltered walkway so visitors are not inconvenienced by rain. The humid weather in S'pore however still made the air-conditioned enclosures eg where the pandas are, more comfortable to linger. Happy to get a glimpse of one panda although the other was hidden. Too bad the planned river cruise to emulate a ride on the Amazon river wasn't open yet when we visited."
,,Great way to spend a couple of hours,5.0,,"We visited in mid April, not long after it opened, and although not all attractions were yet finished, we had a great time. My recommendation would be to spend the morning at the zoo ( right next door) then pop over to the river safari for a couple of hours in the afternoon. You can buy combo tickets to make it more affordable. We enjoyed learning about the major river systems of the world and seeing some wild life we had never encountered before. We particularly enjoyed the giant pandas. ( We were lucky enough to see them very close up!) the other highlight was the squirrel monkeys. They literally roam free in an enclosed area that you walk through! Beware of them trying to take stuff from your bags though! Very cheeky but very cute! Very impressive enclosures and viewing areas. I can only imagine it will be quite spectacular when finished!"
,,When completely up and running will be fantastic!,5.0,,"We went to the soft opening in April and the boat ride wasn't yet working. It was still great though with lots of wildlife we hadn't seen (and we've seen a LOT!). If you are at the zoo, this place is well worth a visit and you can buy combo tickets that make it affordable!"
,,Cool although yet to be opened fully,4.0,,The River Safari is worth paying a visit to although it is yet to be opened fully. We did see some exotic animals at the park and a tank full of manatees. We walked among the free-ranging spider monkeys too. We are waiting for the park to be fully opened to go on the boat ride.
,,Singapore River Safari a con job,1.0,,"Don't even try to go on the River Safari as it is highly overpriced at S$29 for adults and S$20 for children. Most of the exhibits are not open and you just walk on the boardwalk most of the time. The boat ride is not open either and it would have been much better to wait till all th attractions are ready. If you want to see the pandas, which is a huge draw, you only see one as the other one is tto shy to come out. You can see Kai Kai hiding under a table on the screen. There are lot of fishes but then if you have seen the Marine Water Park, which you would as a toruist, this is a complete waste."
,,Wait for the boat ride to open,3.0,,"Went on a weekday to River Safari on a 2-in-1 park hopper. The general sense is being underwhelmed and over-charged for a park that generated so much interest and anticipation, mainly because only half the park is open. The highlights include the giant tanks, with manatees, gars, some pirahnas and some river fishes, and of course the panda enclosure. However, most of the trails are dotted with signboards and picture illustration (musuem like?) and exhibits such as arrowanas, turtles, angel fish fails to wow visitors. There are also no shows or special Lets wait for the full park to open."
,,Exotic animals,5.0,,"The animals in the River safari were all exotic animals and we were so lucky that those animals were still exist, despite some maybe endangered. We hope that Singapore zoo continue the conservation for those exotic and endangered animals."
,,Fabulous experience!,4.0,,"As other advisors have mentioned the river attraction of the river safari is not yet available however this does not spoil the adventure!

20 minutes by taxi from marina bay sands and roughly 22SSD fare.

There is lots to see and experience even for people like us who are not really zoo or safari people but it definitely gave us inspiration for other attractions or maybe even a safari holiday at some point!

The highlight of the trip was seeing the giant panda, just amazing! Fabulous creatures, although to be fair all they really did was eat bamboo and the odd carrot, but so very well worth watching and waiting for people to move around so you can get an excellent view of them.

It's a crowded experience with lots of other tourists wanting pictures etc but just be patient and loiter. Others will leave and you will have your clear photo opportunity within a couple of minutes of standing around

Tip for other visitors... We did the experience in about 2.5 hours and got a park hopper, electing for the night safari later in the day. Go around 2pm if you just want to do the 2 safari parks. But if you want to do all 3, which can be done, arrive early morning when the zoo opens. Start with the zoo, head to the river safari and then night safari later in the evening.

Another tip - the food area around the river safari closes around 6:30 but don't panic... Head up to the night safari area where there are ore food outlets which are open later."
,,Fun & interesting,4.0,,"Despite the boat ride not being available, it was a fun and v enjoyable experience. Esp loved the Amazon flooded forest, so peaceful and happy just watching the aquatic animals. Next attraction i enjoyed was the 2 pandas. Super cute pandas and you can learn how the menus are prepared for the 2 pandas. Didnt complete the river safari as we arrived late, it closes at 6pm. Get the park hopper ticket - its value for money. Will visit again if i do visit Singapore on my next trip."
,,The River Themed Zoo,3.0,,"The River Safari is a river themed zoo located in Singapore and is just next to the Singapore Zoo and the night safari. It comprises of mainly freshwater attraction and of course, the highlight which is the giant panda forest.

It was a pleasant outing for me. However, i didn't find the place fantastic. I felt that the giant panda forest was pretty similar to the Giant Panda Adventure which i saw in Hong Kong Ocean Park. The pandas were cute but if you are talking about value for money, you definedly have lots more to do and see in HK Ocean Park.

My comments ... just alright!"
,,Gorgeous attraction,4.0,,"The only reason this attraction does'nt get 5/5 is the fact that the amazon river part was still not open, which we were aware of prior to our visit though. The walk around is beautiful and everything is build to high standards; seeing the pandas was a lot of fun as well as walking around with free-ranging monkeys in one area."
,,Best Experience together with Parks,4.0,,"The River Safari is the Zoo's latest attraction, and it is located next to the Zoo and the night safari. Don't make a special trip just to visit the River Safari, as it is only 80% complete. The boat ride will only be complete after July 2013 (estimated).

However, if you get the Park Hopper, visiting all 3 parks in a day will be worth your money, and the trip out of the main city area. This is the only place outside of China, yet in Asia, which gives you an opportunity to see the famous China Pandas. Head to the River Safari at 930am or 230pm for Free guided tours. It does not bring you to all the exhibits, but it is comprehensive enough considering it is FREE

Another exhibit I loved is the Flooded Amazon Forest. 6 months of the year, the Amazon is flooded. The Zoo replicates this eco system, as you will see the forest submerged and interactiing with marine life. My kids enjoyed it"
,,Rip off!,1.0,,"After the pleasant and interesting experience that was the Night Safari, I looked forward to seeing the newest attraction in the Zoo cluster. Unfortunately, it turned out to be deeply under-whelming and an outright disappointment. The attraction is only half completed and, while the concept may prove to be successful in the future, at present it consists of a few riverine creatures shifted over from the neighboring zoo and an awful lot of signage displaying information I could have sourced at home, in comfort. Far too many of the enclosures and tanks bear photographs and a strap banner saying ""coming soon""! The entrance fee is currently discounted because of the incomplete nature of the attraction, but is exorbitant considering the paltry offerings. The marketing and advertising of this so-called attraction is misleading, bordering on duplicity, and does Singapore no credit. At present, I strongly recommend that it is avoided. Take a slow stroll through the Botanical Gardens - it is far more rewarding and won't cost you a cent."
,,Interesting place but boat ride was not available during our visit,4.0,,"We bought park hopper specials which cost S$39 per person for Zoo and River Safari. You get to see Red Panda, Panda and a lot more interesting animals. At the end of the walk there is a big big aquarium where you can sit back and relax while watching Manatee swim."
,,Unique River-Themed Park in Singapore,4.0,,"Surpisingly, we enjoyed River Safari recently. Why?

-its concept is new in asia as it features world famous rivers and river-dwelling land and aquatic animals. so it's not all-aquariums and/or all-cages, but it highlights mississipi river, river nile, ganges river, yangtze river, murray river etc.

-informative, educational, promotes awareness and love for environment.

-the Giant Panda Forest section doesn't only highlight the Giant Pandas, Jia Jia and Kai Kai but a couple of red pandas or firefox too. It's a delight to simply watch them move in seemingly huge environment.

-there are airconditioned areas and spots with electric fans providing good ventillation and comfort under the hot Singaporean sun.

-accessible via bus 138 after you alight at Ang Mo Kio MRT station.

-included in the list of theme parks on the package of iVenture card that we availed that save us money, effort in waiting in long queue, and offers lots of options.

-location is a few steps away from night safari, and just beside singapore zoo.

-downside of experiencing it early : the second zone, called amazonia, apart from rivers of the world remains a work in progress. but that's one reason to go back to river safari singapore."
,,Not worth the price eventhough not the full price,3.0,,"Although the price charged was not the full price, I still felt I did not get my money's worth. It was still more expensive than the Singapore Zoo and yet, there were less animals to see.

To potential visitors: I suggest to wait until the whole safari is opened before visiting the place or you might just leave disappointed."
,,Wait till the boat ride!,4.0,,"Went to river safari on Vesak day and actually the crowd was not a lot. Maybe the safari is still not fully opened, some of the exhibits were closed and we did not saw some of the animals which were listed on the map. Nevertheless we had a good day especially for my 19mo toddler.
Kai Kai n Jia Jia were expectedly most popular among the visitors. Jia Jia was sleeping in her cove when we went to visit them. At least Kai Kai still was active walking around his area. Food wise there were only 2 restaurants there. Nothing fantastic. Btw this place is really stroller friendly and the staff were friendly too! Will make a trip down again after the boat ride is up!"
,,Five stars attraction.,5.0,,"This is really a great tour of all the great rivers of the world. There is 3 big aquarium throughout the tour in both airconditiong & outdoor. Of course, there's the red panda, giant panda & squirrel monkeys to add to the fun. The only set back is that the river ride is only open at the end of 2013."
,,Rivers of the Continents in Singapore,4.0,,"This is an educational place for children and also a great eye opener to all!

Accessibility: Have to go by taxi/cab as it is most convenient. Public transport with shuttle bus to Khatib MRT available at certain operating hours.

It is wheelchair friendly and pram-friendly. Pathways suitable for prams and it is not for bumpy surfaces.

Value of money: Currently, in this month May,2013, some sites are not available yet, not even the boat rides, so the cost is about $25. With a group of adults I have been with recently to this place, we took 3 hours to explore the sites comfortably. When all sites are opened, perhaps, 4-5hrs there would be the average. But if you only spend 1 hour breezing past the place without stopping by to admire the creatures or listen to the guides along the way, it might be a bit too expensive for a short trip.

Time: The morning period was cool and comfortable. With light rain, it posed no problems to the trip as most areas are sheltered and you will not hesitate to walk in the open even if it drizzles, provided you have an umbrella or a cap. This is because the open spaces takes you to the next zone which is back to a sheltered zone. So all is well-covered.

Cleanliness: The toilets are clean. That may be important for people concerned over the use of toilets. At certain places, I see vendor machines selling bottled drinks. I saw one 500ml of coke cost $3. So come prepared with some coins if you run out of drinks.

Big Aquarium - the flooded forest : There is a grand spectator stand for people to sit and watch the giant creatures (manatee) swim. You can also go up to the second level to watch them eat from the giant basket of vegetables. Second level has no seat. Just to watch from another angle.

Entire concept: Classification by rivers in different continent was very systematic. It's not putting all the fishes of the worlds together or monkeys together like the zoo. Thus, you get the experience what you can see in River Mekong, River Nile, Amazon etc. Very suitable for school trips!"
,,Still under construction,3.0,,"This seems to be the newest addition to the parks around the zoo. We spent 1.5-2 hrs here. There were some nice aquariums -some quite large with Dugongs, and arowanas. The Panda enclosure was a nice escape from the heat. Many of the tanks were empty and the boat ride was not yet operational. It was rather disappointing as not everything was ready (and we were paying full price for entrance). I think it will be a good visit once it is actually finished."
,,Go on a River Safari in a busy urban city!,4.0,,"The recently opened River Safari SIngapore (officially opened in April 2013) is a refreshing new attraction in SIngapore. Part of WIldlife Reserves Singapore, the River Safari is unlike any zoo you may encounter anywhere in the world.

Built into the natural surroundings of the secondary rainforest of the Seletar/Mandai area, the River Safari features flora and fauna in their natural habitats in the major rivers of the world such as the Amazon, the Ganges, the Mekong and the Yangtze. Of course, any man-made replicas can never truly capture the immense natural wonders of these great rivers but I would say that these small replicas featured in the River Safari is as good as it gets, short of actually visiting these natural wonders individually.

The flora and fauna among the exhibits in the River Safari include rare and highly endangered species such as the famous Giant Panda and the Red Panda. The number of freshwater fish species found in the River Safari is astounding. These include the giant Arapaima, Garfish, Giant Tigerfish, Paddlefish, Chinese Sturgeon and Giant Mekong Catfish.

And the best part of it all? The River Safari is easily accessible using public transport. Public buses and taxis will get you there from the city centre in less than an hour. And it is also nestled together with its more popularly known sister attractions such as the Singapore Zoological Gardens and the Night Safari. A ""Park Hopper"" pass will grant you access to all 3 parks plus the Jurong Bird Park and is a cost-effective means for tourists to visit all these attractions. Enquire at the Pass Office and the friendly staff there will advise you on the costs and other administrative details."
,,proud to be a singaporean more after i visited river safari,4.0,,"I went to river safari on 17/5/2013 Friday and its not very crowded . I will come back again because not all of the wildlife are there yet. Those that are there are adapting very well and I am very please that all the staff are very caring , informative and interactive with visitors about the wildlife in their respective stations. Big thumbs up for them . The whole place is wheelchair and pram friendly . I hope river safari will make the boat ride an optional choice because I wont want to board the boat, I am happy with walking .I was studying in an international school for all my life and I am multilingual, I heard some visitors(from neighboring countries) said they are not very willing to try the boat ride due to some phobia from flood face in their countries and other personal reasons.Viewing from the view decks I actually can see some beautiful kingfisher and I feel that the boat ride open in year end is going to be an amazing one too ,please hold your excitement for a few months more ,if you really want to board the boat.
The most important thing to prepare for this trip is mineral water ,you really need at least 2 bottles to hydrate yourself.
I feel that you need to have some patience when viewing some wildlife .Not all are visible at a glance ,some are hiding in corners ,therefore time is needed to find and see them. The longest was 50 mins ,just to find the green anaconda .I actually had mix feeling when viewing the piranha, I actually quite disagree with breeding and protecting piranha , however in river safari I learn that not all piranha are human flesh eating, some are animal eating. The human eating on surround the human like you are in the middle of a tornado while the animal eating just look at you in a flock. You can move your hand in front of the fishes ,some actually follow your hand motion. Top 4 animals you must visit (1) Indian gharial (they are really enormous ).
(2)Giant Panda kaikai and jiajia I was told that kaikai (male) was more active then jiajia (female)by the staff there.Jiajia actually smile for the cameras before she had her lunch. Very cute Pandas. Giant panda area have air con in their area,very cooling and have more crowd than other areas.
(3)Manatee and(4) giant river otters .That is where I feel so proud to be a Singaporean ,you have to really see for yourselves ,if you think Conrad hotel Rangali Island Resort at Maldives is beautiful ,you will hope and want more that you can build a house in river safari and watch the manatee and giant river otters every single day . For food ,you must try is the cappuccino and bamboo rice set B from Mama Panda kitchen, I am not very impress with the panda bun but the cappuccino was really good. overall ,worth every penny even incomplete,a must go in Singapore!!"
,,Don't go there...yet...,2.0,,"Visited River Safari at the end of April and was disappointed because half of it wasn't completed yet and many exhibits and animals in the completed half were missing. The reason I wanted to go to the River Safari was because they advertised giant otters and manatees, but I didn't see either of those animals there, so I was really bummed out. I was quite sure neither of the animals had arrived yet but looking at the other reviewers, it seems like the manatees were already there - I don't see how I could have missed them though...

They shouldn't have advertised exhibits that have not arrived yet. Was not worth the time and ticket price this time round.

It'll probably be a great place to visit once it's properly completed, but in the meantime, try Singapore Zoo or the Night Safari instead."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,The newest of the parks here this is a great facility and definitely worth a visit. Not all parts of the park are operational yet but that doesn't matter. The viewing tanks throughout are amazing you almost feel like you are underwater. The pandas are a highlight we were lucky that the male was particularly active when we visited which was great. Highly recommend the park.
,,Great concept - still unfinished. Go back when Amazonia is ready,4.0,,"We visited with kids and friends on a Saturday afternoon. There were no crowds at all. The park is not fully ready yet, and the star attractions in the Amazon area and the boat ride open only end of the year. Great concept to showcase habitats based on rivers of the world. The red pandas are really cool and so is the Squirrel Monkey walkthrough habitat. Unlike typical shows, the one at the River Safari was very ""touch-and-feel"" and intimate, as watchers were encouraged to touch the animals to learn about them. The setting is very nice, with the bridge over the mouth of the reservoir making a perfect spot for many pictures. Almost the entire park is open-air i.e. no aircon, but sheltered. Makes for a very natural experience. Lack of creatures in some exhibits and the Amazon section still to open, are the drawbacks of visitng before end of the year."
,,Nice to finally see pandas and manates in Singapore,4.0,,"It was a last min decision for me and my husband to visit the River Safari. We have no idea what to expect although we read a little about the place online before we arrived. Went straight to the ticket counter, and the lady was very nice to inform me that the river cruise attraction was not ready and instead of the regular ticket price of $35, the ticket is now at $25. Which to me was fine when things are mentioned upfront.

The place was huge. Very well organized. Although we had a map on hand we didn’t really refer to it as we just followed whichever the path took us. The place was is amazing! The panda enclosure was very nice. We only got to see Kai Kai as I did not expect to see Jia Jia anyway as it was mentioned on their website that Jia Jia is rather shy and like to stay indoors. We saw her inside sleeping through the CCTV that they had place outside, to me which was a very nice gesture.

I was more amaze when I entered the Manatees ""zone"". It was phenomenal! There were so many of them and it was my first time to see them in real life. I was totally mesmerized by the entire peace and calmness. We sat there for like 30mins just watching them. It was really cool."
,,A bit of a disappointment!!,3.0,,"We were looking forward to visiting the River Safari after all the hype that was created around it, but were quite disappointed after the visit.

Most of the rivers have only been given a space of 5 meters with 2-3 aquariums in them which barely gives a feel of things. On top of that at least a third of the displays / aquariums were empty (with coming soon signs).

The only major attraction is the Panda enclosure, which in my opinion has no link with the rest of the river safari and instead should have been in the zoo next door. The enclosure seems to have just been put there as a way to generate revenue for the river safari.

There were a few positives though. The Manatee area is really nice and has a calm and zen feel to it. The area with the bridge connecting the two sides of the park looking over the reservoir is nice. And of course the Panda enclosure was lovely, especially the red pandas."
,,We need the river cruise!,2.0,,"This is river safari and they offer river cruise. But the river cruise was not operated! What a ripp off! I told the staff that they have to infrom it at the ticket outlet. They just asked for apologize without giving any compensations.
All I experienced was only saw fishes in the aquarium. What a waste. But thanks god, they have Panda."
,,Some new animals!!,4.0,,"Good to see some new animals, if you have already been dozen of times at the zoo, bird park, etc. It is still not fully open yet, but most of the animals are already in place to be admired. Some of the fish I have never seen before, and very nicely done, presenting the major rivers of the world. The Pandas...presented as usual in the cuddly way, with cute little pictograms and branding of the whole exhibit. One could really start a debate. These are BEARS, and the way they are being pampered, they just degenerate, fat and lazy. There is simply no way one of these animals is ever going to be released anywhere. Would not survive. Pure tourist attraction, to, BTW, extract quite a high entry price. Still, also the birds, the monkeys are really well done. The aquarium with the Manatees towards the end is truly impressive. A nice addition to the Zoo complex."
,,Not fully functional yet,3.0,,"The park is still under development till end of 2013 .Yet you can still appreciate the beauty of the lake and nature surrounding it and watch the birds fly above in the peaceful surrounding.Main attractions will be the 2 panda's ,fishes ,squirrel monkeys,red panda and crocodiles .Explanation regarding the worlds rivers are good and educational and each of it has an conservation message .Great for kids to learn .Will be good to pay a visit next year to see the full potential of the river safari ."
,,River Safari - Total Rip Off,2.0,,"Just went there yesterday. I would say River Safari is really quite a rip off, for $25 per adult and something which you can essentially complete in 2hrs! This is a far cry from its neighbour, the Singapore Zoo which I will talk a bit later on.

River Safari is segmented into different zones, eg Ganges River, Amazon, Mekong River, et etc. In ea ch zone, you can expect to see different river creatures. A couple of zones have got those big tanks for the bigger creatures such as the manatees. Don't expect each zone to be big. If you are not on time for the feeding times, and you are on your own, essentially you can finish one river zone in about 15mins.

What I find odd is that the name River Safari gives one the impression that it is about river life and creatures right? But I'm very baffled by the presence of other animals such as the overrated pandas (jia jia and kai kai), plus the many other exhibits which are yet to be unveiled such as the howler monkey, jaguar, macaw etc. Even the show itself reflects this strong lack of theme. It is merely a showcase of hornbills, binturong, and some others which do not live in or near rivers. In addition to that, the show area has ONLY got 2 benches available for seating with each bench seating at most 6 adults. So go there very early to get a seat otherwise be prepared to sit on the floor.

About 40% of the exhibits are not there yet but even if they are, it is really not a large and interesting place to visit. And I say it's a rip off because this admission charge of $25 per adult is even more expensive than a Zoo ticket!

I'm a Singaporean and thus have been to the Zoo numerous times with my kids because it's a large place with hoardes more exhibits than the River Safari. It has a variety of animals to see thus making it interesting. I've also been to quite a number of other zoos but nothing comes quite as close to the Singapore Zoo in terms of the natural rustic enclosures which the architects have so cleverly done up. They do not look anything like a cage! They use the animals' natural fears to demarcate its boundaries.

My take is if you've got a day, visit the Zoo and the Night Safari and give River Safari and Jurong Bird Park a miss. These attractions just scream BORING. If the River Safari can bring in more river related creatures and STAY TRUE to its theme, I may consider going back there but in the meantime, don't bother. Besides, the pandas aren't very interesting.

I'm just very very glad that I got free tickets to the River Safari otherwise I would have been a very grumpy person at the end of yesterday!"
,,Potential but Amazon section not yet open,4.0,,"We are Friends of the Zoo and bring our kids there regularly. We've been waiting for the River Safari to open sine we saw all the construction going on, and decided to go one Saturday.

I agree with the previous contributor who said that it has potential but will likely realize it in a year or so, especially when the Amazon section opens, which includes a boat ride around that section. So prices are going at a discounted $25 instead if what they say is the normal price of $35.

I decided to sign up for the Friends of River Safari, as it was also discounted (at $210) and would still be valid when the Amazon section opens.

I guess the main stars would be Jia Jia and Kai Kai, giant pandas from China. Not sure how they fit into the river theme though. The pandas are housed in a special enclosure which is air conditioned, so that made it nice to get out of the heat. Jia Jia is the shy one, who stayed in the 'house' throughout the 20mins I was there. I guess the zoo knows, so they installed a CCTV for visitors to see her sleeping in her house. Kai Kai was outside eating his bamboo shoots. The website says you need to book a viewing times lot, but that Sat they were trying out a new system whereby you didn't need to book. I think this is better as you don't have to rush.

The exhibits near the entrance houses a very large aquarium, and has a colony of manatees which I really liked. The viewing panel must be at least 2 storey high and you'd could clearly see the manatee feeding. I also saw 2 seals (or were they sea lions) frolicking in the water and playing with some kind of floating ball.

There was the mandatory animal show, but my compliant is that there are no chairs, no crowd control and more importantly, is held in the open which was so so hot. Luckily we got there early at 330pm (show starts at 4pm) and managed to sit on the lone bench (which could sit maybe 3 families?). Has some birds flying back and forth, and some animals coming out (porcupine, dingo, stock, etc). At the end of the show, we queued to take a picture with the stocks, and were allowed to pet the porcupine.

The whole design is very green, with shaded walkways. I believe you should be able to cover the current exhibits in 2-3 hrs (compared to at least 1/2 day if not longer for the Zoo)."
,,Main Attraction is Kai Kai and Jia Jia !,3.0,,"The river boat will only be ready in later part of the year 2013. If you go to the park now, you will only see 1/2 the park which is sheltered under shade or in aircon.

It is not a big park. Without the river ride, we were done in less than 2 hrs, taking our own sweet time. There are quite a few tanks but not much of a sight. Maybe a few fish in a tank, 3 snakes in a tank, a frog in a tank etc. The sting ray pool is a failure. Cant see much. Sentosa Underwater does a better job on their Sting Ray pool.

The main attraction is The Panda Kai Kai and Jia Jia. Cool enclosure and we get to be up close with the panda. Kai Kai was quite reserved and quiet when we were there. But Jia Jia put up quite a show. She was very active and was happily slidding down muddy slopes for more than 10min.

The next honorable mention is the Manatees Tank. It was enchanting and has a mermaid underwater look.

There is a small food court in the park and along the way, there are small kiosks for drinks and chips.

When River boat is ready, the park definitely will be more crowded."
,,"Already wonderful, going to be even better when fully completed!",4.0,,"The River Safari is the newest addition to the family, the others being the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park. In my opinion, the River Safari has the potential to be the best attraction of the 4 when it becomes fully operational by end of 2013; currently there is no Amazon River boat ride and I think only about 60% of the planned wildlife. According to their info, when completed the 8 river region displays should have about 5000 animals from 300 species, including one of the world's largest collection of freshwater creatures (most aquariums concentrate on saltwater displays).

The major attraction is certainly the pair of Giant Pandas, Kai Kai & Jia Jia, on loan from China. But currently the female panda Jia Jia is being shy or moody and doesn't come out from her den. Which leaves Kai Kai to soak up all the adoration from ecstatic kids & females of all ages swooning over his cute looks. He on the other hand is only intent on filling his belly! The pandas are in their own climate-controlled, delightfully cool ""Giant Panda Forest"" together with Red Pandas (can be seen at really close distance compared to other zoos) and Golden Pheasants.

As for the water creatures, freshwater aquarists can only dream about owning such huge aquariums that could house enormous fish like araipama, Mississippi paddlefish, alligator gar, Chinese sturgeon, Mekong giant catfish etc. The 2 largest aquariums for the Mekong and Amazon Flooded Forest really takes your breath away, especially the latter which includes the manatees. One can easily lose time sitting at the Amazon Flooded Forest area, spellbound in watching the slow but oddly graceful ""sea cows"" and end up feeling very relaxed while listening to the soothing background music.

A few creatures like the Chinese giant salamander, American beaver, electric eel and jaguarundi wildcat were either not very responsive or snoozing away at that time. Some others were very ""public-friendly"" by swimming very close or remaining in one spot long enough for good photos: ducks in Mississippi area, Yangtze alligator, piranhas, squirrel monkeys and of course Kai Kai the panda when sitting on his fat bum! Many of the fishes swim pretty fast so you need correct camera settings to avoid blurred still shots or just shoot videos. My favourites are the Mekong display, red pandas, free-range Squirrel Monkey Forest, giant river otters and Amazon Flooded Forest.

When one goes to a zoo or other wildlife park, I think you should slow down, take your time to observe the animals and relish the opportunity to be relatively close to creatures that you would only read about, see on TV or have to trek out to the wild to see. There is no point in rushing things or be only interested in capturing photos and videos in a few seconds then rushing off like the wind to the next attraction. Initially I also thought the River Safari would be only worth 1-2 hours and had considered visiting the zoo next door later. At the end of my visit, to my surprise I had unknowingly spent more than 4 hours including lunch at the Mama Panda Kitchen restaurant. If a work-in-progress place already has so much captivating appeal, can't imagine when it is finally fully operational. In my opinion it is already fully worth the currently discounted $25 adult fee. And I would certainly visit again, especially when more creatures and the Amazon boat ride become available. River Safari, possibly the jewel in the crown for Wildlife Reserves Singapore?"
,,Lots of Potential but give it a year,3.0,,"I am generally a big fan of singapore zoos. I think they did a magnificent job with the zoo and night safari. So when the latest addition - the River Safari - has its soft opening a few weeks back, I couldn't wait to check it out.
The River Safari is a showcase of animals, fishes and birds that inhabitat in or around the great rivers of the world. So you get the Amazon, Nile, Mekong, Mississippi, Ganges, Yangtze etc. It is an interesting and novel concept. It is kind of like a zoo, bird park and acquarium rolled into one. Oh yes, for some reason it also houses the Giant Pandas from China although I doubt they lived anyway near the great rivers. But that is doubtless the star attraction.
The setting is nice as to be expected. Concept is good. And so was the way the animals were display. Aside from the Giant Pandas, I particularly like the Indian Gharial tanks and the Manatees aquarium which is the largest freshwater acquarium in the world.
So why did I give it only 3 stars. Well the park is only 50-60% opened. I was told it will only be fully operational in a year's time. As such - many of the animals cannot be seen and zones not accesible yet. You only need 2 hours to see everything. The S$25 entrance fee seems steep when one consider it is only S$22 to visit the much larger Singapore Zoological Park (right adjacent to it) - which you would need at least 4 hours to complete. Do get me wrong, for what they have, it is quite attractive - but you just have to manage your expectation for what they do not have yet.
I would probably go again in a year to see it in its full glory and hopefully by then it should deserve a 4 if not 5 stars. In the meantime, for those unlikely to be in Singapore then - a visit to this safari is interesting, but if pressed for time - go to the main zoo or the night safari instead where you get better value. Unless....you must see your Panda before your leave."
